Let me introduce you to someone here.

and the boss of First and Balloon.

145

I’m Min Joon's friend.

146

We are friends.

147

- That’s enough.
- We are friends.

148
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:33,406
That’s enough. Keep your mouth shut.

149
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,167
Shut it.

150
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,333
Nott, these aunties were harassing me.

151
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:38,792
Who were harassing you?

152
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:40,940
That would be enough.

153
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,817
Apologize to them.

154
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:45,744
Why should I?

155
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:46,769
Novice.

156
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:49,496
You should apologize
when you did wrong.

157
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,167
Apologize to them.

158

Come on.

159
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:54,414
I’m sorry.

160

This is novice Namnua.

161

His parents got divorce

162
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,382
and his dad moved
to work in the city.

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,792
He is left to be ordained here.

164
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,833
I assigned him to take care of Aod.

165
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,075
How about other novices?

166

They left the monastery
to continue their education.

This is an ill person?

171

How? You don’t seem ill at all.

00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:40,917
Yes, Aod is ill.

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,500
Aod is ill. Aod is ill.

176
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,423
- Aod. This is serious.
- I think it’s serious.

177
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,458
This is serious.

178
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,500
You're a serious issue. Damn. Go.

179
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,666
Since I found this anklet,

180
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,570
I’ve had bad dreams.

181
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,000
And these scales…

182
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,125
started growing on my chest…

183
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:03,792
until last month…

184
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07,708
It’s painful.

185
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:11,347
Hot, and it burns

186
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,917
so that I have a fever

187
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,208
and always feel ill.

188
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,583
No!

189
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:19,917
Don’t touch.

190
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,503
I’m just curious.

191
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,875
Will it be over
if you just throw it away?

192
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,250
Or leave it at where it was found.

193
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,958
Bury it, so this could end.

194
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,375
Why would Aod keep it
if it was that easy?

195
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400

Luanglung.

200
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,458
What do you know about the anklet?

201
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,875
Giving anklets to Nak before ordination

202
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,125
is the temple's tradition

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,333

00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,833

for hundreds of years.

205

Everyone, look closely.

206
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,917
What does it say?

207
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,583
I can't read it.

208
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,083
Looks like ancient texts.

- Pampam.
- Yes?

210
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,875
Can you enlarge the image
and show it to Luanglung?

211
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:42,792
Let me see.

212

You are “the oldest” here.

Can you read it?

214
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,625
I’m not that old
to know these scriptures.

215
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:57,250
I can’t read it.

216
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,708
Alright.

217
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,667
You stay together tonight.

218
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,125
I’m going.

219
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,417
Please, sir.

220
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:08,598

It can’t be read.

I think the rest of the scripts

228
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,784
might give us a hint.

You might see the rest on the back.

Can you?

233
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:16,898
There’s nothing.

234
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,042
If can’t see from this one,
let’s look at the other.

There is only one.

I agree with novice Namnua.

237
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,792
If it’s Nak's anklet,

238
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,250
there must be a pair.

239
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:31,917
The scripts might be
perfect on the other one.

240
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:43,958
Why is there only one then?

241
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:46,792
Aod, why is there only one?

242
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:48,375
It's just that.

243

244
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,750
but didn’t find anything.

245
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,333
Kiddee called me yesterday.

246
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:57,792
Said one of his relatives
went to an ordination

247
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,231
at a temple by Mekong.

248
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,667
At that temple,

249
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,308
their Nak also wears
anklets like we do here.

250
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,042
Aod and I decided to visit Kiddee in Ubon

251
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,833

No, you can't.

254

It’s so dangerous

255
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,542
and too risky.

256
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,958
What if someone took
a footage of you again?

257

00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,583
Come and take it!

346
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,608
Aod.

347
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:19,116
They have nothing to do with this.

348
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,292
Aod, what are you saying?

349
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:21,862
Aod.

350
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,434
You want this?

351
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,958
Aod, what are you saying?

352
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,792
Why would you risk yourself with him?

353
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,663
You are not a part of this.

354
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,500
I took the anklet. It’s my responsibility.

355
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:39,375
You let them go

356
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,875
and come take it from me.

357
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,500
The four of you…

358
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,542
you have stolen

359
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,458
my precious.

360
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,417
I’ll kill you.

361
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:58,917
Namnua.

362
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,625
Novice, what are you doing?

363
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,250
Novice, why did you get in?

364
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,542
Your heart is full of grudge.

365
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,625
Don’t come closer.

366
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,500
Novice, come back.

367
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,708
It pulled me.

368
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:11,792
First.

369
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,167
Everyone, it is open.

370
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,833
What are you waiting for? Go!

371
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,250
Novice, let’s get out.

372
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,333
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go, Aod.

373
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,417
Aod. Go.

374
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:23,792
Pampam. Go.

375
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:25,833
I can’t feel my legs.

376
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:27,417
Pampam. Hurry up.

377
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,500
My anklet!

378
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:03,833
Novice.

379
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,208
Wake up, Namnua.

380
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:07,682
Wake up.

381
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:09,682
Go and wake up everyone.

382
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:12,312
Wake up. It’s morning.

383
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:13,618
First.

384
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:14,350
Balloon.

385
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,375
No.

386
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:16,792
Balloon.

387
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,833
Balloon.

388
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Shit!

389
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:22,596
In the chapel, really?

390
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:27,083
You were all over me
last night, First.

391
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Are you sure?

392
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,799
I’m having a period.

393
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,167
Aod, let me ask.

394
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:36,225
Is this Nak ghost haunting every night?

395
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,000
I can’t do this every night.

396
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,083
No, it is the first time

397
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:42,042
since Aod found that gold anklet.

398
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:44,112
This is the first time I saw him.

399
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,875
It’s the same ghost I saw in my dream.

400
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,792
And he mentioned all four of us.

401
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,333
Four of us?

402
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,250
Which four?

403
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,208
Is it me?

404
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,314
Is it me?

405
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,630
You are just a kitten.

406
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:05,792
Or is it me?

407
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:07,833
But I’m Korean.

408
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:09,708
You never know.

409
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,375
Where are you going?

410
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,875
I'm not involved.

411
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,101
It’s my first time visiting this place.

412
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,042
"First time visiting this place."

413
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,958
That’s what we thought.

414
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,542
And then?

415
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,358
Let me tell you this,

416
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,333
we are all here

417
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:26,500
because in the past…

418
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,167
we might have met before.

419
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:31,583
We might have done something together.

420
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,217
I’m talking from my experience.

421
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:36,534
Oh, there you are.

422
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,643
Luanglung and I looked
for you guys everywhere.

423
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:39,667
Luanglung.

424
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,083
Why do you look worn-out?

425
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,183
A ghost, Luanglung.

426
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,167
There is a new ghost.

427
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:53,808
And a dead Korean…

428
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,211
does it have anything
to do with this?

429
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:04,667
Are you still awake?

430
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,930
Bitch!

431
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:06,955
Crystal clear.

432
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:09,333
Still alive.

433
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:11,024
And the dead Korean you mentioned…

434
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,583
who is it?

435
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
It’s all done.

436
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,083
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

437
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,708
Is it Shon's body?

438
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,708
Can you call the office
to inform about the body

439
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,417
and the police as well.

440
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,042
If this news gets out,

441
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,500
it will be a big mess.

442
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,375
Hurry up, so we can go with Aod.

443
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:00,551
You still want to go with Aod?

444
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:03,250
That ghost has just killed Shon.

445
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:05,583
That’s right.

446
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:07,583
That ghost is evil.

447
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,875
He’d kill just anybody.

448
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,333
I’m scared, Min Joon.

449
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,042
This is the reason why

450
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:20,708
I think it’s best we stick together

451
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:22,792
so we can help each other.

452
00:26:25,098 --> 00:26:26,098
Give me that, Aod.

453
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,375
Here, one more.

454
00:26:33,414 --> 00:26:34,914
I really think it’s dangerous.

455
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,375
If Nak is looking for the anklet,

456
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:40,068
I should just go with novice Nott.

457
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,875
It’s dangerous everywhere.

458
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,715
Everybody might have
something connected to Nak.

459
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,292
We go together to support each other.

460
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
Alright, everybody?

461
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:51,685
Yes.

462
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:55,375
When you said everybody…

463
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,667
can you leave me out of that?

464
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,875
So hurry to be excluded.

465
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,958
You were the first that wanted to come

466
00:27:01,983 --> 00:27:03,000
and now you want to leave.

467
00:27:03,141 --> 00:27:04,933
Be careful of being alone,

468
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,458
the ghost will snap your neck.

469
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,333
We still don’t know

470
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,458
about when he said about the four of us,

471
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,072
which ones of us are those four.

472
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:17,208
Just come along, so you can be safe.

473
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:20,174
Come down and film your stupid Oppa video.

474
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,375
Come on.

475
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,417
Let’s go.

476
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,000
Please come down, novice.

477
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:33,917
Novice!

478
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I know!

479
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Move.

480
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,570
Novice.

481
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,083
Come down.

482
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,792
No, I’ll come along.

483
00:27:43,952 --> 00:27:44,952
Novice.

484
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,918
- Come down.
- Why not, Aod?

485
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,292
It’ll be just a few days.

486
00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:51,476
That’s right.

487
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,958
It’s dangerous and you know it.

488
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:56,083
Come on, novice.

489
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,292
Wait.

490
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:02,708
Only you come down.
The Buddha statue…

491
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,281
stays there.

492
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:14,375
Novice. Novice.

493
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,417
They are taking my photos.

494
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,625
Yeah. Yeah. Good morning.

495
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:32,208
I knew it.

496
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:33,417
Pampam.

497
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,643
You posted about Min Joon
on social media, didn’t you?

498
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,059
That’s why everyone is staring at us.

499
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,167
Are you crazy? I’ve been driving all day.

500
00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:40,192
Hold on.

501
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,167
I don’t think they are Min Joon’s fans.

502
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:44,208
Is it me?

503
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:45,542
I agree.

504
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,000
You and me? You and me?

505
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,851
They are pointing at something on the roof.

506
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:50,958
On the roof?

507
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:54,958
Shit!

508
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:55,917
What?

509
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,125
Are you possessed again?

510
00:28:57,776 --> 00:28:58,776
A leg.

511
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,333
Where?

512
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,417
- That's novice.
- Careful. Careful.

513
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:08,000
Novice.

514
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,125
- Oh my god.
- Novice.

515
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,333
How did you get here?

516
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,750
- Get up.
- Careful. Are you hurt?

517
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:15,500
Novice.

518
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:16,583
Get up.

519
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:17,792
My van. My van.

520
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,083
Novice. Get down.

521
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:20,292
Get down, please.

522
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,375
Please get down.

523
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:23,167
I’m sorry.

524
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,875
Let me hang on this, alright?

525
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:27,875
- Novice.
- Novice, get down.

526
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,625
Get him.

527
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,750
Go get him.

528
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,287
It’s crowded here. Get down.

529
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:33,208
- No!
- Get down.

530
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:33,958
No!

531
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:34,875
- Get him.
- No!

532
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:35,958
- No!

533
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,958
It’s crowded. Come down.

534
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:38,792
- Come down!
- No!

535
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:39,542
No to you as well

536
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,500
Namnua.

537
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:41,500
Go away!

538
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,518
- Pampam. Hurry.
- Everybody.

539
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:46,250
Pampam. People are crowding us.

540
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,958
Just take Namnua with us.

541
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,975
At Kiddee’s house, we
can take him off our hands.

542
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,125
- Okay.
- Yay!

543
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,370
Thank you, Min Joon.

544
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,417
Be patient.

545
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,417
When we arrive Wat Nak Nimitr,

546
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:11,341
Luang por can revoke the curse.

547
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:16,958
Who stole what’s mine.

548
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,708
I’ll kill you.

549
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,708
Klae, wait for me.

550
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,042
Aod

551
00:30:27,417 --> 00:30:28,417
What’s wrong?

552
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:32,792
Startled.

553
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,375
I had a bad dream.

554
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,250
I think you ate too much.

555
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:42,625
Aod’s dreams are never good.

556
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,000
Hello, Kiddee. What’s up?

557
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,542
Novice Nott, come on.

558
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,250
Why do we have to come to this cemetery?

559
00:31:07,297 --> 00:31:08,683
It’s spooky.

560
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,450
Kiddee’s uncle died.

561
00:31:10,475 --> 00:31:11,850
So we have to meet him there.

562
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,058
Kiddee’s uncle died?

563
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,083
What's on earth is happening?

564
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,333
Under the seat, bitch.

565
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:37,833
I can’t find it.

566
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:39,000
What do you usually ride?

567
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:47,667
My vagina is rocked.

568
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,750
Just a moment. Let me call Kiddee.

569
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,875
That kid?

570
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
Look.

571
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:57,583
It's fucking abandoned.

572
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:01,625
No…

573
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:23,917
Hello everyone.

574
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,292
Long time no see.

575
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,583
How are you, Min Joon?

576
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:29,458
I’m good.

577
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,417
And you, Aod?

578
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,500
You must be Pampam.

579
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:37,802
Hello.

580
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:39,305
Nice to meet you,

581
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,750
Novice Nott.

582
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:49,625
The both of you

583
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:51,000
just forget it!

584
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,417
Do you know what we…

585
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:56,442
were thinking?

586
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,917
Cute school boy.

587
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:02,517
I can hear your thoughts.

588
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:03,933
I’m single,

589
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:05,833
here with friends for business.

590
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,125
You guys are brave,

591
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,958
risking yourselves to help Aod.

592
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,458
But I think you underestimate the situation

593
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:16,333
coming here to fight Nak with nothing.

594
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:17,917
I think it’s risky.

595
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,000
Yeah, he is worried about us.

596
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,422
I think he likes you. Don’t blush.

597
00:33:23,703 --> 00:33:24,703
One moment.

598
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,917
Why is he bending?

599
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:31,500
Please, First, Balloon.

600
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:34,208
Aod, have a seat.

601
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,167
I think this is a really tough situation.

602
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:44,708
You guys should prepare
your bodies, minds,

603
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,000
and insurances to guarantee your success.

604
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:51,167
I love you all.

605
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,958
I want you guys to be prepared.

606
00:33:53,983 --> 00:33:55,225
But Kiddee, my friend…

607
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,708
Shut up, Balloon.

608
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:58,475
Go on.

609
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,350
This is what we were talking about,

610
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,792
making a life insurance.

611
00:34:01,817 --> 00:34:03,067
So you can be insured.

612
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,750
But I don’t have…

613
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:10,142
…a pen. You didn’t prepare it. I know.

614
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:11,250
Here you go.

615
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,125
Go on.

616
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,292
But I think it’s quite…

617
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:18,317
...quite dark?

618
00:34:20,042 --> 00:34:21,250
Is this bright enough?

619
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:28,325
But I don’t have…

620
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,475
…any cash.

621
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,750
Mobile banking.

622
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:34,656
It is satisfying.

623
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,125
Sign here.

624
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,292
It’s done, First.

625
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,375
Now I think

626
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:47,250
You don't have to be worried
about getting hurt or dying.

627
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,042
Now you can die, First.

628
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:53,417
Come here.

629
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,500
I heard that my uncle’s mother

630
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,985
put all of his belongings in the coffin

631
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,719
because he was very possessive.

632
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:03,917
I think his phone is in it.

633
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,792
Who’d go to get it?

634
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,042
Why do they howl this hour?

635
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:29,833
Mama?

636
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:32,619
Mama!

637
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,000
Everytime, these shitty lights!

638
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:36,917
You’ve been here before?

639
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:39,875
Every movie is like this.

640
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:44,362
Dogs howl, lights out.

641
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:46,917
Typical.

642
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Run!

643
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,667
First. This way.

644
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:58,545
We are the chosen ones.

645
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:02,011
Let’s go.

646
00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:03,956
Smile.

647
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:14,983
Wow!

648
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:16,792
Hey…

649
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,708
There is a mirror at the entrance.

650
00:36:19,088 --> 00:36:20,934
This is not the time.

651
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:22,526
Come on, let’s go.

652
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:28,417
Hey. Here.

653
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:29,333
What?

654
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:30,458
Jungle! Jungle!

655
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,042
Jungle my ass. Uncle!

656
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,000
Me Chinese.

657
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,808
Stop fooling around.

658
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:36,958
I’m sorry.

659
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:38,500
We mean well.

660
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:41,542
What?!

661
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,792
Your face, I’m not used to it.

662
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Bitch.

663
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,208
Quite pretty.

664
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:50,726
Just got back from Korea.

665
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:51,794
Come on.

666
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:56,417
Scary.

667
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,292
You know how to open it?

668
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,125
I’ve never been in one, have I?

669
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:21,167
Help me push.

670
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,375
It will be alright.

671
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:47,008
Put your back into it, First.

672
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:49,250
One, two…

673
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,208
First!

674
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,708
You pull and I push.

675
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:01,392
No. I push. You pull.

676
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,642
Careful. Careful.

677
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:04,464
You pull. I push.

678
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:05,739
So you push. I pull.

679
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,767
No. You pull. I push.

680
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:09,042
Bitch!

681
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:10,130
Listen to me.

682
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,230
I pull and you push.

683
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,177
One, two, three!

684
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:23,292
Do we get it?

685
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:24,100
Do we?

686
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:27,042
Who are you? What are you doing here?

687
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:40,348
We have to wait for the guests to leave

688
00:38:40,388 --> 00:38:44,122
then we can cry
with the body in private.

689
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,058
It hurts. Damn hurt.

690
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,708
I see. You seem very upset.

691
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,066
Don’t cry.

692
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,638
That’s right, uncle.

693
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:58,583
Listen to me.

694
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,154
Great grandma and great granduncle

695
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:04,875
they never loved us.

696
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:08,375
First aunty also had that bitch.

697
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,875
That bitch.

698
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:11,833
She can’t take it

699
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,167
that we are queers.

700
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,896
And you know what?

701
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,542
Do you know?

702
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,708
That third aunty

703
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:24,750
never supported us
with money or tuition fees.

704
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:26,958
And what about that bastard?

705
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:28,375
Big brother.

706
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,490
Big brother.

707
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,208
Uncle!

708
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,850
So that means…

709
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:38,199
you must be Gim’s children?

710
00:39:38,224 --> 00:39:39,917
Yes.

711
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:42,000
It’s okay. Don’t be sad.

712
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,708
You can get changed
into the mourning attire.

713
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,833
Alright, here.

714
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:56,464
The ritual is done. Are
you heading off now?

715
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,958
Can I stay with my dad for…

716
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,500
the last time, uncle?

717
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:07,583
I want to have the last moment with…

718
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:09,875
my dad, jungle.

719
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:14,125
Enough. Enough. Enough.

720
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:16,792
Take your time. I’ll be right back.

721
00:40:17,288 --> 00:40:18,642
So annoying.

722
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,250
Uncle!

723
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:23,817
Jungle!

724
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,125
Did you find the cell phone?

725
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:45,917
Did you?

726
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,167
He liked singing, damn.

727
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,375
Pager? To call your fucking dad?

728
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:01,000
Dead people can’t take anything.

729
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:04,225
Got it. Got it.

730
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,042
I got it, First.

731
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,208
Turn it on.

732
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:08,000
I can’t.

733
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:09,667
Scan.

734
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,208
Scan it now.

735
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,017
The newest model needs retina.

736
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:21,933
Open his eyes. Open them.

737
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,042
Then, you hold it!

738
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:27,406
Retina.

739
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:29,802
Pull him up.

740
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:38,750
Oh shit.

741
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,333
First.

742
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,667
First. Hurry.

743
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,833
Hurry. Hurry.

744
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:45,833
Take it. Take it.

745
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:48,167
Hurry. Help me pull him up.

746
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,583
Dad. I’m sorry.

747
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,417
Make sure they are open.

748
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:55,958
Got it?

749
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:57,333
Got it? Not too close. Damn it.

750
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:58,875
Not too close.

751
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,900
Are they aligned?

752
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:02,708
- Ready?
- Go!

753
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:05,042
One. Two. Three!

754
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,517
Enough! Close them! Close them!

755
00:42:12,542 --> 00:42:13,683
Close them already!

756
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:14,583
Don’t turn around.

757
00:42:14,608 --> 00:42:15,858
What’s going on?

758
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:18,125
What are you doing?

759
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:20,042
Let’s go.

760
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,417
Hurry, First, hurry!

761
00:42:21,632 --> 00:42:23,132
Come. Hurry.

762
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,333
- What the hell were you lunatics doing?
- hurry.

763
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:30,173
Bring it back.

764
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:31,917
Damn these bitches.

765
00:42:41,197 --> 00:42:42,334
Kiddee, here.

766
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,417
Alright, First.

767
00:42:45,512 --> 00:42:46,846
Why do you dress like that?

768
00:42:46,953 --> 00:42:48,120
To mourn your death.

769
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,375
Just drive. Stop asking.

770
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,292
Do we get the temple name? What is it?

771
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:56,625
Wait a second.

772
00:42:58,458 --> 00:42:59,542
The temple name, everybody…

773
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:00,458
What’s the temple name?

774
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:02,500
Wat Nak Khum.

775
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,042
Where is it?

776
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:05,192
Just a minute, Min Joon.

777
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:07,792
No, Kiddee. You have to find the location.

778
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:09,167
Okay.

779
00:43:10,693 --> 00:43:11,558
Hurry up.

780
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:14,053
It's the fastest I can go.

781
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,808
Is that the fastest you can go, Pampam?

782
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,058
- It is.
- Guys.

783
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:21,083
I got the location.

784
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:23,058
I’ll lead you the way.

785
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,500
Okay, let’s go.

786
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,250
Look. Here, Pampam.

787
00:43:27,902 --> 00:43:29,308
Where are we going?

788
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,208
I’m looking at it.

789
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:33,052
- Stay away from it, Nott.
- What is it, Aod?

790
00:43:33,417 --> 00:43:34,083
What?

791
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,500
What? Why?

792
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:40,667
What’s that noise?

793
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,750
What’s on the roof?

794
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:43,292
Don’t know. What is it?

795
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:44,847
- A rock?
- What is it?

796
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:49,886
Pampam. Careful!

797
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:51,792
Balloon!

798
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,583
Pampam. Careful!

799
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,583
Careful! Careful!

800
00:43:57,833 --> 00:43:59,167
Easy! Easy!

801
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:04,458
Pampam! Pampam!

802
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:09,542
Pampam.

803
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:12,750
- Aod, are you alright?
- My nose.

804
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,250
My nose is gonna be dislocated.

805
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,267
How are you?

806
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:19,292
Is everybody okay?

807
00:44:19,344 --> 00:44:20,344
Okay.

808
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:31,917
Guys.

809
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:33,333
There’s a main road.

810
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:34,792
Let’s go that way.

811
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:36,000
Help me. Help me.

812
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,333
Anybody. Help me.

813
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:39,208
Anybody. Help me. Anybody.

814
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:40,896
Calm down. Watch out for cars.

815
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,333
What?

816
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:52,933
Snake!

817
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:53,808
Snake!

818
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:54,833
Snake!

819
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Snake!

820
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Novice.

821
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:12,375
Can I have something to keep me secure?

822
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:15,421
Here.

823
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:19,083
A flashlight…

824
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,500
Why do you bring that?

825
00:45:20,525 --> 00:45:21,525
Son.

826
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,458
Come to mama.

827
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:28,125
Who stole what’s mine

828
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:28,917
Aod.

829
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,083
Aod! Aod!

830
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,333
My anklet.

831
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:34,773
- Aod
- Aod

832
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:37,125
- Aod
- Aod

833
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,625
must die!

834
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:39,708
Aod, are you alright?

835
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,042
- Aod
- Aod

836
00:45:41,067 --> 00:45:42,731
- Aod
- Aod

837
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,226
Leave me alone.

838
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:46,417
Aod!

839
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:50,391
Aod.

840
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,208
Calm down, Aod.

841
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,742
Aod. Aod.

842
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:11,375
Aod.

843
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:13,292
Help!

844
00:46:18,836 --> 00:46:21,911
Aod.

845
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:24,101
Aod, where are you?

846
00:46:24,746 --> 00:46:26,642
Everybody, this way. This way.

847
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:27,292
Aod

848
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,375
Aod.

849
00:46:29,312 --> 00:46:30,590
Aod!

850
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,000
Aod. Aod.

851
00:46:33,434 --> 00:46:34,434
Aod.

852
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,250
Novice!

853
00:46:58,458 --> 00:46:59,583
First!

854
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,500
Balloon.

855
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:04,375
I’m here!

856
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,250
[CHANTING]

857
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:42,559
Is this the right direction?

858
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:44,695
I think it is.

859
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:46,667
Aod, where are you?

860
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:47,750
Mama. Hurry up.

861
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:49,292
Aod!

862
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:50,292
Kiddee, wait.

863
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:51,375
Mama. Quick.

864
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,667
Straight ahead, First, Balloon.

865
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,167
Help.

866
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,875
Wait.

867
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:04,167
Let me go.

868
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:21,141
Let me go.

869
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:52,687
They all left you.

870
00:49:01,632 --> 00:49:03,101
Let me go.

871
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,218
Luang Por!

872
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:25,417
Aod!

873
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:28,208
Aod!

874
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:29,167
- Aod!
- Wait up.

875
00:49:29,192 --> 00:49:30,192
Aod!

876
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,958
This is so strange.

877
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:35,458
What happened to him?

878
00:49:35,778 --> 00:49:37,146
Why is he shaking?

879
00:49:40,183 --> 00:49:40,850
Aod!

880
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:41,875
Aod. I’m tired.

881
00:49:45,756 --> 00:49:46,725
Kiddee.

882
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,375
Are you alright?

883
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,537
Damn you.

884
00:49:52,042 --> 00:49:53,583
Watch where you are going.

885
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:54,833
I’m sorry.

886
00:49:57,205 --> 00:49:59,892
This is my flashlight,
First. I remember it.

887
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:01,875
It’s mine. I’ve been holding it.

888
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,857
There. Yours is over there.

889
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:09,333
You are the youngest. Go get it.

890
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:10,441
I’m watching our backs.

891
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:11,917
It is calling for you.

892
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,583
Don’t you love me so much? Bitch.

893
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,625
Do you see what I see, B1?

894
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,875
I don’t, B2.

895
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:54,387
Aod.

896
00:50:57,793 --> 00:50:59,017
Aod.

897
00:50:59,042 --> 00:50:59,750
Aod.

898
00:50:59,775 --> 00:51:01,000
What’s happening?

899
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,125
Aod.

900
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:04,583
Aod.

901
00:51:12,545 --> 00:51:14,250
What the hell is going on?

902
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,075
First.

903
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:24,708
Kiddee.

904
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:26,558
Hold on tight.

905
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,125
Don’t let anyone take me.

906
00:51:32,667 --> 00:51:33,708
Hold on.

907
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:35,704
Yes, Balloon.

908
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,767
There’s nothing out there, First.

909
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:04,333
You stay out of this.

910
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:09,833
Aod.

911
00:52:11,332 --> 00:52:13,041
Don’t let him possess you.

912
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,125
You’ll end up leaving me.

913
00:52:15,737 --> 00:52:17,112
Nobody is gonna leave you.

914
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,417
I, for one.

915
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:21,525
You are accepted in the university.

916
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,250
You’ll leave him.

917
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:24,958
Even though everyone leaves you,

918
00:52:24,983 --> 00:52:26,441
but I won’t.

919
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:27,583
Novice! Novice!

920
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:29,458
Aod! Aod!

921
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:31,542
Aod, get yourself together.

922
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:32,625
That’s Namnua.

923
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:50,542
Namnua!

924
00:52:51,452 --> 00:52:52,452
Namnua!

925
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:53,792
Let go.

926
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:59,042
Why are you fighting with him?

927
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:00,567
I have to take the anklet from him.

928
00:53:00,629 --> 00:53:02,004
Or I have to put him out.

929
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,661
Pampam, help.

930
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:05,958
Aod!

931
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:16,958
Novice!

932
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:20,583
Novice! Novice!

933
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:21,667
Catch!

934
00:53:29,784 --> 00:53:32,218
Pampam, help novice Nott.

935
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,892
- You stay here.
- It hurts.

936
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:37,917
Just a moment.

937
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:40,453
Do something.

938
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:44,906
- Easy, novice. Easy.
- It hurts.

939
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:43,375
Your hip too?

940
00:54:45,995 --> 00:54:46,995
First. Balloon.

941
00:54:47,296 --> 00:54:48,296
Where is Pampam?

942
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:50,667
In the building.

943
00:54:58,012 --> 00:54:59,012
What?

944
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:00,708
Where is my anklet?

945
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:02,042
It’s not here.

946
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:03,250
Aod, what’s the matter?

947
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:05,267
I saw that you took it.

948
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:06,532
- I said I don’t have it.
- Aod.

949
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,500
- Aod.
- It has to be here.

950
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:11,500
Aod. The anklet is here.

951
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:14,792
I have it wrapped up.
Nobody touched it.

952
00:55:24,976 --> 00:55:26,268
I used to call you guys

953
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:28,125
trouble makers.

954
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:34,833
Right now,

955
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,500
I am the trouble maker.

956
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,750
Aod…

957
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:43,667
It’s because the ghost possessed you.

958
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,083
You are also not well,

959
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:48,917
so your mind becomes weak

960
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,887
the ghost found it was easy to possess you.

961
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:55,292
Aod.

962
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:57,625
Listen to me.

963
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,292
We all are worried for you.

964
00:56:06,368 --> 00:56:07,875
We won't leave you.

965
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,260
Aod.

966
00:56:22,057 --> 00:56:23,057
Aod.

967
00:56:23,473 --> 00:56:25,172
Don’t worry.

968
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:29,625
Novice Namnua understands.

969
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:33,708
Novice.

970
00:56:34,922 --> 00:56:36,556
Come back to your sense, Aod?

971
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,333
Do you feel better? Still hurt anywhere?

972
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:43,750
Novice.

973
00:56:44,937 --> 00:56:45,937
I’m sorry.

974
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:47,737
There’s nothing to apologize for.

975
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:49,958
I broke your arm.

976
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,125
The ghost did.

977
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,248
Just worry about yourself.

978
00:56:57,375 --> 00:56:59,083
Let’s get going.

979
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:02,340
- Don't rush.
- Take it easy.

980
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:05,167
Stay still. Does it hurt?

981
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:06,195
Novice.

982
00:57:07,328 --> 00:57:09,430
Kiddee called your mother.

983
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,625
She will be here soon.

984
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:13,667
But if I don’t go,

985
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:15,375
who will help Aod?

986
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:16,458
I’ll go with you guys.

987
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:20,292
Novice, it’s too hard for you.
Don’t push yourself.

988
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:22,125
If anything happened to you,

989
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:24,458
we’ll be heartbroken

990
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:26,583
that we didn’t stop you.

991
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33,125
I will come back to pick you up soon.

992
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,500
The sun!

993
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,125
Where is Min Joon?

994
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,625
He went to recover the van

995
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:44,370
with the old man that helped us last night.

996
00:57:48,542 --> 00:57:49,542
It’s Min Joon.

997
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:52,333
Hello, Min Joon.

998
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:54,958
Yes. Yes. Balloon…

999
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:59,125
Hello, Min Joon.

1000
00:57:59,363 --> 00:58:00,600
Your voice!

1001
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:01,542
Yes.

1002
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:04,708
Faster, faster.

1003
00:58:04,792 --> 00:58:06,417
Yeah, almost.

1004
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,119
Excellent!

1005
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:14,458
Excuse me.

1006
00:58:14,542 --> 00:58:16,292
Do we really take this vehicle?

1007
00:58:17,433 --> 00:58:18,433
Yes…

1008
00:58:18,458 --> 00:58:19,917
This is my Cyclone 100.

1009
00:58:19,942 --> 00:58:21,070
I don’t use it often.

1010
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:23,292
You guys can take it

1011
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,833
and I will find a mechanic
to fix your van.

1012
00:58:25,858 --> 00:58:27,683
Whenever you are done with your business,

1013
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:29,433
take it back to me.

1014
00:58:29,458 --> 00:58:30,767
Take it as an exchange, okay?

1015
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:31,917
Thank you, uncle.

1016
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,201
- Sure.
- Guys, let me drive!

1017
00:58:34,226 --> 00:58:36,642
Go ahead. I’ll call the mechanic.

1018
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:37,533
Good luck. Good luck.

1019
00:58:37,558 --> 00:58:38,433
Thank you.

1020
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:39,292
Good bye. Good bye.

1021
00:58:39,317 --> 00:58:40,984
Come on. Let’s go.

1022
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:42,516
Get on. Come on.

1023
00:58:42,867 --> 00:58:43,600
Everybody hop on.

1024
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:44,917
Min Joon.

1025
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:45,683
Hurry up.

1026
00:58:45,708 --> 00:58:46,708
Don’t be stubborn.

1027
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,417
You are stubborn. Hop on. Come on.

1028
00:58:48,952 --> 00:58:50,155
Come on. Let’s go.

1029
00:58:51,023 --> 00:58:51,933
Hop on.

1030
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:53,000
Why is he so hyped?

1031
00:58:53,025 --> 00:58:54,525
I’m a fast driver. Hold tight.

1032
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,300
Pampam. Come on.

1033
00:58:56,812 --> 00:58:57,812
Guys.

1034
00:58:58,495 --> 00:58:59,495
I’m not going.

1035
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:01,042
What now?

1036
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:03,625
I’m scared.

1037
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:06,500
Why would I take a risk with you guys?

1038
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:08,458
If we meet the ghost again,

1039
00:59:08,656 --> 00:59:10,239
you all will leave me.

1040
00:59:11,664 --> 00:59:14,789
Pampam, I know that you are scared

1041
00:59:14,814 --> 00:59:16,500
and don’t trust us.

1042
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:20,083
But we want you to come
because we’re worried for you.

1043
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,208
We don’t want you to end up like…

1044
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
like Shon.

1045
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:29,667
Hey.

1046
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:31,667
Come with us.

1047
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:34,792
We are already on the same boat.

1048
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:38,975
Together, we’ll survive, Mr. Oppa.

1049
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Come.

1050
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,042
Ready. Go!

1051
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:46,100
That way, Min Joon.

1052
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:46,958
Sorry.

1053
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,236
Is that okay?

1054
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:21,878
The temple is over there.

1055
01:00:30,304 --> 01:00:31,683
WAT NAK KHUM

1056
01:00:31,766 --> 01:00:32,808
Wat Nak Toom

1057
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:33,833
Hey, Nak…

1058
01:00:35,667 --> 01:00:37,500
That is Wat Nak Khum.

1059
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:39,542
The temple as in Gim’s phone.

1060
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:41,917
Thank heavens.

1061
01:00:41,942 --> 01:00:43,019
We are finally here.

1062
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,083
Luang Por…

1063
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:48,458
is there a tradition at this temple…

1064
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:50,322
Look at how he said “Luang Por”.

1065
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:51,601
Just speak with normal accent.

1066
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,583
People struggle enough without the accent.

1067
01:00:53,675 --> 01:00:55,583
Don’t bully him.

1068
01:00:56,671 --> 01:00:57,671
Luang Por.

1069
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:01,583
Is there a tradition about wearing anklets?

1070
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:03,917
We still do.

1071
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:09,000
We found a haunting anklet.

1072
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:11,600
And we are here to study the legend,

1073
01:01:11,625 --> 01:01:13,167
hoping to revoke the curse.

1074
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,000
Aod, show the anklet to Luang Por.

1075
01:01:20,539 --> 01:01:21,539
This one.

1076
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:23,695
Luang Por!

1077
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:25,750
Don’t touch it.

1078
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:27,542
It is cursed.

1079
01:01:27,587 --> 01:01:29,725
If you touch it, the scales will start…

1080
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,792
growing on your body, it burns.

1081
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:36,667
The ghost will come
after you. I’m warning you.

1082
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:41,417
So you bring it to Luang Por
to revoke the curse?

1083
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yes.

1084
01:01:43,292 --> 01:01:46,125
Luang Por, please help us.

1085
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:49,667
Prin, bring the anklet for them to see.

1086
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:51,750
Alright.

1087
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,250
Finito.

1088
01:02:13,698 --> 01:02:17,372
This anklet is similar to
the one from our temple.

1089
01:02:23,966 --> 01:02:24,966
But…

1090
01:02:25,461 --> 01:02:27,544
there are no scripts like Aod’s.

1091
01:02:31,586 --> 01:02:32,586
Wait a second.

1092
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:42,167
Can you see this photo?

1093
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:48,708
Is there any temple that has
an arched entrance like this?

1094
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:51,792
Something ancient like this,

1095
01:02:53,059 --> 01:02:54,259
is only at the deserted temple

1096
01:02:54,707 --> 01:02:57,049
called “Wat Nak Nimit”

1097
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,500
on the mountain.

1098
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:01,237
Old people said

1099
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,417
that the Naga built it.

1100
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:07,208
Now it’s just a deserted temple.

1101
01:03:07,783 --> 01:03:10,984
Don’t go there. You won’t find anyone.

1102
01:03:15,471 --> 01:03:17,267
Min Joon, pull over.

1103
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:19,208
- Min Joon.
- Stop.

1104
01:03:19,233 --> 01:03:21,346
- Stop.
- Let me find the location.

1105
01:03:22,417 --> 01:03:23,417
What did you say, Aod?

1106
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:26,625
I think this is it.

1107
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,250
What is “it”?

1108
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:30,667
Just follow me.

1109
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:33,833
Aod, you can always get me excited.

1110
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:37,189
No better place to go?

1111
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,167
Have sunscreen with you?

1112
01:03:44,373 --> 01:03:45,433
What else?

1113
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:46,458
This is it.

1114
01:03:47,964 --> 01:03:48,964
That rock field…

1115
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,700
where I saw Nak running
from something in my dream

1116
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,805
before he jumped off the cliff.

1117
01:04:13,674 --> 01:04:15,007
Be patient.

1118
01:04:15,032 --> 01:04:16,877
When we arrive Wat Nak Nimit,

1119
01:04:17,417 --> 01:04:19,167
Luang Por can undo the curse.

1120
01:04:22,499 --> 01:04:23,975
Klae, wait for me.

1121
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,292
You stole what’s mine, You must die.

1122
01:04:27,317 --> 01:04:28,979
Juk was washed up here

1123
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,917
and looked up to the mountain

1124
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,530
before he saw fire.

1125
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,250
Wait, guys.

1126
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:50,708
This mountain, Luang Por
said there is a deserted temple.

1127
01:04:51,231 --> 01:04:53,586
According to Google Map,

1128
01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:56,083
the mountain is quite high.

1129
01:04:57,542 --> 01:04:58,542
From what I see,

1130
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,792
I think it’s upside down.

1131
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:02,375
Sorry, First.

1132
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:05,625
It doesn’t seem so high now.

1133
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:07,477
Quite low actually.

1134
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,070
Are you alright, Aod?

1135
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:11,333
I think in the past, your anklet…

1136
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:13,250
might be around here.

1137
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:15,083
Since we are already here,

1138
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:16,958
let’s try to find it.

1139
01:05:17,671 --> 01:05:18,671
Let’s go.

1140
01:05:18,735 --> 01:05:19,875
Alright, Aod?

1141
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:21,354
Yes.

1142
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,375
Aod.

1143
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:29,917
My anklet.

1144
01:05:29,942 --> 01:05:31,025
- Aod.
- Aod.

1145
01:05:33,572 --> 01:05:34,572
What’s wrong?

1146
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:36,125
Nak hurts me.

1147
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:40,879
That means the side I’m hurt

1148
01:05:41,315 --> 01:05:42,795
is the direction where the anklet is.

1149
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:45,625
Let’s hurry and find it.

1150
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:48,583
Pampam, take Aod to rest in the shade.

1151
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,583
The rest of us split
and look for the anklet.

1152
01:05:51,608 --> 01:05:52,608
It should be quicker.

1153
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,879
The ghost chased me to
high mountain recess area.

1154
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:07,676
Let me go.

1155
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:09,208
I give up.

1156
01:06:11,207 --> 01:06:12,475
I give up.

1157
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,292
And I died there.

1158
01:06:14,543 --> 01:06:17,267
Do you remember that mountain recess?

1159
01:06:17,292 --> 01:06:18,667
How does it look like?

1160
01:06:18,862 --> 01:06:20,801
That’s too detailed.

1161
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:23,417
Just find a mountain recess with skeletons.

1162
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:25,948
Are you scared?

1163
01:06:27,604 --> 01:06:28,604
Yeah.

1164
01:06:28,629 --> 01:06:29,958
Want to hold this?

1165
01:06:29,983 --> 01:06:30,983
Np, you have an amulet.

1166
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,058
Careful.

1167
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,083
Get up, mama.

1168
01:06:45,211 --> 01:06:46,211
I’m sure.

1169
01:06:46,804 --> 01:06:47,804
I’m sure.

1170
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:48,958
I know.

1171
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:04,458
Over there!

1172
01:07:06,792 --> 01:07:08,268
Your nails are still beautiful, mama.

1173
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:09,208
Not about my nails.

1174
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:10,917
The skeletons right there.

1175
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:15,375
Dinosaur skeletons!

1176
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:16,750
We are rich, First.

1177
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:17,667
We are rich.

1178
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,750
Oh, fuck!

1179
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:21,375
They are human skeletons.

1180
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:25,958
Hurry up, Aod.

1181
01:07:26,504 --> 01:07:27,504
Hey…

1182
01:07:28,292 --> 01:07:29,292
Aod?

1183
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:30,875
Aod!

1184
01:07:31,101 --> 01:07:31,892
Are you sure?

1185
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:33,333
Look at his eyes.

1186
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:34,608
Don’t you remember?

1187
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,950
There are no eyes there.

1188
01:07:35,975 --> 01:07:39,225
And this hair style he
wore when he was younger.

1189
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,090
He literally looks like
a monk with bald head.

1190
01:07:44,164 --> 01:07:45,281
Yes.

1191
01:07:45,306 --> 01:07:47,308
See? Now you can’t argue with me.

1192
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:48,767
You saw what I saw, First.

1193
01:07:48,792 --> 01:07:49,683
I didn’t.

1194
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:51,125
I just saw this. The anklet.

1195
01:07:52,066 --> 01:07:53,100
Pick it up.

1196
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:54,833
You pick it up.

1197
01:07:54,858 --> 01:07:56,124
I can’t.

1198
01:07:56,149 --> 01:07:57,267
You are closer to it.

1199
01:07:57,292 --> 01:07:58,625
How am I gonna reach it?

1200
01:07:58,650 --> 01:07:59,533
Okay, I’m out of the way.

1201
01:07:59,558 --> 01:08:00,725
You pick it up.

1202
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,934
You saw it first. You pick it up.

1203
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:02,833
Why should I?

1204
01:08:02,858 --> 01:08:05,737
- You saw it later. You pick it…
- First.

1205
01:08:07,475 --> 01:08:08,558
I got it.

1206
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:10,625
Get out! Novice! Hurry up!

1207
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:12,917
Hurry. Shit! Let him go.

1208
01:08:12,979 --> 01:08:14,833
You stole what’s mine,

1209
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:18,083
You must die.

1210
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:19,933
Hurry up.

1211
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:21,333
Come on. Novice. Get out.

1212
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,600
You must die.

1213
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:25,542
Hurry up! novice!

1214
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:26,542
Novice!

1215
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:29,375
Let’s go. Novice, come on.

1216
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:30,750
Hurry up.

1217
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:33,667
What happened?

1218
01:08:33,808 --> 01:08:34,558
Help!

1219
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:35,250
What’s going on?

1220
01:08:35,275 --> 01:08:36,442
Help!

1221
01:08:36,467 --> 01:08:37,333
What happened?

1222
01:08:37,358 --> 01:08:39,017
Go, novice. Just leave.

1223
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:39,708
Let’s go.

1224
01:08:39,792 --> 01:08:40,792
What? What’s going on?

1225
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:42,000
Let’s go. Let’s go.

1226
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:43,917
Nak’s ghost is here. Hurry up, Aod.

1227
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1228
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:47,208
Aod, come here.

1229
01:08:56,981 --> 01:08:59,371
Is he following us? Let's go.

1230
01:09:04,128 --> 01:09:06,146
Run, bitch, run.

1231
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:23,167
Who stole what's mine

1232
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:26,792
I'll kill you.

1233
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:28,500
Aod!

1234
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:30,750
Novice. Are you alright?

1235
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,333
I’m okay. I only lost balance.

1236
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:33,792
Aod!

1237
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:34,914
Aod.

1238
01:09:34,958 --> 01:09:36,667
- Be careful.
- Are you alright?

1239
01:09:36,692 --> 01:09:37,692
I’m alright.

1240
01:09:37,843 --> 01:09:38,843
Go.

1241
01:09:39,378 --> 01:09:40,698
I think we should take some rest.

1242
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:42,762
Let’s continue.

1243
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:45,458
Before the ghost catches up.

1244
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:48,000
Don’t worry, novice.

1245
01:09:48,246 --> 01:09:50,038
We have a Buddha statue.

1246
01:09:50,063 --> 01:09:51,532
Pampam, show!

1247
01:09:51,758 --> 01:09:52,758
Here you go!

1248
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:55,417
Buddha is gone!

1249
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:57,792
Pampam!

1250
01:09:58,167 --> 01:09:59,167
Shit!

1251
01:09:59,208 --> 01:10:00,375
Where did you keep it?

1252
01:10:00,925 --> 01:10:01,741
Where has it gone?

1253
01:10:01,766 --> 01:10:03,225
Where did it go?

1254
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,753
How careless!

1255
01:10:04,948 --> 01:10:07,378
Wait, where has it gone?

1256
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:24,690
You stole what’s mine.

1257
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:27,750
You must die.

1258
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:30,292
Wait for Aod.

1259
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:31,792
Aod. Hurry up.

1260
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:32,542
Aod

1261
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:33,625
I know.

1262
01:10:38,684 --> 01:10:40,612
Wait for Aod.

1263
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,500
- Aod!
- Aod!

1264
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:44,625
Wait for me. Hurry up.

1265
01:10:46,956 --> 01:10:48,333
My anklet.

1266
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:55,583
That’s a fire, guys. The fire.

1267
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:57,250
Is that a ghost too?

1268
01:10:58,167 --> 01:10:59,583
Let’s get there first.

1269
01:10:59,608 --> 01:11:01,524
- Go.
- Go, everyone.

1270
01:11:05,292 --> 01:11:06,292
Guys.

1271
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:07,500
The fire. The fire.

1272
01:11:07,525 --> 01:11:09,000
Be careful.

1273
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:13,413
Is it this way?

1274
01:11:16,854 --> 01:11:18,303
Balloon, be careful.

1275
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,083
Pampam. Watch the fire.

1276
01:11:27,436 --> 01:11:28,392
Guys, let’s go.

1277
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:29,710
Hurry up.

1278
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:31,750
Aod, careful.

1279
01:11:37,017 --> 01:11:37,808
Aod. Are you alright?

1280
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:38,875
Yes， I’m alright.

1281
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:39,958
Aod!

1282
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:46,428
Aod. Come on. I’ll help you.

1283
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:49,292
Hold my arm.

1284
01:11:49,317 --> 01:11:50,359
Guys. This way.

1285
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:56,542
Aod, come on.

1286
01:11:58,958 --> 01:11:59,667
It’s itchy.

1287
01:11:59,692 --> 01:12:02,250
I don't want to be at the back.

1288
01:12:08,338 --> 01:12:09,588
Is that a monk?

1289
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:13,061
Better ask, is that a human?

1290
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:15,708
Are you a human?

1291
01:12:16,292 --> 01:12:17,292
I’m a monk.

1292
01:12:18,385 --> 01:12:20,718
On a pilgrimage and staying here tonight.

1293
01:12:21,512 --> 01:12:23,281
He’s really a monk, First.

1294
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:24,042
Hurry up.

1295
01:12:24,067 --> 01:12:25,017
Luang Por!

1296
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:26,975
Luang Por! Please help!

1297
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,125
Luang Por! Please help us.

1298
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:31,634
The ghost has been following us.

1299
01:12:34,367 --> 01:12:35,367
Very well.

1300
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,833
I think we should treat
that young man first.

1301
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:40,109
Aod.

1302
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:47,458
[CHANTING]

1303
01:13:18,255 --> 01:13:19,255
How are you?

1304
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:20,750
Is it better?

1305
01:13:22,244 --> 01:13:23,538
I feel better.

1306
01:13:25,071 --> 01:13:27,792
Can I have a look at your anklet?

1307
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,914
Just hand it over.

1308
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:45,458
It’s alright.

1309
01:14:02,411 --> 01:14:04,036
You know about this anklet?

1310
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:10,708
It belongs to the big
temple on the mountain.

1311
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:12,768
So, there is a temple on this mountain?

1312
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,250
Yes, there is.

1313
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:20,917
Long time ago, there was
a temple on the mountain.

1314
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:23,125
And this mountain

1315
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:26,375
has been protected by Naga.

1316
01:14:29,147 --> 01:14:32,128
He was quite mischievous

1317
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:35,375
and had hurt so many
people until villagers fled.

1318
01:14:36,695 --> 01:14:38,119
Then

1319
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:39,977
there was a monk

1320
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:42,637
that accepted the invitation from villagers

1321
01:14:42,839 --> 01:14:45,336
to subdue the Naga.

1322
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:48,625
It took him seven days and seven nights.

1323
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:51,583
The Naga finally surrendered.

1324
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:53,958
He promised to turn his life around.

1325
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:58,708
He redeemed himself for hurting humans

1326
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,958
and harassed the monks

1327
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:02,958
by building a big temple

1328
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:06,600
and dedicated it to that monk.

1329
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,542
He also made gold anklets for Nak

1330
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:13,307
as a merit to support Nak to become a monk.

1331
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:21,125
Although the temple is deserted now,

1332
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:25,167
the Nak-anklet tradition before ordination

1333
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:28,000
is still practised

1334
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:29,917
by temples around here.

1335
01:15:30,823 --> 01:15:31,823
Luang Por...

1336
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:35,333
The ghost is still in my head.

1337
01:15:37,417 --> 01:15:39,000
I’m afraid that I’ll be possessed.

1338
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:41,263
that I won’t be strong enough to fight it.

1339
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:44,042
The strength you have

1340
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:46,208
is not only from yourself

1341
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,750
but also from your friends

1342
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:52,083
for not leaving you.

1343
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,125
You are not fighting alone.

1344
01:15:57,417 --> 01:15:58,583
But Luang Por,

1345
01:15:59,042 --> 01:16:02,083
we once had a Buddha
statue to fight ghosts.

1346
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:07,533
It is lost now, no where to be found.

1347
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,499
Can you give us something to fight?

1348
01:16:10,963 --> 01:16:13,080
You think the ghost is
scared of the Buddha statue?

1349
01:16:17,874 --> 01:16:20,055
If it’s not for the Buddha statue,

1350
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:22,292
why does it not hurt us

1351
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,578
when it saw the Buddha statue?

1352
01:16:25,792 --> 01:16:29,042
Or he is scared of something else inside?

1353
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Alright.

1354
01:16:41,703 --> 01:16:44,009
I don't think you should overthink into it.

1355
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,542
Rest here tonight.

1356
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:49,542
This is a sacred place.

1357
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:52,083
No ghost will come across.

1358
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,250
Yes, Luang Por.

1359
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:20,104
Aod, you have another story, haven’t you?

1360
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:23,651
I think we should tell Luang Por.

1361
01:18:24,422 --> 01:18:26,130
I’ll find Luang Por.

1362
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,292
Just a moment.

1363
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:28,583
Yeah, make yourself useful.

1364
01:18:28,608 --> 01:18:29,608
Luang Por.

1365
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:35,333
Everyone,

1366
01:18:36,356 --> 01:18:38,408
Luang Por is not here.
His belonging is all gone.

1367
01:18:38,433 --> 01:18:39,850
- All gone?
- All of it.

1368
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:41,750
Everything is gone.

1369
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:43,000
Everything is gone?

1370
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:43,875
No, no. Nothing is here.

1371
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,609
No candles, nothing.

1372
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:48,020
Luang Por, the temple, the monk…

1373
01:18:49,081 --> 01:18:49,914
Cave!

1374
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:51,189
Are any of these real?

1375
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,633
Am I real?

1376
01:18:52,917 --> 01:18:54,250
I’m sure you are real.

1377
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:55,442
But your nose is fake.

1378
01:18:55,467 --> 01:18:57,571
That hurts, asshole.

1379
01:18:57,917 --> 01:18:59,292
I’m sorry, Min Joon.

1380
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:00,683
Well, you asked.

1381
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:03,875
Maybe Luang Por went
out to collect the alms.

1382
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:06,767
You sleep like the dead…

1383
01:19:06,792 --> 01:19:08,305
like rehearse dying.

1384
01:19:08,555 --> 01:19:11,367
Let’s get Aod to the temple.

1385
01:19:12,969 --> 01:19:14,536
Let’s go.

1386
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:15,458
Go.

1387
01:19:15,483 --> 01:19:16,483
Let’s go.

1388
01:19:16,704 --> 01:19:17,683
Thank you.

1389
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:19,188
Do you know where we are going?

1390
01:19:19,917 --> 01:19:21,833
Head north, Balloon.

1391
01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:23,142
You know the direction.

1392
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:24,167
North.

1393
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,438
How is it going?

1394
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:28,180
Are you alright?

1395
01:19:30,312 --> 01:19:32,058
What is it?

1396
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,058
Are you okay?

1397
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:34,298
Yes.

1398
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:37,792
This way, guys.

1399
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:38,833
You go ahead.

1400
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:41,225
Min Joon.

1401
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:41,917
Are you alright?

1402
01:19:41,942 --> 01:19:42,942
I lost all energy.

1403
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:45,500
Guys, wait a moment for First.

1404
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:47,042
Balloon.

1405
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,308
Keep going.

1406
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:51,083
Hurry up, First, before we get lost.

1407
01:19:51,108 --> 01:19:52,441
Keep going.

1408
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:55,208
Watch your hands.

1409
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:57,850
What with my hands?

1410
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:59,750
Balloon is so loud.

1411
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:01,942
I’m sure we can find them.

1412
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:06,892
Falling for someone.

1413
01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:07,542
Not funny.

1414
01:20:07,567 --> 01:20:08,942
Come on. Get up.

1415
01:20:13,135 --> 01:20:14,135
Holy smokes.

1416
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:16,417
Oh, you care about me.

1417
01:20:29,721 --> 01:20:32,012
Kiddee, are we lost?

1418
01:20:32,812 --> 01:20:34,729
This is the way, Balloon.

1419
01:20:34,754 --> 01:20:36,333
It’s the shortcut.

1420
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,958
I can hear you before you get here.

1421
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:45,125
First, how did you get here?

1422
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:48,583
Kiddee!

1423
01:20:49,728 --> 01:20:51,433
What’s the point of a compass?

1424
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:52,750
I’m sorry, Balloon.

1425
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,167
I’m aching everywhere.

1426
01:21:03,417 --> 01:21:04,417
Look, guys!

1427
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:07,625
This is laterite.

1428
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,833
It’s not found naturally.

1429
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:13,842
What is it?

1430
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:17,125
Here, there’s a block of it.

1431
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:19,375
First!

1432
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:23,250
You are so stupid.

1433
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:24,667
Don’t you know laterite?

1434
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:26,167
Look at me.

1435
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:29,292
I don’t have a geologist husband.

1436
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,250
That means…

1437
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:34,208
there must be an ancient site hidden here.

1438
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,875
Is this the ancient arched entrance?

1439
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:12,208
This… is what I saw in my dream.

1440
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:18,098
It looks like the entrance at our temple.

1441
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:22,458
Exactly the same.

1442
01:22:25,958 --> 01:22:26,958
Hello!

1443
01:22:27,552 --> 01:22:29,636
Can you revoke a curse?

1444
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:31,917
Any promotion? Like…

1445
01:22:32,226 --> 01:22:34,142
revoke the curse with free exorcism?

1446
01:22:34,167 --> 01:22:34,958
We’ll take one.

1447
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,642
We’ll take one.

1448
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:38,020
Why are you fooling around?

1449
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:39,417
Look at him.

1450
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,100
Aod!

1451
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:43,125
- Let me help.
- I’m okay.

1452
01:22:43,503 --> 01:22:44,294
I’m okay.

1453
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:45,750
Let’s get inside.

1454
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:48,375
Let’s go.

1455
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,833
Balloon, come on. What are you waiting for?

1456
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Hurry up, guys.

1457
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:55,208
Play football?

1458
01:22:55,233 --> 01:22:56,233
Let’s go.

1459
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:07,042
First, there are some people here.

1460
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:10,083
Make sure they are humans.

1461
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,515
Maybe they can help Aod.

1462
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:15,250
Go.

1463
01:23:15,433 --> 01:23:16,100
Excuse me.

1464
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:16,667
Excuse me.

1465
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:17,359
Please help.

1466
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:18,917
Our friend is ill.

1467
01:23:19,926 --> 01:23:20,926
Can you help him?

1468
01:23:21,208 --> 01:23:22,833
How did you get here?

1469
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,500
Here he is.

1470
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:29,625
Aod.

1471
01:23:30,562 --> 01:23:31,854
The curse…

1472
01:23:32,067 --> 01:23:33,600
of Nak’s anklet.

1473
01:23:34,254 --> 01:23:35,720
Nak Kham!

1474
01:23:49,642 --> 01:23:50,392
How are you?

1475
01:23:50,417 --> 01:23:51,708
- The same monk?
- Yes.

1476
01:23:52,083 --> 01:23:53,363
Does the ghost still bother you?

1477
01:23:54,354 --> 01:23:55,354
Not anymore.

1478
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:58,083
But my wound still hurts.

1479
01:23:58,645 --> 01:23:59,925
Like he is still somewhere near.

1480
01:24:01,944 --> 01:24:04,892
What is the deal with
the anklet, Luang Por?

1481
01:24:04,917 --> 01:24:06,833
And about someone called

1482
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,792
"Nak Kham"?

1483
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:12,083
The deserted temple you saw

1484
01:24:13,143 --> 01:24:14,708
used to be a big temple.

1485
01:24:15,757 --> 01:24:17,218
It’s called Wat Nak Nimit.

1486
01:24:17,958 --> 01:24:21,667
[CHANTING]

1487
01:24:21,692 --> 01:24:23,567
The villagers along Mekong…

1488
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,667
when they celebrate ordination,

1489
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,750
the monk at that temple
to perform for them.

1490
01:24:31,167 --> 01:24:33,292
Nak Kham was an orphan.

1491
01:24:35,218 --> 01:24:36,218
Reverence…

1492
01:24:37,601 --> 01:24:39,622
Kham is burglarizing again.

1493
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:43,208
I have to bring him in this time.

1494
01:24:44,465 --> 01:24:46,899
I'm an orphan. Who do I turn to?

1495
01:24:46,924 --> 01:24:49,667
Just this much, can you spare some?

1496
01:24:50,576 --> 01:24:53,805
Reverence took you in and raised you

1497
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:55,444
You still dare to call yourself an orphan?

1498
01:24:55,492 --> 01:24:57,200
You bastard.

1499
01:24:57,708 --> 01:24:59,042
You have no respect for him.

1500
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:02,958
Please spare him.

1501
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:05,417
I’m asking you.

1502
01:25:09,417 --> 01:25:11,500
I might not teach you well enough.

1503
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:15,167
That’s why you are greedy.

1504
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:19,625
To commit sins and give yourself an excuse

1505
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:22,083
that you did it because
you don’t have as much

1506
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:24,958
doesn’t give you the right reason.

1507
01:25:25,856 --> 01:25:28,481
It makes you go down even deeper.

1508
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:31,167
Reverence,

1509
01:25:31,792 --> 01:25:33,042
We’ll tie him with a plank

1510
01:25:33,125 --> 01:25:34,833
and drag him to the authority later.

1511
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:37,208
No, reverence.

1512
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:40,958
During the next moon,

1513
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,500
there will be a big
ordination at the Naga temple.

1514
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,375
Let me be ordained to repay what I did.

1515
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:53,875
He is right.

1516
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:57,417
For the sake of Buddhism,

1517
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,125
let the Naga discipline him.

1518
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:02,333
I think,

1519
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:05,750
it’s better than making him a convict.

1520
01:26:07,875 --> 01:26:09,915
But it didn’t come from
his heart to become a monk.

1521
01:26:11,403 --> 01:26:13,528
He wanted to go to the capital

1522
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:16,793
so he planed to steal the
gold anklets then ran away.

1523
01:26:18,176 --> 01:26:19,635
That’s why he was cursed

1524
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,333
and it caused him ichthyosis,

1525
01:26:22,645 --> 01:26:24,206
and suffered to death.

1526
01:26:25,917 --> 01:26:28,542
This young man must be cursed

1527
01:26:28,567 --> 01:26:31,913
for the wrongful possession.

1528
01:26:33,129 --> 01:26:36,254
Is there a way to revoke the curse?

1529
01:26:36,838 --> 01:26:38,076
There is only way.

1530
01:26:38,101 --> 01:26:40,893
Return the anklets to the Naga.

1531
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:44,333
How do we do it?

1532
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:47,417
Isn’t it written on the anklets?

1533
01:26:49,625 --> 01:26:51,042
On the other anklet we found,

1534
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:52,854
is there anything written on it?

1535
01:26:54,187 --> 01:26:55,104
Yes.

1536
01:26:55,129 --> 01:26:57,042
- What does it say?
- What does it say?

1537
01:26:59,354 --> 01:27:01,520
“The anklets that Nak is wearing,

1538
01:27:01,572 --> 01:27:04,556
when they are removed,
you’ll become a monk.”

1539
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:07,875
The ghost has been harassing Aod

1540
01:27:08,338 --> 01:27:12,167
because he doesn’t want Aod
to become a monk.

1541
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:14,625
Because if Aod succeeds,

1542
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,760
it will revoke the curse.

1543
01:27:17,417 --> 01:27:18,583
How about this…

1544
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:22,000
we let Aod wears anklets, become a monk

1545
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:23,583
and revoke the curse.

1546
01:27:23,608 --> 01:27:24,149
Yeah.

1547
01:27:24,542 --> 01:27:25,542
That is not possible.

1548
01:27:27,749 --> 01:27:29,416
You still have ties with him.

1549
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:32,375
Ties of karma

1550
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:35,008
that you committed
with him in the past life.

1551
01:27:36,422 --> 01:27:40,174
If you can’t remove those ties,
you can’t be a monk.

1552
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:46,750
The anklets are the symbol
of ties in the world of mundane,

1553
01:27:47,715 --> 01:27:49,611
both good karma and bad karma.

1554
01:27:51,606 --> 01:27:53,398
If you can’t let go of these ties,

1555
01:27:53,958 --> 01:27:55,875
you can’t be prosperous in Dharma.

1556
01:27:57,667 --> 01:27:58,750
So that means…

1557
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,875
to take the anklets off,

1558
01:28:02,042 --> 01:28:03,875
we must let go of ties in our mind first

1559
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,917
or we can’t be a monk?

1560
01:28:10,042 --> 01:28:12,625
No ties, no concerns...

1561
01:28:13,583 --> 01:28:14,583
then you can be a monk.

1562
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:18,792
I see.

1563
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:25,625
A cliff at the back of the village,

1564
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:27,208
there is a holy reservoir.

1565
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:29,292
Put on Nak’s attire

1566
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:32,875
and the anklets. Go wash your body there.

1567
01:28:34,292 --> 01:28:36,375
[CHANTING]

1568
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:39,125
[CHANTING]

1569
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:43,833
Awesome.

1570
01:29:55,750 --> 01:30:00,250
Why don’t we just go
to the flower market?

1571
01:30:00,723 --> 01:30:03,638
It's an eight day walk.

1572
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:08,082
Excuse me.

1573
01:30:08,198 --> 01:30:09,198
Yes?

1574
01:30:09,629 --> 01:30:11,713
Please take this yellow robe to make merit.

1575
01:30:13,333 --> 01:30:14,333
Of course.

1576
01:30:20,042 --> 01:30:21,750
Thank you.

1577
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:27,958
We will pray for you. Sathu.

1578
01:30:37,792 --> 01:30:39,042
I have a gossip.

1579
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,875
Don't you think this village is weird?

1580
01:30:44,542 --> 01:30:46,333
There are only young people

1581
01:30:46,583 --> 01:30:48,830
and no elderly people.

1582
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,958
There is only one that
looks like a village chief.

1583
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:57,708
On the top of that, there are no kids.

1584
01:30:57,851 --> 01:30:59,517
That’s good.

1585
01:30:59,542 --> 01:31:00,792
When mama sees them,

1586
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:04,500
the Korean looking guys around here,

1587
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:05,792
I love it.

1588
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:08,750
Don’t get me suspicious. Just stay put.

1589
01:31:10,917 --> 01:31:11,917
How are you?

1590
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:14,375
Did you wash yourself in the reservoir?

1591
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:17,375
I did.

1592
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:20,083
That’s good.

1593
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:24,125
But it can relieve the
curse for just a while.

1594
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:27,708
Aod.

1595
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,208
Do you know

1596
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,125
how we can take the anklets off?

1597
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:34,167
I don’t know.

1598
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:39,417
But I feel sorry for Nak Kham.

1599
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:42,375
Without you guys,

1600
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:46,292
I might be just like him.

1601
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:49,375
Hey, Aod.

1602
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:51,754
He lived by taking advantage of others,

1603
01:31:51,779 --> 01:31:53,107
stealing from others,

1604
01:31:53,292 --> 01:31:55,417
he is no different from criminals.

1605
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:58,333
He only blames others

1606
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,542
and never looks into himself.

1607
01:32:01,042 --> 01:32:02,042
Yeah.

1608
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:04,667
I think those who only think of the benefit

1609
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:07,167
won’t get sympathy from others.

1610
01:32:12,542 --> 01:32:15,917
That’s right. We should
not forgive ourselves

1611
01:32:17,625 --> 01:32:19,083
but we should ask for forgiveness.

1612
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:22,458
That’s true. Even during the ordination,

1613
01:32:22,557 --> 01:32:25,140
there is a part of apologize
to all vengeful spirits.

1614
01:32:26,042 --> 01:32:27,958
Right, apologize to a ghost.

1615
01:32:28,335 --> 01:32:30,585
You’ll get your neck
snapped before you know it.

1616
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:46,833
Why do you take it off?

1617
01:32:48,917 --> 01:32:50,875
We are willing to apologize to him,

1618
01:32:51,375 --> 01:32:53,500
we should let him see our true intention.

1619
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:04,708
I and everybody here

1620
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:09,708
want to apologize for stealing what’s yours

1621
01:33:11,417 --> 01:33:12,750
and I will be ordained.

1622
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,500
I won’t let you!

1623
01:33:17,757 --> 01:33:19,698
We are here in good faith.

1624
01:33:21,917 --> 01:33:23,292
We are aware of our wrongdoings.

1625
01:33:25,083 --> 01:33:26,167
You…

1626
01:33:28,442 --> 01:33:30,300
stole what’s mine.

1627
01:33:31,378 --> 01:33:33,933
You will be like me!

1628
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:38,600
But the anklets don’t belong to you.

1629
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:40,083
The anklets are mine!

1630
01:33:41,031 --> 01:33:42,989
You took them off from my ankles.

1631
01:33:44,083 --> 01:33:45,333
Do you remember?

1632
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,557
The Naga anklets.

1633
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:19,125
Nak…

1634
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:23,750
you should let go of these anklets.

1635
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,458
Wherever you took them from,

1636
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:29,625
take them back.

1637
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:30,650
No.

1638
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:34,125
I won’t.

1639
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:36,542
I will die

1640
01:34:39,125 --> 01:34:41,083
with my precious anklets.

1641
01:34:44,915 --> 01:34:47,000
The anklet curse…

1642
01:34:48,167 --> 01:34:51,000
nobody can help you

1643
01:34:52,083 --> 01:34:54,667
if you won’t help yourself.

1644
01:34:55,458 --> 01:34:57,083
Remember that.

1645
01:34:58,292 --> 01:35:00,917
I ask for permission to leave the monkhood.

1646
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,667
Please recognize me

1647
01:35:03,792 --> 01:35:06,042
that I’m now a layman.

1648
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:15,167
Juk, Klae.

1649
01:35:16,183 --> 01:35:18,350
You are stealing from corpses again?

1650
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:19,417
We didn’t.

1651
01:35:19,833 --> 01:35:20,833
We didn’t.

1652
01:35:21,653 --> 01:35:23,181
Let’s go then. Get the boat.

1653
01:35:23,206 --> 01:35:24,206
Yes.

1654
01:35:28,511 --> 01:35:30,271
What are you waiting for?
Get the other one.

1655
01:35:35,957 --> 01:35:37,457
You stole what’s mine.

1656
01:35:37,792 --> 01:35:40,208
Whoever took what’s mine must die!

1657
01:35:47,917 --> 01:35:50,083
You are dying already. Don’t be stingy.

1658
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:53,292
At your ankle, give it to me.

1659
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:54,500
Give it back to me.

1660
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:55,875
Novice.

1661
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,417
Anklet.

1662
01:35:57,458 --> 01:35:58,458
Juk.

1663
01:35:58,875 --> 01:36:00,375
Just give it back to him.

1664
01:36:05,629 --> 01:36:06,629
Give me.

1665
01:36:07,667 --> 01:36:08,917
- No.
- It's mine!

1666
01:36:14,042 --> 01:36:15,250
The anklet is mine.

1667
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,083
Juk!

1668
01:36:26,958 --> 01:36:27,958
Take it.

1669
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:29,875
Hey.

1670
01:36:32,542 --> 01:36:33,792
Hey.

1671
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,417
How come the event from previous life

1672
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:41,208
affect us in this life?

1673
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:46,583
Luang Por,

1674
01:36:46,608 --> 01:36:48,498
it’s a different life.

1675
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:53,851
What do you think about
yesterday, today, and tomorrow?

1676
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:55,042
How are they connected?

1677
01:36:55,875 --> 01:36:57,542
They are all connected.

1678
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:03,917
That’s right.

1679
01:37:04,625 --> 01:37:06,750
It’s like the same piece of fabric.

1680
01:37:07,375 --> 01:37:08,667
All connected.

1681
01:37:10,042 --> 01:37:12,208
Today is yesterday’s future.

1682
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:15,708
And the consequence of our actions today…

1683
01:37:15,792 --> 01:37:17,524
affects tomorrow.

1684
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:21,649
We have to accept the consequence

1685
01:37:22,586 --> 01:37:24,767
because you can’t go back in time

1686
01:37:24,792 --> 01:37:26,958
to fix yesterday.

1687
01:37:34,458 --> 01:37:35,583
I won’t let…

1688
01:37:36,625 --> 01:37:38,417
you take off my anklets.

1689
01:37:39,292 --> 01:37:40,917
Please forgive us.

1690
01:37:41,917 --> 01:37:43,208
Please let Aod go.

1691
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:44,667
No.

1692
01:37:46,333 --> 01:37:47,750
All of you

1693
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:49,667
have to die like me.

1694
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:56,083
Aod has admitted his wrongdoings.

1695
01:37:56,792 --> 01:38:00,333
We are asking for forgiveness

1696
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:02,667
with good faith

1697
01:38:02,958 --> 01:38:04,850
and we should…

1698
01:38:04,875 --> 01:38:05,875
Stop!

1699
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:10,250
We are asking for forgiveness

1700
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:12,083
I said stop!

1701
01:38:17,292 --> 01:38:19,167
I will kill him

1702
01:38:19,833 --> 01:38:21,875
and make him suffer.

1703
01:38:23,417 --> 01:38:24,583
Stop, Nak.

1704
01:38:27,083 --> 01:38:28,292
Luang Por.

1705
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:30,083
Aod.

1706
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:31,375
Luang Por.

1707
01:38:31,625 --> 01:38:34,250
When they are asking for your forgiveness,

1708
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:37,583
why don’t you let go of
the ties and forgive them?

1709
01:38:39,667 --> 01:38:42,083
Why am I the only one
who has to become this?

1710
01:38:44,417 --> 01:38:46,333
Why do you help them

1711
01:38:49,042 --> 01:38:50,875
but not me?

1712
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:53,875
And you…

1713
01:38:55,167 --> 01:38:57,000
you performed ordination for me.

1714
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:09,609
I have helped you

1715
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:13,083
but you don’t help yourself.

1716
01:40:17,042 --> 01:40:18,208
Please stop.

1717
01:40:26,125 --> 01:40:29,208
I’m asking to hold back
the extreme punishment.

1718
01:40:30,208 --> 01:40:33,792
Please give him a chance to repent

1719
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,458
the same way it happened to you.

1720
01:41:04,507 --> 01:41:05,507
And you…

1721
01:41:05,792 --> 01:41:07,833
if you really accept your mistake

1722
01:41:08,333 --> 01:41:10,125
and apologize to the anklets’ owner,

1723
01:41:10,208 --> 01:41:11,208
you will survive.

1724
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:13,333
No.

1725
01:41:16,667 --> 01:41:17,917
I’m not giving them back.

1726
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:20,083
You are unjust.

1727
01:41:36,542 --> 01:41:38,042
Those who wear anklets,

1728
01:41:38,875 --> 01:41:41,292
who dedicate themselves to Buddhism,

1729
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,597
the Naga will protect them…

1730
01:42:06,375 --> 01:42:08,142
Who wear the anklet

1731
01:42:08,167 --> 01:42:10,333
If they ever dare to
become enemy of Buddhism,

1732
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:13,375
The Naga will destroy them.

1733
01:42:14,417 --> 01:42:16,958
Like how you declared yourself

1734
01:42:17,042 --> 01:42:18,958
as a protector of Buddhism.

1735
01:42:25,708 --> 01:42:28,875
My anklet.

1736
01:42:31,792 --> 01:42:33,375
Long time ago...

1737
01:42:35,792 --> 01:42:38,500
The Naga accepted his mistake.

1738
01:42:39,292 --> 01:42:40,692
That’s why he created these anklets

1739
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,583
to remind the later generations

1740
01:42:43,583 --> 01:42:47,507
to accept their mistakes in the past.

1741
01:42:48,833 --> 01:42:49,833
As for you…

1742
01:42:51,208 --> 01:42:52,625
after you take off the anklets,

1743
01:42:53,625 --> 01:42:56,042
you can become Nak, then a monk.

1744
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:06,542
[CHANTING]

1745
01:44:09,023 --> 01:44:11,731
For the merit of my ordination this time,

1746
01:44:12,833 --> 01:44:16,042
I want to dedicate it to every Nagas

1747
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:18,583
and Nak Kham.

1748
01:44:53,667 --> 01:44:55,458
No ties, no concerns.

1749
01:44:57,125 --> 01:44:59,125
Be prosperous in Dhamma.

1750
01:44:59,833 --> 01:45:00,833
And everyone too.

1751
01:45:00,875 --> 01:45:02,625
Sathu.

1752
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:42,058
Hello, I’m Pampam Oppa.

1753
01:45:42,083 --> 01:45:46,866
Now you are at “Wat Nak Khum” temple fair.

1754
01:45:46,891 --> 01:45:48,058
Where’s mine?

1755
01:45:48,083 --> 01:45:49,083
Here.

1756
01:45:49,417 --> 01:45:50,500
That’s my boyfriend.

1757
01:45:50,583 --> 01:45:51,808
Sure.

1758
01:45:51,833 --> 01:45:52,833
Yummy.

1759
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
So delicious.

1760
01:45:54,125 --> 01:45:55,500
Oops! Here you go. Thank you.

1761
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:56,750
Thank you.

1762
01:45:56,833 --> 01:45:57,833
This one is delicious

1763
01:46:01,958 --> 01:46:03,042
What are you doing?

1764
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:05,292
Whose drone is this?

1765
01:46:05,542 --> 01:46:07,542
It’s Kiddee’s dad’s. He brought it today.

1766
01:46:08,833 --> 01:46:10,458
- What is this?
- Grilled rice crisps.

1767
01:46:10,542 --> 01:46:11,792
Grilled rice crisps?

1768
01:46:11,875 --> 01:46:13,458
Can I try to make it?

1769
01:46:13,542 --> 01:46:14,542
Sure.

1770
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:18,000
- I keep flipping it?
- Yes.

1771
01:46:18,958 --> 01:46:21,458
Oh gosh! Marvelous!

1772
01:46:21,542 --> 01:46:24,125
Like you’ve never been to a temple fair.
What marvelous about it?

1773
01:46:24,208 --> 01:46:26,583
That guy…
who eating meat balls there.

1774
01:46:26,667 --> 01:46:27,583
Where?

1775
01:46:27,667 --> 01:46:29,667
The grilled rice crisp is cuter.

1776
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:31,708
First, this is why I'm here…

1777
01:46:31,792 --> 01:46:34,642
to see real Naga fireballs.

1778
01:46:34,667 --> 01:46:35,875
Why are you excited?

1779
01:46:35,958 --> 01:46:37,417
Fireball, not a guy.

1780
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:38,667
Really.

1781
01:46:46,875 --> 01:46:47,625
What?

1782
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:49,018
- They are trying to commit suicide.
- What?

1783
01:46:49,042 --> 01:46:50,726
- They are trying to commit suicide.
- Where?

1784
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:51,934
At the rock field we went yesterday.

1785
01:46:51,958 --> 01:46:52,958
Yeah.

1786
01:46:53,333 --> 01:46:55,208
Why are they doing this? Why?

1787
01:46:55,333 --> 01:46:56,375
Let’s go to help him.

1788
01:46:56,458 --> 01:46:57,667
- Yeah.
- Let’s go.

1789
01:47:02,575 --> 01:47:03,558
Calm down, everyone.

1790
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:06,083
Don’t get down. It’s dangerous.

1791
01:47:06,108 --> 01:47:07,017
Guys. Guys.

1792
01:47:07,042 --> 01:47:09,083
Calm down. No.

1793
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:13,750
Old man.

1794
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,125
See you.

1795
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:36,000
- Again?
- Again?

1796
01:47:49,208 --> 01:47:50,728
Here, brother.

1797
01:47:51,338 --> 01:47:52,978
I give it to you.

1798
01:47:53,003 --> 01:47:54,523
Are you sure?

1799
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:04,042
I don’t feel comfortable.

1800
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:06,083
You should give it to him.

1801
01:48:11,042 --> 01:48:12,482
Take it, brother.

1802
01:48:23,792 --> 01:48:26,000
Here, Pampam. Keep it.

1803
01:48:31,667 --> 01:48:34,083
Before you leave, bring this to Phra Aod

1804
01:48:34,108 --> 01:48:36,333
to pay homage to the
Buddha image at the entrance.

1805
01:48:37,417 --> 01:48:38,857
Yes.

1806
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:00,690
Told you he’s not old.

1807
01:49:01,375 --> 01:49:02,850
Luang Pee…

1808
01:49:02,875 --> 01:49:04,275
Novice.

1809
01:49:05,042 --> 01:49:06,482
Cut!

1810
01:49:13,292 --> 01:49:14,000
Let's go.

1811
01:49:14,083 --> 01:49:15,101
In my face.

1812
01:49:15,125 --> 01:49:16,485
What’s in your face?

1813
01:49:22,875 --> 01:49:25,101
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

1814
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:26,605
You’re not.

1815
01:49:30,958 --> 01:49:31,667
Go.

1816
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:33,110
Come on.

1817
01:49:35,625 --> 01:49:37,105
Like that.

1818
01:49:41,583 --> 01:49:43,023
Okay.

1819
01:49:53,583 --> 01:49:55,213
Good. Good. Good.

1820
01:49:55,958 --> 01:49:56,708
Novice.

1821
01:49:56,792 --> 01:49:58,143
Novice.

1822
01:49:58,167 --> 01:49:58,750
Novice.

1823
01:49:58,833 --> 01:49:59,976
Novice.

1824
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,440
Novice.

1825
01:50:16,625 --> 01:50:17,985
Wanna see snakefish?
