00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,460
Chigichigi~

2
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,712
Chigira-kun..

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,507
Unrequited love,

4
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:55,630
it's not about your feelings getting
through to the person you love..

5
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,098
It's falling in love one-sidedly.

6
00:00:58,182 --> 00:00:59,183
Okay, let's do the last 100 times.

7
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,225
Get ready.

8
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:01,142
Yes!

9
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,901
I am right now,

10
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,404
Set.

11
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,039
Experiencing unrequited love.

12
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:43,435
You are wonderful today too.

13
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,896
For Yamada-kun of the gardening club.

14
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,856
I'll give you some water.

15
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,484
So wonderful...

16
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:51,902
Maya.

17
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:57,324
Hey.

18
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,283
Chika-chan.

19
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:01,870
You really don't get tired
of observing mushrooms.

20
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,080
Mushroom?

21
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,917
It's today, right? The
first time in your life thing.

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,210
Yeah.

23
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,255
Why are you getting nervous?
It's okay, I'm rooting for you.

24
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,633
Thanks.

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,930
It's okay. I don't need it.

26
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,141
I don't need it.

27
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,311
Ehh-

28
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,731
As always, the salty treatment.

29
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,191
It's fine. That's what Sui is.

30
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,735
I failed to give it to him again.

31
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:54,738
My unrequited love has
been six months long.

32
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,634
But it'll end today.

33
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,263
I wish I can go over that stage.

34
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:04,766
Yamada-kun.

35
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,063
I've liked you always!

36
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,982
If it's okay with you,

37
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,234
can we exchange our contact information?

38
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,621
Wh.. Who are you?

39
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,167
Eh?

40
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,753
No.. No way.

41
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,809
What a way to get rejected...

42
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:51,730
It was my first time
confessing to someone...

43
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,703
Thanks for everything so far.

44
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,206
Goodbye.

45
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:13,627
Hmm?

46
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:18,412
[Yesterday, a stranger hit on me. I was ambushed... Seriously gross. 
Are you a stalker? LOL It's so hard being ugly. You'll die of depression LOL]

47
00:04:18,497 --> 00:04:19,436
[  Seriously? LOL
Being ugly is so tiring LOL]

48
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:20,399
[So popular~
Let's go out LOL]

49
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:21,438
[Yamada-kun is so mean~ lol]

50
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:22,484
[Ambushed you? What a pervert!
If you see her again, report it. LOL]

51
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:23,688
[It's all about one's behavior, isn't it? (LOL)
I'm curious about how much ugly this person is.]

52
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,931
What is this?

53
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:28,767
Writing comments like this...

54
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,187
You're so cruel, Yamada-kun.

55
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,403
Good work.

56
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,828
By any chance... did you hear it?

57
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,997
Well, I don't mind so you can continue.

58
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,498
No, no, I will mind.

59
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:55,888
Err. Why are you here?

60
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,574
I'm on library duty today.

61
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:09,745
That kind of thing,

62
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,144
Won't it be better if you spit it out?

63
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:41,256
It's so painful to stop loving
the person you used to love.

64
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,387
If I have to feel like this,

65
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:50,348
it's better to have an
unrequited love forever.

66
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,311
I don't need mutual love and boyfriend.

67
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Oh?

68
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:06,114
I'm sorry. Please forget
this. Forget all of this.

69
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,211
Sorry.

70
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,215
It's so embarrassing. It's my
dark history. Yeah, dark history.

71
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,470
Then I'll take away this book, okay?

72
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,599
Kisaragi-san,

73
00:06:34,518 --> 00:06:37,479
I think a smile suits you.

74
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,407
Thank you.

75
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,665
Good morning, Sui.

76
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,692
Shall I help with something?

77
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,962
No, you don't need to.

78
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,046
Help.

79
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,963
I'll help.

80
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,508
Sui, I have something to ask for.

81
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,011
Right now, girls wearing boys blazers and

82
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,053
posting pictures online
is getting popular right?

83
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:11,430
Lend me yours, Sui.

84
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,598
Hanasaki-san, that's not fair.

85
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,476
Hey, hey, are you listening?

86
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,567
Come to think of it, Chigira-kun is..

87
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,448
The most popular boy in the school.

88
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,953
It was a mystery time.

89
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,789
What is it?

90
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,374
Tezuka-kun...

91
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,252
No, it's nothing.

92
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,430
Library Wizard, do this for me next time.

93
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:56,182
[Water Droplets and Thunder; The Last Lullaby; The Cuckoo Bookshop;
The Cold Equations; The Day I was Called a High School Student]

94
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,893
Me again?

95
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:02,313
Yeah, it's better to ask the person
who knows well about books, right?

96
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,441
Okay.

97
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,446
Anyway...

98
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,656
did you get heartbroken?

99
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,117
How did you know?

100
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,453
I saw it.

101
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,624
It's the worst.

102
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,711
It's like a public execution, isn't it?

103
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:34,095
Miss Wizard, you should
forget this kind of rubbish person.

104
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,098
And this Sunday, will you go...

105
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,265
Hey, Maya!

106
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,602
Want to hang out with some
college students next Sunday?

107
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:45,565
The best way to respond to a breakup
is to overwrite it with a new love!

108
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,484
I see.

109
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,612
That's true.

110
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,949
Alright! I'll show that mushroom bastard.

111
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,076
I'm going on a date
with a college student.

112
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,994
Don't do unnecessary things.

113
00:08:58,078 --> 00:08:59,329
What do you mean?

114
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:02,248
Eh...

115
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,667
No way.

116
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,295
It's nothing.

117
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,173
I'm back.

118
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:16,054
Ren, what should you do
first when you get back home?

119
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,598
I need to wash my hands!

120
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:21,267
Well done, you did a good job.

121
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,229
-Then, let's go.
-Yes.

122
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,688
Yeah.

123
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,795
I wonder if I'll ever find
someone I like again.

124
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,799
You inner thoughts are leaking out.

125
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,261
Chigira-kun.

126
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,513
You heard me again.

127
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:06,062
Oh... it's rare to see you
on this train, Chigira-kun.

128
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:09,296
On days without morning
practice, it's usually around this time.

129
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,775
I see.

130
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,619
I saw you, Kisaragi-san, countless times.

131
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,989
You're always smiling.

132
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:20,201
I'm a weirdo, right?

133
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,328
No...

134
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,710
You look so happy
that it's charming to see.

135
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,394
So delicious.

136
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,314
Yamada you're always
eating fried bread aren't you?

137
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,440
It's so delicious.

138
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,150
So delicious!

139
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,296
It was so fun.

140
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,591
But...

141
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,968
it's over.

142
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,649
Kisaragi-san,

143
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,153
Instead of looking for
someone to love desperately,

144
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,255
how about having an
unrequited love for me?

145
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:41,783
Eh?

146
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,369
My little sister often asked
me to accompany her.

147
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:46,329
That kind of...

148
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,790
Pretend game, I guess.

149
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,795
You mean...

150
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,297
I have to pretend

151
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,383
to have an unrequited
love for Chigira-kun?

152
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:03,137
Unrequited love game.

155

why is it like this?

156
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,433
Is it sympathy for me?

157
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,657
A spirit lurking behind.

158
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:13,124
I'm still alive, you know.

159
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,837

How is it?

170
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,118
I don't know since I've never
had an unrequited love before.

Eh?

When your feelings don't
reach the person you like,

173
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,989
and you only long for them
one-sidedly. That one-sided love!

174
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:59,337
For sure, someone like Chigira-kun

175
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,421
always has a mutual love from the start.

176
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,010
Unrequited love is like
a stalker or something?

177
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:10,056
When people fall in love, they all
tend to become rational stalkers!

178
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,684
Hmm.. It seems so bothersome.

179
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,437
Not at all, it's actually quite enjoyable!

180
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,197

00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:32,203
But don't worry.

183
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,080
This is just a pretend game.

184
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,667
I won't seriously fall in
love with Chigira-kun.

185
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:44,257
And please keep this a secret between us.

186
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:49,095
I don't want to be misunderstood
by people and cause a trouble.

187
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,557
I don't really mind though.

188
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,864
I don't want to be written
by someone like this again.

189
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:11,868
I understand.

190
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,871
But you aren't an ugly person.

191
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,082
Thank you.

192
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,711
Then, firstly...

193
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,173
Counting series

194
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,411
Counting the number of times
that you found the person you love.

195
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,357
The goal is 5 times a day.

196
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:57,496
Okay!

197
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,909
Counting the number of
times that your eyes met.

198
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,440
Please... look this way!

199
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:32,198
Eh... what are you doing?

200
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,032
Praying for rain?

201
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:33,658
-Eh?
-What?

202
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,993
I'm not praying for rain!

203
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,036
I'm not a farmer.
-Eh?

204
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,170
-Okay, okay.
-I said I'm not praying for rain!

205
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,047
Check series.

206
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:50,592
Checking the information of the person you love.

207
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,635
Firstly, the time he goes to school.

208
00:16:58,433 --> 00:16:59,601
Why are you taking this train?

209
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,519
Ah! Chigira-kun.

210
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,524
This is unrequited love game mission.

211
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,446
I'm sorry, it was a stalker thing.

212
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,621
Mission clear.

213
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,798
My heart skipped a beat just now.

214
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,383
It feels like an unrequited love.

215
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:33,551
Why are you walking in the back?

216
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:37,096
It's a common thing in the
world of unrequited love.

217
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:39,305
It's like following the person you love.

218
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:42,185
On days with morning practice,

219
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,228
I'll be at school at 7:00 AM.

220
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:45,146
Eh?

221
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,898
I pass this road everyday.

222
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:53,029
I often practice at Ooniwa Park on weekends.

223
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,449
Thanks for the rare information.

224
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,617
This made stalking more easier.

225
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,414
Did you get daunted?

226
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,680
A lady bug.

227
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:33,903
Hurry up and overwrite that
memory of heartbreak with me.

228
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:42,161
My contact ID is Schi...

229
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:44,121
Wait, wait.. Please wait!

230
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:46,373
Please repeat it from the start.

231
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,227
This feeling, it's so
like an unrequited love.

232
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:43,556
I don't want to interrupt him.

233
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,063
Shoo.. Shoo!

234
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,858
Shoo.. Please be quiet.

235
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,443
Shoo.. Shoo!

236
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,169
I'm sorry. I bothered your practice.

237
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:14,712
It's not a bother.

238
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,446
I was just about to take a break.

239
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,715
What a relief.

240
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:24,138
For some reason, I thought
Chigira-kun was naturally fast.

241
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,933
But it's not just that, is it?

242
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,438
You're practicing as much as you could and

243
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,722
even if there's no club activities,
you're practicing here alone.

244
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,279
It's a bit of a lonely sport,
isn't it, track and field?

245
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,244
Sorry, I don't even
know anything and yet...

246
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:48,829
That's true...

247
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,124
It might be lonely.

248
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,810
Like before the tournament,

249
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,046
I sometimes get scared.

250
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,298
Is that so?

251
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:04,595
If it's me, I might want to
run away because I'm scared.

252
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:09,016
Chigira-kun, have you
ever thought about quitting?

253
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,061
No, not even once.

254
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,604
Why?

255
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,691
Because I love running.

256
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,763
Is this like an unrequited love game?

257
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,259
I'm sorry but this thing

258
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,636
doesn't exist in the
world of unrequited love.

259
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,139
I'll wait...

260
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,725
until your wound heals.

261
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,228
Eh?

262
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,605
I'll wait forever.

263
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:04,863
Why are you being so kind to me?

264
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:08,450
I and Chigira-kun... um..

265
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,019
It's like the world we're
living in is different.

266
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:15,416
Up until now, we never
talked to each other too.

267
00:22:17,578 --> 00:22:18,769
Because I understand

268
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:21,738
Your feelings, Kisaragi-san.

269
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:29,347
I'm not good at
understanding my own feelings

270
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,432
or the feelings of others.

271
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,183
So I don't really know but

272
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,895
I understand what you were saying.

273
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,283
I wonder what that means.

274
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,077
Chigira-kun is way too mysterious.

275
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,374
But anyway, have to try my best.

276
00:22:58,626 --> 00:22:59,668
Next is...

277
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:11,305
Liking the thing that
the person you love likes.

278
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,189
Okay!

279
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,340
Chigira kun is... doing this everyday?

280
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,718
Sit down.

281
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,098
Until the end, until the end.

282
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,770
As expected of Chigichigi

283
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:02,440
Today's Chigichigi is
more serious than ever.

284
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,247
It's because Kanto tournament is getting close.

285
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:06,431
Sui was in Inter-High last year too.

286
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,404
So awesome.

287
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:10,697
Sui!

288
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,143
My leg hurts...

289
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,025
Hey, are you okay?

290
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,986
Grab here.

291
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,620
It's okay, it's okay. I'm fine.

292
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,784
Sorry.

293
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,327
Thanks.

294
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,537
It hurts...

295
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:00,164
By the way, what happened to your leg?

296
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,749
Well, I just started running a bit.

297
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,086
Running? Why again?

298
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,628
That's a bit...

299
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,047
What should we do?

300
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,970
What is that?

301
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,347
Isn't it Chigichigi thing?

302
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,234
Eh?

303
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:31,195
By any chance, Miss Wizard...

304
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,488
do you like Chigira?

305
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:35,616
No.. I don't, I don't.

306
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,619
You see, I just got my
heart broken not long ago.

307
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,747
Besides, Chigira-kun is a
person above the clouds!

308
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,875
Liking him.. It's impossible!

309
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,002
No way. No way.

310
00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:53,383
Ah... Thanks for lending your hand.

311
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,802
I'll go then.

312
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:58,138
It hurts...

313
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,187
Of all things...

314
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,689
why him?

315
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:16,115
Your legs hurt because you ran everyday?

316
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,799
Kisaragi, which club are you in?

317
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,618
Go-home club.

318
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:20,702
Eh?

319
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,246
-Go-home club?
-Yes, go-home club.

320
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,966
I can't believe he can also play soccer!

321
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,634
Sui was in a soccer club before.

322
00:26:35,718 --> 00:26:37,094
Eh? Really?

323
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,571
Chigichigi!

324
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,733
If it weren't for this pretend game,

325
00:27:08,818 --> 00:27:11,205
no one would even look my way.

326
00:27:17,176 --> 00:27:18,343
Look out!

327
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:24,808
It hurts...

328
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,560
Are you okay?

329
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,230
-I'm sorry.
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

330
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,817
It hurts...

331
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,237
There's no way you're okay.

332
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,864
Eh? What was that just now?

333
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:22,366
Who is that girl?

334
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,763
Um... thank you.

335
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,983
Eh?

336
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:09,871
Eh?

337
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,791
Can I take it off?

338
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,084
What?

339
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,852
How did this happen?

340
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,481
Unrequited love game mission.

341
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,406
Liking the thing that
the person you love likes.

342
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,243
Running is the thing Chigira-kun likes so

343
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,328
I also want to like it.

344
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,457
Only for that?

345
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:55,458
Yeah.

346
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:08,680
Running is forbidden.

347
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:10,890
Eh?

348
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,227
Just to match my preferences,

349
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,812
Kisaragi-san, you don't
need to add more wounds.

350
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:18,606
Okay.

351
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:24,446
But I want to cherish the
thing Chigira-kun likes.

352
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,409
There is another thing I like.

353
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:31,036
What is it?

354
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,622
Kisaragi-san's

355
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:37,959
cheeks.

356
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,260
These are only for me

357
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,136
so don't let anyone touch them.

358
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,765
Okay!

359
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,689
My face is burning up.

360
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,567
Is this.

361
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,319
Love?

362
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,156
No good, no good, no good.

363
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:11,243
This is just a pretend game.

364
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:12,745
Chigira-kun is

365
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,705
just being kind to me as part of the game.

366
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,666
Don't misunderstand.

367
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:18,875
Okay!

368
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:32,072
-I'm Maya Kisaragi! Nice to meet you!
-Nice to meet you too.

369
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,473
-Do you have time next Sunday?
-Let's go somewhere.

370
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,516
Is..

371
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,560
Is this...

372
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,770
a..

373
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:41,523
A date?

374
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,963
Thank you for waiting.

375
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:06,381
Thanks for coming.

376
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:11,011
No. I'm also grateful
for you inviting me out.

377
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:13,972
Um...

378
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:17,726
Today is what about...?

379
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,060
Mission of pretending
to have unrequited love.

380
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:22,314
Get to know more about me.

381
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,733
I understand.

382
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:29,821
I was lost between the
aquarium and the temple but

383
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,656
is it fine here?

384
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,366
Of course, Chigira-kun
can choose the one he likes.

385
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,495
But why temple?

386
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,249
By any chance, do you
like Buddhist statues?

387
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,669
Rather than watching
fishes at the aquarium,

388
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,703
I want to see Kisaragi-san's face more.

389
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,552
Yes! I won over the fishes!

390
00:32:53,095 --> 00:32:54,263
Is it okay, if we walk for-a-bit-?

391
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,223
Ah-I don't mind at all.

392
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,392
If I'm together with Chigira-kun, I'm okay with anything.

393
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,536
Stalking is not allowed today.

394
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,536
Eh?

395
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,914
Come next to me.

396
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,711
Well... but in the world of unrequited
love, this kind of thing never happens!

397
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,296
This way is much more fun to climb.

398
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,383
Chigira-kun.

399
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:36,846
This is no longer the unrequited
love world, it's the mutual love world.

400
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,432
My heart can't take it anymore.

401
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,647
Um.. Can you please climb a bit slower?

402
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,065
Okay.

403
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,544
Oh.. So your little
sister's name is Ren-chan.

404
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,212
Yeah, she's 5 years old.

405
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,132
Ah! I need to take notes.

406
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,807
So sweet...

407
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,020
Ju... just now...

408
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,313
an indirect kiss.

409
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,773
Are you blushing?

410
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:34,279
No.. This is because we're in the middle
of pretending to have unrequited love.

411
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,822
Hmm...

412
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,076
As expected of a popular guy.

413
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,495
He does things differently.

414
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,127
Your neck is long so this resembles you.

415
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:50,295
Go ahead.

416
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,725
This one looks like Chigira-kun.

417
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,854
It's a pair with this!

418
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:09,038
It's a pair with this!

419
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:10,565
So cute.

420
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:15,705
[Couples Corner

421
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,869
With that person you love.
Attach it to  your bag or accessories and always be together
Soft and squishy texture!!

422
00:35:17,954 --> 00:35:19,143
A pair keychain that binds two people together.]

423
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,411
No, no, no.

424
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,290
Let's see the other ones.

425
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,752
Other.. Souvenir.

426
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,196
Somehow, it was like a dream.

427
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,031
Dream?

428
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:07,330
Chigira-kun who is always far
away at school, is now next to me.

429
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,949
This is also thanks to the fact
that we started the pretend game.

430
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:16,172
That's right.

431
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,846
Here, you can have it if you like.

432
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,228
Good-luck bracelet...

433
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:33,273
Why?

434
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,234
The other day.

435
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:39,404
You said you felt lonely when
you were running, didn't you?

436
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,740
I hope things will get a little better.

437
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,167
Kisaragi-san.

438
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,084
Hm?

439
00:36:59,049 --> 00:36:59,966
This..

440
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:05,597
It's a pair.

441
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,601
If you ever feel down again,

442
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,520
look at this and think of me.

443
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,735
Okay, thank you.

444
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,545
Let's go home, Maya.

445
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,587
Okay.

446
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,548
Hm?

447
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:45,845
Just now... did you call me by my name?

448
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,030
Is this like an unrequited love game?

449
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:54,062
Today, I feel like we're having a
mutual love game all the time though.

450
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:03,988
It's fun, so let's just do it!

451
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:59,127
Onii-chan, you look so happy.

452
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,838
Look happy?

453
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,047
Yeah!

454
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,134
I see.

455
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,012
Yeah, I'm happy.

456
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,076
777 all of a sudden.

457
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,495
I'm now a world ranker too.

458
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,751
What? Someone you know?

459
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,379
It's that girl! The one who ambushed me.

460
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,506
That ugly one!

461
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,842
Is she here to confess again?

462
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:49,135
She's really a stalker.

463
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:51,137
I felt likely was being stared at.

464
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:52,889
I can't believe she's coming back

465
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,099
Stalkers are so creepy.

466
00:39:55,517 --> 00:39:56,518
She's there all the time.

467
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,061
I just want a peaceful time.

468
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,187
So creepy...

469
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,022
Don't look away.

470
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:16,162
The one you like is not him,

471
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:17,413
It's me, right?

472
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:27,465
Itou, let's go. Hurry up and run.

473
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:48,945
Hey, hey, just tell me already!

474
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:49,821
What?

475
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:53,032
A new love has started, right?

476
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:59,705
It's useless to hide,
who's the other person?

477
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,712
That person...

478
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,800
I was never supposed to fall in love with.

479
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,009
Eh?

480
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,471
Eh...

481
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:17,557
An affair?

482
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,808
It's not!

483
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:20,476
What is it? What do you mean?

484
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:29,444
I fell in love with someone who
only treats me kindly out of pity.

485
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,492
That person is high above
in the clouds, very popular.

486
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:40,079
I'm not someone who
matches up to him, yet...

487
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:50,923
But you fell in love with him, right?

488
00:41:51,758 --> 00:41:53,676
If that's the case, it doesn't matter.

489
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,511
You should just honestly
convey your feelings.

490
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,892
But don't worry.

491
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,478
This is just a game of pretend, after all.

492
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:07,398
I will never truly fall in love
with Chigira-kun, for sure.

493
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,865
It's impossible.

494
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,868
Well, that's...

495
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,496
Because it's a promise.

496
00:42:42,684 --> 00:42:43,984
Thank you, I'll take over.

497
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,649
But I can handle this alone.

498
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,070
Are you avoiding me for some reason?

499
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,447
No...

500
00:42:57,699 --> 00:43:00,117
It would be awkward if someone saw us.

501
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,120
I understand.

502
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:09,210
I don't want to get
more serious than this.

503
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,008
Have you finally been able to
overwrite the memories of heartbreak?

504
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:18,719
Huh?

505
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,346
How is it now?

506
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,389
Well...

507
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,558
Well, that's...

508
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,201
Hurry up and overwrite them using me.

509
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,361
Maybe I'm being a bother?

510
00:43:36,738 --> 00:43:37,571
Huh?

511
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,161
Sorry, I have to go.

512
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:58,801
I heard Hanasaki-san is planning
to confess to Chigichigi soon.

513
00:44:00,053 --> 00:44:01,387
Eh? Really?

514
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,265
Well, it can't be helped since it's Hanasaki-san.

515
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:06,642
Yeah, they're a good match.

516
00:44:08,478 --> 00:44:10,146
Huh, where do you think she'll confess?

517
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,772
Maybe on the rooftop?

518
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,863
Maya, let's go to the chemistry lab.

519
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,781
Yeah, let's go.

520
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,062
I wonder why..

521
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,274
I don't want to cry, but I can't stop.

522
00:45:00,238 --> 00:45:04,283
I didn't feel like this
when it was Yamada-kun...

523
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,298
That means how much you love...

524
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,551
that person...

525
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,642
But...

526
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,397
If I admit my feelings...

527
00:45:40,153 --> 00:45:41,946
it will all be over.

528
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,492
-Did you have dinner?
-Yes, I did.
-Understood. I'll be working late again tonight. I'm sorry.

529
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:54,560
It's too painful to stop liking
someone you once loved.

530
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,692
If I have to go through such feelings,

531
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,526
I'd rather have unrequited
love for the rest of my life.

532
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,781
I don't need mutual love or a boyfriend.

533
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,009
Here are the three books.

534
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,892
Good work.

535
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,892
Good work.

536
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,230
Are you avoiding me after all?

537
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,817
I'm not avoiding you, I promise!

538
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,490
Don't we all become rational
stalkers when we're in love?

539
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,993
This is definitely not stalking.

540
00:47:54,412 --> 00:47:56,330
Try to find me more seriously.

541
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,627
Sui!

542
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,678
Come to the rooftop when you're done,

543
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,712
there's something I want to talk about.

544
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,181
I'll be waiting.

545
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:15,516
Okay.

546
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,576
Maya.

547
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,560
If you want to stop this
one-sided love game, just tell me.

548
00:48:37,038 --> 00:48:37,871
Huh?

549
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,048
You look good together with Hanasaki-san.

550
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,835
I support both of you.

551
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,259
Are you okay?

552
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,221
Yeah, it's fine. I'll go wash up a bit.

553
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,109
I'll wash it.

554
00:49:07,193 --> 00:49:07,944
It's fine, it's fine!

555
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,653
Chigira-kun, you can go back.

556
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,907
Are you okay?

557
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,693
I'm okay, I'm okay!

558
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,006
Wear mine.

559
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,512
If you don't, I'll have
you wear it by force.

560
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,146
What am I doing?

561
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,151
Miss Wizard!

562
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,649
What's with that outfit?

563
00:49:56,117 --> 00:49:58,452
Um, this is...

564
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,798
Is this blazer Chigira's?

565
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,851
Miss Wizard, do you
like Chigira after all?

566
00:50:24,729 --> 00:50:26,271
N-No way!

567
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,483
Chigira-kun is someone
from above the clouds,

568
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,360
he lives in a different world.

569
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,095
But only Chigira-kun...

570
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,909
I will absolutely not
fall for Chigira-kun.

571
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:47,710
Wait, Miss Wizard, there's
something I need to talk about.

572
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:48,919
Don't touch her..

573
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,760
Chigira-kun?

574
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,224
What kind of relationship do you two have?

575
00:51:02,308 --> 00:51:04,018
You're not dating. Right?

576
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,894
It's none of your business.

577
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,201
I don't understand.

578
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,669
Chigira-kun!

579
00:51:34,048 --> 00:51:35,675
Hanasaki-san is waiting.

580
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,342
Yeah, I got it.

581
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:51,815
Thank you.

582
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,829
That's right.

583
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,839
Unrequited love isn't just fun.

584
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:26,433
[I washed it.]

585
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,686
It's painful.

586
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:50,415
Hmm, it's a relationship you
can't talk about with others?

587
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,018
What are you talking about?

588
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,352
I've liked you for a long time.

589
00:53:12,897 --> 00:53:14,523
Go out with me.

590
00:53:19,737 --> 00:53:23,407
What is this one-sided
love game? It's stupid.

591
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,954
Aren't you just being played by Chigira?

592
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:33,500
Chigira-kun is just trying to
cheer me up after my heartbreak.

593
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:37,671
Please, Tezuka-kun, don't
tell anyone else about this.

594
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:40,340
It would bother Chigira-kun too much.

595
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,968
If your goal is to heal from heartbreak,

596
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,167
So it doesn't matter
if the other person in

597
00:53:45,251 --> 00:53:47,301
this "pretend game"
is not Chigira, right?

598
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:49,975
Huh?

599
00:54:02,488 --> 00:54:03,655
Miss Wizard...

600
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,758
Play the one-sided love game with me.

601
00:54:12,957 --> 00:54:14,791
Why would you say that?

602
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:16,710
That's...

603
00:54:16,794 --> 00:54:18,795
Are you making fun of me?

604
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,138
Anyway,

605
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,600
please keep this a secret.

606
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,104
I beg you.

607
00:54:54,832 --> 00:54:56,458
It's because I like you!

608
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,714
I don't want to see you looking so sad.

609
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,844
Even if you do this with Chigira,

610
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:09,028
the one who will get
hurt is you, isn't it?

611
00:55:13,851 --> 00:55:15,143
I'm...

612
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,689
genuinely worried about you.

613
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,699
I'm sorry.

614
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,234
What? A consultation?

615
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,446
Um...

616
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,490
About that...

617
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:11,908
About Chigira?

618
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,494
Huh?

619
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:17,122
So, Maya's crush is really Chigira, huh?

620
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,874
Chika-chan...

621
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:20,960
Are you Psychic?

622
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,754
No, no, it's obvious!

623
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,340
Is that what you wanted to talk about?

624
00:56:26,507 --> 00:56:28,509
No, it's just that...

625
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,386
Something unexpected happened,

626
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,570
and I feel like my
head's going to explode.

627
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,431
I don't really understand,

628
00:56:34,515 --> 00:56:37,142
but why does it have to
be Chigira of all people?

629
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,728
This is going to stir up Tezuka again.

630
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,732
What do you mean?

631
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:52,991
Hey, did something happen between
Chigira-kun and Tezuka-kun in the past?

632
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,537
Chika-chan, weren't you in the
same middle school as them?

633
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,666
Please tell me.

634
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,508
Those two...

635
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:12,803
I recruited Chigira Sui-kun
from the soccer team!

636
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:18,475
He was so persistent, I
had no choice but to transfer.

637
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,143
Come on, stop it.

638
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:24,481
With him, our track and
field team is the strongest.

639
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,153
What's the matter?

640
00:57:38,704 --> 00:57:40,831
At first, they really got along well.

641
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:43,417
But...

642
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:51,508
Chigira quickly surpassed Tezuka's time.

643
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,805
What do you mean, you're quitting?

644
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,859
Shut up, it doesn't matter.

645
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:09,568
Wait a minute.

646
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,027
Don't touch me!

647
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:15,074
Always acting calm and handling everything skillfully...

648
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,785
Always acting calm and
handling everything skillfully...

649
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,370
When I look at your face, it irritates me.

650
00:58:34,635 --> 00:58:36,785
I think he must have
been really frustrated.

651
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,182
For him...

652
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,477
all he had was track and field.

653
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,457
So, you were running since morning?

654
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,251
Impressive how you keep
doing it without getting tired.

655
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,928
Yesterday, I hugged Maya Kisaragi.

656
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,988
Sorry, my legs are long.

657
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,866
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

658
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,494
Don't get close to Maya.

659
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,331
You too, what's with
that one-sided love game?

660
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,251
It's just nonsense,
are you kindergartners?

661
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,586
It's none of your business.

662
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,962
It does concern me!

663
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:56,341
If you hurt her, I won't
forgive you, seriously.

664
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:57,759
Same goes for you.

665
00:59:57,843 --> 01:00:00,053
If you hurt Maya, I won't forgive you.

666
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:27,038
What happened between
Tezuka and you yesterday?

667
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:34,504
Is it true that Tezuka hugged you?

668
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,049
Well, um...

669
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,302
I wonder how it was...

670
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,441
Chigira-kun?

671
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:07,662
Disinfection.

672
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:11,333
Don't let any other guy touch you.

673
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,518
Regarding Hanasaki-san,

674
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,648
I don't plan on dating anyone right now.

675
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:36,900
Because I have Maya.

676
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:45,033
I don't want to end this
one-sided love game

677
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:49,913
until Maya's wounds are properly healed.

678
01:01:57,421 --> 01:01:59,255
One-sided love game...

679
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,058
What if...

680
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:17,690
What if I say the wounds have been healed?

681
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,192
Huh?

682
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,321
The game will be over.

683
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:27,158
We're just going back to
how things were, nothing more.

684
01:02:28,702 --> 01:02:30,453
The hug from earlier,

685
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,372
also the kiss,

686
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,708
it was all just a "game."

687
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,712
It wasn't real.

688
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,297
Maya?

689
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:49,097
And yet, I find myself
elated and then depressed.

690
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:54,686
Being with you right now, Chigira-kun...

691
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,856
is painful.

692
01:03:12,037 --> 01:03:15,540
I'm sorry. What am I saying?

693
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,922
Huh! Hey, isn't that Chigichigi?

694
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:24,466
Huh? Oh, really!

695
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,053
Maya!

696
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,224
Maya!

697
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,348
Chigira-kun?

698
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,727
Chigira-kun.

699
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:20,188
Chigira-kun!

700
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,537
Maya!

701
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,373
Chika-chan...

702
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,792
How's Chigira?!

703
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,835
He's in the Treatment Room.

704
01:04:45,005 --> 01:04:47,006
He might have sprained his ligament.

705
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,092
Huh?

706
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,430
It's my fault.

707
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,937
In truth. I have overwritten
my feelings already.

708
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:09,821
But I wanted to be with Chigira-kun,

709
01:05:13,158 --> 01:05:14,868
so I relied on his kindness,

710
01:05:17,746 --> 01:05:20,081
and hid my true feelings.

711
01:05:23,919 --> 01:05:25,962
So I guess I'm being punished...

712
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:16,721
Huh? Is Chigichigi's injury that bad?

713
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,431
It depends on his rehabilitation. But..

714
01:06:18,515 --> 01:06:20,965
He probably won't make it
to the Kanto Tournament.

715
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,727
Eh, seriously?

716
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:25,188
Sui practiced so hard.

717
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:26,982
It's true, right?

718
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,859
Eh, seriously... I
wonder if he'll be okay.

719
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,318
What a disaster...

720
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:55,862
I'll open it a bit more, okay?

721
01:08:16,216 --> 01:08:18,426
Put more effort into it, more power.

722
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,057
Let's do one more round..

723
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,099
Yes.

724
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:34,692
Okay!

725
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:16,901
Okay, here it goes.

726
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,320
Ouch...

727
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,993
It hurts...

728
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:31,499
Tezuka-kun...

729
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,060
You were doing a hundred-day
pilgrimage for Chigira-kun's sake?

730
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:40,091
Even if you don't do that,
he'll come back soon anyway.

731
01:09:40,425 --> 01:09:41,875
That's the kind of guy he is.

732
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,848
Tezuka, about the other day...

733
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,975
Ah, it's okay, forget about that story.

734
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:53,527
Anyway, you're probably thinking
about Chigichigi right now, aren't you?

735
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:59,402
Tezuka-kun, do you dislike Chigira-kun?

736
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,988
Huh? Why are you suddenly asking?

737
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:05,533
Sorry, I heard it from Chika-chan.

738
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:06,909
Well...

739
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:09,370
About track and field...

740
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:11,831
That girl.

741
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:17,461
It's just like an
unrequited love, isn't it?

742
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:19,714
Huh?

743
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,593
The feeling of chasing something
that you can never reach,

744
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:25,386
no matter how hard you try.

745
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,488
I understand that too.

746
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,602
The feeling of being hurt.

747
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:35,230
Hating everything.

748
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:36,814
And wanting to give up.

749
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:44,280
But if you really hate it,

750
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,190
I don't think you would chase after it.

751
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,243
Tezuka-kun,

752
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:52,246
you really like Chigira-kun, don't you?

753
01:11:14,811 --> 01:11:17,355
As expected of Miss
Wizard, you are the best.

754
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:20,942
I like Chigira-kun...

755
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:40,419
Tezuka-kun?

756
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:54,558
Miss Wizard, what will you do from now on?

757
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:08,447
As for me...

758
01:12:21,431 --> 01:12:23,081
-I had fun too.
-I'll take good care of the keychain!

759
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:25,118
-Yeah.
-Sorry.
-It's not your fault, Maya.

760
01:12:34,426 --> 01:12:38,599
[I want to see you.]

761
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:44,816
Being with you right now, Chigira-kun...

762
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:47,862
is painful.

763
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:19,852
Maya...

764
01:13:28,111 --> 01:13:31,280
I was worried because
you didn't contact much.

765
01:13:31,948 --> 01:13:32,990
I'm sorry.

766
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:36,160
How are your injuries?

767
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,204
It's recovering smoothly.

768
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:42,166
That's why I decided to
participate in the tournament.

769
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:43,751
Huh?

770
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:45,544
Is it okay?

771
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:46,754
It's okay.

772
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:50,508
So, Maya, you don't have to worry anymore.

773
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,635
The tournament

774
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,520
I want you to come and cheer for me.

775
01:14:03,271 --> 01:14:06,524
You're always kind, Chigira-kun.

776
01:14:09,861 --> 01:14:13,739
You suddenly appeared when I was down,

777
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:16,450
and said the words I  need the most.

778
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:26,335
But let's put an end to this
one-sided love game, okay?

779
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:28,129
Huh?

780
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:32,550
Thanks to you, Chigira-kun,

781
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,034
the pain of my heartbreak
is completely gone now!

782
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:02,580
I'm sorry I said it was painful!

783
01:15:06,042 --> 01:15:07,293
I had fun.

784
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:10,754
It was the best time ever.

785
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:16,802
Are you really okay now?

786
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,484
Yes, I'm really fine now.

787
01:16:15,111 --> 01:16:16,695
Thank you for today.

788
01:16:19,991 --> 01:16:21,116
Well then.

789
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:29,625
Maya...

790
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:33,921
Good luck in the tournament.

791
01:17:38,778 --> 01:17:39,987
Why...

792
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,797
The reason Chigira-kun
become so fond of track and field.

793
01:17:52,792 --> 01:17:54,960
Maybe it's because of your influence.

794
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:56,253
Huh?

795
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:58,505
Maya mentioned that.

796
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,134
"To love the things your beloved loves."

797
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:06,545
Isn't it just the way things are
in the world of unrequited love?

798
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:47,554
I wonder if Chigichigi can win?

799
01:18:48,264 --> 01:18:50,140
He didn't practice enough.

800
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,435
It's okay, I'm here for him.

801
01:18:56,773 --> 01:18:59,483
Are you making that "Didn't
you just got dumped?" face?

802
01:18:59,692 --> 01:19:03,320
I've decided I'm going to
be Sui's number one fan!

803
01:19:06,282 --> 01:19:07,491
That's great.

804
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:10,703
Hold on a second.

805
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:11,579
What do you mean?

806
01:19:11,663 --> 01:19:13,122
It's Chigichigi, this is bad.

807
01:19:13,456 --> 01:19:15,708
I can't believe it... this is the worst!

808
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:17,668
Hey, check this out.

809
01:19:18,878 --> 01:19:20,003
This is really bad.

810
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:21,672
Chigira?

811
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:25,592
This is terrible...

812
01:19:26,302 --> 01:19:27,219
What's going on?

813
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:33,726
This...

814
01:19:41,192 --> 01:19:43,402
May Chigira-kun win.

815
01:20:06,883 --> 01:20:08,945
[-I saw the photo!
-Maya~!? What's going on?
-It's being shared all over the place!

816
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:10,820
-What's your relationship with Chigichigi?
-You need to explain yourself!!!]

817
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:19,596
Why with such an ugly girl!!!

818
01:20:37,344 --> 01:20:39,961
[-Seriously unbelievable! Why with such an ugly girl!!!
-Wait, that's so tasteless. Think about Chigichigi.
-Eww, disgusting. Living hurts so much LOL]

819
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,175
[-Seriously pissed off right now. Self-absorbed woman. Chigichigi is out of his mind.
-Huh? Who is this woman?]

820
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:46,897
[-Isn't she cocky? Don't get too big for your britches!
-Ugh, I don't even fee like supporting him anymore.
-Why is there a plain girl next to Chigira-kun?]

821
01:20:46,982 --> 01:20:48,551
[-Huh? Who is this girl?
-Chigichigi, I hate it. Sobs.
-This girl is so creepy.]

822
01:20:58,358 --> 01:21:00,854
It's that girl! The one who ambushed me.

823
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,314
That ugly one!

824
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:23,710
I'm sorry.

825
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:27,422
I'm sorry.

826
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:30,467
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

827
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,010
I'm sorry.

828
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:54,157
[Tezuka Soma]

829
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:05,335
Hello.

830
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,979
Hello, Miss Wizard?
What are you doing now?

831
01:22:10,466 --> 01:22:11,800
What do you mean...

832
01:22:13,052 --> 01:22:15,053
What should we do, Tezuka-kun?

833
01:22:16,347 --> 01:22:18,974
Because of me, even Chigira-kun...

834
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:21,476
Calm down.

835
01:22:22,478 --> 01:22:26,148
He's just calmly warming up as usual.

836
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:28,066
Huh?

837
01:22:28,818 --> 01:22:30,485
He's an idiot.

838
01:22:30,987 --> 01:22:35,198
Even if he participates, he's
far from his best, he can't win.

839
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:38,359
He'll just embarrass
himself in front of everyone.

840
01:22:41,497 --> 01:22:44,541
But he's determined to run.

841
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,642
Have you ever wanted to quit, Chigira-kun?

842
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,937
No, not once.

843
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:48,438
Why?

844
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:52,150
Because I love running.

845
01:24:21,264 --> 01:24:25,559
The Men's 100m final will be held shortly.

846
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:32,607
Here are the competitors
for the Men's 100m final!

847
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:19,404
Chigira-kun! Do your best!

848
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:26,829
Isn't that the girl from
the picture earlier?

849
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:28,763
Seriously, who does she think she is?

850
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:31,000
Huh? She's ugly, isn't she?

851
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:32,292
Isn't she creepy?

852
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:35,713
Why is she even here? I can't believe it.

853
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:36,922
What is she trying to show off?

854
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,706
What's up with her and Chigichigi?

855
01:25:48,392 --> 01:25:50,352
I don't want to give up,

856
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:52,854
these feelings that I have.

857
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:04,157
Chigira-kun! Fight!

858
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:38,817
Do your best, Sui!

859
01:26:42,029 --> 01:26:44,948
Chigichigi! Do your best!

860
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:55,917
Hang in there!

861
01:26:56,419 --> 01:26:58,545
Chigira-kun!

862
01:26:59,213 --> 01:27:01,006
Do your best!

863
01:27:22,528 --> 01:27:23,445
Set.

864
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:11,928
Where's Maya?

865
01:29:12,596 --> 01:29:13,764
She went home already.

866
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,056
Thank you.

867
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:20,770
Sorry.

868
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:23,106
Yeah.

869
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:34,993
Even though he lost
miserably in the tournament,

870
01:29:35,077 --> 01:29:37,245
he really loves running, huh?

871
01:29:37,788 --> 01:29:39,372
Aren't you the same?

872
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:58,850
When people fall in love, they all
become rational stalkers, you know?

873
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:09,110
To love the things your beloved loves.

874
01:30:09,862 --> 01:30:12,447
Running is something Chigira-kun loves.

875
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:14,449
I want to love it too.

876
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,917
Yeah, thank you.

877
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:31,383
The hug from earlier,

878
01:30:32,176 --> 01:30:33,259
also the kiss,

879
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,721
it was all just a "game".

880
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:39,682
It wasn't real.

881
01:30:57,868 --> 01:30:59,661
You looked cool.

882
01:31:40,035 --> 01:31:41,327
I found you.

883
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:43,288
Chigira-kun.

884
01:31:44,915 --> 01:31:45,999
Why?

885
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:50,086
One-sided love Mission

886
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:52,088
I...

887
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:55,049
Because I'm your stalker, Maya.

888
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:57,635
But...

889
01:31:58,804 --> 01:32:02,056
I thought we had already
ended this one-sided love game.

890
01:32:07,438 --> 01:32:09,272
I continued it alone.

891
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:12,859
Eh?

892
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:18,406
I was afraid that my feelings
for you would eventually go away.

893
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:21,201
That's why,

894
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:25,788
I understood the feeling when you
said you didn't want a relationship.

895
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:29,959
I hoped I could be a bit
of healing for your wounds.

896
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:34,047
But...

897
01:32:35,299 --> 01:32:36,382
looking back now...

898
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:54,692
So delicious.

899
01:33:17,967 --> 01:33:19,885
I have always had

900
01:33:19,969 --> 01:33:22,262
unrequited feelings for Maya

901
01:33:22,346 --> 01:33:24,046
who also have unrequited feelings.

902
01:33:34,441 --> 01:33:36,234
Spending time with you,

903
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:40,446
I experienced the joys and
pains of unrequited love,

904
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:44,198
and got to know the loneliness
of not being able to meet you.

905
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:47,704
Now, more than anything,

906
01:33:48,372 --> 01:33:50,172
I hate that I can't be by your side.

907
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:55,420
You taught me what it's like

908
01:33:56,672 --> 01:33:58,673
to love someone this much, Maya.

909
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:03,177
Chigira-kun...

910
01:34:10,352 --> 01:34:13,021
I love you, Maya.

911
01:34:18,902 --> 01:34:20,028
From now on,

912
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,905
not just pretend,

913
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:25,158
I want to

914
01:34:26,577 --> 01:34:28,411
have a real relationship with you.

915
01:34:31,081 --> 01:34:32,957
Please be my girlfriend.

916
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:43,217
Yes.

917
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,013
I love you too,

918
01:34:47,931 --> 01:34:49,307
Chigira-kun.

919
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:57,815
My feelings have been
completely overwritten.

920
01:35:09,453 --> 01:35:10,912
I love you so much.

921
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:41,943
Tell me more about your love.

922
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:44,195
Let me hear it more

923
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:47,824
A uniting love story

924
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:52,287
When our unrequited loves connect,

925
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:55,624
Starting, from here,

926
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:59,544
it's our own special love

927
01:35:59,628 --> 01:36:01,671
Everlasting Love Just for you

928
01:36:01,755 --> 01:36:04,006
You're the only one My special

929
01:36:06,218 --> 01:36:10,555
You're the only one My special

930
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:13,015
You're the only one My special

931
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:21,774
The beginnings are
always unexpectedly sudden

932
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:25,695
I can't hide the beating of my heart

933
01:36:25,779 --> 01:36:27,864
No matter what (kind of love),

934
01:36:28,073 --> 01:36:30,116
we'll overcome it all

935
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:33,286
And move forward by overwriting it

936
01:36:33,412 --> 01:36:36,748
Your smile (yes, next to you)

937
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:41,294
Imagining I have it all
to myself (thinking of you)

938
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:43,880
I can't stop it

939
01:36:44,047 --> 01:36:48,176
Even if it's unrequited, it's not a lie

940
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,928
My overflowing feelings, I love you

941
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:55,349
Tell me more about your love,

942
01:36:55,434 --> 01:36:57,518
let me hear it more

943
01:36:57,644 --> 01:37:01,189
A uniting love story

944
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:05,485
Even the ordinary scenery,

945
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:09,864
becomes dear when you're next to me

946
01:37:09,948 --> 01:37:13,034
Let's embrace each other.

947
01:37:13,243 --> 01:37:17,955
Share kisses, and make promises

948
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:23,503
When we tightly connect the invisible red threads,

949
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:26,672
It starts here,

950
01:37:26,882 --> 01:37:30,510
it's our own special, love

951
01:37:30,594 --> 01:37:33,012
I don't want it to only be in my dreams

952
01:37:33,096 --> 01:37:35,098
Even when I wake up want you to always

953
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:39,602
Look and smile only at me, not someone else

954
01:37:39,686 --> 01:37:43,690
Today, I'll definitely tell you

955
01:37:43,774 --> 01:37:50,738
my honest feelings

956
01:37:51,114 --> 01:37:55,326
Tell me more about your love,

957
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,704
let me hear it more

958
01:37:57,788 --> 01:38:01,040
A weaving love story

959
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:05,712
Things we want to cry and painful things,

960
01:38:05,796 --> 01:38:10,132
we can definitely overcome them

961
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:14,220
Let's rewrite everything

962
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:17,557
Let's embrace each other,

963
01:38:17,766 --> 01:38:22,437
share kisses, and make promises

964
01:38:22,521 --> 01:38:27,859
When we tightly connect
the invisible red threads,

965
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:31,195
It starts here,

966
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:35,158
it's our own special kiss.

967
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:37,285
Everlasting Love Just for you

968
01:38:37,452 --> 01:38:39,787
You're the only one My special

969
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:46,294
Everlasting Love Just for you

970
01:38:46,378 --> 01:38:48,671
You're the only one My special
