Ma

25
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:36,328
You're home?

26
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:39,242
Ayi, I'm Yue Yue.
(Ayi = aunt)

27
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:42,058
Yue Yue?

28
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:43,090
Please sit

29
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:50,833
Ayi, you really look young and kind.

30
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,256
Thanks

31
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:54,104
Ah, thank you aunt.

32
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:56,311
My son, You pour your own drinks.

33
00:02:58,663 --> 00:03:01,919
Ayi, I came without bringing anything

34
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:08,330
We both buy skin care products.

35
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,234
Special to oil control.

36
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:13,033
It is suitable for people of your age.

37
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:17,081
Really ? Thank you.

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,288
Aunt, it doesn't matter.

39
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,135
You see this product ...

40
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,631
Use at night.

41
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:25,919
And these imported products.

42
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,431
It is suitable to control oily skin.

43
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:30,055
Is It True?

44
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:33,958
You do not need to rub it in you'r face
just polished it directly on oily areas.

45
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:37,038
The color of this dress looks very pretty.

46
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:40,612
Aiyoo, you know, the pink
color is suitable for white people.

47
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:44,646
Aunt, you're not black. You see,
your skin is covered with white snow.

48
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:48,083
I also have a friend, he
designed clothing imports

49
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,249
And also the material is better.

50
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:51,185
Cheaper than this.

51
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:52,588
Chi Cheng, he is very clever.

52
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:53,148
Thank you.

53
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:54,936
He's like his father.

54
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:56,319
Is it true?

55
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:03,567
You see, he was shy.

56
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:09,439
Yue Yue

57
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:11,670
Let's go home.

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,296
My child..

59
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,862
Wait a minute ....
There is something else...

60
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,599
Aunt, I go home.

61
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:21,175
My son, this girl is good.
A good woman.

62
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:35,195
Drink your medicine twice a day.
Then, drink plenty of water.

63
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:36,369
Your illness is not too bad.

64
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,950
Useless to you to see me like that.

65
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:53,581
I really don't know where he went.

66
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:02,268
11.

67
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,236

68
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:21,042
You said..If I start
now. before your head ...

69
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:24,569
He ... he went home.

70
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:40,042
OMG.

71
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:43,686
Men with men, how can it be like this?

72
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,165
It's too horrible ...

73
00:05:58,002 --> 00:06:02,946
Aunt, asked permission passengers,
Is this Wu Suo Wei home?

74
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:06,487
Ah, he is my son.
And you...?

75
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:07,671
I'm his co-worker.

76
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,280
Ah, please come in.

77
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:14,518
Through this way.

78
00:06:15,695 --> 00:06:17,693
Baby, your coworkers come to see you.

79
00:06:18,882 --> 00:06:19,514
Please come in.

80
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:24,585
Come on, come on. Please come in.

81
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:35,511
This, please drink first.

82
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:36,128
Sorry

83
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,803
I go to call Da wei first.

84
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:39,841
He was sick for one week.

85
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,338
Every day, he is just lying on the bed.

86
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:43,544
Didn't come out from
his room for a few days.

87
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:45,582
Ah, no need. no need.

88
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:46,448
Let me call him.

89
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:08,684
Why you are here?

90
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:10,468
To see you.

91
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:16,130
Your mother told me that
you're just lying every day.

92
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,839
I smell, odor or not?

93
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:23,504
Bad smells.

94
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:24,890
Impossible.

95
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:27,370
I take a bath every day.

96
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:47,982
Is your mother know, if
you're already resigned ?

97
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:49,333
Don't dare to tell her!

98
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,893
You're brave, let me kiss you.

99
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,117
I challenge you to go!

100
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,135
This, eat vegetables.

101
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,439
Ah aunt, It's okay, okay.

102
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,647
Our house is not too good to please you.

103
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:28,325
Aunt, no problem. You're really very good.

104
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:29,836
Take this again.
Thank you aunt.

105
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:35,596
Actually, sometimes, these
people looks very good.

106
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:40,032
Aunt, eating this meat.

107
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Aunt have diabetes, can't eat meat.

108
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,383
You add more.

109
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:47,510
Thank you aunt.

110
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:52,911
This, give you.

111
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,357
Your coworkers are very good.

112
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:02,044
Came to our house, it
was really good thing.

113
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:05,309
Da Wei

114
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:08,469
Don't hang out too much with that guy.

115
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:10,437
Why?

116
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:12,501
Don't you like him?

117
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,566
Of course i like him.

118
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,418
Just think ..

119
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,245
If you guys hang out together

120
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:18,893
Who is going to look at you ?

121
00:09:28,428 --> 00:09:28,971
You are home?

122
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,260
How's "your practice" ?

123
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,531
Good.

124
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:42,381
Where is "my son"? (Box contents which
sugar candy taken by Chi Cheng in ep 4)

125
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:43,434
Taken by him.

126
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:45,681
Why he take it?

127
00:09:45,905 --> 00:09:49,489
I've told him repeatedly
if you go back for sure you will get angry.

128
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:51,017
But he didn't care.

129
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:52,421
At least, leave me some.

130
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:12,691
Hey! Who told you to take "my son"?

131
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,434
Hey! Speak up!

132
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:21,402
What are you talking about?

133
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:25,346
You can't take it!

134
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,209
My girlfriend says,
you're sugar-candy is ugly.

135
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:31,248
I take it all so she could choose.

136
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:40,005
Teacher, give me nice
clothes to look handsome.

137
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,114
Tomorrow I will seduce him!

138
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:43,841
If I let him go again!
My family name isn't Wu!

139
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:16,097
Uh, you take this?

140
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,336
Who told you that's for you? And also...

141
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:29,071
Eat.

142
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:30,145
No.

143
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:33,190
Eat this and we go.

144
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:50,873
Hello?

145
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,290

146
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,875
Not busy.

147
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,832

148
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,616
Ouch .. I don't know why my head is hurt?

149
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:03,917
Ouch hurt, hurt... hurt ..

150
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:04,781
Aw, how can this be?

151
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:40,434
Don't lift your shirt!

152
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:44,944
I said dont lift your shirt!

153
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,087

154
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:48,976
You are hot, ha?

155
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:53,856
Because you're hot.

156
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,375
Let me cool you off!

157
00:12:57,752 --> 00:12:58,447
Don't touch me!

158
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:02,631
You repeatedly come to me!

159
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:04,389
When I want to do
you always don't let me touch you!

160
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:06,470
What games are you doing?

161
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,978
You are not my boyfriend

162
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:08,245
How can I let you to touch me?

163
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:16,050

164
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:17,723
Let's go there.

165
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:19,002
Don't want.

166
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,170
You don't break up with her.
I don't want to go.

167
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:27,442
Good.

168
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:33,362
People who are in love, is really ...

169
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:36,401
....

170
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:38,114
Yue Yue must have been blind!

171
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,855
No! You guys are equally blind.

172
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,400
Hello?

173
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,027
Are you sleeping already?

174
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:02,944
Getting ready to sleep. You?

175
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,393
We're getting ready to "make love"

176
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:08,167
You!
You give me the sex phone?

177
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:09,846
I want you to give me cheer.

178
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:13,044
Good! Doesn't matter!

179
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,349
You, listen carefully!

180
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:18,271
Your boyfriend is not a good person

181
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:20,902
...

182
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,701
...

183
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:24,435
...

184
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:34,227
What are you doing here?

185
00:16:47,762 --> 00:16:51,169
When did you buy this car?
How much?

186
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,584
Last year, more than 1 million yuan

187
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:56,830
Sell it to me for 700 thousand ?

188
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,990
I can sell you.

189
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:08,023
I'll take you home.

190
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:12,573
No need, I go home on foot.

191
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,523
I will pick my girlfriend.

192
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:15,833
Go into the car.

193
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,582
You are something.

194
00:17:20,228 --> 00:17:21,765
I'm thirsty.

195
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:24,076
Maybe, go to your house for a quick drink.

196
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,760
It is true that you are a donkey.

197
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:06,147
I can't take "your name".

198
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,323
So why am I the donkey?

199
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:13,427
Your "x" like a donkey.

200
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,570
I'm hungry.

201
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:27,273
What do you want?
I would buy food outside.

202
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,034
This year, I went to three supermarkets.

203
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:06,585
First, because seeing someone wearing tattered clothes?

204
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,968
Secondly, when I come to your house.

205
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:12,513
While the other is past.

206
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:16,730
I didn't hear anything.

207
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,923
Didn't hear anything.

208
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,818
Let me do it.

209
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:58,652
What do you say?

210
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:00,614
After all, you have a lot to do it with others.

211
00:20:00,614 --> 00:20:01,679
I'm not bad.

212
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:03,653
I've never been with a man.

213
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:04,910
Make me become addicted.
