1
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:37,443
Your eyes are the sunshine of blue sky
Ni de yanjing shi qingkong de taiyin

2
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:45,540
Your smile is the aurora of the universe
Ni de xiao rou shi yuzhou de jiguang

3
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,522
Sweet like candies, hard like weapons
Tian de xiang tang, lie de xiang cang

4
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:54,107
Live in heart, die in heart
Huo zai yan li si zaixin shang

5
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:59,058
But will never let it go
Que buneng fang

6
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:04,741
Your dimples are the shadows of sunset
Ni de jiuwo shi yingzhao de yuhui

7
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:12,436
Your singing is the perfectly perfect
Ni de gesheng shi zhenshi de wanmei

8
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:14,965
Who is hurt
Shang de shi shui

9
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:16,855
Who is in pain
teng de shi shui

10
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:18,709
Wild in dreams
Mengle dian kuang

11
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,989
Drunk during the day
Xingle mizui

12
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:26,485
But no regrets
Que wu wu yuan hui

13
00:01:26,868 --> 00:01:29,724
They have their own reasons
Tamen you Tamen de Daoli

14
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:34,004
We have our own temperaments
Women you women de piqi

15
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:38,444
Even if the world is full of hostility
Napa shijie chongmanle Diyi

16
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:40,395
I'll still love you
Wo yiran ai ni

17
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:43,484
They have their own reasons
Tamen you tamen de daoli

18
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:48,590
We have our own temperaments
Women you women de piqi

19
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,082
Even if the world is full of hostility
Napa shijie chongmanle diyi

20
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:59,733
I still dare, to love you
Wo yiran haishi yonggan ai ni

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,723
I still dare, to love you
Wo yiran haishi yonggan ai ni

22
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,120
Episode 2

23
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,280
Chi Cheng!

24
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,270
Why are you here?

25
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,260
What about you?

26
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,580
Oh, I was going for a walk near here.

27
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,499
Who were you talking to earlier?

28
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,680
None of your business!

29
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,630
Then, let's have lunch!

30
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,020
Are you home already?

31
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,900
What's wrong ?

32
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,900
Are you alright?

33
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,510
What happened?

34
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,510
Hey, I'm talking to you!

35
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,129
Are you crying? Are you having a problem?

36
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,660
At least say something!

37
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,680
I'm fine!

38
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,370
Doctor Jiang! Doctor Jiang!

39
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,360
Doctor Jiang, our brother injured his arm!

40
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,700
Can you treat it?

41
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,700
Where is he?

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,580
Do you hear me, Doctor Jiang?

43
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,870
Are you going to treat it
without checking his wound first?

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,420
This is the price for his blood.

45
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,420
You're not going to turn it down, right?

46
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,880
Go inside and wait there.

47
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,400
I told you.

48
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,010
Who would refuse money these days?

49
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Take off your pants!

50
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,210
Turn around!

51
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,640
They're already doing "it" so quickly?

52
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,280
If I'm not mistaken,

53
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,380
... It's the voice of prince Guo.

54
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:20,960
Yes.

55
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,420
I understand.

56
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,249
Guo Zi!

57
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,859
Ma Er is looking for you!

58
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,440
He says it's urgent!

59
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:54,859
Wait!

60
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,270
Take this.

61
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,680
How long have you been standing there?

62
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,970
Why did you do it?

63
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,570
He likes you, doesn't he?

64
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:34,105
He comes here all the time for check ups.

65
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:36,100
That's because he
wants to seduce you, right?

66
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:37,050
The wound on his arm,

67
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,440
... It was intentional, right?

68
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,811
No, you're wrong. He and I ..

69
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:44,974
Please teach me.

70
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:47,044
Teach you what?

71
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,218
Teach me how to attract guys!

72
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:51,180
Attract guys?!?

73
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,839
Yue Yue and I

74
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,006
... Had known each other since college.

75
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,232
That's the story ..

76
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:05,874
She's gone too far!

77
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,428
I thought, if I were to get hurt

78
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:10,007
The both of us.

79
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:12,439
It will change Yue Yue's mind,
but changing her feelings is difficult.

80
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,564
Even if I lose everything,
she won't feel a thing.

81
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,434
And she'll just find someone else.

82
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,846
But if I date him, it will be different!

83
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:19,930
Don't you think ..

84
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:21,207
Yue Yue would get angry?

85
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:23,823
If I had an affair with him,
Yue Yue will feel uncomfortable, right?

86
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:24,590
And ...

87
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:25,260
Wait!

88
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:28,251
Don't you think...
chasing him will be more difficult

89
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:30,573
than changing Yue Yue's feelings?

90
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,960
Who said I was pursuing him?

91
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:35,390
I just want to lure him.

92
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:36,588
So he'll be chasing me instead.

93
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:40,380
Wow, mate! You're unbelievable!

94
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:41,850
Are you a god?

95
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:42,894
What would you think

96
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,406
if one day he acts like Guo?

97
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:46,553
Just because he wanted to get to know me

98
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:48,150
he paid with his blood.
(Example: hurting himself)

99
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:49,538
I'll be hated for sure!

100
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:50,412
Mate,

101
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:51,656
You must be joking.

102
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,294
I'll finish up here so I can go home.

103
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:54,311
Xiao Shuai.

104
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:56,126
I'm not kidding.

105
00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:57,531
This is serious.

106
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:02,414
If you've never seen the girl you've loved
for 7 years kissing another man,

107
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,873
You wouldn't understand
what I'm going through, right now.

108
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:06,359
Do you...

109
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:09,545
know him?

110
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,150
I don't even know his name.

111
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:16,860
Then we need to learn about him in 2 weeks.

112
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:18,376
To find out all about him.

113
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:19,826
About his family,

114
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,621
His hobbies, experiences,
and his past relationships.

115
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:24,011
We have to find out everything
about him to understand him.

116
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:25,253
I understand.

117
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:29,885
I think your appearance won't be a problem.

118
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,969
Although a little unstable,
everything else is not a problem.

119
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:34,679
You need charisma.

120
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,910
To be honest, the impression
you leave on people is a bit chaotic.

121
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,068
You need to change that.

122
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,602
To something more suited
to the unique style of Wu Suo Wei!

123
00:10:46,084 --> 00:10:47,562
Unique style?

124
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:49,061
Listen carefully,

125
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:54,868
It will be more maximum
with these eyes!

126
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:12,675
From this picture...

127
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,571
This man has dark hair, sharp eyes,
wide hands and a long middle finger

128
00:11:17,072 --> 00:11:22,024
Which means he has a strong sexuality,
unlike most men

129
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,385
How do you feel?

130
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:27,488
Pretty good.

131
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:31,305
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, why are you asking?

132
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,007
I mean ...

133
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,351
He's a man who loves people arbitrarily

134
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,220
Anyone will do,
as long as they surrender to him.

135
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:40,442
Like, he wouldn't reject anyone.

136
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,820
If you want to attract his attention,

137
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,039
I think there is hope.

138
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,240
But after that it will be difficult.

139
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:48,658
Do you understand?

140
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,593
How should I say it?

141
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,802
If you want to be with him,

142
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,456
He will ask you to
fulfill his physical needs.

143
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,042
Can you handle that?

144
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:07,683
This is too...

145
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:10,366
Hard to say.

146
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:12,473
We've been studying him for a while now.

147
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:15,548
We have to take action now.

148
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,545
Stand here and wait for him.

149
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:20,553
You have to be careful!

150
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,917
Remember what I taught you.

151
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:24,922
Don't worry!

152
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,171
I'm going to push this cart

153
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,253
and you ...

154
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,352
go hide over there!

155
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,186
You go over there.

156
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:31,043
He'd take the main road.

157
00:12:31,044 --> 00:12:32,953
I will be there as well

158
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:33,040
He's here! He's here!
You go

159
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:34,887
Hide! Go!

160
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,313
Hurry!

161
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:14,077
Hard head
(Stupid people)

162
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:15,037
What did you just call me?

163
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:16,567
Hard head.

164
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:21,604
Do you have the ability to live happily?

165
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:25,959
You want things, but can't get them!?
How are you abilities?

166
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:28,300
If you're not going to help,
get out of my way!

167
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:29,534
Go away!

168
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:01,958
Did you see it clearly?

169
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:03,653
Very clear.

170
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:06,543
From what you've seen,
do you think I can suppress him?

171
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:09,250
Give it your all!

172
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:30,830
Say! What happened a few days ago?

173
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:31,639
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!?

174
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,023
Don't play dumb with me!

175
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:09,093
That day, when you
helped me push the cart ...

176
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,442
Thank you.

177
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:13,392
My boss needed the food
that was in that cart,

178
00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:14,884
Without you, I would've lost my job.

179
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,190
You spent two days playing here,

180
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,100
just so you can thank me?

181
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:21,451
I just wanted to thank you
as soon as possible.

182
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,611
But I would've thought twice
if I'd known you'd insult me like this!

183
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:25,610
You really don't deserve it!

184
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,228
How do you know I like dried peanuts?

185
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,294
Open it.

186
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:06,651
Oh, you're home?

187
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:12,216
What happened to your ass?

188
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:17,067
The two of you... so quickly?!

189
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,700
What do you think?

190
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,103
We were playing basketball
and he squeezed my ass

191
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:24,609
to force me to tell him
about what happened that time.

192
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:26,393
He shouldn't have done that!

193
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,028
There are many places
he could have grabbed.

194
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,044
Why did he choose there?!?

195
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:31,002
It doesn't make any sense!

196
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:33,079
You've only known each other for a while

197
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,899
and he's already doing this?

198
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:36,620
Teacher

199
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,296
Shouldn't you be happy for me?

200
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:42,420
Sit down. That needs treatment.

201
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:17,697
30 minutes later

202
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:25,506
Teacher, are you done?

203
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:33,326
I'm massaging it so your skin
can absorb the salve more quickly.

204
00:19:06,818 --> 00:19:08,031
You already thanked me.

205
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:08,918
Why come back?

206
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,303
Who said I came here to see you?

207
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,148
Why is this candy in my pocket?

208
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:24,230
Cand.. what candy?

209
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,139
Why did you give me
candy using that method?

210
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,600
Are you afraid of getting caught?

211
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,675
Fat ass.

212
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:44,669
My legs are shaking.
