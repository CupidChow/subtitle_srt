00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:24,799
Episode 7

2
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:20,215
Eh!

3
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:22,257
Do you know what I did last night?

4
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:23,090
What?

5
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:25,132
You didn't know?

6
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:27,007
How on earth would I know that?

7
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,957
You were already in the
clinic since I left last night

8
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,957
And you're still in the clinic
after I came this morning

9
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,332
What did you do? Obviously sleeping

10
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,999
Could it be all just an erotic dream?

11
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,374
Oh right!

12
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,540
There was a bag of food
on the table this morning.

13
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,207
Not sure who sent it here..

14
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:53,957
I'm in a bad mood today

15
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,374
Go back and rest earlier

16
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,374
I will bring you food early next morning

17
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,290
So that was not just a dream after all

18
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,124
Hey!

19
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,874
What are you thinking there?

20
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,165
I went to meet with Chi Cheng's sidekick

21
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,374
He said Chi Cheng had absolutely no idea

22
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,790
That Yue Yue and I
were once together before

23
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,540
And so?

24
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,832
So he is not picking on me
because of YueYue at all

25
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,499
It was all just a coincidence

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,290
Then you guys are just so fated to be!

27
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,374
More like ill-fated!

28
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,915
What are you going to do then?

29
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,165
Have you thought about calling it a quit?

30
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,165
Somewhat..

31
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,249
Oh right! Your phone was ringing

32
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,332
nonstop ever since last night

33
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,499
It's an unknown caller id
so I didn't pick it up

34
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:08,082
YueYue? Why would she be calling me?

35
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,874
Could it be that she knew?

36
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,207
Bloody slut you playing dumb with me?

37
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,540
I dare you to answer your Ladyship's call!

38
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,332
I wouldn't mind to know
who this shameless person is!

39
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,832
How dare you steal my man!

40
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,165
Hello?

41
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,832
A guy? Who are you?

42
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,999
Wu Suo Wei

43
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,332
Why is it you?

44
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,665
Who are you asking?

45
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,207
You are the one calling in

46
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,207
Have... have you been using
this phone number all along?

47
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,790
Do you share the same
number line with someone else?

48
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,540
Wu Suo Wei! You are so fucking shameless!

49
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,082
Who are you calling shameless?

50
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,165
No but.. Did you think my life is

51
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,249
too cosy that you're feeling unfair?

52
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,165
So you called my boyfriend on purpose?

53
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,874
I'm telling you this, Wu Suo Wei!

54
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,665
Cut out your craps with me!

55
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,624
I'm through with you for my entire life!

56
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,374
Just give up!

57
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,415
One more thing, let me tell you this

58
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,165
Don't you ever call my boyfriend again!

59
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,499
Don't you ever mention my name to his face!

60
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,082
If not I will get you for this!

61
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,749
As long as you don't mention my name

62
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,374
to his face, that'll do nicely

63
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:25,082
You're seriously thinking you're all that,
aren't you?

64
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,832
I feel that I would stain his ear myself
if I were mention your name to his face

65
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,832
I've thought it out

66
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,749
What have you thought out?

67
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,249
I'm gonna have to 'kill' her!

68
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:51,624
Hey!

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,415
How's your progress so far?

70
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,040
I've been busy these two days

71
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,707
Don't have the time to entertain him

72
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,707
He didn't initiate contact with you?

73
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:03,790
Yup! Ever since I came back
from his place the other time

74
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,165
we didn't contact each other at all

75
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,999
What did you guys do the
other time you went to his place?

76
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,374
He spill his guts out to me

77
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,957
It's all about his heartbreaks
from past relationships

78
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,957
Hey! Do you think if
there is a possibility that...

79
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,999
Being a powerful man as
he is, he revealed to you

80
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,957
his secrets that no one else knew about

81
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,124
So when he thought about it later

82
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,249
he could have felt embarrassed?

83
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,499
That's can't be...
does he know what shame is?

84
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,999
You can try calling him

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,415
OK

86
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:49,957
Hello?

87
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,332
Hello, what are you doing now?

88
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,415
Playing Mahjong

89
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,582
Playing at such late hour?

90
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,790
Are you talking seriously?
If not I'm hanging up

91
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:05,249
Yes! Didn't you tell me a
lot about your past that night?

92
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,415
I have thought it over
after I'm back and felt that..

93
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,457
What's the matter?

94
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,165
Nothing. He's been like
that for the past few days

95
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:22,249
I even have to keep my distance
when walking with him

96
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:27,874
If you guys had seen his face
it will scare the shit out of you!

97
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,040
Hello?

98
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,165
You fucking nailed it!

99
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,665
Haven't I told you that?

100
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,790
He's definitely embarrassed

101
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,040
He.. is quite interesting!

102
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,790
I am fully prepared for a prolonged battle

103
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,499
Chi Cheng is unlikely to break up

104
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,165
with Yue Yue from anytime soon

105
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,457
Why not? Because he has
developed feelings for Yue Yue?

106
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,207
He didn't

107
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,624
Then why?

108
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,415
Chi Cheng has once kept some snakes as pet

109
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,165
But they were locked up by his father

110
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,582
In order to ensure the safety of his pets

111
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,749
He has to obey
his father's order at all cost

112
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,790
Isn't the reason
his father locked them up is

113
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,124
because he was idling too much?

114
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,290
What does that have
to do with his girlfriend?

115
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,332
Furthermore, how can
Yue Yue be so superior?

116
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,832
How can she settle his father?

117
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,124
You're wrong

118
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,874
The lump in his father's
heart is not about his job

119
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,832
but his private life

120
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,707
His father tied him back because...

121
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,332
He toys with men

122
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,832
No wonder..

123
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,874
Hey! Do you think
if there is a possibility that...

124
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,040
He is willing to give up
those snakes for your sake?

125
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,874
Im.. Impossible

126
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,832
Snakes mean a tremendous thing to him

127
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,374
Our occasional teasing
with each other can never

128
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,790
move his heart away from the snakes

129
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:10,207
Then things will be quite difficult..

130
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:18,957
Dad, please drink tea

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,624
Mom, please drink tea

132
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,582
Son, bring Yue Yue over tomorrow noon

133
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,707
Let your (older) sister have a look

134
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,582
Yue Yue? Who’s that?

135
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,207
Your (younger) brother's girlfriend

136
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,499
That's hard.
He finally came to his senses...

137
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,290
Yue Yue

138
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,040
Come and help yourself to the food

139
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,165
Thank you Auntie

140
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:50,957
You too

141
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,082
Sister

142
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,832
Chi Cheng often talks
about you in our conversation

143
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,582
Does he?

144
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:07,082
Sister, how long will
you be staying home this time?

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,415
Depends

146
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,749
YueYue, have some of this

147
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,040
Auntie, come, you have some too

148
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,374
Dad, Mom. Please have some fruits

149
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,040
I shall say that, Dad and Mom...

150
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,499
Are you guys once bitten twice shy

151
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,999
It has already been 6 years since

152
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,457
the thing between my brother and Wang Shuo

153
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,499
He only took a bent once

154
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,582
Do you guys have to
get so anxious about it?

155
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,165
And nodding your head
to any woman that goes by?

156
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,499
Can you stop ruining your son's life?

157
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,582
We are encouraging him to fall in love

158
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,707
but we didn't talk about marriage

159
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:03,499
It's already good enough
that he can't find a girlfriend

160
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,832
Keeping himself busy with snakes all day

161
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,582
Who will be willing to stay with him?

162
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,457
That's right

163
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,707
I think this girl is not bad

164
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,332
Although she didn't
come from a well-off family

165
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,582
she seems quite
tactful and looks pretty

166
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,207
You see, there are quite a number of

167
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,790
girls from the noble families

168
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,874
But your brother is unwilling

169
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,874
It's not about family backgrounds

170
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,624
Well if she is a simple girl
it can't be helped

171
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,290
Just take a look at her avaricious face

172
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:35,165
It's only missing the line
"I'm going to prosper!"

173
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,499
That's nonsense

174
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,832
What can you tell from
just meeting her for the first time?

175
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,374
Awww we'll wait and see about that

176
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,040
I say.. You should at least
send Chi Cheng a gift too

177
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,290
Not really necessary

178
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,540
Why not?

179
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,499
This is not the first time
he is sending you a gift

180
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:01,999
Aright alright

181
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,415
I'll just take it as a return for his favor

182
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,415
I only have twenty thousand dollars
in hand right now

183
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,790
Twenty thousand dollars...
You can give him a watch

184
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:17,999
What did you say?

185
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,749
Spend all the twenty thousand
on the gift for him?

186
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,040
What will I feed on for the
upcoming two months then?

187
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,332
What if something comes up?

188
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,707
It's impossible not to have money in hand!

189
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,082
What are you getting so tensed up for?

190
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,749
As if it's like taking your life

191
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,124
I thought that money is your petty cash

192
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,874
Who knows your daily
allowance is included in it too

193
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,832
Eliminate this portion of money

194
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,999
and see how much remains you have

195
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:45,032
About five thousand dollars

196
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,824
Five thousand...
Probably you can give him a shirt?

197
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:49,157
We can put this into consideration

198
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:53,074
Oh! I just remembered something

199
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:54,824
It's my mother's birthday next month

200
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:55,990
I have to give her two thousand dollars

201
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,532
Then give him a pair of shoes

202
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:01,240
I still have two portions
I need to chip in money...

203
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,782
I need to keep
two thousand dollars at least

204
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:05,199
Then give him a razor

205
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,407
Oh right!

206
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:08,490
I promised you before that
I'll take you for a bath scrub

207
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:13,199
Oh! I got the wrong number!

208
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,615
It should be 740 dollars,
but I wrote it as 470 dollars

209
00:14:17,783 --> 00:14:18,699
How much are you left with?

210
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,532
Still left with about 260 dollars

211
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:24,532
But |I need a haircut as well

212
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:28,740
Why not I give him Buddhist prayer beads?

213
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:30,032
Look here buddy...

214
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:31,740
What have he been giving you all along?

215
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:33,032
You have the cheek to give him

216
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:34,282
something off-the-rack to fool him?

217
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:36,657
I also have given him
quite a number of things

218
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,282
What are those that you gave him?

219
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:39,365
Sugar coated figurines?

220
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:41,324
Two dollars for a large pot of caramel

221
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:43,199
can give you at least 200 of that

222
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,365
Cooked corn from your own paddy field?

223
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:47,365
Fifty dollars for a
large pot of hot & spicy soup

224
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:49,824
What did he give you?

225
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:51,324
Let's just take this
carton of cigarettes as an example

226
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:53,615
One carton is about thirty thousand dollars

227
00:14:53,616 --> 00:15:00,282
Why not I sell a box of cigarettes?

228
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:02,074
And buy him an ashtray!

229
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:04,949
I should fucking smash
you with my ashtray here!

230
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,990
Alright alright

231
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:07,990
I'll make a bank overdraft
of three hundred dollars

232
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,574
and buy him a belt, does that satisfy you?

233
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,574
Fine

234
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,907
What brings you here?

235
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,115
I'm asking you a question!

236
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:49,949
What brings you here?

237
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,699
Kinky play!

238
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,449
You better watch your mouth!

239
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,907
This is a civilized location

240
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:59,532
How did a civilized location
breed a little whore like you?

241
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:00,740
Who are calling a whore?

242
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:02,324
Don't you know it very well?

243
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:06,865
What are you doing?

244
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:10,324
Baldy! You fucking put me down!

245
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:11,990
I will count to three...

246
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:13,157
One...

247
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:14,199
Two...

248
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,032
Three!

249
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:22,865
Put me down now!

250
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:24,657
I have something for you

251
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:36,782
You're going to fool me with this shit?

252
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:38,949
Take it or leave it!

253
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,157
I will use it for my own

254
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:09,782
What did you do that for!

255
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,032
Testing it to see if it's good

256
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:15,115
Did I give you a belt to whip me with it?

257
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,740
I can multi-use it

258
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:18,949
If your butt feels itchy someday

259
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,740
I can whip you once or twice for fun

260
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:22,199
Pervert!

261
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:24,949
Tie it for me

262
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,865
Don't you have hands?

263
00:17:27,658 --> 00:17:29,365
Not as good as yours!

264
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:32,657
Move over!

265
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:40,032
Cut that out!

266
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,490
I'm not going to leave tonight

267
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:50,115
Why not?

268
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,074
You have already trapped me tightly

269
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,657
How do I leave?

270
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,240
Stop squeezing anymore

271
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:15,282
Can you fucking stop squeezing anymore?
