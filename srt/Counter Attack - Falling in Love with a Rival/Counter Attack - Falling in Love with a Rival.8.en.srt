00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,040
Episode 8

2
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,582
the other time that you
talked about starting

3
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,082
your own business, what do you plan to do?

4
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,040
I want to operate a LED
lighting fixture business

5
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,457
I graduated with a degree
in Electrical Engineering

6
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,915
And have been in contact with the
related field in a multinational company

7
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,874
Not bad, you can consider it

8
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,582
This Is the supplementary
card to my credit card

9
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,207
Just withdraw from it if you need money

10
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,457
I don't want that.
Just give your money to whoever you like.

11
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,207
The card is applied under your name

12
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,207
Who else can I give it to?

13
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,457
I'm not using It anyway. Just cancel it

14
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,957
With what will you commence your business
If you don't have the capital?

15
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,999
Use it if you need, if not just leave it!

16
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,915
Please take care of your own son!

17
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,707
Don't let him come harassing me!

18
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,374
I'm a straight man!

19
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,624
Please take care of your own son!

20
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,540
Don't let him come harassing me!

21
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,040
I'm a straight man!

22
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,540
Hello? Auntie!

23
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,332
YueYue, can you come over
to my house right now?

24
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,624
Ohhh sure sure I can

25
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,874
Yes! Right now!

26
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,957
YueYue! Finally you're here,
come in quickly!

27
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,457
What's the matter?

28
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,832
This is getting on my nerve!

29
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,124
Come and have a seat here quickly

30
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,332
I have something to ask you

31
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,957
Auntie! Did something happen that

32
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,624
made you call me here in a hurry?

33
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,749
YueYue

34
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,332
Tell me the truth

35
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,749
How has things been so far
between you and Chi Cheng?

36
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,499
We're still the same

37
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,499
Are you guys having conflicts?

38
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,457
Auntie

39
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,832
Did Chi Cheng tell you something?

40
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,874
No.. He hasn't come home for a long time

41
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,499
Auntie, please don't worry

42
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,790
Things have been good all along between us

43
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,415
Although each and every one of us
has our own temper

44
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,582
to give way to me every time

45
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,707
My mom has always told me

46
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,915
If I'm too fussy in a relationship

47
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,957
I will feel a large discrepancy
after marriage

48
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,082
I'm a very rational person

49
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,915
So I will never fantasize
about unrealistic things

50
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,457
I think for two parties to stay together

51
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,082
they should keep their feet on the ground

52
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,499
Don't you agree?

53
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,707
YueYue, you're still the intelligent one

54
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,957
No wonder my son doesn't like anyone else

55
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,457
but only takes a fancy on you

56
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:20,957
Oh right!

57
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,540
You guys should quickly
register your marriage

58
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,574
Auntie Isn't this a little too fast!

59
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,407
No! No!

60
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,949
Actually I have already
regarded you as my daughter-in-law

61
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,532
I need your help with something

62
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:26,865
What is it?

63
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:29,240
This could be a little mean..

64
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,032
Are you willing to help me?

65
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,240
Ok. Tell me about it

66
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,782
The rest of Chi Cheng's life
will be yours sooner or later

67
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,574
Do you think Chi Shao will listen to me?

68
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,440
...then we're over just like that?

69
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,415
Duh!

70
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,957
But his mother has already..

71
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,040
You know too that is his mother and not him

72
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,499
Do you think he is the kind of person

73
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,874
that listens to their parents?

74
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,790
The reason he was held back
by his father the other time

75
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,290
is because of his pet snakes

76
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,999
Now that the snakes are released...

77
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,874
Well. I can't do anything for you

78
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,140
Can you tell me where he is?

79
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:38,807
I'm pleading you..

80
00:09:38,808 --> 00:09:40,724
I just want to know where is he now

81
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:55,474
Waiter. Bill please

82
00:09:56,516 --> 00:09:57,807
Please hold on

83
00:10:10,391 --> 00:10:12,474
What's the meaning of this?

84
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:13,849
Compensation for the break up?

85
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:21,515
Whether I spend it or not,
in the end we will still break up

86
00:10:22,016 --> 00:10:24,182
Why not just spend it then?

87
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,849
Mom!

88
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:36,682
Just take a look at this yourself

89
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,015
Why did you spend so much money going out?

90
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:47,890
Take a closer look at who the spender is

91
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:56,640
This.. Where did you get this from?

92
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:59,140
This is your so-called daughter-in-law's

93
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,182
expenditure of about
$23,600 for this afternoon

94
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,807
Do you know whose card she is swiping?

95
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:04,807
Your son's

96
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:08,265
You better keep your eyes open
and look closely

97
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:10,724
She has already broken up with Chi Cheng

98
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,974
Yet still dares to squander
his money In such a way

99
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:15,349
Who knows how much she will spend on

100
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,682
lavishing items when they are together

101
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,932
Mom, if we accept
such a woman into our family

102
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:25,265
She will empty our house
within two years, Mom

103
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:26,682
Already broken up?

104
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:27,890
You don't believe me?

105
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:29,724
Then call your son and ask him yourself

106
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:39,057
Mom

107
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,390
Did you break up with Yue Yue?

108
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:42,724
Long ago

109
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,874
Mom, just look at your cardigan

110
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,332
She says she had to save

111
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,707
for an entire month to but it for you

112
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,332
It has been several months
since she last went to work

113
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,332
Where would she have the salary?

114
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,332
My dear mother

115
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,415
She just used the money from

116
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,457
your son's bank account to buy it for you

117
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,332
Scrimp and save?

118
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,082
It will be you who will
take her word for it

119
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,249
If she buys one fewer bag

120
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,707
it can already get you
10 of such cardigans, Mom

121
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,540
I really have never seen
someone so shameless before

122
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,957
Auntie, I'm here to see you again

123
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,957
I'm really too bored staying at home alone

124
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,415
You won't find me annoying right?

125
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,374
You already know I find it annoying
and you still come?

126
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,040
Auntie, what seems to be the matter?

127
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,957
Stop showing up here anymore

128
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,749
I feel sick seeing you

129
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,915
Auntie, what did I do wrong?

130
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,749
Since we have known
each other for some time

131
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,457
I have a piece of advice for you

132
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:26,082
As a woman,
don't be too lazy and don't be too greedy

133
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,124
Going after small gains

134
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,582
you will suffer big loss sooner or later

135
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,207
How's the arrangement
for your company so far?

136
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,290
The license have been issued

137
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,915
Shop front tendering is also done

138
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,040
Hiring information has already been posted

139
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,165
Just waiting for the grand opening

140
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,165
Where is the location?

141
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,457
CBD

142
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,874
I remember the housing price
is very high there

143
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,832
Not so high,
I rented from someone I knew before

144
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,749
You even have affiliations there?

145
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,165
Who?

146
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,040
Chi Cheng

147
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,582
You can just directly say he's your sponsor

148
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,582
Who said so? I spent money on it

149
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:21,915
How much?

150
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,457
5500

151
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,415
Is it 500 per day or 500 per month?

152
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,540
3 years

153
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,749
Can you stop pulling my leg?

154
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:42,832
Then... are you going to live there?

155
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,665
I still want to live at the clinic

156
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,749
Don't you find it a little
cumbersome going back and forth?

157
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,415
I bought a car

158
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,582
What car?

159
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,332
Range Rover Vogue

160
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,707
I remember
that car costs $2,000,000 to $3,000,000

161
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,832
I bought a second hand

162
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,374
How much after full installment??

163
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,457
$70,000

164
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,582
I remember that model
was just released last year

165
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,165
Where did you bought it from?

166
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,124
Ask him to sell another one to me

167
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,249
SEWN

168
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,124
what's the matter with you today?

169
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,207
I should ask you the same thing!

170
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,374
Not saying it out straight
and beating about the bush

171
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,832
You're deliberately making people worried

172
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,290
Why am I beating about the bush?

173
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,707
Aren't you just reminding me
that the date is due soon?

174
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,415
Aren't you just hoping for me
to end it with him?

175
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,790
Alright I will state my stand here

176
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,207
All goes according to the plan

177
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,582
You can rest assure now can't you?

178
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,665
Say.. buddy! Are you awake?

179
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,582
Aren't you just hoping for me
to end it with him?

180
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,415
You are still planning to end it with him?

181
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,915
Isn't that what you intended?

182
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,165
What did I intend to do?

183
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,540
You've already went so far

184
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,832
If you're not going to stay
together with him

185
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,082
then who else will stay together with him?

186
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,665
Why do I have to stay together with him?

187
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,749
Why do you not stay together with him?

188
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,290
Didn't we agree on this in the first place?

189
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,415
The purpose for me
to stay together with him

190
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,749
is to break them up

191
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,624
After they have broken up, I will step back

192
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,915
Since our plan has been achieved,

193
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,457
according to the plan I should..

194
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,249
What other plan do you still
have to care about right now?

195
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,790
As long as you are
happy then it'll be enough!

196
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,707
It's not about whether
I will be happy or not

197
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,499
The thing is.. I like women

198
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,624
I have to fall in love
with a girl and get married

199
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,999
Fooling around with
another guy is totally pointless!

200
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,040
Then why can you fool around before?

201
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,874
And it's so serious and exciting

202
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,790
Ask you heart

203
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,874
Do you not have
the slightest feeling for him?

204
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,040
Let's put feelings aside first

205
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,665
And talk about the situation alone

206
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,957
The reason I can fool around
with him in the past

207
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,415
Is because I have a fence around my heart

208
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,082
I know what I was doing

209
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,874
When I'm together with him now

210
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,415
I do not know what I am doing

211
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,290
I can't find a valid reason for that

212
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,415
Do you think..

213
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,915
You still have that fence
around your heart now?

214
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,374
I admit my heart is slightly swaying now

215
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,374
But I still can't stay together with him

216
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,832
Why?

217
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,707
Why can't you stay together with him?

218
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,874
If I stay with him together..

219
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,249
...he ...he will try every
way he can to top me!

220
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,415
Wu Suo Wei!

221
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,749
Are you free later?

222
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,415
I want to have a chat with you

223
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,415
If you have anything
to say just say it here

224
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,832
You look really handsome in suits

225
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,415
Really? Thank you

226
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,415
Your collar is crooked

227
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,665
It's ok. I'll do it myself

228
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,249
You really have changed a lot

229
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,832
Probably

230
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:15,374
The reason we broke up before
is not because I'm snobbish

231
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,374
I know that

232
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,707
He didn't love me

233
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,415
We have already broken up

234
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,957
I know that

235
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,915
You know that?

236
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,332
So you've been paying
a lot of attention to me

237
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,790
Because he has already got together with me

238
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,124
Crazy!
