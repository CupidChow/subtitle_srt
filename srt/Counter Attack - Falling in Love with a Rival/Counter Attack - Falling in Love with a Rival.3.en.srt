1
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:37,533
Your eyes are the sunshine of blue sky
Ni de yanjing shi qingkong de taiyin

2
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,800
Your smile is the aurora of the universe
Ni de xiao rou shi yuzhou de jiguang

3
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,633
Sweet like candies, hard like guns
Tian de xiang tang, lie de xiang cang

4
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:54,200
Live in heart, die in heart
Huo zai yan li si zaixin shang

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,167
But will never let it go
Que buneng fang

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,833
Your dimples are the shadows of sunset
Ni de jiuwo shi yingzhao de yuhui

7
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:12,533
Your singing is the perfectly perfect
Ni de gesheng shi zhenshi de wanmei

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,067
Who is hurt
Shang de shi shui

9
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,967
Who is pain
teng de shi shui

10
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,800
Wild in a dreams
Mengle dian kuang

11
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,099
Drunk in day
Xingle mizui

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,599
But no regrets
Que wu wu yuan hui

13
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:29,833
They have their own reasons
Tamen you Tamen de Daoli

14
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:34,099
We have our own temper
Women you women de piqi

15
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,533
Even if the world is full of hostility
Napa shijie chongmanle Diyi

16
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,500
I still love you
Wo yiran ai ni

17
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,599
They have their own reasons
Tamen you tamen de daoli

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,800
We have our own temper
Women you women de piqi

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,167
Even if the world is full of hostility
Napa shijie chongmanle diyi

20
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:59,833
I still dare, to love you
Wo yiran haishi yonggan ai ni

21
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,832
I still dare, to love...
Wo yiran haishi yonggan ai...

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,667
You
Ni

23
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Episode 3

24
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,533
Why don't you see him?

25
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,300
I call this the "counter-attack" tactic.

26
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,167
Must go forward when it should,

27
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:42,267
When is enough, slow down for a bit.

28
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,300
I've told you.

29
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,400
My goal is to lure him.
Not to pursue him.

30
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,567
What happens if you run out of time?

31
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,166
And he don't chasing you?

32
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:55,800
This would not only be a waste of time?

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,933
Die again.

34
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,300
Don;t worry.

35
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,933
In 3 days,

36
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,370
He will come here.

37
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,033
Really?

38
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,300
Of course!

39
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,233
You didn't see? Who is the teacher?
eiii ~~

40
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,467
Chi-ge, you came?
(ge = brother)

41
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:42,033
Chi-ge, why didn't you come here lately?

42
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,370
Today, I didn't come to see you.

43
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,267
Looking for Dada?

44
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,633
She doesn't work here anymore.

45
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:47,633
Boss fired her.

46
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,166
Doesn't matter who I'm looking for.
Don't bother me.

47
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:54,300
I don't want to, if I go
what if you call someone else?

48
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,900
Take the money.

49
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,832
I don't want money, I want you.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,500
How long haven't you had sex ?

51
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,633
Everyday, people call me.

52
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:10,166
But, there isn't a single person
that can make me happy.

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,800
Listen first, go find someone else.

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,667
No, I just want you, want you

55
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,232
Chi-ge, you are different from them,

56
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:22,300
They come here just to "use me"

57
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,133
But for me, I really love you.

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,400
Aiyou, hate you~~
(prff ~)

59
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,967
Chi Cheng.

60
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,690
He was terrible.

61
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:54,532
Terrible?
Who are you referring to?

62
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,467
Who else?

63
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:58,300
The little slut.

64
00:04:59,067 --> 00:04:59,867
Terrible ha?

65
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,032
Is more appropriate for Chi Cheng.

66
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:04,100
I bet,

67
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,999
9 out of 10 people would think so.

68
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,299
Just don't dare to talk.

69
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,467
Don't you know Chi Cheng well?

70
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,370
Chi Cheng,

71
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,967
Play no1 in this city.

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,433
Wait for me.

73
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,900
Follow my friends and play for a while.

74
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,367
I've got something to talk to him.

75
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,600
Remember to call me when your done.

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,267
Your snake..
(Chi Cheng's pet)

77
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:32,567
Still locked?

78
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,633
What?

79
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,333
Bored?!

80
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,200
No one wants to play with you?

81
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:40,667
Keep that snake to yourself.

82
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,100
Wang Shuo ...

83
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,566
Don't mention that name!

84
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,020
Oh, yah.

85
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,600
Recently, I saw a handsome man.

86
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,200
Unique personality

87
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,667
If I get him,

88
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,400
Come to my room and we can sleep with him.

89
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,867
Help me investigate someone.

90
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:10,690
Who?

91
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,900
Wu Suowei (not important)

92
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,467
Not important?

93
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,333
Then, how?

94
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,933
He called Wu Suowei.

95
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,499
His name is.. weird...

96
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,900
Hey, a lot of people come here for medical examinations.
Hurry up and change your clothes.

97
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,833
No need to rush, I take a shower now.

98
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,233
I see you really like
wearing it to sleep.

99
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:43,300
This is quality cotton,
very comfortable to wear it to sleep

100
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,633
Okay, I take a shower.

101
00:06:58,667 --> 00:06:59,532
Why do you come here?

102
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:00,867
Where is Wu Suowei?

103
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,367
He's in the bathroom.

104
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:42,066
Hey, what are you doing in here?
This is the bathroom, not the common space!

105
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,467
The role
(He forgot his role)

106
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,833
Can you please go out first,
I need to bathe.

107
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,633
Quick, I'm waiting for you outside.

108
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:20,532
What do you want ?

109
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,400
It's time for you to give me back
all the things you owe me.

110
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,370
Like what?

111
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,400
Dried tofu,

112
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:28,667
Candy,

113
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,100
Spicy gluten.

114
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,966
Biscuits,

115
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,667
Pistachi onuts.

116
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:37,833
WTF, thats what I give you,
not what I owe you.

117
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:39,399
No more.

118
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,533
Go, get more.

119
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:41,366
No money!

120
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,267
Nope.

121
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:11,933
These days...

122
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:15,367
Why didn't you show up
in the basketball court?

123
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:17,500
No reason.

124
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,167
I just don't wanna go.

125
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:25,200
Then why you went there before?

126
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:38,800
Answer me!

127
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:47,966
You, don't be so close to him.

128
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,100
He has a cold.

129
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,332
In case you will be infected.

130
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:52,500
You've goten a cold ?

131
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:56,533
He's blabbing!

132
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,100
I'm totally fine!

133
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,399
I'm blabbing?

134
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,585
You are the one who
went out running while

135
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:04,633
it was raining and
got yourself sick!

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,267
Jiang Xiaoshuai!
Shut up your mouth!!

137
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,500
It seems like you're
enjoying being bitchy, aren't you?

138
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,600
You're always giving the
good things out to other people.

139
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:14,133
Even though you're
wearing worn-out underwear.

140
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:15,867
And fear of infecting someone
after caught a cold.

141
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:18,233
Therefore don't wanna appear
in front of him these days.

142
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,867
Mr.muscle

143
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't you think that it would
be a huge loss to the group of idiots

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,667
If he died because of a fever?

145
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,533
Is there someone here named Wu Suo Wei?

146
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:12,366
Here I come!

147
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:14,800
This package is for you.

148
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,200
Who?

149
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,533
Wow ..

150
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,567
Your ex-girlfriend was never like this.

151
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,399
I must say..

152
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,899
You've got him.

153
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,700
He's good for you.

154
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,633
Your ex-girlfriend very nasty.

155
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,133
We're both using a decent guy for revenge.

156
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,933
Don't seriously hurt him.

157
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,200
Are you kidding me!

158
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:55,332
He just send some clothes
and you're already praising him?

159
00:11:55,633 --> 00:12:00,030
Don't you know his father's status?
How many people want to give gifts for him?

160
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,333
Maybe this stuff that
was not used at his home.

161
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,833
Who would give you this after
seeing you wear tattered clothes?

162
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:11,300
And the size is perfect for you !!?

163
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:15,200
Who said that? This isn't my size!

164
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,600
You try it, go try.

165
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,433
Too late!

166
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,433
This size is too small, a little tight

167
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,667
Then take it off and give it to me.

168
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,133
For this one, noo..

169
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,167
You're don;t use it, so for what?

170
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,600
Don't fit, but it can be sold!

171
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,000
This underwear is great!

172
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,633
I will open an online shop,
definitely sold out.

173
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,433
I have an online shop,
I can sell it for you.

174
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:56,533
No, I know how to sell it!

175
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:16,600
Why are you here?

176
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,466
I just wanted to see it, do they fit?

177
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,899
I made candy-sugar
Try some..

178
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,370
You know how to make a sugar-candy?

179
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,267
I just know how to make
simple small animals.

180
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:49,400
Make me one.

181
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,433
What do you want ?

182
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:51,833
A snake.

183
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,700
What snake? >. <

184
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,370
Cobra.

185
00:13:54,395 --> 00:13:55,728
All right, look carefully!

186
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:00,700
Here, your cobra.

187
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:08,233
Are you sure this isn't your ... ??!?

188
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:15,433
Im going home...

189
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,333
Are you free tomorrow?
I want to talk with you.

190
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,067
I just go "to sleep", don;t date.

191
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:31,100
If you want me to make you another one,

192
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,966
Promise me the thing we said  before then.

193
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,067
Okay.

194
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,933
Are you sure you are not turning your size,

195
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,533
into mine. ?

196
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,133
Yo, you look handsome.

197
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,200
This drama .. must be assured.

198
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't forget to observe
the movement of his hand.

199
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,533
His hand? What do you mean?

200
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:24,800
Physical contact!

201
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:26,667
Isn't that too fast?

202
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,000
I heard, they will get married

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,690
Yue Yue is Chi Cheng's only girlfriend.

204
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,467
It's likely they were pressured
by his parents to get married.

205
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,030
I know, I'm sure
I will find an opportunity.

206
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:51,133
Dressed like this ..

207
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:52,200
Like this?

208
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,370
What was "like this"?

209
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:55,167
Like what !!!?

210
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:46,000
That's...

211
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,167
You really don't rest!

212
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:57,867
I don't know what to say.

213
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,467
Today's weather ...

214
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:52,667
is nice huh?

215
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:58,030
Teacher, what should I
do when having an affair?

216
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,333
Hug instantly!

217
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,633
Bite him twice!

218
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,370
You're a man, what are you afraid ?

219
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,700
He won't slap you or scold you.

220
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,370
Let's go.

221
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,832
You sure you're cleaning it?

222
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:30,833
You're not fat, but your
ass has a lot of meat.

223
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,667
If a man makes contact with the butt,

224
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,900
In any form of touch,

225
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,267
This is your chance!

226
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:43,846
Remember!

227
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,133
Use all methods that will
make him respond to you.

228
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,000
Be brave! Reach him!

229
00:18:57,067 --> 00:19:03,267
Non-toxic, afraid of what?

230
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:57,567
Think!

231
00:18:57,567 --> 00:19:00,500
It's only meat wrapped around skin.

232
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,233
Are you sick?

233
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,267
No, just tingling.

234
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:09,967
Tingling?

235
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:10,300
Yes ..

236
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,899
Should I make it better?

237
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:14,233
Come on

238
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:16,370
This's a good opportunity!

239
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,567
Just say "let's go"

240
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,200
Only one step away.

241
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:23,967
Thanks, really don't need.
Just a little tingling.

242
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:32,067
Come on, quickly!

243
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,867
Only 300m until we reach the park gate,

244
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,500
If not now, there won't be another chance!!

245
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,370
Over 200m left to go!

246
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,667
You've been working for 1 month!

247
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:40,400
Only 100m now.

248
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,033
If not now, they will be married!

249
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,300
Uh, watch out!!!

250
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:13,067
Hello?

251
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:15,900
Hello
It's me, Yue Yue, where are you?

252
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,233
I'll be there soon!

253
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:20,599
You need to go?

254
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:22,133
Dinner appointment.

255
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,030
Go.

256
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,100
Why don't you go ? Don't make people wait!
