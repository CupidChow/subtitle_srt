1
00:00:31,918 --> 00:00:37,843
Your eyes are the sunshine of blue sky
Ni de yanjing shi qingkong de taiyin

2
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:45,940
Your smile is the aurora of the universe
Ni de xiao rou shi yuzhou de jiguang

3
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,922
Sweet like candies, hard like weapons
Tian de xiang tang, lie de xiang cang

4
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:54,507
Live in heart, die in heart
Huo zai yan li si zaixin shang

5
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:59,458
But will never let it go
Que buneng fang

6
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:05,141
Your dimples are the shadows of sunset
Ni de jiuwo shi yingzhao de yuhui

7
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,836
Your singing is the perfectly perfect
Ni de gesheng shi zhenshi de wanmei

8
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:15,365
Who is hurt
Shang de shi shui

9
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:17,255
Who is in pain
teng de shi shui

10
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:19,109
Wild in dreams
Mengle dian kuang

11
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:21,389
Drunk in the day
Xingle mizui

12
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:26,885
But no regrets
Que wu wu yuan hui

13
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:30,124
They have their own reasons
Tamen you Tamen de Daoli

14
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:34,404
We have our own temperaments
Women you women de piqi

15
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:38,844
Even if the world is full of hostility
Napa shijie chongmanle Diyi

16
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:40,795
I still love you
Wo yiran ai ni

17
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:43,884
They have their own reasons
Tamen you tamen de daoli

18
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:48,990
We have our own temperaments
Women you women de piqi

19
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,482
Even if the world is full of hostility
Napa shijie chongmanle diyi

20
00:01:53,917 --> 00:02:00,133
I still dare, to love you
Wo yiran haishi yonggan ai ni

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,123
I still dare, to love...
Wo yiran haishi yonggan ai...

22
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,953
You
Ni

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Episode 1

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yue Yue!

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yue Yue!

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,873
Yue Yue, why are you ignoring me?

27
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:46,113
I think we should break up.

28
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:49,194
But why?!

29
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:51,162
We've been together for 7 years!

30
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:52,499
At least, you have to give me a reason?

31
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:54,266
7 years of boredom,
is that not enough reason?

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,585
If you're bored, we could try
making our relationship more interesting

33
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:57,641
Forget it!

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,825
- We...
- Please. Don't say another word!

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,409
Let me tell you

36
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,577
I have suffered throughout
this relationship

37
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,721
For a long time, I have a dream

38
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,825
When I was going out with someone else

39
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:13,744
I won't lie

40
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:15,704
I enjoyed myself

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,872
I am pretty enough to find

42
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,424
the perfect guy in a matter of minutes

43
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:25,879
You, please take care of yourself

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,975
Have you ever heard
the wise words of Li Jia Cheng?

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,952
"When an egg is broken
from the outside, it becomes food."

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,545
"When broken from the inside,
it becomes life."

47
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,250
Human life is the same.

48
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:32,825
When you're broken by an outside force
it means you're being pressured,

49
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:34,304
but when it is broken by an inside force,
it means you're becoming more mature.

50
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,768
If you wait to be attacked
from the outside,

51
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,879
you'll become food for other people.

52
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:43,830
But if you push yourself from the inside,
you will find your own maturity.

53
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:45,288
Like being reborn.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,772
I quit. I'll open a small business.

55
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:53,579
Starting from the dealer,

56
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:59,578
I'll wait until I have enough money,
then I'll open a large shop.

57
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:00,962
What will you sell?

58
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,834
I want to sell breakfast food.

59
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:04,882
But I don't know how to cook.

60
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:07,202
I can't fry rice cakes...

61
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:08,657
Can't fry meat buns either.

62
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:12,472
After some thinking...
I can only sell porridge?

63
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:13,697
Selling porridge is also good!

64
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:15,582
A little rice can yield
a big pot of porridge.

65
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,344
All you need is a large pot,

66
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:18,135
some spoons,

67
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:19,792
And some plastic bowls.

68
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,318
It doesn't rquire a lot of capital.

69
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:27,246
Got it!

70
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,270
I think it's done.

71
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,393
Try it, let me know how it tastes.

72
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,621
Good, but a bit bland

73
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:48,717
This is not right.

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,836
I see people on the streets
selling porridge like this as well.

75
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:54,424
Maybe we didn't cook it
for the right amount of time?

76
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:56,441
That's because herbal plants release
their sap after some time

77
00:05:57,536 --> 00:06:00,782
Is there another way?
... No, I don't believe it!

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,752
What are you thinking of?

79
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:04,993
There are many benefits in plant sap!

80
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:06,257
It's very good for your health!

81
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:09,639
Whether I'm a good or bad doctor,

82
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,831
would I ever lie to you?

83
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:14,761
Wait!

84
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:16,402
I'll give you a box of wholesale goods!

85
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:19,329
Remember, buy the cheapest ones!

86
00:06:32,803 --> 00:06:33,715
What are you doing?

87
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:34,945
The same as usual.

88
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,267
I heard your father caught
a bunch of criminals?

89
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:43,287
Because of Wang Shuo,
he's been internalizing this fear.

90
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,045
Is he still obsessed?

91
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,252
Don't mention him again!

92
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,332
Okay, okay.

93
00:06:48,332 --> 00:06:50,867
Maybe your father wants you
to be in a more neutral position.

94
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,570
If not, you can come to our police station.

95
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:55,322
We could have some fun together.

96
00:06:56,306 --> 00:06:57,233
Not interested.

97
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,817
Well, I'm not going to say
anything anymore. Have fun.

98
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:53,497
Do you want to try some porridge?

99
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:57,920
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

100
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,516
Isn't that Chi Cheng?

101
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:01,923
Stop, stop!

102
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:03,898
Who told you you can sell
your porridge here?!

103
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,500
Who told you to sell your porridge here?!

104
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,655
Back off, I say! Don't come near me!

105
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:45,733
Don't let me get my hands on you!

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,212
Was that guy a hired thug or something?

107
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:50,594
I don't know.

108
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:51,460
Come on.

109
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,916
Let's go see the "fairy".

110
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:03,685
The police are after me!

111
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,167
Please, don't tell them I live here!

112
00:09:11,977 --> 00:09:12,746
What do you want?

113
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:14,177
Medical check-up.

114
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:15,858
Where are you hurting?

115
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:17,480
Guess.

116
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,301
If you're having problems
with your genitals,

117
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,400
please go to the
hospital for a check-up.

118
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,502
Go out the door, turn left 30 meters,

119
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:22,727
the ride a bus twice from there.

120
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,358
You're very handsome.

121
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,751
For physiological disorders,
please go to Tongren hospital.

122
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:31,520
You like men, don't you?

123
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:34,967
Please go to An Dinh hospital
for psychological disorders.

124
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,563
What about a broken heart?

125
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:38,629
Please call 110
(emergency phone number)

126
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:44,027
Jiang Xiao Shuai.

127
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:46,194
I'll remember that!

128
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,728
Hey~ Wu Suowei!

129
00:10:09,728 --> 00:10:11,967
Why are you walking by yourself?
What are you doing?

130
00:10:12,807 --> 00:10:14,630
Do you need a ride?

131
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,582
What, are you showing off
your wealth or something?

132
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:20,189
That car isn't even yours.

133
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,243
If you cry, don't come to me.

134
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:27,473
With that kind of personality,
you'll be waiting your whole life.

135
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:30,577
Honey, let's go.

136
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,216
What are you doing?

137
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:03,257
Don't disturb me!

138
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:05,872
I'm searching for enlightenment

139
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,242
I don't want to be a seller.

140
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:21,226
Do you feel that being
a seller is undignified?

141
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,093
Do you feel that you don't
have a place in society?

142
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,935
Or that you can't work in
the same position as before?

143
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:25,928
No!

144
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:27,535
I've been doing calculations for 1 week.

145
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:29,320
In one week, I can get 100 yuan.

146
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,703
Minus 2 trolleys,

147
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:35,550
2 stainless pots and 3 spoons.

148
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,511
It's all losses.

149
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,335
So what will you do next?

150
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,856
"Street art".

151
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,453
I've concluded.

152
00:11:45,478 --> 00:11:48,718
Being a peddler takes a huge investment.

153
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:49,877
The risk is very big!

154
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:52,501
Martial arts requires only yourself.

155
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:55,120
I will rely on the strength
of my body to earn money.

156
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,436
What will you sell?

157
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,524
My hard head!

158
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:05,617
Hello everyone!

159
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:06,995
Please give a big applause

160
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:11,254
I will destroy these bricks with my head!

161
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:12,806
First, I will give a demonstration.

162
00:12:12,806 --> 00:12:15,325
If you have money give me the money.
If you don't, give me applause.

163
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:18,902
Applause! Applause!

164
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,146
Why is it really noisy today?

165
00:12:33,147 --> 00:12:34,572
Let's have a look.

166
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:36,580
Observe carefully!

167
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:38,579
Ready!

168
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,938
Money! Money!

169
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:44,898
Do it again! Again!

170
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,602
This is 10 yuan.
Your bricks are fake, right?

171
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,937
Do it again! Let me see it!

172
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:51,609
You think this is fake?

173
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:53,193
Don't believe me? Alright then!

174
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:55,646
I need volunteers for verification!

175
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:56,423
Okay?

176
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,207
You there, the tall one!

177
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:00,455
Yes, you! I need your help!

178
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,111
Look, everyone! Are my bricks fake or real?

179
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:04,896
See clearly!

180
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,688
Please check this brick ...

181
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,711
Hey kid, so you're doing martial arts now?

182
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:25,839
Go away! You, come with us now.

183
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,795
I'm busy. Can you continue
the interrogation, Chi Cheng?

184
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:41,680
Alright.

185
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:57,911
Full name.

186
00:13:58,485 --> 00:13:59,625
Wu Suowei. (Pronunciation
similar to "not important")

187
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:04,520
Gender?

188
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:06,265
Wu Suowei.
(Pronunciation similar to "not important")

189
00:14:10,865 --> 00:14:12,561
Gender is not important?

190
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:21,983
If it is not important ...

191
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:24,540
Can I cut it off for you?

192
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:30,610
Next time, answer me politely!

193
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:36,650
Wait! Wait!

194
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,525
Wu Suo Wei?! This ID is fake, right?

195
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,867
This's real!
Go check it if you don't believe me!

196
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:12,177
Do people really have this kind of name?

197
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:14,640
It fits you.

198
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:19,505
That day, why did you throw porridge at me?

199
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:22,887
That day? You... ?

200
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:28,165
No reason, I just want to.

201
00:15:49,404 --> 00:15:50,404
What are you doing?

202
00:15:50,404 --> 00:15:53,379
The police department
has a weak association!

203
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:54,972
The association is weak, you know!

204
00:15:54,972 --> 00:16:00,235
If you're really going to do this to me,
people out there will not let you!

205
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:02,412
Your life will be ruined!

206
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:07,006
What is that?
Why are you suddenly cutting my hair??!!

207
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:16,867
"I've been caught by a devil."

208
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:19,570
"A little devil!"

209
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,550
"Devils and demons..."

210
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,306
"Why are there so many of them?"

211
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:26,131
"The three feathers on his hat"

212
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:27,290
"...look like they can laugh."

213
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:31,722
"Do you not know his name?"

214
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:33,138
"Everybody knows!"

215
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,513
"The old woman said"

216
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:37,330
"My life is good"

217
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:42,969
"Because I work hard to earn money."

218
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,632
"I live in a building in Xiao Yang."

219
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:48,857
"but that building's really old."

220
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:50,890
"I also have a credit card."

221
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,400
"But it's only got 8 yuan left."

222
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,438
What century is it now?

223
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,022
Why are you still listening
to this kind of music?

224
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:02,054
I'm a big fan of Yao Ming!

225
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,221
You like basketball?

226
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:07,356
Not Yao Ming the basketball player.

227
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:10,332
I'm talking about Yao Ming the composer.

228
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,756
The old one!

229
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:14,815
There's a composer named Yao Ming too?

230
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,532
You came out of that era too!

231
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:20,162
You don't know who Yao Ming is?

232
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:22,668
(A Cup of Tea by
the Front Gate).

233
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:24,213
(.......)

234
00:17:24,213 --> 00:17:25,947
The best composer in China!

235
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:27,260
This country has a subsidy because of him!

236
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:30,996
(Kitchen Story)
Have you ever seen it?

237
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,854
It was composed by him!

238
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,982
Some time ago, I met him here.

239
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,766
Chi Cheng, this town's No. 1 playboy.

240
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,629
Why haven't I seen him?

241
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,742
Strange...

242
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:52,821
With his personality,

243
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,821
it's not unusual for him to be here.

244
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,252
I'll wait, he'll definitely be here.

245
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:22,104
May I sit here?

246
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:29,716
Handsome.

247
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:33,533
Do you come here often ?

248
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:38,771
Do you think ... I'm pretty?
