1
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:37,743
Your eyes are the sunshine of blue sky
Ni de yanjing shi qingkong de taiyin

2
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:45,840
Your smile is the aurora of the universe
Ni de xiao rou shi yuzhou de jiguang

3
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,822
Sweet like candies, hard like guns
Tian de xiang tang, lie de xiang cang

4
00:00:49,822 --> 00:00:54,407
Live in heart, die in heart
Huo zai yan li si zaixin shang

5
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:59,358
But will never let it go
Que buneng fang

6
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,041
Your dimples are the shadows of sunset
Ni de jiuwo shi yingzhao de yuhui

7
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,736
Your singing is the perfectly perfect
Ni de gesheng shi zhenshi de wanmei

8
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:15,265
Who is hurt
Shang de shi shui

9
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:17,155
Who is pain
teng de shi shui

10
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:19,009
Wild in a dreams
Mengle dian kuang

11
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,289
Drunk in day
Xingle mizui

12
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:26,785
But no regrets
Que wu wu yuan hui

13
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:30,024
They have their own reasons
Tamen you Tamen de Daoli

14
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:34,304
We have our own temper
Women you women de piqi

15
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:38,744
Even if the world is full of hostility
Napa shijie chongmanle Diyi

16
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:40,695
I still love you
Wo yiran ai ni

17
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:43,784
They have their own reasons
Tamen you tamen de daoli

18
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:48,890
We have our own temper
Women you women de piqi

19
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,382
Even if the world is full of hostility
Napa shijie chongmanle diyi

20
00:01:53,817 --> 00:02:00,033
I still dare, to love you
Wo yiran haishi yonggan ai ni

21
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,023
I still dare, to love...
Wo yiran haishi yonggan ai...

22
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:07,853
You
Ni

23
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:20,391
Episode 4

24
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:40,147
Since when do you read this kind of book?

25
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:43,197
Improve the quality of self.

26
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,137
Since when do you have
the desire like that?

27
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,231
Forced.

28
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:51,175
The last time I talked to him,

29
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,206
Although it has been many hours together
but I can only say less than 10 words.

30
00:02:57,131 --> 00:02:58,137
Then, I find out more about him.

31
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:01,323
And found that he graduated from
New York University majoring in law.

32
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:02,789
I'm majoring in engineering.

33
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:04,590
We aren't the same.

34
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,174
I have no family background, at least I
have to improve my aspects of culture.

35
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,829
You two haven't contacted
each other for quite a while, right?

36
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:11,685
1 week

37
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:13,756
Still want to be calm?

38
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,828
We are in a quiet period.

39
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:19,540
In this period, I will not call him first.

40
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,087
Really?

41
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:24,171
Eh, Guo Chengyu

42
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,258
These several days, he didn't come here ?

43
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:28,121
Don't, don't, don't. Don't mention him.

44
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:30,130
He will appear if you mention him.

45
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,180
Dr. Jiang, are you in?

46
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:33,774
Our brother sprained his ankle,

47
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:35,231
Could you see it for a while, please?

48
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,201
Let's talk somewhere.

49
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,203
No time.

50
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,155
My car is outside, it's up to you!

51
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:16,151
I found the book FangLong.
Is like cracking riddles.

52
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,206
Excessive irony.

53
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:24,147
Indeed the history of heresy.

54
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:32,115
You said, the story is very dramatic ..

55
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:34,225
Why do people even prefer to read novels?

56
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:43,805
You think, religion can
claim a monopoly on that?

57
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:47,153
I think..

58
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,131
All this intolerant behavior
comes from human fears.

59
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:56,557
Especially those with authorities, so they
do anything to confuse the public.

60
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,635
Just like public said "......."

61
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:02,857
What are you thinking?

62
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,259
You talked about this to me,

63
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,199
Why are we not talking
about the anatomy of the anal.

64
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:25,486
What are you doing!?

65
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:31,115
Show some respect!

66
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,119
Who's not respecting you?

67
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,132
Why are you want to take
off my pants all of a sudden?

68
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,665
I just want to see if you wore
the underwear I gave for you.

69
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:41,824
There's a lot of pants.

70
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:43,257
How do you know which one you gave me?

71
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,583
Your underwear, I
specifically chose it for you.

72
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,605
Brand, size, types of fabric.

73
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:50,076
Everything, I chose it carefully.

74
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:52,230
You thought I was shopping
in the wholesale market?

75
00:05:57,706 --> 00:05:58,568
Make me sugar-candy.

76
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:00,041
Don't want.

77
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:05,650
The last time I took it, my
girfriend saw it. And she loved it.

78
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,770
Make one more for her.

79
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:08,114
Your girlfriend?

80
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:09,105
Yue Yue, ha?

81
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:10,175
How do you know her?

82
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,069
Acting stupid again.

83
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:16,643
Not because she told you?

84
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:21,421
Are you angry because I gave it to her?

85
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:24,460
Bullshit, she is my ex-girlfriend!

86
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:26,261
You gave her the results of my work!

87
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,341
How can I happy?

88
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:30,242
Listen, make me one.

89
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:33,173
Move!

90
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:58,147
Take this and go!

91
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:07,130
What are you doing!

92
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:09,100
Care of yourself!

93
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,033
Many dead skin here.

94
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:14,751
If you do not treat it, you will die!

95
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,140
Why are you so good to me?

96
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,216
Do you think ?

97
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:21,168
I don't know!

98
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,112
Just like that and you don't know, low IQ!

99
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:27,890
Damn!

100
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,087
....

101
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,700
He's gone, huh?

102
00:07:58,088 --> 00:07:59,095
Gone a long time.

103
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,062
He didn't stay here last night?

104
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,479
Stay here? Why should
I let him stay here !?

105
00:08:05,114 --> 00:08:07,142
Last night, you two didn't do anything?

106
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,143
Blowing sugar candy

107
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:10,209
Blowing sugar candy?

108
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:12,165
Can you do anything else?

109
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:15,259
You think I want?
He kept asking me to blowing sugar candy!

110
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,780
If it was not because i want to lure him,
how can I stop to show it to him.

111
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:21,064
But you can't just show it to him.

112
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:22,664
You must "show" yourself to him.

113
00:08:22,664 --> 00:08:23,535
What do you say?

114
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,783
You got me wrong.

115
00:08:24,783 --> 00:08:27,350
I mean we can't do things this way.

116
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:29,404
A bit of fun is a good thing.

117
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,960
But you can't only
have fun, right?

118
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,787
This man is a predator.

119
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,280
Now he can only look. Can't touch.

120
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,016
If it was you, how?

121
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,063
Of course, if you have enough charm.
It will be different.

122
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,499
But, don't you think it can
strained state much longer?

123
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:47,716
You think.

124
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:49,652
If you wait one year later

125
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:51,892
Don't knows how many girlfriends
Chi Cheng have changed.

126
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,761
and who YueYue will be sleeping with.

127
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,600
It will be too late.

128
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,580
Who will revenge, then?

129
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:03,398
What I think is ...

130
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,217
Now or never!

131
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:43,160
Hallo?

132
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,186
I "want" you.

133
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:51,175
Me too!

134
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:53,177
What do you say?!?

135
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:57,141
I also "want" you!

136
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,110
You really say "me too"?

137
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:21,640
What's so funny?

138
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,203
I did what you said, to respond him.

139
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:25,570
But the results are nothing.

140
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,583
And it only makes an awkward situation.

141
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,515
Are you sure about what you said to me?

142
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:29,179
How?

143
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:30,338
Miscalculation, ha?

144
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,091
I didn't ask you to say in that way.

145
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,237
Then, what should i talk to him?

146
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:35,781
Should I say "Ah, let's come to me"

147
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:36,269
I'm not a whore!

148
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,126
"My long Goods"  here is not for no reason.

149
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:39,669
How can I let him to "do" that to me!

150
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,161
Hey, what you two?

151
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:50,464
Dr. Jiang, my friend have period.

152
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:52,037
Can you cure it?

153
00:10:57,697 --> 00:10:59,480
You're just in time.

154
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,481
You move fast?

155
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,821
I haven't even yet to act, and you've come

156
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:21,193
Did you come to see him?

157
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,720
Wrong.

158
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:25,630
It's him.

159
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:38,078
They knew each other!

160
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:39,681
I don't know.

161
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:41,523
It seems they have a dispute.

162
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,835
You think.. they're both have
the same family background.

163
00:11:47,742 --> 00:11:50,799
If we can find something from Guo Chengyu,

164
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,467
Maybe we can get a "windfall"

165
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:57,706
I think, what you need now
is to safe. (Don't make trouble)

166
00:11:57,706 --> 00:12:00,737
Didn't you see Chi Cheng's gaze?
He looks like he want to kill you.

167
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:24,491
Go .. go .. go.

168
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,123
Oh, why don't you go?

169
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:33,166
Afraid.

170
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,133
You fear something may happen to me?

171
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:40,176
You don't need to worry,
I have a sword in my hand.

172
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:42,245
But I think, his eyes...

173
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:44,142
Like want to eat people.

174
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:48,622
Are you expecting him to
always find me in trouble, huh?

175
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:50,734
How, if he comes?

176
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:52,272
You really don't believe me.

177
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:53,273
It was not the same.

178
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:58,835
What if he forced himself to you?
Hug him, touch him, I don't worry about it.

179
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:00,296
You'll be half dead!

180
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:01,676
I stay here.

181
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,372
If something happens, I can help you.

182
00:13:05,112 --> 00:13:06,206
Not sure?

183
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,609
I'm telling you as the one who have gone through it all..

184
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:10,505
Like ..

185
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:15,148
Someone's coming?!

186
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:18,101
Don't tell me that's ChiCheng!

187
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,141
I will go hide inside.

188
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:39,754
Looking for Wu Suowei?

189
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:41,203
He's inside.

190
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:46,245
You two staying together?

191
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:50,482
No, I will clean
up and go home..

192
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:22,006
New York University
Law Must Read Book List

193
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,108
Who said you can touch
my things without permission!

194
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:44,497
I just want to see the
person who wants to

195
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:47,171
"do it" with me is reading
what kind of books.

196
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:52,207
Which mentor lead him
to say big words like that.

197
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:57,142
Why did he still remember about that?

198
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,174
Since when did you "want" me?

199
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:07,173
since I was a trader.

200
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,787
So, the previous meetings ..

201
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:14,143
You've set it up?

202
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:20,195
Obviously you set it, to push me!
(Now)

203
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:21,981
Yeah

204
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:45,757
Do you want to see it?

205
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:49,814
I want to ... or don't want?

206
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:51,817
On whom you ask?

207
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,179
I am home.

208
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:20,285
Da wei, why you don't want to get up?

209
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:22,244
I don't want to get up.

210
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:24,216
Don't want to get up?

211
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:26,309
Why you don't want to get up?

212
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:28,483
I want to die!!

213
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,285
He "did it"?

214
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,100
Last night

215
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:36,382
He did it in front of my face..

216
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,222
"Did" this.

217
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,758
He force me to look.

218
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:47,319
Da wei ...

219
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:53,225
He just "play" in front of you.
Let's just say you're watching porn.

220
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:55,110
It is normal.

221
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:57,757
Don't think in the usual way to vote him.

222
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:01,389
When you see he "did" that

223
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:03,620
Doesn't mean that he want to insult you.

224
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,492
It was just your innocent feelings.

225
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:10,305
I say .. let's just forget about it

226
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:14,502
With your psychological,
you really don't fit to be a gay.

227
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:17,480
May find a permanent job,

228
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:19,208
there must be a girl
who wants to be with you.

229
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:26,643
In my dictionary ..

230
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,938
There's no such thing as give up halfway.

231
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,962
Your determination..

232
00:17:31,962 --> 00:17:33,925
Makes me want to cry.

233
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:40,249
Uh, Where are you going?

234
00:17:40,249 --> 00:17:41,881
Going home for 2 days.

235
00:17:42,212 --> 00:17:42,952
No, you can't.

236
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:45,960
You also had a fever.

237
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:47,801
My mind,

238
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:50,590
Medicines will be useless.

239
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:53,500
only the strong will of myself,
that can handle it

240
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:54,409
At least take some medicine.

241
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:55,442
Don't want.

242
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:01,435
I don't want to see him these days.

243
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,914
If he comes looking for me.

244
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:06,730
Help me settle it.

245
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:13,532
Don't worry.

246
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:14,893
I'm here.

247
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:45,264
Chi Cheng

248
00:18:53,283 --> 00:18:55,283
Where are you?

249
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:57,274
Traveling.

250
00:18:58,206 --> 00:18:59,209
Traveling?

251
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:00,253
Where?

252
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:02,541
Yanjiao
(City in Hebei province)

253
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,279
Pretty far.

254
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:07,327
Eh, don't get caught?

255
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:09,323
I should continue..

256
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:12,257
Maybe I can draw other things from him..

257
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:13,295
Last night...

258
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:15,261
I really enjoyed it.

259
00:19:16,213 --> 00:19:17,206
Enjoy how?

260
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,307
Next time do it with
you, and you will know.

261
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:26,249
Damn! You already know but still pretend.

262
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:40,295
Where is he?

263
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:43,185
I have told you, he went traveling.
