1
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,054
(The Morning After)

2
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,583
Do we have a cold or something,

3
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,708
why are you so afraid?

4
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:01,773
It's not like I know
who you fucked last year.

5
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:10,171
How's the return visit for the hospital?

6
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,416
You talk like my mother.

7
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,937
“Hey mom, how have you been?”

8
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,208
Your mom offers you cigarettes?

9
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,833
Give me that!

10
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:38,875
Lighter?

11
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,812
It's at the windowsill, treat yourself to it.

12
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,250
Get it for me.

13
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,250
I'm in the middle of something,
go get it yourself!

14
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,291
What are you doing?

15
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,208
Shhh...

16
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,291
Stop it!

17
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:39,282
It's been five years.

18
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,208
Why won't you kiss me?

19
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,958
Because it's not for you.

20
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:50,958
Oh I see!

21
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:53,992
Someone's got a new boyfriend?

22
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,333
No.

23
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,750
Liar.

24
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,250
How about you?

25
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:03,265
I told you we broke up half a year ago.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why?

27
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,125
Take a guess.

28
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,359
The same old?

29
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,000
Sure!

30
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,429
To be honest,

31
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,171
I can't really drink tea right now.

32
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,101
Oh really?

33
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,378
Why's that?

34
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,695
Caffeine causes my heart to palpitate.

35
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:02,414
Ok, so no tea then.

36
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,708
It burns!

37
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,234
Freshly boiled water, duh.

38
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:20,143
Fine!

39
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,471
I'll go out and get you something to drink.

40
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:26,581
So you're always like this?

41
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,213
Like what?

42
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:29,960
The “no kissing” part.

43
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:33,679
No.

44
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:38,242
Then why can't I?

45
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:42,549
You really have your mind set on this, huh?

46
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:52,476
What now?

47
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,664
It's freezing.

48
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:01,753
Let’s sit for a bit.

49
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:24,831
Don't you think people nowadays
take “kissing” too informally?

50
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,885
Go out to a bar,
have a few drinks, and anyone will do it.

51
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,438
Somehow,

52
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:45,018
I take kissing more seriously.

53
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,284
I don't think it's fair
when you compare it like that.

54
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,583
Ok...

55
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,870
you see,

56
00:05:57,895 --> 00:05:59,628
you'll kiss someone,

57
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,750
or even hook up with him,

58
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,620
only because you like him, right?

59
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,188
Call me!

60
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:26,455
Call me!

61
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,221
You really do like
the “Before” trilogy, don't you?

62
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,510
I'm ready for it.

63
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,721
That's what I thought too.

64
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,706
Whom am I playing?

65
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,487
My best friend.

66
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,208
Hello?

67
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:53,016
Hey hear me out,

68
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,729
I think my booty call has feelings for me.

69
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,291
Oh, how so?

70
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,041
The one I've told you about before,

71
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,940
the one that I hook up with once a year.

72
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,708
We'd made an agreement,

73
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,729
sex is cool but no kissing.

74
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,417
But for some reason, he insisted
on kissing this time.

75
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,284
Maybe he...

76
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:16,612
Hello...?

77
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,268
What makes you not want to k...

78
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:19,543
kiss him then?

79
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,410
Because I think...

80
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:27,625
Uhh....

81
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,791
I just feel like...

82
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,151
Excuse me,
which direction is the metro station?

83
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:35,299
The metro is that way.

84
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:35,891
This way?

85
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:36,333
Yeah.

86
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:36,776
Thank you!

87
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:37,760
Hey, sorry.

88
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:38,971
So...

89
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,620
Hello?

90
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,901
Where were we?

91
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:46,932
How about now?

92
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:52,878
Come on,

93
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:53,753
lead the way.

94
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,963
Why aren't you wearing a mask?

95
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,393
I've already been vaccinated.

96
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,500
What? Why?

97
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,456
It's not like I had a choice.

98
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,562
My company's annual meeting is coming up.

99
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,167
Wow, so brave.

100
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:21,503
Times like this and you still have a business trip.

101
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:26,520
Come to think of it,
it's actually been pretty long, five whole years!

102
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,417
Remember the second year,

103
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,073
Your phone kept on ringing during sex?

104
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,458
OK, you are in no place to judge,

105
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,875
One time your ex came back
to pick up his stuff,

106
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:43,291
and I had to stay in the balcony
naked for three hours.

107
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,932
After that I caught a flu.

108
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,166
We are going to hell for sure.

109
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,354
Let me tell you,
all homosexuals going to hell.

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,315
Why am I always carrying everything?

111
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:57,542
Well, I'm holding the umbrella for you already.

112
00:08:58,198 --> 00:08:59,995
Why did we buy so much?

113
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,737
Well you're the one who said you’re hungry.

114
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:04,627
And you're not?

115
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,573
Wait a second.

116
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:16,501
Ok.

117
00:09:20,814 --> 00:09:22,003
Are you ok?

118
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,541
Medicine, quick!

119
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,510
Where is it?

120
00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:41,674
Tell me!

121
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,166
Hey what's wrong? Everything ok?

122
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,667
Call 119!

123
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:46,791
Sir you alright?

124
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,870
Call 119!

125
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:49,917
Where? Where is it?

126
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:50,885
119 or 110?

127
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,721
119

128
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:57,416
Hello?

129
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,784
There's a young man who looks very sick.

130
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,760
He's lying on the floor.

131
00:10:02,573 --> 00:10:03,666
Zhongxing Road.

132
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,416
Hold on, what floor is this?

133
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:06,875
Fourth.

134
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,458
Fourth, ok.

135
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,000
180, fourth floor.

136
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:10,921
Yes.

137
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:12,558
- Are you alright?
- What happened?

138
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,799
He's having a heart attack.

139
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:16,574
180, fourth floor.

140
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,632
I'm not, I'm his neighbor.

141
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,333
They are a bit busy now.

142
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,148
Ok, how long will it take?

143
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,448
Got it.

144
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:34,581
Please hurry, ok?

145
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,916
What the fuck?

146
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,500
Alright thank you!

147
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,102
Heart attack?

148
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:48,461
Attack my ass.

149
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:51,354
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:54,846
You're paying for this act.

151
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:57,951
I wasn't acting.

152
00:10:57,976 --> 00:10:59,351
I was serious.

153
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,528
Lighter.

154
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:36,132
Actually,

155
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:43,046
my company's annual meeting is canceled.

156
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:49,928
Oh really?

157
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:51,453
Yeah.

158
00:12:03,852 --> 00:12:04,686
Actually,

159
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,041
I don't kiss because of my ex.

160
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,898
He cheated.

161
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:24,973
Cheated,

162
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:27,054
Weren't you cheating with me too?

163
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:29,592
Kidding.

164
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:37,737
We agreed not to kiss,

165
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:39,095
that's the bottom line.

166
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,630
Hey,

167
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:52,257
stop being mad, ok?

168
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:53,491
Please.

169
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:15,486
Thank you. It's fine now, thank you!

170
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,320
Where did you find it?

171
00:14:02,953 --> 00:14:04,250
At that corner.

172
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:07,593
Oh ok.

173
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:37,175
Hey.

174
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,042
Huh?

175
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:41,650
Should we try it out?

176
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:47,080
But, I've already tried long distance,

177
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:48,487
and it didn't really work out though.

178
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:50,784
Come on,

179
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:53,534
even if we were to break up,

180
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,174
we could always go back
to being friends with benefits again.
