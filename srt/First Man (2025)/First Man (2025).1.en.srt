- Are you okay?
- Yes.

- Aren't you cold?
- It is a little cold.

Tell him I'm not coming.

9
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,870
You should go, Dong Seok.

10
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,370
It's only natural that your father
disapproves of me.

11
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,950
What's so natural about it?

12
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,950
The woman I love...

13
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,950
is you, Jung Suk Hee.

14
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,620
He's not the one getting married, I am.

15
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,160
But still.

16
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,160
From your father's point of view,

17
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,160
I'm an orphan with nothing to my name.

18
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,500
Why would he want me
for a daughter-in-law?

19
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,670

What on earth is wrong with you?

43
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,110
How have you been conducting yourself
to get mixed up with all these women?

44
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,410
And now that showgirl, Chae Hwa Young,
claims she's pregnant with your child?

No, that's impossible.

47

As if the orphan, Suk Hee, wasn't enough,
now it's a showgirl?

48
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,030
Don't even think of bringing
those low-class people into my house.

49
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,270
Father, this has nothing to do with me.

Chae Hwa Young?

51
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,370
This claim that she's carrying my child
is completely absurd.

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,010
- What?
- For the record,

53
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,640
Suk Hee is very capable and smart.

54
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,010
She even passed the first round
of the bar exam.

55
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,710
You keep looking down on her as an orphan,
but what's so wrong with that?

Marital connections
are very important for a businessman.

61

- Why don't you understand that?
- Suk Hee...

62
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,670
is more than worthy of being my wife.

I'll take care of it.

64

will raise you well.

177
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Little one.

178
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,590
Until this scandal with Chae Hwa Young
blows over,

179
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,520
you're going to our branch in France.

180
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,350
(6 months later)

181
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,190
Your amniotic fluid is lower than normal,
so we need to monitor you closely.

182
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,690
And you need to get complete bed rest.

183
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,860
You especially have to avoid stress.

184
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,240
If you notice anything unusual,
come to the hospital right away.

185
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,210
I came to the rural hospital out here,
and all they do is nag.

186
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,240
How annoying.

187
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,580
Hey, stop it. People are watching.
Just start the car.

188
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,190
But...

189
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,190
are you really going to have this baby
on your own?

190
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,320
Why are you asking that now?
Isn't it obvious?

191
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,430
Where is this coming from all of a sudden?

192
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,370
We're just receiving this breaking news.

193
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,670
Ma Dong Seok, the vice president
of Dream Department Store,

194
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,040
has gone missing while yachting
near Monaco.

195
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,310
According to witnesses,

196
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,580
there were reports of what sounded like
a large explosion near the yacht.

197
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,680
After hearing the news,
Chairman Ma immediately left for Monaco...

198
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,220
with his employees.

199
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,550
- Sweetheart, what's wrong?
- No.

200
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,520
Dong Seok...

201
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,360
No, this can't be happening to him.

202
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,750
What's the latest?
Is Chairman Ma back from Monaco?

203
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,650
- Yes, he just got to his residence.
- That's not what I'm asking!

204
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,120
What about Dong Seok?
What happened to him?

205
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,660
Did they find him or not?

206
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,690
Apparently, he's still missing.

207
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,130
Don't worry too much.
They haven't found a body yet,

208
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,470
- so he could still be alive somewhere.
- So much time has gone by already.

209
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,840
If they haven't found him by now,
he's dead.

210
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,240
Dong Seok is dead!

211
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,140
He's had more than enough time
to become fish food by now.

212
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,450
You're happy about this, aren't you?
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

213
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,490
- Chae Hwa Young.
- What?

214
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,660
You were praying for this to happen,
weren't you?

215
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,330
You think I don't know you? Dream on.

216
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,900
Even if something happened to Dong Seok,
I'm never going back to you.

217
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,500
I know.

218
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,870
You're way too good for me.
I wouldn't dream of it.

219
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,940
Good. As long as you know your place.

220
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,270
Still,

221
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,710
just know that
I'll always be here for you.

222
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Are you okay?

223
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,020
Get the car ready.

224
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,150
Since it's come to this,

225
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,830
I need to have it out with Chairman Ma.

226
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,200
There's no need to cry.

227
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,600
Dong Seok isn't dead.

228
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,610
I don't care what anyone says.

229
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,580
My Dong Seok isn't dead.
I'm sure he's alive out there somewhere.

230
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,480
Yes.

231
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,080
I hope so too, Father.

232
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,750
How far along are you?

233
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,120
I'm eight months along.

234
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,330
This is your grandson, Father.
And he's Dong Seok's son.

235
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,700
It's a boy.

236
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
Everyone says I look like
I'm having a boy.

237
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,870
And how can you prove
that baby is Dong Seok's?

238
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,110
How could you say such a thing?

239
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,640
That's just cruel.

240
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,940
I'm not the kind of woman
who sleeps around.

241
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,850
Do you think
all actresses are just bar girls?

242
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,710
My point is,

243
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,920
prove that the child is Dong Seok's.

244
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,090
Then...

245
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,160
I'll accept you as my daughter-in-law.

246
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,360
This child is Dong Seok's.

247
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,300
Fine.

248
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,660
After I have this baby,

249
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,370
I will prove without a doubt
that he is Dong Seok's child.

250
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,100
And when I do,

251
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,170
you will apologize
for what you said to me.

252
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,340
I just...

253
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,380
feel so incredibly wronged, Father.

254
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,520
Stop the car!

255
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,630
That woman! That's Jung Suk Hee!

256
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,000
Her belly...

257
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,100
She's pregnant too?

258
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,550
Is she carrying Dong Seok's baby?

259
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,580
(8-25 Namseon-dong, Hangang-gu, Seoul)

260
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,120
Dong Seok.

261
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,290
Nothing's really happened to you, has it?

262
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,320
I intended to raise this child
without you.

263
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,390
But I can't even bear
the thought of you...

264
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,190
no longer being in this world.

265
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,960
Now that Chairman Ma is back from Monaco,

266
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,000
I'll ask what's happened,

267
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,640
if they've found you,
or if you're gone forever.

268
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,710
That's all I'll ask.

269
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,910
Just that.

270
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,440
No way.

271
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,580
I absolutely cannot let Jung Suk Hee
meet with Chairman Ma.

272
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,550
Dong Seok's child...

273
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,920
has to be my baby. Mine alone.

274
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,830
What is this? Why won't it open?
Open the door!

275
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,790
What do you think you'll accomplish
by running out there?

276
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,970
I have to stop her. I can't let
Jung Suk Hee see Chairman Ma.

277
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,570
And stopping her now
is going to make that baby just disappear?

278
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,700
Lee Kang Hyuk!

279
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,270
Open this door! Open it!

280
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,940
- She already rang the doorbell.
- What?

281
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,050
Darn it.

282
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,860
This is your grandson, Father.
And he's Dong Seok's son.

283
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,260
It's a boy.

284
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,530
A son, she says...

285
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,930
A grandson to carry on my legacy.

286
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Fine.

287
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,800
After I have this baby,

288
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,370
I will prove without a doubt
that he is Dong Seok's child.

289
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,140
Seeing how she's so confident about it,

290
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,110
the baby must be Dong Seok's.

291
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,550
If that's the case,

292
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,780
then I'll leave my grandson...

293
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,820
everything I have.

294
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,730
Hey, Ms. Kim. I heard the chairman's back.

295
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,260
Does that mean they've given up
on finding his son?

296
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,300
Tell me about it.
They haven't even found his body.

297
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,040
Everyone's saying it's hopeless.

298
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,040
That's terrible.

299
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,970
What am I going to do?

300
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,780
Dong Seok, what am I going to do?

301
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,400
I'm in love with someone else,

302
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,040
and I am going to marry her.

303
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,970
In your dreams, Jung Suk Hee.
Just give up and go home.

304
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,040
You can never meet Chairman Ma.

305
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,910
My child is more than enough...

306
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,180
as Dong Seok's child.

307
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,220
You think I'll let you have that baby
without a fight?

308
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,190
You are never having that baby.

309
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,090
Tail her, but be discreet.

310
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,470
With Dong Seok gone,
you think you can raise his child alone?

311
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,830
Not a chance.

312
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,210
Oh, gosh.

313
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,650
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
I meant to be right back from my break...

314
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,520
Where have you been?
Are you planning on working today or what?

315
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,280
I'm sorry. I'll get right to it.

316
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,590
Excuse me, can we get some more kimchi?

317
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,260
- Sure.
- Hurry up.

318
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,760
Here you are.

319
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,710
I'm heading out for the day.

320
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,180
I can't stand Jung Suk Hee.

321
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,050
How can she be just as pregnant as I am?

322
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,190
Does that even make sense to you?

323
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,890
I think you're the one
who's not making any sense.

324
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,590
What's that supposed to mean?

325
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,630
I have Reserve Forces Training tomorrow,
so I can't come.

326
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You can go to the hospital alone, right?

327
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,270
So your Reserve Forces Training
is more important than I am?

328
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,370
Good night.

329
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,540
Jung Suk Hee.

330
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,450
How am I going to stop you?

331
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,640
I have to do something.

332
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,850
That's it. I'll just run her over.

333
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,350
Then the baby and that woman
will both be...

334
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,170
- Hey, let's go!
- That was a total slam dunk!

335
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,580
- Do you want to hit the arcade?
- See you at the entrance.

336
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,580
My mom said I had to get home.

337
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,380
Darn it.

338
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,780
Dong Seok isn't dead.

339
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,580
They never even found a body.

340
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,780
That's right.

341
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,050
So, pull yourself together, Jung Suk Hee.

342
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,790
You're a mother now.

343
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,690
You need to be strong...

344
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,590
like a mother should be.

345
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,630
I can do this.

346
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,370
Who says you get to be a mother?
That's ridiculous.

347
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,010
What's happening?

348
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,210
All right, Jung Suk Hee.

349
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,340
This is where you live, is it?

350
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,350
Now that I know where you work
and where you live,

351
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,120
you just wait.

352
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,210
No, my baby.

353
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
No.

354
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,380
No way.

355
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,390
No.

356
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,420
No, this can't be happening.

357
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,030
No.

358
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,710
Gosh, you startled me.

359
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,010
Because you're twins,

360
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,180
are you competing to see
who kicks the hardest?

361
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,220
All right. Have all the fun you want...

362
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,490
as long as you're born healthy.

363
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,560
Ok Hee.

364
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,860
Tok Hee.

365
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,330
I'm going to take such good care of you.

366
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,530
Okay?

367
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,510
- Prepare for surgery!
- Yes.

368
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,580
Hurry!

369
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,750
Please...

370
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,920
No.

371
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,360
Nothing can happen to my baby.

372
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,260
Please save my baby.

373
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
Please.

374
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,060
(The First Man)

375
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,500
What do you mean I'm fired?

376
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,530
"Room and board. Mature women welcome."
This is a godsend!

377
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,540
My goodness.
You must have a big baby in there.

378
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,210
- It's because they're twins.
- Twins?

379
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,540
The chairman is here.

380
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,740
What are you doing? Open the door!

381
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:39,280
- I smell wine.
- Oh, no. What if I get caught?

382
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,660
