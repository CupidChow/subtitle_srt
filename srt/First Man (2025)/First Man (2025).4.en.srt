<i>- I'm sorry</i>

00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,540
<i>- I'm sorry</i>
<i>- I'm sorry</i>

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,610
<i>- I'm sorry to leave you behind</i>
<i>- I'm sorry to leave you behind</i>

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,980
You're doing great!

00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,450
<i>- I'm sorry</i>
<i>- I'm sorry</i>

00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,590

<i>- I'm sorry to leave you behind</i>
<i>- I'm sorry to leave you behind</i>

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,630
Tae Pyung! What do you want to be
when you grow up?

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,660
A singer!

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,300
All right.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,140
Manager Hwang, what did you just say?

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,940
Are you saying the papers already reported
I had a daughter?

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,410
Yes. I think someone
at Dream Department Store leaked it.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,410
I haven't even found the baby yet,
and it's already out.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,280
All right.
Let me know if you hear anything else.

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,220
Darn, this is infuriating.

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,710
- Darn it.
- Did you see?

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,680
- No.
- Darn it.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,380
- Hey.
- Gosh.

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,880
Darn it.

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,710
Hey.

22
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,530
Darn it.

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,030
- Let's go.
- All right.

24
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,870
Gosh, where is she?

25
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,530
A car...

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,330
Stop the car!

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,430
Stop! Stop the car!

28
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,870
Stop!

29
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,570
Thank you. Thank you so much.

30
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,240
My babies, we're saved.

31
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,180
Thank you.

32
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,110
Thank you!

33
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,220
Please, hurry. Quick!

34
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,690
We're being chased.

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,160
If they catch us, we're dead!

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,790
Horrible men are trying to take my babies.

37
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,260
They're horrible men.

38
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,460
Please just drive. Hurry!

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,830
Please step on it.

40
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,870
No!

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,910
No!

42
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,980
Dong Seok, you fool.

43
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,350
Where on earth are you?

44
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,490
Are you even alive?

45
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,990
Your daughter was born.
You have a daughter!

46
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,500
Let go! Get off...

47
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,170
Let go of me!

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,940
Let go of me!

49
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,540
Let go of me! I said, let go, you jerks!

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,280
Chae Hwa Young.

51
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,510
You're Actress Chae Hwa Young, aren't you?

52
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,480
Why did you pretend to be a nurse?
What is all this?

53
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,780
Why are you doing this?
Are you trying to take my baby?

54
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,450
Why?

55
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,560
But you were pregnant too.

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,290
I saw the news
that you were having Dong Seok's baby.

57
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,930
Then why are you doing this to me? Why?

58
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,160
Shut it!

59
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,530
What do you think you're doing?

60
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,940
My baby died because of you.

61
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,570
Because of you!

62
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,940
What did I do?
How is it my fault that your baby died?

63
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,480
Explain yourself!

64
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,080
No! Give me back my baby! No!

65
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,580
Jung Suk Hee, get this straight.

66
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,220
From now on, this baby is mine.

67
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,660
I said she's my baby now!

68
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,160
No...

69
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,330
I'm the one who went through labor
for this baby.

70
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,500
How can she possibly be yours,
Chae Hwa Young?

71
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,370
This is insane.

72
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,130
What kind of monster are you?

73
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,170
Give her to me. She's my baby!

74
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,810
She's my baby!

75
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,240
- Never. I won't allow it!
- Shut it.

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,610
Or I'll take your other baby too.

77
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,180
No! Give me my baby back!

78
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,550
Give her back!

79
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,050
You can't do this!

80
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,320
No...

81
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,260
No, that's my baby.

82
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,590
Please give her back.

83
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,270
Ms. Chae Hwa Young.
I'll do anything you want.

84
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,670
Just please, not my babies.

85
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,970
Please give my babies back.

86
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,710
Please don't do this!

87
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,050
You're a mother
who has carried a child before.

88
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,550
To do something this cruel,

89
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,380
you, of all people, should know better.

90
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,420
Stop before you do something even worse.

91
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,350
Let's just end this here.

92
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,160
I didn't see anything.
I didn't hear anything.

93
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,690
If you just give me back my babies,

94
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,930
I'll keep my mouth shut forever.

95
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,400
So please...

96
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,700
Please give my babies back.

97
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,140
Please spare their lives.

98
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,110
Chae Hwa Young!

99
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,310
What do you want me to do?

100
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,680
Like this?
Should I get on my knees and beg?

101
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,850
Just tell me what I have to do.

102
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,390
You think I want to be doing this?

103
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,230
If you had just stayed away
from Dong Seok,

104
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,760
things wouldn't have gotten so twisted.

105
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,660
Your very existence is a sin.

106
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,030
You want to know what you can do?

107
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,500
You're asking me what you can do?

108
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,970
Get out of my sight. Just disappear!

109
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,500
That's the only way!

110
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,540
Die! Just disappear!

111
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,370
Die!

112
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,410
- Let go!
- Hwa Young, stop.

113
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,080
Let me go!

114
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,880
I said, let go!

115
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,050
My baby wouldn't have died
if it weren't for this wench!

116
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,850
You want to know what you can do?

117
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,720
Bring my baby back to life!

118
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,420
Just bring my baby back!

119
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,990
Your baby?

120
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,730
Please just spare my baby.

121
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,460
I don't care if I die. My baby...

122
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,570
Just please spare my baby.

123
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,310
Lock them both in the warehouse.

124
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,810
Get rid of them after dark.

125
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,680
The mother and her daughter.

126
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,620
Both of them.

127
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,360
Please spare my baby!

128
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,690
- Please.
- Lock them in the warehouse!

129
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,800
What are you waiting for?

130
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,400
Please...

131
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Darn it.

132
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,900
Open up!

133
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,230
Open this door, you monsters!

134
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,400
Aren't you afraid of the law?

135
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,140
Please let us out.

136
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,440
I'll live like I'm dead, I promise.

137
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,510
I didn't see anything.

138
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,520
I heard nothing.

139
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,290
Please...

140
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,470
Please...

141
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,160
My baby.

142
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,790
There's no way we're dying in here.

143
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,400
Just hang on a little longer.

144
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Just a little longer.

145
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,700
Guard them well.

146
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,470
And erase every trace
that we were ever here.

147
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,040
Yes, sir. Don't you worry.

148
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,210
- Go on ahead, sir.
- Go on ahead, sir.

149
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,650
Kang Hyuk.

150
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,050
Wouldn't it be safer
if you stayed and finished things up?

151
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,860
You said your baby was sick
and had to go to the hospital.

152
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,290
Everyone in the country knows who you are.
How could I let you go there alone?

153
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,430
Besides, we have to wait
until dark to deal with them.

154
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,230
I'll come back and handle everything.
Don't you worry.

155
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,040
First, let's get to the hospital.

156
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,210
My baby...

157
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,320
Mommy will do whatever it takes...

158
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,520
to make sure you get out of this alive.

159
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320
Even if...

160
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,230
it costs Mommy her life...

161
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,830
Mommy...

162
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
will...

163
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,470
save you.

164
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,340
Mommy's bracelet...

165
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,710
will bring you both...

166
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,250
good luck.

167
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,280
I love you.

168
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,420
Ok Hee.

169
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,920
Dong Seok.

170
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,990
My boy.

171
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,890
You must still be alive.

172
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,030
Right, Dong Seok?

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,930
Should I have let him
marry the girl he loved?

174
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,200
Maybe I should try to find her, even now.

175
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,580
There's an article saying
Ms. Chae Hwa Young had a daughter.

176
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
I saw it.

177
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,230
Hello.

178
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,100
- Hi.
- Who is it?

179
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,200
I'm here to see Jung Suk Hee.
The one studying for the bar exam here.

180
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,170
I'm a friend of Suk Hee's.

181
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,910
I just wanted to drop this off for her.

182
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,640
The bar exam?

183
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,850
You really don't remember
the pretty woman studying for the bar?

184
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,120
Where on earth did Suk Hee go?

185
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,390
I don't know about any bar exam
or whatever,

186
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,360
but the person who rented this place
for a month is already gone.

187
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,270
- What? She left?
- Yes.

188
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,330
It looked like she packed and left.

189
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,200
I guess I just missed her.

190
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,270
You don't happen to know where she went?

191
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,040
How am I supposed to know that?

192
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,710
Dad.

193
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,550
We can't see Aunt Suk Hee today?

194
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,250
I guess not, honey.

195
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,020
Maybe she's studying at a nearby temple.

196
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,320
- Thank you for your time.
- Okay.

197
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,890
Let's go!

198
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,730
Darn it.

199
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,210
Did I just hear something
from the storage shed?

200
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,380
Maybe it's a cat.

201
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,200
Pardon? You mean Ms. Jung Suk Hee?

202
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,440
Was the girl Dong Seok liked
named Jung Suk Hee?

203
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,540
Yes. I believe she'd even passed
the first round of the bar exam.

204
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,880
What's she up to these days?

205
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,810
Ever since Vice President Ma Dong Seok
left for the overseas branch,

206
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,080
- we haven't looked into that, so...
- So you don't know?

207
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,220
I apologize, sir.

208
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,990
- Should I find out?
- No, don't bother.

209
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,990
I'm pretty sure they broke up
a long time ago anyway.

210
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,930
Now that Chae Hwa Young
has had his daughter,

211
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,730
what's the point of finding her?

212
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,370
It would only upset Hwa Young.

213
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,800
For some reason today,

214
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,140
I can't help but wonder.

215
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,410
What if I had just given in
and let him have what he wanted...

216
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,680
with Jung Suk Hee,

217
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,620
the one Dong Seok loved so much?

218
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,020
No.

219
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,920
It's a pointless thought.

220
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,860
Get rid of all the photos
in Dong Seok's room.

221
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,630
Hwa Young would be upset if she saw them.

222
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,020
My baby.

223
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,820
My sweet, gentle baby.

224
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,220
Get rid of them after dark.

225
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,760
The mother and her daughter.

226
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,160
Both of them.

227
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,860
It's already getting dark.

228
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
My baby.

229
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,230
I have to save you.

230
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,970
But how?

231
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,430
That woman, Chae Hwa Young,
is tricking the chairman,

232
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,700
pretending that she gave birth to her.

233
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,340
It looks like
she's going to raise your sister.

234
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,970
That's why...

235
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,510
you have to live.

236
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,110
If you can just stay alive,

237
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,480
you'll be able to meet Tok Hee someday,
Ok Hee.

238
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,350
How can Mommy...

239
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,450
protect you?

240
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,190
That's it.

241
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,630
It's the only way.

242
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,770
My baby.

243
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,170
Mommy...

244
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,470
will protect you, no matter what.

245
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,090
Go take care of Jung Suk Hee right now.

246
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,330
No loose ends. Make it clean, you hear me?

247
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,030
Got it.

248
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,300
Give me the baby. Your arms must be sore.

249
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,250
It's done.

250
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,460
We're over the first hurdle.

251
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,860
That must've been hard.

252
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,560
Maybe you should've gotten an IV drip.

253
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,960
Are you crazy?

254
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,170
Do you want the hospital to announce
that I didn't actually give birth?

255
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,040
- That's not what I meant...
- Enough. I told you, clean up this mess.

256
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,210
If that sly fox Chairman Ma finds out,

257
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,410
all our work will be for nothing.

258
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,210
The whole thing will come crashing down.

259
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,480
Right, I get it.

260
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,820
But Chairman Ma will want
a DNA test right away.

261
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,790
What do you think
I went through all this for?

262
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,690
- That baby is Dong Seok's daughter.
- Twins, of all things...

263
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,560
That's why the other one
can't be allowed to live.

264
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,930
And as for Jung Suk Hee,
who knows everything,

265
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,900
we have to shut her up for good.

266
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,170
This looks delicious.

267
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,310
Hey, you kids have one too.
Why won't this break off?

268
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,150
You too. Here.

269
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,250
So? It's good, right?

270
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Yes.

271
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,820
- But, Dad.
- Yes?

272
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,050
When are we going to see Aunt Suk Hee?

273
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,020
I'm not sure.

274
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,860
Let's stay at this inn tonight.

275
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,790
Tomorrow, we'll look for her
in a nearby temple or hermitage.

276
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,000
We have to at least see her before we go.

277
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:33,480
<i>When Mommy's in the island's shade</i>

278
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,180
- So beautiful, my daughters.
<i>- Gathering oysters</i>

279
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,450
- Ok Hee, Tok Hee.
<i>- from the sea</i>

280
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,450
This bracelet will bring
you both good luck.

281
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,620
<i>- Baby is left all alone</i>
- Mommy knitted these for you.

282
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,230
Wear these bracelets...

283
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:54,900
- and always be happy.
<i>- And watches the house alone</i>

284
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:02,440
<i>The sea sings</i>

285
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,240
<i>A lullaby</i>

286
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,250
No! Give me back my baby! No!

287
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,450
<i>- Head resting</i>
- From now on, this baby is mine.

288
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,420
<i>- On an arm</i>
- I said she's my baby now!

289
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,990
She's my baby!

290
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,630
<i>- Baby slowly falls asleep</i>
- Never. I won't allow it!

291
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,230
My baby.

292
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Live.

293
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,770
We...

294
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,700
have to survive and see each other again.

295
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,230
You're here, boss.

296
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,400
You cleaned this place up
without a trace, right?

297
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,370
Of course. Don't worry, boss.

298
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,370
- Where are the other guys?
- They're inside finishing up.

299
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,940
Have you been drinking already?

300
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,750
- I'm sorry, boss.
- Open the door!

301
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,590
You jerks! Open the door!

302
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,620
Aren't you afraid of the skies' judgment?

303
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,420
You're all scum!

304
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,260
Open the door!

305
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,060
Open the door right now!

306
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,600
Open up!

307
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,770
Open this door right now!

308
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,030
Open up!

309
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,040
Open up!

310
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,680
Darn it!

311
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
It stings!

312
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,850
My eyes!

313
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,850
Darn it!

314
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,060
- Darn it!
- What are you doing? Go after her!

315
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,700
She's carrying a baby,

316
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,370
so she can't be running fast.

317
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,870
If we lose her, we're all dead.
Go get her now!

318
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,740
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

319
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,250
- Hey, get out here!
- Everybody out, now!

320
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,250
This way!

321
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,090
Over here!

322
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,960
Hurry up and catch her!

323
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,430
Move it!

324
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,470
If I get caught now,
my Ok Hee will be in danger.

325
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,700
Whatever it takes,
I have to buy more time.

326
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,000
That's right.

327
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,780
As long as you can live,
I'm ready to die right now.

328
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,040
My baby. My little one.

329
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,150
You have to live, no matter what.

330
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,650
Okay?

331
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,430
Over there!

332
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,540
She couldn't have gotten far.

333
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,550
We can't let her get away.
We must catch her.

334
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,680
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

335
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,990
No. I have to hold on longer.

336
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,620
Please.

337
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,810
My baby.

338
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,610
Mommy's so sorry.

339
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,320
Why don't you just give up, Jung Suk Hee?

340
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,060
Stay back! You filthy scumbag!

341
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,590
You monster!

342
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,360
Do you have no fear of the skies?

343
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,160
Jung Suk Hee.

344
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,400
What do you plan to do with that?

345
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,770
If you come any closer,

346
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,570
I'll stab you.

347
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,110
That's enough.

348
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,010
Just come with me quietly.

349
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,470
Ok Hee, Tok Hee.

350
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,070
I'm so sorry you were both born
as my daughters.

351
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,680
But still, please be happy.

352
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,180
Live a long and happy life.

353
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,380
Promise me you'll live a good life.

354
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
(Filming with newborns was conducted...)

355
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,550
(under parental supervision
with safety and rest.)

356
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,390
(The First Man)

357
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,890
What's a baby doing here?

358
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,190
Where's your mommy?

359
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,800
This is exactly like mine.

360
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,030
Welcome!

361
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,430
