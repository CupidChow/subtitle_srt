=The Girl Inside Me=

2
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,799
It worked right away, didn't it?

4
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,959
I have suffered
from eye disease for years.

5
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,400
And you said it could be cured.

6
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,120
That's just nonsense.

7
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,879
How dare you petty being

8
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,439
try to deceive our lord?

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
I'll make you pay.

10
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,560
I dare not deceive you, my lord.

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,120
- Drown him in the pond.
- Understood.

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,152
My lord.

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,719
You...

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,400
(It makes no sense.)

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,200
(His eyes were fine
after he put on the glasses.)

16
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,519
(This lord is so cunning.)

17
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,359
What a prick.

18
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,599
Your Highness, Lord Zhennan's mansion
is heavily guarded.

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,640
It's way too hard to get someone out.

20
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,200
But to kill someone

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,560
is quite doable.

22
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,680
Send people to rescue him tonight.

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,959
Make a great commotion.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,079
Your Highness, you want to protect him?

25
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,120
Firstly, the bigger the commotion,

26
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,319
the more my uncle would
think of this man as a prodigy.

27
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,519
So he wouldn't kill him.

28
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,680
Secondly, I need to retrieve something.

29
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,840
I could use some distraction.

30
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,920
Please think twice.

31
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,919
The command token is strictly guarded
in the Tianji Pavilion

32
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,759
at Lord Zhennan's mansion.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,639
You shall not endanger yourself.

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,319
The command token
can summon all the heroes.

35
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,360
I need manpower
to deal with the Sixth Lord.

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,719
Master Chu, are you alright?

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,439
What a terrible mistake.

38
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,599
I misunderstood my lord.

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,840
He told me to drown the disobedient pig.

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,479
I thought he was referring to you.

41
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,240
What a mistake. I'm so sorry.

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,039
(Yeah, yeah.)

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,719
(This freaking lord is ruthless.)

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,240
(He's a formidable opponent.)

45
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,560
Chu.

46
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,599
This thing you've given me

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,879
can't fully cure my eye disease,

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,360
but it features exquisite craftsmanship.

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,599
I am very fond of it.

50
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,879
I will give you a gift in return.

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Got it.

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,680
My long-built reputation is ruined.

53
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:17,960
Lust is like a sharp knife
that scrapes the bone.

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,120
It's hard for someone flawless
to gain the trust of others,

55
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,280
especially an old fox like the lord.

56
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,280
Fine, you got a few ladies.

57
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,759
But why did you get those guys?

58
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,680
I-I-I'm warning you.

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,960
You'll get exposed like this.

60
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,719
They are very likely
to be the lord's informants.

61
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,400
Come on, young master, let's drink.

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,719
Come on, drink up.

63
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,599
Come on, buddy. Have a drink.

64
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,280
You too.

65
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,159
And you want to monitor me?

66
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,080
The Sixth Lord is so crafty.

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,319
I've got to go.

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,719
(Mansion of Lord Zhennan)

69
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,840
Assassin!

70
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,879
Where did the assassin go?

71
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,439
Y-Your Highness.

72
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,480
Your Highness.

73
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,079
The assassin disappeared around here.
Search carefully.

74
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:54,879
Understood.

75
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,639
Search the rooms one by one.

76
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,279
Understood.

77
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,399
Search.

78
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,319
Look at you, acting so inexperienced.

79
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,199
Are you so excited to hold her?

80
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,439
W-What should I do? I'm so nervous.

81
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,600
You're not grasping the chance.

82
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,519
Come on, let me take over.

83
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,879
Go ahead.

84
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,079
You surely know how to have fun.

85
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,800
Yeah.

86
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,199
(Scoundrel! How dare you offend me!)

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,680
How dare you offend the princess?

88
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,600
Does it feel good?

89
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,519
Oh, my God.

90
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:06,800
You...

91
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,240
Turn around.

92
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,319
(Oh no.)

93
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,759
Sir, my chick is a bit shy.

94
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,319
You're too imposing,
so she dares not turn around.

95
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,600
Enough talk. Hurry up.

96
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,560
Sweetie.

97
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,879
Just show your face
real quick. It's okay.

98
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,720
Let him have a look
and it's going to be fine.

99
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Let's go.

100
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,319
Rest assured, Your Highness.
They're gone.

101
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,839
That's not right.

102
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,360
They know how I look.

103
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,240
How could they leave so easily?

104
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,720
Is there a chance

105
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,040
that you scared them away?

106
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,319
She's not so tough, either.

107
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,879
I suppose anyone would react like that.

108
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,279
I'll leave it to you now.

109
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,199
Are you sure you won't do anything?

110
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,199
No, no.

111
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,439
Caress her.

112
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,040
No, I won't.

113
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,480
Caress her.

114
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,879
You idiot.

115
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:51,879
Give me your hand.

116
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,480
- Let go.
- Give it to me.

117
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,800
Caress her.

118
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,879
Let go.

119
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,800
Hurry up.

120
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,040
Don't mess around.

121
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,920
Get down. I'll do it.

122
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,199
(May time stop at this moment.)

123
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,040
(My Tian is so handsome.)

124
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,279
Let go.

125
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,720
I don't know what talent you've got

126
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,799
that made Qingcheng ask me to save you.

127
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,080
Speaking of talents,

128
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,559
I've got plenty of those.

129
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,919
If you're willing,

130
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,279
we can have a long talk.

131
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,600
I'll tell you slowly.

132
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,320
No need.

133
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,080
I have to tell you something else.

134
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,080
Spill it.

135
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,679
You may have to go back again.

136
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,559
The princess is still in that room.

137
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,759
Still laughing?

138
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,679
We have offended the princess.

139
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,879
We're doomed.

140
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,320
And we offended the lord.

141
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,679
We're doomed.

142
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,320
Why are you scared?

143
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,559
There's nothing a fairy can't do.

144
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,799
I am very much looking forward
to what's going to happen.

145
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
W-What are you doing?

146
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,399
I saved the princess.

147
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,480
She's in debt to me.

148
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,840
I'm so jealous.

149
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,799
My Tian is holding another woman.

150
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,039
But they do make a good match.

151
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,120
It's good that the princess is fine.

152
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,279
They are the perfect match.

153
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,600
My lord, will you
put the princess down first?

154
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,480
Are you commanding me?

155
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,360
I dare not.

156
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,159
Your Highness.

157
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,159
Qingcheng.

158
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,080
Qingcheng.

159
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,600
How much have you suffered

160
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
to be so frightened?

161
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,919
Qingcheng, are you all right?

162
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,080
Where is Chu Xiaoran?

163
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,919
Rest assured.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
I've put him in jail.

165
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
He won't be able to escape.

166
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,639
That lad looks ordinary,

167
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,039
has mediocre ability,

168
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:43,960
and is a bit effeminate.

169
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,120
I really don't know

170
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,399
how he caught your attention.

171
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,240
- Ruyi.
- Yes.

172
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,240
Chop off Chu Xiaoran's hands.

173
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,919
Both of them.

174
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,200
Now!

175
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,240
Yes.

176
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,432
I want to see the princess.
