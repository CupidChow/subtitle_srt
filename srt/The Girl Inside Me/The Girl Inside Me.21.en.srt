=The Girl Inside Me=

2
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:46,432
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,439
Are you really fond of me?

4
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,640
Your Highness.

5
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,879
My parents took me here
to escape famine when I was a kid

6
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,560
and passed away shortly after.

7
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,840
I was begging on the streets
on that winter day

8
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,079
when His Majesty was on a tour.

9
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,879
You saw me and said
I was pitiable in my shabby clothes.

10
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,519
Someone took me in
because of your comment.

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,439
I would have frozen to death
if it hadn't been for you.

12
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,319
So, thank you, Your Highness.

13
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,680
I kind of remember that.

14
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,519
So you've been coveting me since then?

15
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,200
What an ambitious man.

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,079
I might consider marrying you
once we settle everything.

17
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,759
No, Your Highness,
that would be too late.

18
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,560
What do you mean?
Are you tired of waiting?

19
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,840
No, I...

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
Life is too short.

21
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,319
We must cherish every day.

22
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,800
I cherish every day I spend with you.

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,199
Rest assured, Your Highness.

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,159
Since I've made up my mind,

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,599
I will remain loyal
and stay with you forever.

26
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,360
Xiaoxiao, my fairy, thank you
for devising plans for me.

27
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,520
I toast to you.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,520
You're too polite.

29
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,120
You serve the people wholeheartedly.

30
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,599
We're only making slight contributions
by sharing your burden.

31
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,439
Let's toast to Her Highness.

32
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,919
Come on.

33
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,879
To Her Highness.

34
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,639
Come on, dig in.

35
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,199
What's wrong, buddy?

36
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,159
I bit my tongue.

37
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,599
I thought you were stung by a bee
or bitten by a snake.

38
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,120
Si Tian, what's wrong?

39
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,879
I chew on the chicken bottom.

40
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,199
You are always so special.

41
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,560
My lord.

42
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,439
This is the fairy of the nine heavens.

43
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,120
I never believe in superstition.

44
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,319
I bet someone has been playing tricks.

45
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,560
But this is true, my lord.

46
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,079
The eunuch serving His Majesty
saw her in person.

47
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,360
It can't be fake.

48
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,399
Have you seen her in person?

49
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,759
I'm telling you she's not a fairy.

50
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,879
You're right, my lord.
I bet she's an imposter.

51
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm just worried

52
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,000
that His Majesty might
favor the Crown Prince again.

53
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,639
Then the supporters of the Third Prince
might change their minds.

54
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Enough.

55
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,680
They pushed me into a corner.

56
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,800
So don't blame me for striking back.

57
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,720
Pass on my words.

58
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,480
Alright.

59
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,160
That fairy looks so familiar.

60
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,160
It's like I've seen her before.

61
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,920
When hopes are won,
drink your fill in high delight.

62
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,199
And never leave your wine cup
empty in the moonlight!

63
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,000
Great!

64
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,560
Ye Qingcheng,

65
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,839
the high and mighty princess,

66
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,519
is caring so much about the image.

67
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,959
But you are concerned
about the nation and the people.

68
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,560
You are right.

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,160
You, Si Tian.

70
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,360
The carefree second-generation official.

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,920
And you, Chu Xiaoran.

72
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,600
The veteran body scrub worker.

73
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,800
I, Qu Xiaoxiao, a medical talent.

74
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,439
This gathering is something

75
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,839
that can only take place in novels.

76
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,959
That's right.

77
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,680
I just want to say,
"Let's get wasted tonight."

78
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
Cheers. Let's get wasted tonight.

79
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,199
- Cheers.
- Let's get wasted.

80
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,160
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

81
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,399
Let's get wasted.

82
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,519
Let me tell you a secret.

83
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,680
I'm not a human from this universe.

84
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,279
You say you're not a human?

85
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,160
Human? Nor... Nor am I.

86
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,959
I am a fairy.

87
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,199
It doesn't matter.

88
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,879
Just be happy, cheers.

89
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,480
I can't drink anymore, seriously.

90
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,560
- No way.
- No way.

91
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,319
Cheers.

92
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,959
I have never felt
as carefree as I do today.

93
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,399
Forget about the power and wealth.

94
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,199
I just want to be an ordinary person

95
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,959
and live a simple life

96
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
with the person I love.

97
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,040
Your Highness.

98
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,639
Is Chu Xiaoran the person you love?

99
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,519
There are so many handsome men
in this world for me to choose from.

100
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,399
How could I possibly like him?

101
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:51,679
Chu Xiaoran, do you like me?

102
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,919
Look at me in the eye and answer that.

103
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,320
No, look at me.

104
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,279
No, look at me.

105
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,039
Look at me.

106
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,519
Fine, fine.

107
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Your Highness.

108
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,279
I like...

109
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,279
Drinking alone is no fun.

110
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,879
I'm taking a bath.

111
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,039
Taking a bath?
Alright, my bathtub is huge.

112
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,639
Take a bath.

113
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,240
- Take a bath.
- Si Tian.

114
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,519
- Take a bath.
- Take a bath.

115
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,679
I'm leaving.
