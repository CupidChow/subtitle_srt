00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,640
(Trying to establish authority, huh?)

4
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,640
(As you wish.)

5
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,519
(It's time to lose it, Princess.
You can't tolerate this.)

6
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,840
How dare you
throw away the wine in front of me?

7
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
You'd better have a good explanation.

8
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,400
Otherwise...

9
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,519
How can such rubbish wine
be worthy of Your Highness's attention?

10
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,879
Please give me a second.

11
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,439
(Bloody Mary. Here we go.)

12
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,879
(This is my strategy
of delayed gratification.)

13
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,840
What do you think, Your Highness?

14
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,759
Doesn't it remind you

15
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,759
of two trusting lovers cuddling up?

16
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,199
I am very pleased.

17
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,120
Say it. What reward would you like?

18
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,919
I want you.

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,319
I want you.

20
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,120
(I confessed on your behalf. Hurry up.)

21
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,599
(Hurry up.)

22
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,240
I-I want you

23
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,439
to drink the cocktails I mix every day.

24
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,120
(So useless. This is infuriating.)

25
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,520
Let's see if you can

26
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,000
provide me with new experiences forever.

27
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,759
Of course, I can.

28
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:47,360
Your Highness
may experience it for yourself.

29
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Your Highness,
Minister Zhang has arrived.

30
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,479
Come with me.

31
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,279
I pay my respect

32
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,000
to Your Highness.

33
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,600
(He has such an imposing aura.)

34
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,759
Stop shaking. Straighten up.

35
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,920
Imagine yourself as a stud.

36
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,079
I mean, imagine yourself as sturdy.

37
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,639
Minister Zhang, if I'm not mistaken,

38
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,360
you've been a Chief Captain
for six months now, right?

39
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,439
Your Highness, it's been
six months and five days.

40
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,639
I managed to take this position

41
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,639
all thanks to your support.

42
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,120
So you haven't forgotten that.

43
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,439
The four former captains of yours

44
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,120
were assigned by me.

45
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,240
But you replaced them out of nowhere.

46
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,959
Shouldn't you explain this to me?

47
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,120
Please don't get me wrong.

48
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,720
It's normal personnel transfer.

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,480
They have done great jobs,

50
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,839
so I've promoted them by half a rank,

51
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,439
which makes them Senior Captains.

52
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,040
A nominal position without real power.

53
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,600
Well played.

54
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,920
I swear I serve Your Highness

55
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,279
without ulterior motives.

56
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,000
(To the Sixth Lord)
Do these look familiar to you?

57
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,319
These are your letters
with my Sixth Uncle.

58
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,000
Your Highness, the Sixth Lord and I

59
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,920
are merely in touch
regarding court affairs.

60
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,000
Minister Zhang, do you really think
I'm easy to fool?

61
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
I could grant you power.

62
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,399
That means I can also bring you down.

63
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,920
You blatantly accepted bribes.

64
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,199
Do you confess?

65
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,879
There are always ways

66
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,079
to make false accusations.

67
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,279
Guards, seize him.

68
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,439
Who dares?

69
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,680
I am the Chief Captain.

70
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,279
Without His Majesty's decree,

71
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,920
who dares to lay a hand on me?

72
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,240
Minister Zhang

73
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,439
attempted to defile me

74
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,480
out of disrespect and failed.

75
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,360
Embarrassed and infuriated,

76
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,720
he intended harm upon me

77
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,240
and was killed on the spot.

78
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,040
Seize him.

79
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,279
You're worried about my safety?

80
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,279
Aren't you afraid of death?

81
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,000
I am.

82
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:34,360
But I instinctively wanted to save you.

83
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,839
Why?

84
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,439
Because

85
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,720
I... I...

86
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,879
Xiaoxiao, what should I do now?

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,959
I can't be there
to help you all the time.

88
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,480
Try to improvise.

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,399
Aren't you a smooth-talker?

90
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,519
Why are you mute now?

91
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,079
Your Highness, I am not good with words.

92
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,040
But I do know

93
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,759
that if something like this
happens again,

94
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,800
I will still choose to save you
without any hesitation.
