=Episode 23=

3
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,464
(Mansion of Lord Zhennan)

4
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,799
Chu Xiaoran, what are you waiting for?
Hurry up and leave.

5
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:57,880
I'm not leaving.

6
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,320
Trust me. Leave.

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,359
Or I'll kill myself.

8
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,159
Xiaoxiao.

9
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,280
Have you forgotten?
I'm the fairy of the nine heavens.

10
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,200
I'll figure something out.

11
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,879
Hurry up and go.

12
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,599
Chu Xiaoxiao, I've let him go.

13
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,159
It's your turn.

14
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,879
All my secrets are in here.

15
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,240
Knock it on your head
and you'll find the answer.

16
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,719
(I have to die now)

17
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,159
(so that they can't hold me hostage.)

18
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,240
Try harder.

19
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,360
Xiaoxiao.

20
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:08,096
(Mansion of Lord Zhennan)

21
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,120
Chu Xiaoxiao, I swear I will
slaughter your entire family.

22
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,240
Xiaoxiao passed away

23
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,840
saving me.

24
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,639
Sorry for your loss, buddy.

25
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,160
Rest assured, I will avenge her death.

26
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,759
Xiaoxiao.

27
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,839
Simpleton, you didn't
really think I died, did you?

28
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,160
That was just a temporary body,

29
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,439
only for a month's use.

30
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,399
It's fine to be destroyed.

31
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,360
See, I'm perfectly fine here.

32
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,360
Hey.

33
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,519
Don't tell me
you've fallen in love with me.

34
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,399
From now on,
I'll take control of my body.

35
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,240
I will win over the princess.

36
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,639
You asked me if I love you.

37
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,639
My answer is...

38
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,560
Report!

39
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,720
Report! Urgent news
from the northern border.

40
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,199
The border is in jeopardy
due to the 500,000 Wu troops.

41
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,600
Qingcheng, I'm heading there
to guard the border.

42
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,040
Qingcheng.

43
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,680
Could you give me an encouraging hug?

44
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,039
Thank you.

45
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,080
The deployment of Wu troops
is to constrain our military force.

46
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,320
My uncle has made a smart move.

47
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,799
Let me analyze this.

48
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,919
First, he might
lead rebels into the palace,

49
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,720
forcing His Majesty to abdicate.

50
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,000
Secondly, he might
fabricate the imperial edict

51
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,440
to take over legitimately.

52
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,080
Thirdly, he might kill all competitors
or keep them grounded.

53
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,799
Fourthly, he might seize power
and threaten the new emperor.

54
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,200
Do you often plot coups?

55
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,960
You sound so experienced.

56
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,720
I...

57
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,480
Your Highness, bad news.

58
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,159
Things are not going in our favor.

59
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,799
You might survive if you leave now.

60
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,279
What do you take me for?

61
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,240
I will always stay by your side.

62
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,320
Do you think you're capable of that?

63
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,519
Even if mountains and gorges
are blocking the way,

64
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,679
I will fight for you to the end.

65
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
I'm going to bed now.

66
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,320
I dare you to come with me.

67
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,840
I must enter even the tiger's den
if a fair lady invites me.

68
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,200
Why are you still up there?

69
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,879
(Once I'm with Her Highness,)

70
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,879
(Xiaoxiao should be able
to go back, right?)

71
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:04,080
Do you know
what I hate about you the most?

72
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,759
(It's too dangerous tomorrow.)

73
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,200
(You'd better stay and wait for me.)

74
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,679
Xiaoxiao, the princess
has knocked me out.

75
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,360
I can't control my body now.

76
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,360
If you can't control your body,

77
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,879
what can I possibly do?

78
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,639
Let nature take its course.

79
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,519
Xiaoxiao.

80
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,440
I can see that
you're worried about the princess.

81
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,759
You still care about her.

82
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,600
She treats us like siblings.

83
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,480
Of course, I worry about her.

84
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,960
So you've fallen for her.

85
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,200
Yes, I've fallen for her.

86
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
That's for the best.

87
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,279
Take good care of the princess

88
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,559
and yourself.

89
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,840
In fact, what I've taught you
is quite useless.

90
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,960
The most important thing
about loving someone is sincerity.

91
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
I see.

92
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,600
Make sure you treat the princess well.

93
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,320
If you mistreat her, you're dead.

94
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,639
I won't.

95
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,720
That's good.

96
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,320
(Xiaoxiao, in fact,
the girl I like is you.)

97
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,360
By the late emperor's edict,

98
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,336
the Third Prince Zikun resembles
his father with noble characters.

99
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:46,144
He shall ascend the throne
as the successor

100
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:49,159
to continue the reign. Respect this.

101
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,840
His Majesty has arrived.

102
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,000
- Long live, Your Majesty!
- Long live, Your Majesty!

103
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,679
How dare you!
Why aren't you on your knees?

104
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,440
Ancestral rules say that the successor
must be the child of Her Majesty.

105
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:26,039
Not a single minister was present
before the late emperor passed away.

106
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,279
Who can prove
the authenticity of the will?

107
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,240
I think you plotted to usurp the throne.

108
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,759
That's right. I disapprove of it.

109
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,679
Gentlemen, before
the late emperor passed away,

110
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,919
the Sixth Lord, the new emperor,
and I all served by his side.

111
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,960
What's inappropriate about it?

112
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,639
Look closely. This is
the handwriting of the late emperor.

113
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,360
Isn't it fake?

114
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,879
Yeah, it could be a forgery.

115
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,839
Yeah.

116
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,519
It's forged. Yeah.

117
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,480
This is the late emperor's handwriting.

118
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,119
Really?

119
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,599
Won't you kneel to pay respect
to the new emperor?

120
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,160
Hold on.
