00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:44,448
=The Girl Inside Me=

00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,679
I will count to three.

4
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,640
If you don't confess,

5
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,479
I'll kill you.

6
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,679
If you do,

7
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,920
I'll make it painless.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,799
Three.

9
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,399
Think of something.

10
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,640
One. Kill him.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,479
Wait. Don't.

12
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,079
I confess.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,920
Your Highness.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,239
I have been a scrub worker for decades.

15
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,079
I've severed...

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,599
I mean, "served"
hundreds and thousands of people.

17
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:13,920
Well,

18
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,120
Commander Yan's death

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,319
has nothing to do with me.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,680
Because in fact, I am

21
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,560
a rare inventor.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,040
I don't have the energy
or the time to kill people.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,200
Kill him.

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,560
I-I have something here
that can prove it.

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,599
It is

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,359
a rare armor
that's impervious to blades.

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,159
Beautiful lady,

28
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,799
can you take it to Her Highness?

29
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,840
It's right in this cloth bag.

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,599
Dear God.

31
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,079
Give me a bulletproof vest to save me.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,959
Please.

33
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,719
See? I wasn't lying.

34
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,840
Your Highness, see?

35
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,479
If you and your people
put on this armor,

36
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,080
your combat power will soar.

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,840
And my lord, you will be
the most handsome man in the world.

38
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,599
Do you have any other inventions?

39
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,159
Yes.

40
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm working on them.

41
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,280
Your Highness.

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,680
Now you believe
that I am an inventor, right?

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,400
Inventor?

44
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,759
You're a descendant of Guigu?

45
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,400
Yes.

46
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,800
That's right.

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,960
Even so,

48
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,599
you are still a suspect.

49
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,719
Your Highness.

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,759
I solemnly swear that

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,120
I devote my life and soul to you

52
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,919
and I'll serve you

53
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,199
with full loyalty.

54
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,159
If I break this vow,

55
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,120
I, Chu Xiaoran,

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,759
will have no descendants

57
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,280
and be forever despised.

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,360
(This man is truly spineless.)

59
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,080
Ruyi.

60
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,800
Take him back.

61
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,560
Watch him closely.

62
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,639
Understood.

63
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,719
Qingcheng.

64
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,520
Why not leave him to me?

65
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,319
Alright.

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,519
Thankfully, I am clever.

67
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,199
Otherwise, you could have died.

68
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,079
Why do you fall for
such a mean princess?

69
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,639
How do you know?

70
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,160
I told you I'm a fairy.

71
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,360
You won't fall for
any other woman in this world?

72
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,199
What an ambitious toad.

73
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,519
The princess used to be quite sweet.

74
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,199
It was an afternoon with heavy snow.

75
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,839
We were together...

76
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,680
Stop.

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,240
Long story short.

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,360
I will fulfill your dream
as soon as possible.

79
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,160
Cooperate with me fully from now on.

80
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,759
Fulfill my dream?

81
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,800
That's right.

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,120
I'll help you win over the princess

83
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,079
and reach the pinnacle of life.

84
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
But I think that Duke is quite nice.

85
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,360
So amiable.

86
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,639
And that body of his.

87
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,839
He looks upright and decent

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,079
at first glance.

89
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,279
(Commander Yan is dead.)

90
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,800
(The evidence is rendered useless.)

91
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,199
(It's even harder to implicate)

92
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
(Lord Zhennan now.)

93
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,240
I've underestimated my Sixth Uncle.

94
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,600
We've alerted the enemy.

95
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,959
It will be hard

96
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,360
to make another move.

97
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,120
His Lordship avenges
the smallest grievance.

98
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,959
We must stay alert.

99
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,600
There's something fishy
with Chu Xiaoran.

100
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,079
Set him up to make him talk.

101
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,079
Understood.

102
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,199
(What's going on?)

103
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,040
(Why can't I move now?)

104
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,240
Who are you?

105
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,439
You didn't betray us, did you?

106
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,079
You did well by killing Commander Yan.

107
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,399
Our lord sent us to rescue you
and escort you

108
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,399
out of the city.

109
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,879
You simpleton!

110
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,720
Are you really working
for the Sixth Lord?

111
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,040
Of course not.

112
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,120
Is it a trick?

113
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,199
I see.

114
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,720
I didn't kill anyone.

115
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,759
You got the wrong guy.

116
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,399
I am just a bathhouse attendant.

117
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,319
How can I know your lord?

118
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,639
Really?

119
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,079
Really.

120
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,959
I, Chu Xiaoran, hereby swear

121
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,800
that I'll never
have descendants if I lie.

122
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,360
Boss.

123
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,680
Since he already knows our secret...

124
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,759
J-Just a minute.

125
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,040
Wait.

126
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,120
Wonderful.

127
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,120
This man is really a genius.

128
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,680
Your Highness.

129
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,480
He escaped.

130
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,519
Please punish me, Your Highness.

131
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,839
Look at me.

132
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,759
What happened?

133
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,800
Tell me everything.

134
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,120
Take the gold and spare my life.

135
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,759
Bring it here.

136
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,720
We don't like gold.

137
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,720
Tell the truth

138
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,840
and we'll spare you.

139
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,559
I have another treasure.

140
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,120
This is very rare.

141
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,639
Empress Dowager Cixi's great pearl.

142
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,680
Look.

143
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,159
Your Highness.

144
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,519
That man is way too cunning.

145
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,840
I've never heard of

146
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,720
Empress Dowager Cixi.

147
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,399
That thing was so dazzling.

148
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,399
I thought I saw my great-grandmother
who passed away a decade ago.

149
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,320
This man is really a genius.

150
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,799
Capture him.

151
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:28,960
Understood.

152
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,519
Oh no.

153
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,919
We have thoroughly
offended the princess.

154
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,240
We can't go back to the bathhouse.

155
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,679
Are you regretting it?

156
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,159
No.

157
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,039
I would have died without you.

158
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,919
Good for you.

159
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,039
Indeed, it's a pity
we can't return to the bathhouse.

160
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,240
And we won't complete
the mission anytime soon.

161
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,080
What mission?

162
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,759
Haven't you been in love
with the princess since childhood?

163
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,519
Fulfilling your dream
is my lifelong pursuit.

164
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,320
How noble of you.

165
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,600
Go on.

166
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:34,400
(Mansion of Lord Zhennan)

167
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,440
(Who is this dumb guy
with short-sightedness?)

168
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,080
Who are you, sir?

169
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,519
You blind creature.

170
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,159
This is Lord Zhennan, the Sixth Lord.

171
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:53,759
Believe me...

172
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,679
Who's the lord here?

173
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,240
(So he is that lord. He's quite cute.)

174
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,360
(Just short-sighted.)

175
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,759
What are you doing?

176
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,720
Just kidding.

177
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,840
Well...

178
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,879
I've heard that

179
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,919
my dear niece has been

180
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,480
heartless and ruthless enough

181
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,879
to set you up.

182
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,840
Tell me.

183
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,360
What talent do you have?

184
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
My lord.

185
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,720
Your words are so heartwarming.

186
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,440
Princess Qingcheng is so cruel.

187
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,919
She got me bruised everywhere.

188
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,240
Our lord asked you a question.

189
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,440
Just tell the truth.

190
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,559
Otherwise, I swear...

191
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,960
Will you stop?

00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,879
(I might get killed.
It doesn't make sense.)

194
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,600
Go on.

195
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,679
My lord.

196
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,360
I am

197
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,320
actually

198
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,799
a descendant of Guigu.

199
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,360
(Look at that face of yours.
You got bluffed, didn't you?)

200
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,600
My lord.

201
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,360
I can cure

202
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,639
your eyes

203
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,080
right away.

204
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,919
Right away, my lord.

205
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,600
Be bluffed. Please be bluffed.
