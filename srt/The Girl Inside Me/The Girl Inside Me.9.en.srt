3
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,200
Kiddo, eat more.

4
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,719
I found you some friends.

5
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,480
Have a good time. Are you happy?

6
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,879
Bad news! The Heavenly Horse
rushed into the mare's stable.

7
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,920
Congratulations
on winning the race, Your Highness.

8
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,280
Tell me what you want as a reward.

9
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,879
I'll fulfill your wish as long as I can.

10
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,079
Don't be so distant, Your Highness.

11
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,680
Call me brother-in-law.

12
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,879
What?

13
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,760
Brother-in-law?

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,439
My brother-in-law.

15
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,760
I don't have much to give you.

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,519
I'll give you a tip that can

17
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,079
keep you safe in the palace.

18
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,280
What tip?

19
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,400
Listen carefully.

20
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,680
Stay away from women

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,120
who try to get close to you,

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,840
no matter whether they do it

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
on purpose or by accident.

24
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,959
Stay alert.

25
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,200
Due to your special status,

26
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,439
they will use you,

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
set you up,

28
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:56,799
and drain you.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,599
Drain me?

30
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,480
What does that mean?

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
You'll get it one day.

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,560
Anyway, remember.

33
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,879
Women only slow you down
when you try to draw your sword.

34
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,479
Whenever you're approached
by pretty ladies,

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,800
tell me so that I keep watch for you.

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,520
Only the pretty ones?

37
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,400
That's right.

38
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,840
Because they are the best liars.

39
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,439
The pretty ones.

40
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,680
Yue, come out.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,879
(The Crown Prince
has such a unique taste.)

42
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,639
Yue, confess.

43
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,599
Do you want to set me up,

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,639
assassinate me,

45
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:38,800
use me,

46
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,919
or drain me?

47
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,840
Your Highness, I dare not
harbor such treasonous thoughts.

48
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,759
My life had been miserable
before I was brought to the palace.

49
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,199
I'm so grateful I met...

50
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:53,759
Wait.

51
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,680
Your Highness, did you go out one day

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,840
and see her being bullied?

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,199
You saved her out of good will

54
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,759
and then she told you

55
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,800
that she was from a poor family
and had to sell herself

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,759
to bury her late parents?

57
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,319
Is that the case?

58
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,719
Am I right?

59
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,599
Yeah.

60
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,439
How did you know that?

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,240
I just took her in yesterday.

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,039
Look.

63
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
I got it right.

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,680
Confess. Who sent you?

65
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,599
Is it the Sixth Lord?

66
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,159
It must be him.

67
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,759
Only he would use such nasty tricks.

68
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,319
Why did he send you to His Highness?

69
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,240
That's not true.

70
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,400
It's not necessarily poisoning.

71
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,919
It's hard to bring poison
into the palace.

72
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,400
So you're here to assassinate him.

73
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,719
She's here to assassinate you.

74
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,039
What does that imply?

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,639
She's well-trained.

76
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,120
Guards!

77
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,199
Miss, a kind reminder.

78
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,520
You've got the wrong guy.
The target is there.

79
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,280
I wish I could cut your tongue.

80
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,240
Even if I have to die today,

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,240
I will drag you down with me.

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,919
That's unnecessary.

83
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,759
I promise you a grand funeral, alright?

84
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,560
Shut up.

85
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,719
You really work for the Sixth Lord?

86
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,519
Your Highness, you are weak and foolish.

87
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,959
You're no match for the Sixth Lord.

88
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,720
Kill her.

89
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,720
Don't move.

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,639
Miss, as you can see,

91
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,199
His Highness tends to listen to me.

92
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,399
So put down the sword.

93
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,519
Let me talk to them.

94
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,680
We'll do you justice, okay? I promise.

95
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,839
You're the one
I want to kill the most right now.

96
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,680
Let's die together.

97
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,759
How dare you!

98
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,519
So beautiful.

99
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,360
Our Duke.

100
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,279
I feel dirty. I need a bath.

101
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,079
Don't go.

102
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,240
You're leaving now?

103
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,519
Stay a bit more.

104
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,360
Are you alright?

105
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,879
I'm fine.

106
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,759
Perfect timing.

107
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,879
You promised to kiss me

108
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,839
if I help you win the horse race.

109
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,480
I saved you today.

110
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,279
So we're even now.

111
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,319
How are we even just like that?

112
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,600
Ask my brother-in-law if he agrees.

113
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,399
Brother-in-law?

114
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,480
That's right.

115
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,040
My brother-in-law

116
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,000
caught that assassin.

117
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,519
Or I'd have been in real danger.

118
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,439
Brother-in-law?

119
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,120
Yeah.

120
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,920
Oh my, Young Master Chu
only met His Highness today.

121
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,639
How...

122
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:20,879
What?

123
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,600
You're not going to break

124
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,160
your promise, are you?

125
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,120
(He is still of value.
I will put up with it.)

126
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,519
Fine, see you, Your Highness.

127
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,399
Young Master Chu,
you did exceptionally well in the race.

128
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,439
But you've also offended the Sixth Lord.

129
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,319
You could be killed at any moment.

130
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,839
Ruyi.

131
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,120
Do you see me as someone
who is so afraid of death?

132
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,319
Of course not.

133
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,279
Are you sure they won't send assassins
into the Princess's Mansion?

134
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,319
Or bribe someone inside the mansion
to poison me,

135
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,879
set a fire, or something?

136
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm not sure.

137
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,040
I thought you weren't afraid.

138
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,839
It is always necessary
to take precautions.

139
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,040
As the one in charge
of the Princess's Mansion,

140
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,319
you must strengthen the defense

141
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,040
to protect the princess.

142
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,279
Rest assured.

143
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,240
Her Highness is guarded
by highly skilled secret guards.

144
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,199
She is totally safe.

145
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,480
(It's terrifying.
The assassins could sneak in.)

146
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,240
(I must stay close to the princess)

147
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,279
(just to be safe.)

148
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,679
Chu Xiaoran, why are you following me?

149
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,480
It makes me feel safe.

150
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,639
I thought you weren't afraid of death.

151
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,879
Are you a man or not?

152
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,159
Don't you know

153
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,799
the answer to that?

154
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,919
Chu Xiaoran, you'd better forget
what happened that day.

155
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,720
And don't have
any improper thoughts about me.

156
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,480
You know?

157
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,679
Your eyelashes curl when you're angry.

158
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,600
It's very pretty.

159
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Get angry more often.

160
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,120
Ouch.

161
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,679
Be careful, Your Highness.

162
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,360
Catch the assassin! Stop!

163
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,519
