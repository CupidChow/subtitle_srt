=The Girl Inside Me=

2
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,119
(Thankfully, I had the armor
offered by Chu Xiaoran.)

4
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,200
(This man is truly a genius.)

5
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
(How dare that scoundrel knock me out?)

6
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,359
(How is it satisfying)

7
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,840
(to merely chop off his hands?)

8
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,239
Guards.

9
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,319
Zuo Tang, look into Chu Xiaoran.

10
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,640
My lord, if you think he's a threat,

11
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,840
I'll just...

12
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,079
What in this world could threaten me?

13
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,159
Then why should I look into him?

14
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,840
(I almost lost my hands.)

15
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,159
(Thankfully,
the messenger came in time.)

16
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,359
(But what does the princess want again?)

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,840
You have some nerve.

18
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,560
How dare you touch me?

19
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,400
I simply adopted extreme measures

20
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,239
to save you.

21
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,239
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,760
Coward.

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,680
Get up.

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,920
Let me handle it.

25
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,480
Go ahead.

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,159
Tell me, what should I do about you?

27
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,759
I have offended Your Highness.

28
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,319
I'll hit myself to apologize.

29
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,520
Wait a second.

30
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,120
No, Your Highness.

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,879
You should do it.

32
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,319
It's your turn to hurt me.

33
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,560
I've decided. Here.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,439
Forget it.
You might as well explain to me

35
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,080
about the scars on my face.

36
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,639
That's the secret art of Guigu,

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,919
not to be disclosed.

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,240
The secret art of Guigu?

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,360
What other skills do you have?

40
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,120
Show me everything.

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,599
(Trying to probe my secrets? No chance.)

42
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,599
Your Highness, I've been
giving people scrubs for over a decade.

43
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,840
I've mastered the skill

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,919
to an unfathomable level.

45
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,960
Your Highness, your skin is so fair.

46
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,879
How about I give you a rubdown?

47
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,400
Come on.

48
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,560
How dare you?

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,759
Chu Xiaoran.

50
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,639
Do you really think

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,960
I'm unable to kill you?

52
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,280
Your Highness.

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,879
Have an ice cream
to cool off in the hot weather.

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,560
How dare you?

55
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,680
Don't you know any rules and manners?

56
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,840
Your Highness, life is so short.

57
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,439
Why don't we be bolder?

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Pursue someone.

59
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,360
Climb a mountain.

60
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,480
Chase a dream.

61
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,720
Why should we waste our limited time

62
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,639
on meaningless things?

63
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,267
♪When I forget
what I've been seeking, can I still♪

64
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:35,272
♪Wait for time to reverse
and inscribe my heartache♪

65
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,279
I treat you with sincerity.

66
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,279
That is the highest etiquette
in this world.

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,240
And it's my respect for life.

68
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:54,936
♪The encounter in the fairy tale
turns out to be fictitious♪

69
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:59,583
♪A multitude of thoughts

00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,720
Guards.

71
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,839
Your Highness.

72
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,120
Accommodate Young Master Chu.

73
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,160
The Sixth Lord will not let this go.

74
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,199
Understood.

75
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:16,040
♪Let thoughts be fickle
as time flows backward♪

76
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,008
♪Piecing together fragments of memory,

♪All the past is but a prelude,

79
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,240
Simpleton, what's wrong?

80
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,079
I thought that

81
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,639
you were just a girl with magic powers.

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,759
I mean, fairy.

83
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:52,600
What you said just now

84
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,160
enlightened me.

85
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,079
Life is finite.

86
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,680
One must do meaningful things.

87
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,759
A mere commoner like me
wants to pursue the princess.

88
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,480
That's way too unrealistic.

89
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,759
I've decided.

90
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,720
I give up.

91
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,040
Don't.

92
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,319
How can you have such a dangerous idea?

93
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,480
(If you give up,)

94
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,399
(then I won't be able to go home.)

95
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,319
But such an idea is way too unrealistic.

96
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,839
No, no.

97
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,399
Think about it.

98
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,600
Who is the closest to the princess?

99
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,519
Who?

100
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,199
You.

101
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,519
You've held her,

102
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,439
caressed her face,

103
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,399
and hit her on the head.

104
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,120
None of those nobles

105
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,720
can achieve this in their lifetime.

106
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,879
Try a little harder
and she will be yours.

107
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,199
Tell you what, I look down
upon men who give up halfway.

108
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,959
But this is really just a fantasy.

109
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,240
No way. I give up.

110
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,560
Don't worry. I've got this.

111
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,160
Sweet, huh?

112
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,079
Yeah.

113
00:07:11,552 --> 00:07:14,528
(Mansion of Lord Zhennan)

114
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,639
My lord.

115
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,279
The princess is keeping Chu Xiaoran

116
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,839
heavily guarded.

117
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,600
Our spies can't even
approach the courtyard.

118
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,160
I won't feel at ease

119
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,639
as long as he's alive.

120
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,240
My lord.

121
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,560
Aren't you overestimating him?

122
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,839
This person must die.

123
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,319
Your Highness,
I can make nine divinations.

124
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,560
This last one is reserved for me.

125
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,639
I will take this last divination.

126
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,680
Name your price.

127
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,759
Heaven below.

128
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,840
Earth above.

129
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,240
It's a trigram of pure yin.

130
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
You're asking about your marital fate?

131
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
Water over Thunder.

132
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,759
The divination says
that this person has shown up.

133
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,279
If you get this person

134
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,240
to work for you,

135
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,279
you'll get both

136
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,559
a marriage and supremacy.

137
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,399
Find out who he is.

138
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,679
I've given nine divinations.

139
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,080
I can't divine any further.

140
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,960
You have my word.

141
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,240
One more divination,

142
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,960
and your Zhang family
will rise in officialdom

143
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,639
and prosper forever.

144
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,639
Among 50 heavenly ways,

145
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,679
only 49 are derived,

146
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,759
allowing infinite changes.

147
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,120
Your Highness,
this person is not of this world.

148
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,759
He is a good talker

149
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,600
with seven stars...

150
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,320
Seven stars

151
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,080
on his body.

152
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,679
Si Tian.

153
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,360
Kiss me. Hug me. Lift me.

154
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,399
Kiss me.

155
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,759
Sweetie Tian.

156
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,240
What are you doing?

157
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,559
My fellow sisters, you want to see
this body, don't you?

158
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,320
Just a second.

159
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,639
Young Master Chu, we knocked.

160
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,120
You didn't respond, so we came in.

161
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,240
Also, Young Master Chu, you are a man.

162
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,759
We can't be your "fellow" sisters.

163
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,159
It doesn't matter.

164
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,639
You'll see enough today.

165
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,440
Don't be stingy
when it's your turn one day.

166
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
How can you do this?

167
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,159
This is so embarrassing.

168
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,159
Put on your clothes.

169
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,120
Feudal thinking is unacceptable.

170
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,600
Young Master Chu,
the princess wants to see you.

171
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,559
Ruyi.

172
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,480
Are you familiar with Si Tian?

173
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,960
What is he like?

174
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,519
Is he so aloof?

175
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,759
You won't even talk about him?

176
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,279
I didn't expect Young Master Chu
to be interested in men.

177
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,320
Exactly.

178
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,440
Let's go.

179
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,519
Your Highness.

180
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,360
Young Master Chu is here.

181
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,840
I pay my respect, Your Highness.

182
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,279
Somebody. Take off his clothes.

183
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,919
Your Highness,
you are perhaps a bit too eager.

184
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,559
We should get to know each other first.

185
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,840
Strip him.

186
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,080
No, no.

187
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:30,639
I'll do it myself.

188
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,600
