=The Girl Inside Me=

2
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,319
(Hello, welcome.)

4
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,799
Who is it?

5
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,200
(Please close the door, thank you.)

6
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:47,616
(Gentle breeze and pleasant weather)

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,280
I'm clumsy for this as a newbie.

8
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,920
Don't mind me.

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,879
(I have underestimated him.)

10
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,359
(He actually caught Dai'er.)

11
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,639
Dai'er, why did you betray Her Highness?

12
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,240
Your Highness.

13
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,360
I deserve a death sentence.

14
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,199
But they took my parents hostage.

15
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,240
If I don't kill Young Master Chu,

16
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,319
they will kill my parents.

17
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,240
You should have told us,

18
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,680
rather than act recklessly.

19
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,240
Young Master Chu, you caught her.

20
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,120
You decide what to do.

21
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
An attempted murder doesn't

22
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,080
call for a death penalty.

23
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,199
Though foolish,
you possess filial piety.

24
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,599
How about this?

25
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,840
Help us find the person
who contacted you

26
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,199
and lead us to rescue your parents.

27
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,512
What do you say?

28
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,759
Thank you, Young Master.

29
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Don't thank me.

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,280
If you want to thank someone,

31
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,879
thank our intelligent, beautiful,
and kind-hearted princess.

32
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

33
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,199
Young Master Chu pleaded for you.

34
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,599
You are spared the death penalty

35
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,639
but you shall be punished.

36
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,039
Work with Young Master Chu.

37
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,879
Ruyi, make sure to rescue her parents.

38
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,719
Understood.

39
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,759
Young Master Chu, what's your plan?

40
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,120
Simpleton, I have created
the opportunity for you.

41
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,159
Impress them.

42
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,199
How would I have any plans for that?

43
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,759
Massage my shoulders.

44
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,280
If you do a good job,

45
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,879
I will tell you a brilliant plan.

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Nice.

47
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,680
(If Dai'er completes the task,)

48
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,520
(they will meet her somewhere.)

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,199
O-Over there.

50
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,319
Now you can tell me

51
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,560
where my parents are.

52
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,199
Rest assured. You will see them.

53
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,720
You girl, you've got a great body.

54
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,680
Let me have some fun first.

55
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,639
It will be your turn later.

56
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,600
Let me go.

57
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920
Let's go.

58
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Let me go.

59
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Let me go.

60
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,240
So pretty.

61
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,399
Don't be shy.

62
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,240
How dare you hit me?

63
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,240
Let me go.

64
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,920
Help!

65
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Come on.

66
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,519
Brother.

67
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,759
Not your turn yet. What's the rush?

68
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,519
- Brother.
- What is it?

69
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,279
Look, Brother.

70
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,120
Pay for your crime.

71
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,079
Aren't you dead?

72
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,120
I didn't kill you.

73
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,439
Pay for your crime.

74
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,920
I didn't kill you.

75
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,319
You got the wrong guy.

76
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,199
It was you.

77
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,600
It wasn't me. It was...

78
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,920
It was that woman.

79
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,879
I'll take you to her.

80
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,120
Then tell me.

81
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,759
Where are the relatives

82
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,279
of the person who killed me?

83
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm going to kill them all.

84
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,680
I'll tell you everything.

85
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,920
I'll tell you everything.

86
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,680
Impressive, huh?

87
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,720
Why don't we just torture them
until they confess rather than

88
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
putting up this show?

89
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,920
What if they're fanatic assassins?

90
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,439
Of course, we have to trick them

91
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,399
and break them when they're in disarray.

92
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,399
Right?

93
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
It's pretty steady.

94
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,680
You're quite thoughtful.

95
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,199
Just like that.

96
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,040
Not only did we rescue her parents,

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,800
but we also interrogated the suspects

98
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,839
and made a few arrests.

99
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:44,279
But in the end, we only caught
a lackey of Lord Zhennan.

100
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,240
Young Master Chu
humiliated Lord Zhennan this time.

101
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,920
I bet he'll be in serious trouble.

102
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,399
If I couldn't protect one man from him,

103
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,680
how can I fight against him?

104
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,079
Indeed.

105
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,720
Have you memorized
the flirting manual I gave you?

106
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,759
It's time to test the results.

107
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,439
Come on, gain control over your body.

108
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,079
Greetings, Your Highness.

109
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,680
My Sixth Uncle
is determined to kill you.

110
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,279
What will you do?

111
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,079
Naturally, I'll keep pace
with Your Highness,

112
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,720
cling tightly to you,

113
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,519
and get into the same...

114
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,519
Young Master Chu, talk properly.

115
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,079
Y-Your Highness.

116
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,120
If liking you is a mistake,
then I'd rather

117
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,040
make the mistake over and over again.

118
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,680
You've used it wrong.

119
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,759
This is an example of common mistakes.

120
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,040
You're going to ruin it like this.

121
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,399
Get up. Let me save it.

122
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,720
You like me?

123
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,879
Who are you to say those things to me?

124
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:34,039
Your Highness,
I know this might sound arrogant.

125
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,200
But I still want to say it.

126
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,080
I like you

127
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,279
regardless of my status

128
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,279
because it's a feeling from my heart.

129
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,600
I think you are a beautiful, confident,

130
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,159
and excellent woman

131
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,039
worthy of my respect and affection.

132
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,759
Do you know the difference between us?

133
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,360
It's a huge gap

134
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,919
that is insurmountable.

135
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,879
I know, but what I want to say is

136
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,919
true love knows no class or status.

137
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,159
Because with a sincere heart,

138
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,279
we can face difficulties

139
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
and overcome obstacles.

140
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,320
I am willing to do anything for you.

141
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,240
These are my heartfelt feelings.

142
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,960
Status-wise,
you may be more distinguished.

143
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,960
But not in characters.

144
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,120
See that? When I step in,

145
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,639
it's all easy-peasy.

146
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,360
Good, I admire your courage.

147
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,879
However, you've offended me.

148
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,360
Guards.

149
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,399
Take him away for a beating.

150
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:11,600
Your turn.

151
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,799
Your Highness,
I don't think this is necessary.

152
00:10:19,648 --> 00:10:21,507
(Princess's Mansion)

153
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,440
You cause the trouble

154
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,720
and I get the beating. How's that fair?

155
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,440
You need to be tempered.

156
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,120
Once I complete the task and leave,

157
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,600
you will die at any time.

158
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,879
You must pay attention and learn.

159
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,440
If you want to learn to attack,

160
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,200
you must learn to take a beating first.

161
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,840
Got it.

162
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,919
I've been

163
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,120
racking my brains to help you.

164
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,919
But then again, I was born
to be generous in giving help.

165
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,399
Ruyi.

166
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,039
Here.

167
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:15,039
Give him some healing elixir.

168
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,279
(Her Highness rarely falls for someone.)

169
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,639
(Should I tell her)

170
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,559
(about Young Master Chu's
interest in men?)

171
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,120
How is the strength?

172
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,240
It could be better.

173
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,120
Then, how about this?

174
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,840
Stop asking.

175
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,399
It shows that you lack confidence.

176
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,039
I like listening to you.

177
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,200
Talk some more.

178
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,679
Of course.

179
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,039
I am the wind
you'll never be able to grasp.

180
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,360
Generally, you did quite well today.

181
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,039
Have you noticed?

182
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,159
Her Highness is starting to
have feelings for you.

183
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,720
Really?

184
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,200
Beating is a sign of affection,
and cursing love.

185
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,360
It's evident from all the wounds that

186
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Her Highness cares for you deeply.

187
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,879
Young Master Chu, Her Highness
told me to bring you the healing elixir.

188
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,120
See? The care has arrived.

189
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,159
At this point,
you should hold your stance.

190
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,879
Unless Her Highness
apologizes to me in person,

191
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,039
I won't accept it.

192
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,720
Really?

193
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,960
Why are you looking at me?

194
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,360
Get up now.

195
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,840
Your Highness,
just let me know if you want to see me.

196
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,480
I will show up right away.

197
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,200
From now on, you shall stay by my side.

198
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,480
She's so bossy.

199
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,720
She didn't even ask if I agreed.

200
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,519
What?

201
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,799
Why are you staring at me?

202
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,720
She's never allowed
any men close to her.

203
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,519
You're the first one.

204
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,000
But, Young Master Chu,
let me remind you.

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,799
Never overstep the bounds.

206
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,159
Her Highness's stateliness
shall not be challenged.

207
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,879
Ruyi, you are mistaken.

208
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,080
Haven't you ever felt that

209
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Her Highness is highly approachable,

210
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,799
gentle and virtuous,

211
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,519
beautiful and kind,

212
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,200
and beloved

213
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,279
by everyone?

214
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,000
From now on,

215
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,000
we will be Her Highness's
right and left arms.

216
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,720
I lend you my broad shoulders.

217
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:44,640
(Gentle breeze and pleasant weather)

218
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,519
You, come here.

219
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,000
(Look at you.)

220
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,399
(Go ahead.)

221
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,120
(Why are you scared?
Don't you remember what I taught you?)

222
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,840
Understood.

223
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,399
Pour wine for me.

224
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,799
Ruyi, show him.

225
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,279
What should I do?

226
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,000
She wants to discipline you.

227
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,080
Get up. Let me handle this.

228
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,000
(Trying to establish authority, huh?)

229
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,000
