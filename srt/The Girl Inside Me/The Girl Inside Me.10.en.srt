00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:44,448
=The Girl Inside Me=

2
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,200
Good opportunity. Come on. Take over.

4
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,159
Your Highness, what's wrong?

5
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,959
I didn't do anything.
Why did I get hit again?

6
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,560
You didn't do anything

7
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,079
and that was the mistake.

8
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,079
Be reserved when it's needed.

9
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,719
But seize the opportunity.

10
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,599
I-I don't get it.

11
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,079
You have a lot to learn.

12
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,799
Move aside. I'm going to the bathhouse.

13
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,319
Harder.

14
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,040
Are you scrubbing me or touching me?

15
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,040
Our Duke, if you keep up this attitude,

16
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,200
Her Highness might
fall for someone else.

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,079
What did you say?

18
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,680
I'm just saying

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,159
that you should lower your stance

20
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,359
and pester Her Highness

21
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,159
just like Chu Xiaoran does.

22
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,360
Pester Her Highness?

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,919
It seems you know nothing
about my charm.

24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,639
How can that guy

25
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,759
even compare with me?

26
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:17,840
Our Duke.

27
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,319
Chu Xiaoran
won the race for Her Highness.

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,840
His Highness called him
brother-in-law in public.

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,800
For real?

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,919
It seems that I must
have a proper talk with him.

31
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,639
Was that Chu Xiaoran?

32
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,080
Where?

33
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,879
I didn't see anyone.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,479
Who was giving me that rubdown?

35
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,879
Apply this three times a day.
I promise you'll be alright.

36
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,080
It's really much better.

37
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,960
Thank you, Young Master.

38
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,439
Call me Xiaoxiao.

39
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,360
- Not Young Master.
- Xiaoxiao.

40
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,240
- It's too formal.
- Young Master, how do I use this?

41
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,680
This? Open it.

42
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,400
Smells good, right?

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,439
It's for dates.

44
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,680
You can have it.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,120
- I pay my respects.
- I pay my respects.

46
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,560
Our Duke.

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,520
Nice to see you again.

48
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,599
I don't want to know

49
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,560
why you're so popular with ladies.

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,520
But I must warn you

51
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,159
that Her Highness is out of your league.

52
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,240
Our Duke, you got me wrong.

53
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,159
I don't like Her Highness.

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,800
Our Duke, would you like to know
how to pursue a girl?

55
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,240
Do I need to know?

56
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,080
I don't mind hearing about it.

57
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,919
Our Duke, you must show Her Highness

58
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,080
your fondness.

59
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,599
First, you need to know what she likes.

60
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,199
Do you know what she likes to eat,

61
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,800
what she likes to wear,

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,080
or what she likes to do?

63
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,520
It's easy for you to talk.

64
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,840
Go on.

65
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,360
You must always show your charm.

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,719
Her Highness likes powerful men.

67
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,560
And of course, you're powerful enough.

68
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,639
But then,

69
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,319
she likes obedient servants.

70
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:20,959
Don't do it.

71
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,480
Just defy her.

72
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,639
That makes you stand out.

73
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,399
And?

74
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,839
Her Highness also likes muscular men.

75
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,639
I wonder if you meet her requirements.

76
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,319
Haven't you seen my muscles?

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,304
Yeah.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,519
Perfect.

79
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,120
You meet the criteria.

80
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:45,920
Good.

81
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,959
From now on,

82
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,160
you are my sworn brother.

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,399
Tian.

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,199
Just call me Xiaoxiao.

85
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,360
Xiaoxiao.

86
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,000
My buddy.

87
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,480
Xiaoxiao.

88
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,839
Can you stop touching him, Xiaoxiao?

89
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,920
Shut up.

90
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,439
Cheers.

91
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,399
Cheers.

92
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,959
What wine is this?

93
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,160
It tastes strange

94
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,240
but refreshing.

95
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,759
It doesn't matter.

96
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,680
What matters is...

97
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,360
Zuo Tang.

98
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,519
Massage my shoulders. They're sore.

99
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,160
I work for our Duke,

100
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,199
not you.

101
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,439
Just do as I say.

102
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,199
Stop blabbering.

103
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,839
Do it.

104
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,199
Is it nice?

105
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,199
Yeah.

106
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,399
Let me tell you..

107
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,759
The lady told me

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,240
that Her Highness likes those
dark and steady men.

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,920
The darker, the better.

110
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,000
And domineering.

111
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,360
That's why she always ignores me.

112
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,279
Turns out it's because I'm pale.

113
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,480
Your Highness.

114
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,000
Our Duke and Young Master Chu
took over your bath.

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,480
I couldn't stop them.

116
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,959
By the way, Xiaoxiao.

117
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
I have a friend

118
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,600
who likes a girl.

119
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,720
That girl's birthday is coming up.

120
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,199
But he doesn't know what to give her.

121
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,759
I get it. An imaginary friend, right?

122
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,519
Give her the most valuable thing
you can find.

123
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,040
I promise she'll like it.

124
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,000
What is valuable?

125
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,839
What's the most valuable thing here?

126
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,639
Jewelry?

127
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,480
That's too expensive.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,680
Really?

129
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,480
What do you need?

130
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,639
I'll get it for you.

131
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
See? Our Duke is so generous.

132
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,199
Her Highness has arrived.

133
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Don't you three owe me an explanation?

134
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,480
What's there to explain?

135
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,040
I'm just using your bath.

136
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,879
What about it?

137
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,639
I apologize.

138
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,879
But it was Chu Xiaoran's idea.

139
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:12,800
That's right.

140
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
He lured me.

141
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,400
You...

142
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,639
How could you betray your buddy?

143
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,160
How can you win her over

144
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,439
if you're so spineless?

145
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,920
I know.

146
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,920
But you don't know

147
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,639
that she was whipping me

148
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,480
all the time when I was a kid.

149
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,319
I'm seriously traumatized.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,680
Fine then.

151
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,839
For the sake of your handsome face,

152
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,519
I forgive you.

153
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Xiaoxiao.

154
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,560
Her Highness wants to see you.

155
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,120
Let me tell you.

156
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,279
She doesn't look very happy.

157
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Be careful.

158
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,800
Got it.

159
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,160
You see that?

160
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,439
In the end,

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,160
I have to take on everything.

162
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
But rest assured.

163
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I'll shoulder the responsibility alone.

164
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,160
My buddy.

165
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,519
Xiaoxiao.

166
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,639
W-Who are you guys?

167
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,759
What's so funny?

168
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,799
Don't you find me masculine and mighty?

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,200
Exactly, our Duke has
an otherworldly charisma.

170
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,759
It's like a gift from nature.

171
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,440
That's my buddy.

172
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,399
You got me.

173
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,360
Let's get serious here.

174
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,600
The martial arts meeting is coming up.

175
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,879
The new alliance leader
will obtain the command token.

176
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,360
How confident are you?

177
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,039
I'm 90 percent sure that...

178
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,000
I won't make it.

179
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,279
However, I have paid off
many martial artists

180
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,519
to secure the position
as the alliance leader

181
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,320
for us...

182
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,960
Can't you even brag properly?

183
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,360
If I were you, I would say,

184
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,960
"Whatever you want,

185
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,840
I'll get it for you."

186
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,919
That's brilliant.

187
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,840
Why didn't you

188
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,600
tell me earlier?

189
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,480
You didn't ask me.

190
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,000
Chu Xiaoran, do you have a plan?

191
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,840
Holding the stars
and plucking the sun and moon,

192
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,440
I'm one of a kind in this world.

193
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:06,919
What do you mean?

194
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,519
I mean,

195
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,440
does anyone think

196
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,759
there's something I can't accomplish?

197
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,720
No.

198
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Very well.

199
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,679
Assist Si Tian.

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,759
Secure the command token.

201
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,840
If you make it,

202
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,879
I will reward you handsomely.

203
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,519
Your Highness.

204
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,879
We don't need rewards

205
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,200
to work for you.

206
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,960
How about you give us a rubdown

207
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,399
