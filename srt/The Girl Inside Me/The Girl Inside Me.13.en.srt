2
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,159
Withdraw your weapons. Hurry.

4
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:05,398
(One hour ago)

5
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,040
Chu Xiaoran, how is my father?

6
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,920
Rest assured.

7
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,680
He is no longer in mortal danger.

8
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,439
But my uncle is right outside.

9
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,359
If my father does not wake up,

10
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,920
we will be in great peril.

11
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:23,520
(Now)

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,719
Impressive, my bother.

13
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,680
Did you barge in with troops

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,439
to pay your last respects to me?

15
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,319
I'm flustered.

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,840
You're in your prime time, Your Majesty.

17
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,840
It's just that the Great Chu
has been in turmoil

18
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,239
with internal and external troubles.

19
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,680
I only wished to protect Your Majesty.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,799
Hence, I boldly led troops
into the palace.

21
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,719
In that case,

22
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,680
you have been very thoughtful.

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,319
Your Majesty.

24
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,680
There are many bodies outside.

25
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,719
Come on, my brother. Explain this.

26
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,439
The deputy commander
of the Imperial Guards

27
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,759
killed his superior

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,439
to stage a rebellion.

29
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,360
He shall be executed.

30
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,560
I've failed to keep the court in order.

31
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,919
I deserve any punishment.

32
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,639
All of you may leave.

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,199
I'm tired.

34
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,039
I take my leave.

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,879
Thank you, Your Majesty.

36
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,479
Your Majesty, he glared at me.

37
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm tired.

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,599
Simpleton, give me a massage.

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
Don't slack off. Harder.

40
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,280
I didn't slack off.

41
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,399
Chu Xiaoran.

42
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:24,079
What's wrong?

43
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,040
What are you doing?

44
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,959
Giving you a massage.

45
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,399
Did I teach you to massage like this?

46
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,319
Yeah, you did.

47
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,519
It's pointless
to rub her shoulders alone

48
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,439
even if you have
great technique, Simpleton.

49
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,319
So what should I do?

50
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,519
Find her sensitive spot.

51
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,040
What's a sensitive spot?

52
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,480
Stroke her ear.

53
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,680
You're running away?

54
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,040
Stop right there.

55
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,120
Stop there!

56
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
You taught me that.

57
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,800
Stop.

58
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,600
But you taught me that.

59
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,879
I taught you that?

60
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,199
Yeah, have you forgotten?

61
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:03,959
I taught you that?

62
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,120
I taught you that?

63
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,040
Stop hitting me.

64
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,160
Congratulations, Your Highness.

65
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,920
His Majesty is doing much better.

66
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,439
Will you fulfill your promise?

67
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,439
My promise?

68
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,079
What promise?

69
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,040
You're playing dumb?

70
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,040
Look.

71
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,160
Do you know what this is?

72
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,680
If you can cure my father,

73
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,439
why wouldn't I marry you?

74
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,560
What is this?

75
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,319
Why does it have my voice?

76
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,439
Are you going to keep

77
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,800
playing dumb?

78
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,879
I did promise you that.

79
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,759
But I need my father's consent on this.

80
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,680
Talk to him if you dare.

81
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,800
How can the distinguished princess

82
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,720
break her promise?

83
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,639
I don't get to decide whom to marry.

84
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,279
But you had the nerve
to tell me to get lost.

85
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,480
Even my father dares not
speak to me like that.

86
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,720
I was infuriated.

87
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,240
It was an extreme measure. I apologize.
Please don't take it to heart.

88
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,199
I know you wouldn't dare.

89
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,879
(Look at you.
You think I can't do anything?)

90
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,279
Young Master Chu,
His Majesty wants to see you.

91
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,959
Come on, stop putting on airs.

92
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,199
Hurry up.

93
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,720
Hurry.

94
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,439
You look even better now, Your Majesty.

95
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,879
Thank you for your great work,
Physician Chu.

96
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,319
So, what reward do you desire?

97
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,240
Your Majesty.

98
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,240
As long as you follow my treatment plan,

99
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,839
you will surely get better.

100
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,399
As for the reward,

101
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,879
I do have a wish.

102
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,040
I'm listening.

103
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,439
I hope

104
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,600
that you can let me marry Her Highness

105
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,879
and make Si Tian my subordinate.

106
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,160
(Hurry up. Say yes.)

107
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,440
(I'll complete the task and go home.)

108
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,200
Theoretically,

109
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,240
Qingcheng is way out of your league.

110
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,399
(Should I take this statement
the other way around?)

111
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,039
However, if Qingcheng likes you

112
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,639
and agrees to marry you,

113
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,639
I will not object.

114
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,279
Your Majesty,
you truly are a good father.

115
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,240
My dad passed away when I was young.

116
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,440
I really can't even remember
what he looked like.

117
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,440
No, no, wait.

118
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,679
Dad?

119
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
It means father.

120
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,519
My father passed away
when I was very young.

121
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,759
I've never felt a father's love.

122
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,639
If you don't mind,

123
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,279
let me be your son-in-law.

124
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,200
Dad.

125
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,799
I need to ask Qingcheng for her opinion.

126
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,799
How about I make you my godchild first?

127
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,639
Dad.

128
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,320
I should have killed him
a long time ago.

129
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,519
This weirdo ruined my plans.

130
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,759
I lost half of my military power
to my brother.

131
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,519
I should have killed him
a long time ago.

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,639
My lord, anger harms your health.

133
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,639
Doesn't it hurt?

134
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,559
It's breaking my heart.

135
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,679
Pass on my words.

136
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,679
Find his relatives.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,360
I'll kill them one by one

138
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,159
right in front of him.

139
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,720
My lord, I have investigated thoroughly.

140
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,440
He is an orphan indeed.

141
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,679
Orphan?

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,080
Everybody

143
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,600
has relatives in this world.

144
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,879
Be they his distant aunts or cousins

145
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,519
or even his neighbor's dog,

146
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,759
bring them to me.

147
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,879
If you fail,

148
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,639
I will feed you to the fish.

149
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,559
My lord, I'll work on it now.

150
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm on it.

151
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,440
Get lost.

152
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,240
Alright, everyone has relatives.
