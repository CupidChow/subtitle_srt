00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:46,336
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,799
What happened last night?

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,640
After you said that you wanted a bath,

5
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,799
Duke Dingjun was sent home
completely wasted.

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,480
Then the three of you
got even more hyped.

7
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,359
Your Highness, be careful.

8
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,959
Don't touch me, or I'll kill you.

9
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,040
Tell me how many stars there are.

10
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,120
One, two, three, four,

11
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:32,120
five, six...

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,040
So many.

13
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,879
Stars.

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,959
One thousand.

15
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:37,799
One thousand.

16
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,799
One hundred.

17
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,920
One hundred.

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,280
Tell me how many stars there are.

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,599
One thousand.

20
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,799
One hundred.

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,680
One thousand, right?

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,719
One hundred.

23
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,359
One hundred.

24
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,920
No, one thousand.

25
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,599
Why did you hit him?

26
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,920
Don't hold him. He's mine.

27
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,879
Don't hold him.

28
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,359
He's mine.

29
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,079
Mine.

30
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,840
He's mine.

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,800
He's mine.

32
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,479
Step aside.

33
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,000
He's mine.

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,199
Shut up, you're talking drunk.

35
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,520
Better keep it to yourself.

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,159
Rest assured, Your Highness.

37
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,879
I sealed Young Master Chu's
acupoints last night.

38
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,120
What about me and Xiaoxiao?

39
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,280
I forgot.

40
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,520
Flowers for sale.

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,759
Sweet and tasty pastries.

42
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,199
- Miss, take a look.
- Okay.

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,159
I'm out to look around.
Why are you following me?

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,840
The Sixth Lord could kill you
at any moment, you know?

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,879
I-I feel safe around you.

46
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,439
Look at this guy.

47
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,960
Why are they so strange?

48
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,159
Who are they?

49
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,919
Are we being too conspicuous?

50
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,919
Who cares as long as
the Sixth Lord's people

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,639
don't recognize you?

52
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,199
The Fairy Temple
outside the city is quite popular.

53
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:10,000
Those nobles would spend a fortune
just to be the first to offer incense.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,159
Exactly.

55
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,319
Everyone started worshiping the fairy
after she descended.

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,000
What a commercial mindset.

57
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,319
How dare you commit fraud in my name?

58
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,719
Let me find out who you are.

59
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,960
Fairy Temple Registration Place.

60
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,759
We must get registered?

61
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,719
(Fairy Temple Registration Place)
Sir, we need to be registered?

62
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,400
Of course, the fairy and the master
are both very busy.

63
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,400
It's 100 taels per person
to get registered.

64
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,000
So expensive.

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,360
Go home if you don't have money.

66
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,039
Pay him. Let's find out who they are.

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
Okay.

68
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,919
Have some tea over there.
You'll be registered in a second.

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,199
Please enjoy your tea.

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,840
Thank you.

71
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,759
Fairy Temple.

72
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,040
Why are there two of you?

73
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,160
And there are two of you.

74
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,959
So dizzy.

75
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,079
We fell into his trap.

76
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,199
I'm afraid we're in serious trouble.

77
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,160
Nonsense. Chu.

78
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,079
Won't you do the introductions?

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
Good for you.
You have a fairy in your family.

80
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,639
My lord, this is between you and me.

81
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,639
Don't drag her into this.

82
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,639
Just come at me.

83
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,480
How can you say that? It hurts.

84
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,519
I sincerely admire your talent.

85
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,439
My lord, why don't you get to the point?

86
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,000
Alright, that little trick
you two pulled the other night

87
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,160
wasn't in my favor.

88
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,399
But I demand you two do it again.

89
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,959
As for my purpose,

90
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,879
I don't think you need
any further clarification.

91
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,040
Do your job and you'll get
all the wealth in the world

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,040
and all the prettiest partners.
What do you say?

93
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,600
Really?

94
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,240
Yeah.

95
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,920
But I'm not interested. How about you?

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,839
I have fantasized about it.

97
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,160
But not anymore.

98
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,279
You haven't figured it out.

99
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,199
Then I will give you some time
to think it over.

100
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,199
But you only have one day.

101
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,279
If you still can't figure it out,

102
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,560
Fei Teng, please help them.

103
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,680
With pleasure.

104
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,439
They both look exhausted.
Help them loosen up first.

105
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,920
Alright.

106
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,519
I pay my respects.

107
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,639
Did you find them?

108
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,079
Not yet.

109
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,040
How did they disappear without a trace?

110
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,920
We've dispatched the martial artists,

111
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,439
but there are no clues.

112
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,480
I suspect that it has something to do
with the Fairy Temple.

113
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,879
Look into it and keep an eye
on the Mansion of Lord Zhennan.

114
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,319
- Understood.
- Understood.

115
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,839
Xiaoxiao, I'm sorry.

116
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,519
I failed to protect you.

117
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,959
You think I need your protection?

118
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,120
Chu Xiaoran, you must live on.

119
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,759
The princess is waiting for you.

120
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know if we can get through this.

121
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,879
I don't want to lie to myself anymore.

122
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,000

Listen, I can agree to your terms.

143
