=Episode 19=

3
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,880
Young man, let go.

4
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,799
I'm not that "Xiaoxiao" you mentioned.

5
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,679
You are Xiaoxiao.

6
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,039
I am sure you are Xiaoxiao.

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,439
I am not Xiaoxiao.

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,759
I am a fairy.

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Where have you been?

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,439
Why did you disappear?

11
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,560
Young man, what's wrong with you?

12
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,560
It's highly inappropriate to hug me.

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,400
Can you let go first?

14
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,280
The steel plate
on your chest is poking me.

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,959
Sorry, but we agreed on
protecting this body well.

16
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,680
Wasn't I very cool?

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,680
F-Forget about that.

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,400
Tell me. Where did you go?

19
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,760
Am I cooler than the princess?

20
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,200
The princess?

21
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,599
She's not you.

22
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,400
There's nothing to compare.

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,760
So ambiguous. I'm not pleased at all.

24
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,120
Xiaoxiao, Her Highness only represents
my pursuit of beautiful things.

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,879
You're different.
You are within my reach.

26
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,719
I have thought it over these days.

27
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,520
I give up on her.

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,360
What? You give up on her?

29
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,599
Listen, I hate men who give up halfway.

30
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,280
But I...

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,120
If you give up,

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,800
then all of our efforts are wasted.

33
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,240
Forget about that.

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,159
What happened to you? Where did you go?

35
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,520
Physician Wang, please.

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,560
Physician Wang, you have no idea.

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,840
Ever since our lord
developed this illness,

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,719
all the famous physicians
have been at their wit's end.

39
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,759
Please check on him.

40
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,280
This way.

41
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
(Oh my, what's going on?)

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,280
(It's really this guy.)

43
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,080
(We've become arch-enemies.)

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,919
(Can I refuse to save him?)

45
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,680
(Yes, you can.)

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
(Then you won't get
your mysterious reward.)

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,439
The reward matters more than my life?

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,759
Reward? As long as you cure my lord,
I will even pick the stars for you

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,639
if you want me to.

50
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,840
(It's up to you.)

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,520
(You'll get to use
your own body for 30 days.)

52
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,960
I am a medical student.

53
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,080
Saving lives is my bounden duty.

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,240
Even if the patient is my sworn enemy,

55
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,639
I must save this troublemaker.

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,039
Troublemaker?

57
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,560
Well, I guess.

58
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,120
Xiaoxiao.

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,319
You don't need to know.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,599
All you need to know is that
I am your sister, Chu Xiaoxiao.

61
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,399
Are you alright?

62
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,839
Are you crazy?

63
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,680
Don't try to be a hero again!

64
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
As a man, shouldn't I protect you?

65
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,360
I've already died once.

66
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,439
I won't live much longer.

67
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,519
You don't have to do this.

68
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,519
Come on.

69
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,279
What do you mean?

70
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,360
Literally what I said.

71
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,879
Could you make yourself clear

72
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,079
to put me at ease?

73
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,040
Stop asking.

74
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:38,720
(Token)

75
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,319
Si Tian, Chu Xiaoran,
you did a great job.

76
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,240
What reward do you wish for?

77
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,360
We don't need rewards
to serve Your Highness.

78
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Chu Xiaoran, go on.

79
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,720
We don't need special rewards.

80
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,920
Your Highness, do you still
remember your promise?

81
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,480
Chu Xiaoran, how dare you?

82
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,439
Don't you know who she is?

83
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,639
How could she give you two a rubdown?

84
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,199
If this gets out,
her reputation will be tarnished.

85
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,480
Her Highness
naturally values her reputation.

86
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,040
But of course,
she must keep her promises.

87
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,360
Or who's going to respect her?

88
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,519
But Her Highness is too distinguished

89
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,240
to do such a thing.

90
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,399
Please allow me to give Duke Dingjun
a rubdown on Your Highness's behalf.

91
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,399
Permission granted.

92
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,519
Shouldn't you ask me before...?

93
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:05,879
No objections.

94
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,639
Your Highness,
there's Young Master Chu left.

95
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,759
I don't mind serving him.

96
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,360
Your Highness, don't bother.
I don't need it.

97
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,759
My words are as precious as gold.

98
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,160
Shuang'er, serve Young Master Chu well.

99
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,680
Understood.

100
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,319
What? Chu Xiaoxiao,
Chu Xiaoran's younger sister,

101
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,279
won the command token?

102
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,519
Didn't you tell me
you only found his parents' remains?

103
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,399
How come he has a sister?

104
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,519
My lord, is it possible that

105
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,680
he's either an illegitimate child
or she's his sworn sister?

106
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,639
Are you crazy? Stop talking nonsense.

107
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,839
But then again,

108
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,680
the Third Prince is extremely filial
and has won His Majesty's favor.

109
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,959
Though he's born of a consort,
he should stand a chance.

110
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,040
Find an opportunity to bond with him.

111
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,519
You want to sit on top of the mountain
to watch the tigers fight?

112
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,360
What mountain? What's your problem?

113
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,679
Add some fuel to the fire.

114
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,679
Yeah, I will add more fuel
to make the fire bigger.

115
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,039
Should I do it?

116
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,320
I'll go.

117
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,399
Tian.

118
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,799
What are you doing? Stay back.

119
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,399
Why are you so shy?

120
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,600
Don't be scared. I've seen it before.

121
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,080
What have you seen?

122
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,399
As if we're close.

123
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,360
I am your elder brother's good friend.

124
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,200
What do you want?

125
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,519
I'm just following Her Highness's order
to give you a rubdown.

126
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,919
Why are you so nervous?

127
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,159
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would I be nervous?

128
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,679
I just think that

129
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,919
I must respect women.
We'd better avoid physical contact.

130
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,360
Enough. Clothes off.

131
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,039
I've fought endless battles
in grave danger.

132
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,919
I've seen and been through

133
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,559
all kinds of hardship.

134
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,320
I surely can handle you.

135
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,799
You're just talking tough.

136
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,200
Go on.

137
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,480
Chu Xiaoran, my buddy.
When will you come to save me?

138
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,279
My Young Master Chu.

139
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,679
Shuang'er, how can you
be so insensitive? Go away.

140
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,360
Young Master Chu.

141
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,840
Young Master Chu,
you have a lot of dampness on you.

142
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,279
Your Highness, please go easy.

143
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,360
I've been deeply troubled these days.

144
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,159
How can I go easy on you?

145
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,399
Your Highness, why don't you
tell me about it?

146
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,200
I can share your burden.

147
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,320
The Third Prince copied the Vajra Sutra
in blood and won Father's favor.

148
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
The Crown Prince's position
may be in jeopardy.

149
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,519
It's fine if the Third Prince
makes a great successor.

150
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,200
The Third Prince
is close to my Sixth Uncle.

151
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,200
I'm sure they have dealings
with each other.

152
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,159
I'm afraid that my uncle
is going to benefit in the end.

153
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,720
Your Highness.

154
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,039
Are you and the Crown Prince
on bad terms with His Majesty again?

155
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,919
His Majesty is unpredictable.

156
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,679
If the Third Prince
and my Sixth Uncle win,

157
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,879
both the Crown Prince
and I will be killed.

158
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,840
I-Is it that cruel?

159
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,879
T-There must be a way.

160
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:14,368
Once I go home,

161
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:17,480
I'll think it over
and get back to you tomorrow.
