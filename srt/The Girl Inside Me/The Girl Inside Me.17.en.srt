=Episode 17=

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,880
He got totally wasted?

4
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,399
Ruyi.

5
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,840
Where am I?

6
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,200
Confess if you don't want to die.

7
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,560
Did you kill Commander Wang?

8
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,040
Did you kill him or not?

9
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,120
You work for the lord?

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,079
Confess if you don't...

11
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,239
You don't work for the lord.

12
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,400
We're arch-enemies.

13
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,120
It doesn't matter
if I kill Commander Wang.

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,200
He just wants me dead.

15
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,120
Boss, this kid doesn't play along.

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,400
He is not showing you any respect.

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
I suggest we cut off his limbs first.

18
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,439
I am giving you one last chance.

19
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,760
I'd rather be killed than insulted.

20
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,519
Kill me if you want.

21
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,400
I'll finish you off now.

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,239
Not the sack.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,799
Stop it.

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,159
Feels good, huh? Again.

25
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,599
Come on.

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,959
Stop, you audacious bandits.

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,920
Get lost.

28
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,040
Stop!

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,439
Young Master Chu, you've suffered.

30
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,240
Fortunately, we arrived in time.

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,479
Ruyi.

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
You've changed.

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,039
What are you talking about?

34
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,599
Why don't I understand?

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,719
It could have been horrible

36
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,280
if we hadn't arrived in time.

37
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,280
You guys are so sweet.

38
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,319
Your Highness, you're so sweet.

39
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,520
I was almost beaten to death.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,719
Otherwise, I'd be grateful.

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,319
What are you babbling?

42
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,199
I don't get it.

43
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,120
If I'm not mistaken,

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,960
you must be wearing
the perfume I gave you.

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,560
I can smell it from far away.

46
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,400
You must have been
lurking around to protect me.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,919
Right?

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,199
Yeah.

49
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,840
This is yours, huh?

50
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,719
This is yours, huh?

51
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,479
I've been working diligently
for our cause

52
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,800
only to receive beatings.

53
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,599
I am so disappointed.

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,960
I'm sorry, Young Master Chu.

55
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,400
Her Highness commanded me
to teach you a lesson.

56
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,719
I meant to teach him a lesson verbally.

57
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,199
But she took action on her own.

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,159
Yeah, it's all my fault.

59
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,800
Blame me if you want.

60
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,360
I didn't understand
Her Highness's care for you.

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,159
I...

62
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,360
Your Highness, actually...

63
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,280
Why are you hesitant?

64
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,520
Strip and get in the water.

65
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,759
The medicinal herbs in there

66
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,080
can heal your wounds.

67
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,520
Just say that you want to see my body.

68
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,199
Why go to such lengths?

69
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,680
Fine, I'll strip.

70
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,560
Why are you hesitant?

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,319
Pants off.

72
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,319
No, this is my last shred of dignity.

73
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,439
Pants off.

74
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,600
It's quite cozy, Your Highness.

75
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,240
Why don't you join me?

76
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,879
I mean, it seems like a waste
to enjoy this on my own.

77
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
Indeed, it's a bit of a waste.

78
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,120
Don't you have some special hobbies?

79
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,399
I shall indulge you.

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,680
Enjoy.

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,399
Your Highness.

82
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,160
Your Highness.

83
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,319
Xiaoxiao.

84
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,560
Wake up. You're missing out on the fun.

85
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
It's your favorite.

86
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,160
Xiaoxiao.

87
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,079
Wake up.

88
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:46,879
Come on.

89
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,079
Will you wake up?

90
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,040
I've given you a chance.

91
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,120
Come and see.

92
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,199
Fine.

93
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,399
One last time. Will you wake up?

94
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,560
(Mansion of Lord Zhennan)

95
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Commander Wang died
and Her Highness has placed

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,800
many of her people
among the Imperial Guards.

97
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,759
Things are not in our favor.

98
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,720
I have long had a plan.

99
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,480
Seek external assistance

100
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,920
to quell the internal strife.

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
The external assistance means...?

102
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,319
State of Wu.

103
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,959
Aren't the Wu people

104
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,040
too ambitious to work with?

105
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,720
I have already made them a promise.

106
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,639
As long as they help me
ascend to the throne,

107
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,040
I will cede three border cities to them.

108
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,839
I'm afraid this is not appropriate.

109
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,240
Why do you even care?

110
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,800
Once I reign over the nation,

111
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,399
won't I take over
the State of Wu in no time?

112
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,759
My lord, what's wrong?

113
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,759
My lord.

114
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Guards!

115
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,920
My lord, are you all right?

116
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,480
(What happened?)

117
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,160
(Why does it feel so oppressive?)

118
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,959
(Qu Xiaoxiao.)

119
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,720
(The mysterious task
I told you about earlier)

120
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,120
(has been initiated.)

121
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,959
What task?

122
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,160
Xiaoxiao.

123
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,279
Xiaoxiao.

124
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,720
Xiaoxiao.

125
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,839
Xiaoxiao.

126
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,519
Xiaoxiao, where are you?

127
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,799
(Xiaoxiao, where did you go?)

128
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,639
(You didn't just leave, right?)

129
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,559
(Without you here,)

130
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,759
(I can't even
stay with Her Highness alone.)

131
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,039
What's wrong? You seem lost.

132
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,480
It's nothing.

133
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,200
What can I do for you?

134
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Let's take a bath.

135
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,399
Rain check.

136
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,720
Let's get warmed up.

137
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,200
The martial arts meeting is coming up.

138
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,759
We must discuss the details.

139
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,519
Does it have to be today?

140
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,200
What's wrong? Why are you so hesitant?

141
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,440
You're tired of this place?

142
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,919
Let's go to my mansion.

143
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,679
Okay.

144
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,879
Where is Chu Xiaoran?

145
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,799
Young Master Chu?

146
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,120
He's been at the duke's mansion for days

147
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,200
and hasn't come back.

148
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,480
Forget it. I should get rid of someone

149
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,279
I can't control.

150
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:15,559
Understood. I will have him killed now.

151
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,559
Come back.

152
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,159
What's going on with you?

153
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,679
Are you influenced by Chu Xiaoran?

154
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,519
No.

155
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,360
I just feel that he will slow you down

156
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,919
when you draw your sword

157
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,320
and affect your major decisions.

158
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:32,919
Are you telling me what to do?

159
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,679
I dare not.

160
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,879
Go, bring him back.

161
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,840
Tell him I have important matters
to discuss with him.

162
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,960
Important matters.

163
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,279
Like what?

164
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,440
