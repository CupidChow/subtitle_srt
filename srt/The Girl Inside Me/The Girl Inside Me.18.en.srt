00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:44,448
=The Girl Inside Me=

2
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,600
I pay my respects to Your Highness.

4
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,119
Chu Xiaoran.

5
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,880
This is not your usual attitude.

6
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,840
Do I look like I will eat you up?

7
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,079
It's not like that.

8
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:10,840
Come forward.

9
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,040
Understood.

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,120
How confident are you
about the martial arts meeting?

11
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:30,159
I-It should be alright.

12
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,319
It should be?

13
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,959
That's not what I'm expecting.

14
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,760
It's been so long,

15
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,519
yet you still don't have a viable plan.

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
I've discussed it with Si Tian.

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,280
If the plan fails,

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,079
I will step in

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
to turn the tide.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,599
How will you turn the tide?

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,319
Your Highness, it's a secret
that can't be revealed.

22
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,200
So how confident are you?

23
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,680
What are the chances?

24
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,120
Ninety percent.

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,799
Leave the rest to the heavens.

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,840
Ninety percent.

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,039
Leave the rest

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,520
to Xiaoxiao.

29
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,439
Young Master Chu, you're quite vain.

30
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,520
A hundred percent?

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,639
Then I'm relieved.

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,759
Then, I will take my leave.

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,840
Come back.

34
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,719
Anything else, Your Highness?

35
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,840
Chu Xiaoran.

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,719
I've looked into your past.

37
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,639
You used to be a nobody,

38
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,680
honest and simple.

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,080
Now you are full of strategies.

40
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,759
Don't you owe me an explanation?

41
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,240
Perhaps, it's a case of late blooming.

42
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,360
Your Highness.

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,680
If you weren't so shameless,

44
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,639
I'd suspect that you were replaced.

45
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,759
If I didn't know
Your Highness was magnanimous,

46
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,400
I'd have thought that you were
taking personal revenge on me.

47
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,719
No more sweet talks. I won't buy it.

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,319
- Ruyi.
- Here.

49
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,199
- Punch him.
- Alright.

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,759
Young Master Chu.

51
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,680
If someone knew everything about you,

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,479
would you be happy?

53
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,240
Not to mention Her Highness.

54
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,520
Think about it.

55
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,319
(Xiaoxiao.)

56
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,639
(Without you by my side,)

57
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,079
(I feel completely restless.)

58
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,240
(I dare not even meet people.)

59
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,120
(They might see through me.)

60
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,600
Hello, Miss.

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,959
We're in my consciousness.

62
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,600
Whoever sits in that chair

63
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,120
can control my body in reality.

64
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,399
So please don't be too casual about it.

65
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Rest assured, buddy.

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,079
I'll take good care of your body.

67
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,879
Caress her.

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,040
Caress her.

69
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,600
I'm about to be a eunuch. Stop laughing.

70
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,279
It's okay.

71
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,839
We can be sisters like that.

72
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,839
(I have no idea)

73
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,439
(what's going to happen tomorrow.)

74
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,920
(If things go wrong,)

75
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,360
(I'll be doomed.)

76
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,480
(Xiaoxiao.)

77
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,079
(Will I be able to see you again?)

78
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,120
The martial contest begins.

79
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,759
Xiaoxiao, what's wrong?

80
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,319
I'm fine.

81
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,720
Don't worry.

82
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,600
I will try to keep you off the stage.

83
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,399
(If things go wrong,)

84
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,199
(at worst, I'll die on the stage.)

85
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,040
(After all, I've survived till now
thanks to Xiaoxiao.)

86
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,040
(It's been worth it.)

87
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,519
(It's just a pity that)

88
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,279
(I can't see her again.)

89
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,279
(I really regret)

90
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,839
(that I didn't cherish
our time together.)

91
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,800
Fei Teng from the Sixth Lord's team won.

92
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,160
Next up, Duke Si Tian.

93
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,839
I pay my respects to you.

94
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,720
We signed up for a life-and-death fight.

95
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,920
Weapons have no eyes.

96
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,240
If you get hurt,

97
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,399
please don't blame me.

98
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,839
Save it.

99
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,360
As if you could hurt me.

100
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,720
It's the Poisonous Sword.

101
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,800
He turns out to be Mr. Poisonous
who retired long ago.

102
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,720
Mr. Poisonous?

103
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,720
Xiaoxiao?

104
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,320
Stop.

105
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,919
Young lady, who are you?

106
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,600
What hidden weapon is that?

107
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,960
We have rules in our arena.

108
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,399
No hidden weapons.

109
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,440
It's only a hidden weapon
when it's "hidden".

110
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,679
I'm using them openly.

111
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,799
Amazing. You can dodge bullets.

112
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
I lost.

113
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,240
I lost.

114
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,159
