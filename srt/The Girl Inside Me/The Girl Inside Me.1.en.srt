=The Girl Inside Me=

2
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,200
Hi, Mom. Tell you what.

4
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,439
I caught the bouquet
as a bridesmaid today.

5
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,280
I could be the next one
to walk down the aisle.

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,799
Are you happy?

7
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,000
Xiaoxiao, stop fooling me.

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,480
Bring a man home to marry
this Spring Festival.

9
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,319
Alright.

10
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,079
What's your type? I'll find one for you.

11
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,239
Find one for you, not for me.

12
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,079
Do you hear me?

13
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,079
Remember. Bring a man home.

14
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,079
Divorce? Fine.

15
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,799
I can't live like this anymore.

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,439
You're on your phone all day long.

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,560
Someone is in a hurry to divorce.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,319
Someone is eager to get married.

19
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,319
Find a boyfriend or don't come back.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,400
What an expert scrub worker.

21
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,840
You fell asleep during work.

22
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:46,112
(Bathhouse)

23
00:01:46,112 --> 00:01:46,848
(Private Room)

24
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:48,152
Nice work on the chest muscles.

25
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,560
(How did I end up
in an ancient men's bathhouse)

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,439
(Chu Xiaoran, Bathhouse Attendant)
(after I got knocked out?)

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,560
(Is this a dream in a coma?)

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,520
(And where am I now?)

29
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,120
Hello, Miss.

30
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,560
My name is Chu Xiaoran.

31
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,879
We're in my consciousness.

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,039
You are now inside my body.

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,319
Now, whoever sits in that chair

34
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,360
can control my body in reality.

35
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,280
So,

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,000
please don't act willfully
without my permission.

37
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:47,520
(I can control this simpleton's body
by sitting on the chair?)

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,319
(That's something new.)

39
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,039
(Instead of waking up
and being nagged by my mom,)

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,120
(I'd rather
tease this simpleton for fun.)

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,400
What are you doing?

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Rest assured, buddy.

43
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,080
I'll take good care of your body.

44
00:03:03,155 --> 00:03:06,515
(Bathhouse)

45
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,319
Chu Xiaoran.

46
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
Commander Yan is furious.

47
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,400
He doesn't like
any of the body scrub workers.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Come with me now.

49
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,159
Come on.

50
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,199
Okay.

51
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,280
Commander Yan.

52
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,879
The bathhouse attendant is here.

53
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,240
(Controlling someone's actions)

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,520
(inside his body is so much fun.)

55
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,879
Want a scrub?

56
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,840
Here we go.

57
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,800
Stop messing around.

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,719
He could kill me if he got annoyed.

59
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,439
Please stop messing around.

60
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,400
Commander Yan is merciless.

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,639
Behave yourself.

62
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,920
I must give him a proper rubdown.

63
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,480
I haven't started with the technique.

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,839
Something more thrilling is coming up.

65
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,800
Your Highness, an agent reports.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,079
(Ye Qingcheng, Princess of Chu)
Commander Yan supports the Sixth Lord.

67
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,399
Once we catch Commander Yan,

68
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,800
we hold leverage over the Sixth Lord.

69
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,240
We've been playing this game for ages.

70
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,079
It's time to wrap it up.

71
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,680
Make the arrest.

72
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,560
Understood.

73
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,079
Duke Dingjun is watching Commander Yan.

74
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,639
I will have him make the arrest.

75
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,064
(Si Tian, Duke Dingjun)

76
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,079
Commander Yan!

77
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,720
How dare you!

78
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
It... It wasn't me.

79
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,199
I-I didn't do anything.

80
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,879
I didn't...

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,600
I didn't do...

82
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,079
(This man looks so aggressive.)

83
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,360
Want a scrub?

84
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,519
I'm innocent.

85
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,319
I have no idea.

86
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,319
I didn't do anything.

87
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,879
I was just giving him a rubdown.

88
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,079
I didn't do anything.

89
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,839
Oh no.

90
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,639
What?

91
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,000
He's dead?

92
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,680
He coughed up blood and died
while getting a rubdown.

93
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,079
I've arrested the scrub worker,

94
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,639
Chu Xiaoran, the bathhouse attendant.

95
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,199
The duke is interrogating him.

96
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,480
My lord, he's passed out.

97
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,000
Hit him to wake him up.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,512
Understood.

99
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,319
Don't you want to control my body?

100
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,439
Take over from here.

101
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,800
I can't hold on much longer.

102
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,480
No, no.

103
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,240
It's your body. You're in charge.

104
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,800
Dear God.

105
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,839
What a horrible place.

106
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,639
Let me wake up from this nightmare now.

107
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,439
I want to go back.

108
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,439
I miss my mom.

109
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,680
(You can only leave)

110
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,560
(after completing the mission.)

111
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,439
There really are gods.

112
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,959
God?

113
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,519
(Chu Xiaoran, the bathhouse worker,)

114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,680
(has always admired Princess Qingcheng.)

115
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,120
(But the Emperor of Chu has been ill,)

116
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,399
(Lord Zhennan, Sixth Lord)
(so the Sixth Lord eyes the throne.)

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,920
(The princess is struggling
to sustain the Great Chu.)

118
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,519
(Chu Xiaoran is worried about
the princess's safety,)

119
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,360
(but can't do anything
due to his lowly status.)

120
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,480
(Imperial Edict)
(Yet the wheels of fate)

121
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,160
(have drawn Chu Xiaoran
into the power struggle)

122
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,879
(between the Sixth Lord
and Princess Qingcheng.)

123
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,839
Well...

124
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,120
What's the mission?

125
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,879
(Help Chu Xiaoran
win over the princess.)

126
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,000
Win over

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
the princess

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,040
with his status and cowardness?

129
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,560
I certainly won't make it.

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,120
(This is the capricious pouch.)

131
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,000
(You can get some small items
from your world.)

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,039
(Remember, the mission ends in 60 days.)

133
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,919
(If you fail,
you won't see your mom again.)

134
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,440
(Moreover, you will vanish for good.)

135
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,879
What are you muttering over there?

136
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,639
Come and take over.

137
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,200
What a loser.

138
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,279
So spineless.

139
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,320
Get up. Let me sit.

140
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,279
Go ahead.

141
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,559
Ouch.

142
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,480
You committed a crime
right before my eyes.

143
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,960
How do I explain this to the princess?

144
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,080
I-I didn't...

145
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,559
(Oh my, that is going to hurt a lot.)

146
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,480
(Think of something.)

147
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,440
(It is shown in this coward's memory)

148
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,240
(that the princess and the Sixth Lord
have been in a power struggle.)

149
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,080
(The Sixth Lord killed Commander Yan)

150
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,320
(to get rid of him.)

151
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,919
(I've become the scapegoat.)

152
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,200
(What do I do?)

153
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,320
Her Highness is here.

154
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,960
(This princess
has such an imposing aura.)

155
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,039
(But)

156
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,399
(as a transmigrator, I must not flinch.)

157
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,480
Leave this to me, Qingcheng.

158
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,080
You didn't have to come.

159
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,960
I will count to three.

160
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,559
If you don't confess,

161
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,279
I'll kill you.

162
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,320
If you do,

163
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,600
I'll make it painless.

164
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,399
Three.

165
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,399
Think of something.

166
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,399
One. Kill him.
