=The Girl Inside Me=

2
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:46,368
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Hold on.

4
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,480
It was a great imitation
of my father's handwriting.

5
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,760
But the person
who forged the will didn't know

6
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,879
that Father stopped writing altogether
after he fell seriously ill.

7
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,879
Third Prince, you conspired
with the Sixth Lord against Father

8
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:29,760
for usurpation.
This is utterly treasonous.

9
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,040
The new emperor
just ascended to the throne.

10
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,840
Naturally, some would challenge him.

11
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,480
Fifth Prince, Sixth Prince.

12
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,079
What do you have to say?

13
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:49,879
Will you obey the late emperor's edict

14
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,040
or will you rebel
and question it like her?

15
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,680
Gentlemen, it is time to make a choice.

16
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,680
Guards.

17
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,960
Seize the traitor.

18
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,280
Who dares?

19
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:22,355
(The Crown Prince Zikun
shall ascend to the throne.)

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,520
The will states that the Crown Prince
shall ascend to the throne.

21
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,280
But the real Crown Prince

22
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,319
is imprisoned by the traitorous lord
and the Third Prince.

23
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,360
Your Highness,
let's obey the will of heaven.

24
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:48,759
The edict we forged
can never become real.

25
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:53,120
Good, you recognized
and corrected your errors.

26
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,039
Expose the rebels

27
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,360
and the new emperor
will forgive you for your past sins.

28
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,599
Sixth Uncle, you should be executed
for colluding with the enemy.

29
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,240
How dare you! Seize her!

30
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,759
Why haven't you seized the rebel?

31
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,560
What is going on here?

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,719
Uncle, I've replaced
all your people with mine.

33
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,319
I knew that you'd betrayed us.

34
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,319
So I let you leak
some false information on purpose.

35
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,879
Those lists you've obtained

36
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,599
don't really record the names
of my informants.

37
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,319
Guards, put these traitors in jail.

38
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,400
Your Highness, bad news!
The mansion has been raided.

39
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,719
Young Master Chu disappeared.

40
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,720
(The Sixth Lord is really cunning.)

41
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,279
(He's operating the usurpation
from inside and outside the palace.)

42
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,360
(I wonder how the princess is doing.)

43
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,439
Your Highness.

44
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,959
Buns. Hot steaming buns.

45
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,800
Buns.

46
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,384
(Jiumu Casino)

47
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,879
(It's free money. Take them.
What are you waiting for?)

48
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,920
(So indifferent?)

49
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
(Hey, Chu Xiaoran, you simpleton.)

50
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,879
(Let me take control.)

51
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,480
(I'll shoot them down.)

52
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,720
Kill him.

53
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,279
(I'm not ready yet.)

54
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,319
(Tian.)

55
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,839
Si Tian.

56
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,279
Si Tian.

57
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,519
My buddy.

58
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,800
My lord.

59
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,040
I made it.

60
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,759
I-I'm back.

61
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,079
Duke Dingjun knew there
would be turmoil in the capital

62
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,959
so he launched the attack
and fought hard

63
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,519
to defeat the enemies.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,759
Knowing the capital was in chaos,
he hurried back despite his injuries.

65
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,000
After continuous fierce battles,

66
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,480
he is at the end of his strength.

67
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,040
My lord, my buddy, you finally woke up.

68
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,920
You rushed back to save me
and ended up like this.

69
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,639
We're buddies.
Why do you sound so distant?

70
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,319
Thankfully, you're fine.

71
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,439
My lord, there's something
I have to confess to you.

72
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,000
What is it?

73
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,639
Xiaoxiao once used my body
to get close to you.

74
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,079
She likes you.

75
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,720
What?

76
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,680
Chu Xiaoran!

77
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,199
You had improper thoughts about me!

78
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,879
No, it's not what you think.

79
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,120
Do you take me for a fool?

80
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,240
You're even in my bed
and it's not what I think?

81
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,279
No, let me explain.

82
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,680
D-Don't explain anything.

83
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,160
You made up such a story as an excuse.

84
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,079
- No, no.
- You are dreadful!

85
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,040
It's not what you think.

86
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,639
Let me explain.

87
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,680
Save it.

88
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,959
Get off my bed.

89
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,000
I have nowhere to sit. I...

90
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,279
So you offered to help me

91
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,480
pursue Her Highness only to approach me.

92
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,879
And you tricked me into
bathing and sleeping with you.

93
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,920
I thought of you as my buddy.

94
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,079
Yet you wanted to
bathe and sleep with me!

95
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,680
I also thought of you as my buddy.

96
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,560
I have no improper thoughts about you.

97
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,680
That's your claim

98
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,839
but you did everything.

99
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,800
I am completely sullied.

100
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,240
What did I do?

101
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,919
I didn't do anything, my lord.

102
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,960
Si Tian, listen.

103
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,120
Stay back.

104
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,200
You're still laughing?
Aren't you going to explain?

105
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,000
That's hilarious.

106
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,039
G-Go on.

107
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,840
I'm just enjoying the drama.

108
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,799
Calm down.

109
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,399
I thought of you as my buddy.

110
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,279
Yet you've been eyeing my body.

111
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,039
No.

112
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,279
You even complimented my figure.

113
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,639
Oh my goodness.

114
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,879
My lord.

115
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,960
Stay back.

116
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,039
Let me explain.

117
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,399
Don't touch me.

118
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,600
Let me explain.

119
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:36,352
(Princess's Mansion)

120
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,559
Ruyi.

121
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,000
Why is Her Highness avoiding me?

122
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,919
Why would she see you?

123
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,200
It turns out to be a mistake.

124
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
That was a misunderstanding.
I've explained it.

125
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,799
Why don't you believe me?

126
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,600
What's the point of me believing in you?

127
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,360
Actually, we have quite a few
new guards at the mansion.

128
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,240
In terms of appearance,
knowledge, or talent,

129
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,519
they're all top-notch.

130
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,200
So, you know what I mean.

131
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,639
There are only three days left.

132
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,720
I still haven't helped the simpleton
win over the princess.

133
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,840
Chu Xiaoran, it doesn't matter
whether you can marry the princess.

134
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,919
There are so many outstanding women.

135
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,759
You'll find the right one for you.

136
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't be obsessed about it.

137
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,840
What will happen to you in three days?

138
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,360
Nothing much, actually.

139
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,559
I will return to my world.

140
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,600
I lied when I said that I'd disappear.

141
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
Chu Xiaoran, I'm glad to have met you.

142
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,519
I'm glad to have met you.

143
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,320
Here, Your Highness. Come catch me.

144
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,120
- Over here.
- Don't run.

145
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,320
I'm right here.

146
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,080
Here, Your Highness.

147
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:56,399
Come catch me.

148
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:56,919
Where are you?

149
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,559
Come here.

150
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,480
Your Highness, here.

151
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,639
I'm here, Your Highness.

152
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,799
- Over here.
- Don't run.

153
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,519
Come here.

154
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,120
Your Highness, I'm here.

155
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,799
I know.

156
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,440
Come catch me, Your Highness.

157
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,759
Got you.

158
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,559
So you're the new guard.

159
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,519
Look at your hand. So soft and tender.

160
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,960
I wonder how well-trained you are.

161
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,559
I've been training since childhood
and vow to protect Your Highness.

162
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,039
Very good.

163
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,120
Chu Xiaoran, what do you want?

164
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,320
I wonder if you still
remember your promise.

165
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,360
Of course, I do.

166
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,919
But if you want to marry me now,

167
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,679
you need His Majesty's decree.
Do you dare to ask him?

168
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,039
Why wouldn't I dare?

169
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,039
I pay my respects to Your Majesty.

170
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,679
Minister Chu, spare the formality.

171
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,519
Thank you, Your Majesty.

172
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,960
I have some great news for you.

173
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,080
What is it?

174
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,200
The granddaughter of Duke Jing
is at the perfect age.

175
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,759
She's gentle, virtuous,
and stunningly beautiful.

176
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,639
I plan to make her your wife.

177
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,600
Your Majesty, please don't.

178
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,080
Why not?

179
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,159
I want to marry your sister.

180
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,720
You want to do what?

181
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,320
Chu Xiaoran, do you know
what you're saying?

182
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,840
Please grant your permission.

183
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,800
(Princess's Mansion)

184
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,639
My buddy is getting married.

185
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,960
But I am not the groom.

186
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,320
Give me some comfort.

187
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,200
My lord, please keep it down.

188
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,799
I know you are very happy.

189
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,399
But let's not disturb them.

190
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,440
(Princess's Mansion)
Let's see how you escape from me.

191
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,480
Wait, Your Highness.

192
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,759
Can we go through the procedure?

193
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,039
What procedure? That's up to me.

194
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,720
Stop chasing me, Your Highness.

195
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,559
Stop chasing me. It's slippery.

196
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,879
Chu Xiaoran, why are you running away?

197
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,679
I give up.

198
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,559
Procedure? What procedure?

199
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,440
I have the final say on the procedure.

200
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,039
Your Highness.

201
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,320
I will love you wholeheartedly.

202
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,200
I will love no one but you
for all my life.

203
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,519
(Chu Xiaoran, I wish you all the best.)

204
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,559
Chu Xiaoran, is that you?

205
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,000
Can you hear me?

206
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,640
I'm Qu Xiaoxiao.

207
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Chu Xiaoran.

208
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:22,599
Chu Xiaoran.

209
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,640
Can you hear me?

210
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,359
I'm Qu Xiaoxiao.

211
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm Qu Xiaoxiao.

212
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,519
Wake up.

213
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,880
I won't leave anymore.

214
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,839
I know you married the princess

215
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,640
so I could live on, right?

216
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,799
Hey, Simpleton.

217
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,720
I'm Qu Xiaoxiao.

218
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,559
You didn't forget me, right?

219
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,440
Do you remember that I said

220
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,519
the most important thing
about loving someone is sincerity?

221
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,960
I didn't tell you.

222
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,839
I didn't tell you that I like you.

223
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,799
Can you wake up?

224
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,799
You woke up?

225
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,440
You...

226
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,559
What a miracle.

227
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,920
He has been in a vegetative state.

228
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,000
But you were brought here yesterday

229
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,960
and shared his neural stimulator.

230
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,119
Now he actually regained consciousness.
