=The Girl Inside Me=

2
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,079
I have suffered
from chronic headaches for many years.

4
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,399
Such pain is unbearable.

5
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,280
Now that I'm speaking of it,

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,759
my head starts hurting again.

7
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,200
Do you know how to treat it?

8
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,079
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,040
This may require careful inquiring.

10
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,599
However, I can stop his pain first.

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,959
Give me a second.

12
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,760
You can take this pill.

13
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,599
(Trying to test me?)

14
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,519
(One painkiller will do the trick.)

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,959
It really stopped hurting.

16
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,040
This medicine is so effective.

17
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,359
Great physician,

18
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,200
do you have any more of these pills?

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,519
I'm willing to pay a fortune for them.

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,480
Let me see.

21
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,879
Gao Dehai.

22
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,480
How come you have a fortune?

23
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,080
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,800
I misspoke.

25
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,520
I meant to say
that this pill is worthy of a fortune.

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,280
I don't feel any pain now.

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,719
I can serve Your Majesty
for decades to come.

28
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
You slick old man.

29
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,599
Chu Xiaoran, attend to my father now.

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,639
Okay.

31
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,919
Father.

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,599
Your Majesty.

33
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,719
Father.

34
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,360
- Your Majesty.
- Father.

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,639
Chu Xiaoran, hurry.

36
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,879
His Majesty passed away.

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,879
Qingcheng.

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,439
Guards.

39
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,759
Imperial Guards, seal off the main hall.

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
Execute anyone who disobeys.

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,599
Understood.

42
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,080
Supreme Guards,
keep everyone under control.

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,639
Execute anyone who tries to leave.

44
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,639
Understood.

45
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,280
Take my token to summon

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,560
the lieutenants to the capital.

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,520
Understood.

48
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,639
What are you doing?

49
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,360
Show respect to His Majesty's body.

50
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,719
Chu Xiaoran, I know you mean well.

51
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,960
But you can't touch him now.

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,680
You will die for this.

53
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,879
A physician can't let someone die.

54
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,560
I won't let him die yet.

55
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,199
Push him away.

56
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,439
Tell them to stand back.

57
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,280
Chu Xiaoran.

58
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,080
Get lost.

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,439
Don't try to hold me back.

60
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,439
(Mansion of Lord Zhennan)

61
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,680
General Wang, inform our people

62
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,960
among the Imperial Guards
and Supreme Guards

63
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,360
to kill the chief commanders

64
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,319
and take control.

65
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,199
Understood.

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,319
General Yuan, lead your troops
and the neighboring state's troops

67
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,479
to attack the capital.

68
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,319
Understood.

69
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,599
Lu, tell the martial artists

70
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,800
to stir up trouble.

71
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,240
We need to put the world in chaos.

72
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,120
Once I ascend the throne,

73
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,480
I will pacify the world
to build a reputation.

74
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
Your Highness.

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,240
The rebels are attacking.

76
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,680
We have too few guards.
We won't hold for long.

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,399
(He did put many agents here.)

78
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,600
(He's been plotting it for a long time.)

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,879
(Chu Xiaoran, I hope
you will not disappoint me.)

80
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,639
Hurry.

81
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,959
Retreat to the main hall.

82
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,519
Retreat to the main hall.

83
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,519
Don't blame yourself.

84
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,879
You have done your best.

85
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,959
My niece, the rebels have stormed in.

86
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,360
Open up for me. Be a good girl.

87
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,839
I just want to see
my brother for the last time.

88
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,959
After all, we are family.

89
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,399
Without Father's edict,

90
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,040
no one may enter.

91
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,600
Please forgive me.

92
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,959
Qingcheng.

93
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,800
Why are you playing dumb
when you know what's going on?

94
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,279
My brother has passed away.

95
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,439
Everything is in turmoil.

96
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:57,600
The two of us should join hands
to stabilize the situation

97
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,319
and safeguard the court.

98
00:06:59,319 --> 00:06:59,839
Right?

99
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,040
You're mistaken.

100
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,519
My father is here.

101
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,639
The world is at peace.

102
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,279
Could it be
that you harbor rebellious intentions?

103
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,279
Then don't blame me for this.

104
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,360
The Princess Ye Qingcheng

105
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,199
and the Crown Prince Ye Li

106
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,600
killed His Majesty for usurpation.

107
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,040
Kill them!

108
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,879
Xiaoxiao.

109
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,160
I can die

110
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,399
without regret

111
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
since I've met you.

112
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,920
Thank you.

113
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,759
Do you know
why I chose to study medicine?

114
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,800
I often hoped

115
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,560
that I could have
saved my father back then.

116
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,080
Let me lean on you for a second.

117
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,559
Can you hold me?

118
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm only pretending to be tough.

119
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:17,879
In fact,

120
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,679
I've missed my dad.

121
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,360
When I see other people's dads,

122
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,840
I am reminded of my own.

123
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,080
How I wish he is still alive.

124
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:01,919
