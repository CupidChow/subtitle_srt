00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:44,448
=The Girl Inside Me=

2
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,799
Kill him

4
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,959
to prove that you really
want to protect me.

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,159
No, no, I can't.

6
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,359
You can die for me.

7
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,400
But you can't kill him for me.

8
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,359
Why?

9
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,200
I don't know how to kill people.

10
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,759
Nor do I have the guts.

11
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,639
And someone once said

12
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,280
that each life has a meaning.

13
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,199
We have no right to claim anyone's life.

14
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,439
Who said that?

15
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,280
A friend of mine.

16
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,280
Your Highness,
what should we do about him?

17
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,360
Take him away.

18
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Lock him up first.

19
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

20
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,560
You acted like

21
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,400
a real man today.

22
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,159
But don't do this again.

23
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,240
It's so dangerous.

24
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,599
The big shots all have bodyguards.

25
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,599
So don't be heroic.

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,840
Give me a break. I'm still anxious.

27
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
(Young Master Chu.)

28
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,960
Someone is coming. You take control.

29
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
Miss Ruyi.

30
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,319
What can I do for you?

31
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,240
Her Highness wants you
to have this jade token.

32
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
With this jade token,

33
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,240
the entire Princess's Mansion
is open to you.

34
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,520
Thank you.

35
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,199
Then can I visit her bedroom?

36
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,280
Of course, you can,

37
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,680
if you're suicidal.

38
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,719
Ruyi, do you know

39
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,719
what General Si Tian
likes to do in his leisure time?

40
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,360
What kind of food does he like?
Where does he go?

41
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,759
What kind of people does he like?

42
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,120
I want to give him a gift.

43
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,879
But I don't know what to give.

44
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,840
Can you give me a suggestion?

45
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,319
He likes women.

46
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,600
I am a woman.

47
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,959
Backyard is off-limits.
No entry is allowed.

48
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,240
Why is it off-limits?

49
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Wait.

50
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,199
Is it still off-limits?

51
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,079
Sixth Uncle put the Crown Prince
in charge of the horse racing tomorrow.

52
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,480
But it seems they have bought
some kind of Heavenly Horse.

53
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,800
How can our chestnut horses

54
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,439
compete with a Heavenly Horse?

55
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,480
If we lose,

56
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,639
the Crown Prince will be humiliated.

57
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,399
What should I do?

58
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,160
Your Highness.

59
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,800
Chu Xiaoran, what are you doing here?

60
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,720
I came for a bath

61
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,439
and ran into you.

62
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,160
Go on. It helps you sweat.

63
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,120
You've grown more and more shameless.

64
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,160
Get out of here.

65
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,800
Your Highness, your skin is so fair.

66
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,480
How do you maintain it?

67
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,279
You...

68
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,560
Shameless.

69
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,319
Keep staring
and I'll gouge out your eyes.

70
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,360
Get out.

71
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,759
Why are you so mean?

72
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,680
Let me teach you a lesson.

73
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,680
Simpleton, take over.

74
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,560
Simpleton, open the cloth bag.

75
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,680
Something in there
will make you less awkward.

76
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,319
A snake.

77
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,560
The snake is gone.

78
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,319
Is it?

79
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,759
That was so scary.

80
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,279
Simpleton, how do you
call yourself a man?

81
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,839
I was bitten by a snake as a kid.

82
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,959
The snake is back.

83
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,319
Where? Where is it?

84
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,399
It's gone.

85
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,600
Are you sure?

86
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,360
Come on. Great opportunity.

87
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,560
Kiss her.

88
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,160
No.

89
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,079
Kiss her.

90
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,600
No.

91
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,240
Get off.

92
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,879
No.

93
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,279
Move aside.

94
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,720
Move, I'll do it.

95
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,560
What are you doing?

96
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,120
Get off.

97
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,839
Let me do it.

98
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:10,762
Go away.

99
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:11,932
Go away.

100
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,439
What's your problem?

101
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,680
Simpleton, you're so useless.

102
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,480
You acted like a coward in front of her

103
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,839
and missed a great opportunity.

104
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,960
Stop dwelling on it.

105
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,399
There is a great opportunity

106
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,399
that could help you regain her trust.

107
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,840
The horse racing?

108
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,039
I'm not good at it.

109
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,159
Once a simpleton, always a simpleton.

110
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,519
You can ask me for help.

111
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,919
Please guide me.

112
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,720
Later...

113
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:14,080
Later, I will give you
a sachet of medicine powder.

114
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,039
Mix it into the fodder

115
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,399
to feed that Heavenly Horse.

116
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,240
Feed it to the Heavenly Horse?

117
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,840
And send a few mares
to its stable at night.

118
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,399
Mares?

119
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,799
I don't believe that the Heavenly Horse
can still race tomorrow.

120
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,559
But first, you must
set a condition with the princess.

121
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Ask her to kiss you if you help her win.
