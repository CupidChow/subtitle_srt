Flowers for sale.

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,759
(If only I was rich back in my world.)

5
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,840
(Let's spend some good money today)

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,520
(like a rich person.)

7
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,119
(Where is Si Tian?)

8
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,399
(He's already late.)

9
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,600
Miss, take a look.
This hairpin is of good quality.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,239
Flowers for sale.

11
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:06,959
Fresh flowers.

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,920
Sir, have a look.

13
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,920
It matches the princess.

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,680
It's my first gift for her.

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,040
She will definitely be moved.

16
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,959
Sir, how much is this?

17
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:21,200
Five taels of silver.

18
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,599
Here are 100 taels. Keep the change.

19
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,640
You're so generous.

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,159
Wrap it up.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,920
Alrighty.

22
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,120
Young Master Wang,
I like that hairpin too.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,904
Alright.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,480
Sir, I'll take this hairpin.

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,680
Young Master Wang.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,519
Here you are.

27
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,640
It's my honor
that you fancy this hairpin.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,200
Please accept it as a gift.

29
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,319
You can't do business like this.

30
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,760
I paid for it. It's mine.

31
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,200
How can you give it away?

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,920
Sir, please give me a second.

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,280
I will refund you.

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,560
I don't want the money.

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,959
I want the hairpin. Give it here.

36
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,519
Who do you think you are?

37
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,239
How dare you oppose Young Master Wang?

38
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,680
You must be blind.

39
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,359
I've never seen someone so arrogant.

40
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,280
Today you've met one.

41
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,920
Let me tell you, lad.

42
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,199
You're not getting this hairpin.

43
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,960
Moreover, if you don't get on your knees
to apologize right now,

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,400
you won't live to see tomorrow's sun.

45
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,960
You're robbing me in broad daylight?

46
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,120
So domineering.

47
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,400
You're in charge here?

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,919
How dare you talk to
Young Master Wang like this?

49
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,479
You're courting death.

50
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,479
Who cares?

51
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,439
I don't know him.

52
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,439
But I know you.

53
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,400
What do you know?

54
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,080
You are a lowly bully and a bootlicker

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,960
who clings to the powerful.

56
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,080
No, no.

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,639
That's an insult
to the word "bootlicker".

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,159
You...

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,759
Young Master Wang, he kicked me.

60
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,800
How dare you hit a woman?

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
Why can't a woman hit another woman?

62
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,240
Kill him.

63
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,039
Don't move.

64
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,560
Check this out.

65
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,560
Do you recognize this jade pendant?

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,120
Beat him up.

67
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,400
Stop.

68
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:09,840
Where is Si Tian?

69
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,680
He's busy.

70
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,520
He sent me here.

71
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,199
Who are you?

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,439
So it's Young Master Wang.

73
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,439
My brother here
shouldn't have offended you.

74
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,120
I apologize on his behalf.

75
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,280
His father is in charge
of the Imperial Guards.

76
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,520
I am very magnanimous.

77
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,199
As long as this lad licks my shoes clean

78
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,599
and crawls under my crotch,

79
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,199
I will let him off today.

80
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,120
Got a problem?

81
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,039
Young Master Chu.

82
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,360
Her Highness needs his father's support.

83
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,840
Why don't you concede a little?

84
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,039
Concede...

85
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,719
Fine, I'll concede.

86
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,080
Anything for Her Highness.

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,479
Young Master, I didn't recognize
a distinguished person like you.

88
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,800
I apologize for offending you.

89
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,960
On your knees.

90
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:03,840
You...

91
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,759
Alright.

92
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,160
That was impressive.

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Encircle them.

94
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,399
Young Master Wang.

95
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,600
Does it hurt?

96
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,920
I want them dead.

97
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:01,959
Guards.

98
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,160
Who dares?

99
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,279
We work for Duke Dingjun
and the Princess.

100
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,480
Do I look like I care?

101
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,279
Kill them.

102
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,040
Your Highness.

103
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,560
Young Master Chu is under attack
by the Imperial Guards in the street.

104
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,639
What?

105
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,959
Zuo Tang.

106
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,839
Your buddies died
because of me. I'm so sorry.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,199
It's not your fault.

108
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,639
Tie them all up.

109
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,959
I'll chop them alive.

110
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
Stop.

111
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,560
How dare you

112
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,519
commit murder in broad daylight?

113
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
Lord Chen.

114
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,439
The Capital Administration

115
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,920
should stay out of our business.

116
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,319
Whatever happens within the capital

117
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,319
is under our jurisdiction.

118
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,120
How can you...

119
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,439
Young Master Wang.

120
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,680
Let's leave it at this.

121
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,519
We'll fix it later.

122
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,360
Just you wait.

123
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,920
Let's go.

124
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,079
Let's go.

125
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,399
Are you alright?

126
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,600
You're not hurt, right?

127
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,399
They were outrageous.

128
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,920
I wouldn't let them rob me

129
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
so they tried to kill me.

130
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,439
Come on.

131
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,639
What is more important than life?

132
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,759
Aren't you usually afraid of death?

133
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,160
Aren't you very flexible?

134
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,399
I bought you a hairpin

135
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,319
and almost got robbed.

136
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:21,879
It's all my fault.

137
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,639
If I had endured a bit more,

138
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,240
it wouldn't have happened.

139
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,040
Our brothers wouldn't have died.

140
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,399
Tolerance only leads to
more transgression.

141
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,279
My honorable troops

142
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,959
did not die in battle

143
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,120
and were killed by petty beings.

144
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,240
What a huge irony.

145
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:58,800
My lord.

146
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,279
The Wang family
is supported by the Sixth Lord.

147
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,600
So what?

148
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,759
The law applies to even His Majesty.

149
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,720
Let's seek justice for our buddies.

150
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,879
Go away. Stop looking.

151
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,839
Give me a kiss.

152
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,040
Young Master Wang, please don't.

153
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,720
Go away.

154
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,439
Behave.

155
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,240
No.

156
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,560
No.

157
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,399
Stop it.

158
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,120
Help me.

159
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,040
How dare you scoundrel harass this lady?

160
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,960
I wondered who it was.

161
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,559
It's you again.

162
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,559
Did you rush here to get killed?

163
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,679
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

164
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,399
My father works for the Sixth...

165
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,279
Young Master Wang.

166
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,080
So cool.

167
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,759
My little heart.

168
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,879
That's my idol.

169
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
Be a bit more discreet.

170
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,960
It's a bit weird for me
to be infatuated with other men.

171
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,600
Be discreet.

172
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,039
So, did you

173
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,360
vent your anger?

174
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,679
Totally.

175
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
You were so cool back there.

176
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,120
So cool.

177
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,480
Get off.

178
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,320
Get off the chair.

179
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,279
Get off.

180
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,399
No.

181
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,480
- Get up.
- No.

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sorry, someone was losing it.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,600
You don't know her.

184
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,720
Where were we?

185
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,039
Any ordinary person

186
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,039
would have been bullied today.

187
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,559
So we must gain power

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,200
to protect ourselves

189
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,200
and those who we care about.

190
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,840
You're right.

191
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,559
We killed Wang Hai.
