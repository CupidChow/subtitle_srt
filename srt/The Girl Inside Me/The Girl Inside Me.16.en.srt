=Episode 16=

3
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,320
I pay my respect to Your Highness.

4
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,960
Spare the formality.

5
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,039
Thank you, Your Highness.

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,320
How's the investigation going
about the corruption

7
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,799
of the Imperial Guards, Lord Chen?

8
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,640
You've planned far ahead.

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,119
I started the investigation last year.

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,840
Wang Dachui and his subordinates

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,079
did take briberies.

12
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,200
The Imperial Guards
are filled with corruption

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,319
which causes trouble.

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,439
It is time to clean the house.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,040
Well, well, Si Tian.

16
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,400
How dare you kill my son?

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,359
I must avenge him

18
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,319
or I am unworthy as a father.

19
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,159
General.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,439
Si Tian is a great fighter

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,120
and holds military power.

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,879
It's tricky to deal with him.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
General, the Sixth Lord sent you this.

24
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:36,128
(Kill)

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,159
It seems that we have the same thought.

26
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,200
How can we manage to kill Si Tian?

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,359
There is a sect
called "Kill Without Mercy".

28
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,439
Their assassins are highly experienced.

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,439
I will hire them.

30
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,359
No matter how well-trained Si Tian is,

31
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,480
he's not going to survive this.

32
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,599
No, wait.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,840
You should place it here.

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,919
Yeah, block me here.

35
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,120
Or I'll have four in a row
on the next move.

36
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,879
Then you will lose, right?

37
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,840
My Lord, the next...

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,759
We got a tip.

39
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,680
The Imperial Guards are meeting
the assassins at Manyue House tonight.

40
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,240
Manyue House.

41
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,112
That's right.

42
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,960
This is getting interesting.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,599
What's your plan?

44
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,840
Take their places.

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,560
Use their plan against them.

46
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,932
(Heaven No. 1)

47
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:53,960
The code.

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,479
What code?

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,680
There is no code.

50
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,479
If you had said something,
you would already be dead.

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,639
Come in.

52
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,280
Have a seat.

53
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,599
What is the matter?

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,879
So you are from...

55
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,800
"Kill Without Mercy"?

56
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,520
That's right.

57
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,520
We are the "Ultra Group"

58
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,719
from "Kill Without Mercy".

59
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,840
I'm "Group".

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,719
I'm "Ultra".

61
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,800
What is it?

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,039
Five hundred taels of gold
to kill this person.

63
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,879
Si Tian, Duke Dingjun.

64
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,879
Duke Si Tian?

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,120
He looks better in the painting.

66
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,960
That'll cost extra.

67
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,519
As long as you kill him,

68
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,560
feel free to name your price.

69
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:24,720
One...

70
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,199
One thousand taels of gold?

71
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,639
Five hundred taels upfront.

72
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,560
Pay me the rest after the job is done.

73
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,040
Deal.

74
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Bring me Si Tian's head tomorrow.

75
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,879
Alright.

76
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,279
Well, "Ultra Group".

77
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,040
Can you kill another person for me?

78
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,839
Who?

79
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,560
There's a servant named Chu Xiaoran
in the Princess's Mansion.

80
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,519
One thousand taels of gold.

81
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,480
Chu Xiaoran?

82
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,639
One thousand taels of gold?

83
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Forget it then.

84
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,879
Even 100 taels of silver are too much.

85
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,680
Please.

86
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:31,872

87
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:39,560
(Heaven No. 1)

88
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,040
The code.

89
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,079
What code?

90
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,199
There is no code.

91
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,040
I was testing you.

92
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,680
If you had blurted out something,

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,600
you would already be dead.

94
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,200
(Heaven No. 1)

95
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,639
You two are

96
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,720
the legendary duo
from "Kill Without Mercy"?

97
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,959
The "Wreckers Group".

98
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,120
Who do you want to kill?

99
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,839
Commander Wang of the Imperial Guards.

100
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,839
One thousand taels of gold?

101
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,480
One hundred taels of gold.

102
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,240
Deal.

103
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,639
Here are 500 taels of gold.

104
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,199
Kill his whole family.

105
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,279
Any problems?

106
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,160
Not at all.

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,319
We even made a profit.

108
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,240
Your Highness, something happened!

109
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,879
Commander Wang
and all his key subordinates are killed.

110
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,920
What a great news.

111
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,319
Do we know who did it?

112
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,079
We don't know yet.

113
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,399
But the killers were extremely brutal.

114
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,600
It must have been the work
of an assassin organization.

115
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,319
Bring Chu Xiaoran here right now.

116
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,279
Understood.

117
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,879
Your Highness.

118
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,920
He's out drinking with Duke Dingjun.

119
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,360
He asked you to meet him.

120
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,519
He also said

121
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,439
that if you don't go,

122
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,439
you should start appointing
some Imperial Guards.

123
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,680
He also said that he simply did his job

124
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,360
and you don't need to
marry him to show your gratitude.

125
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,800
I will find him a wife instead.

126
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,040
After all, Shuang'er is still into him.

127
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

128
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,439
Have a seat.

129
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,839
My lord.

130
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,519
How do you say it?

131
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,680
You know?

132
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,959
Something about subduing
the enemy's troops.

133
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,920
Subdue...

134
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,879
Subdue the enemy's troops
without fighting.

135
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,639
That's right.

136
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,320
How about this?

137
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,279
Stay at my place tonight.

138
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Let's have a long talk overnight.

139
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,960
What do you say?

140
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,759
Wonderful.

141
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,399
A long talk overnight.

142
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,679
Let's go.

143
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,559
No, my lord.

144
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,120
Let's just call it a day.

145
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Let's continue tomorrow.

146
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,320
Rest early, Young Master.

147
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,720
Rest early, Young Master.

148
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,039
A long talk overnight.

149
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,600
Xiaoxiao.

150
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:09,799
- Cheers.
- Xiaoxiao.

151
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,879
Keep drinking.

152
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,679
Happy.

153
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,720
Xiaoxiao.

154
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,879
I have Simpleton in my left arm

155
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,840
and Si Tian in my right arm.

156
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,840
Si Tian, why are you

157
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
hitting me so hard?

158
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,320
And you've grown so tall.

159
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,639
Xiaoxiao.

160
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,039
Xiaoxiao.

161
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,679
Simpleton.

162
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,879
What will you do once I go back?

163
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,559
You are now caught up in the whirlpool.

164
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,639
After I leave,

165
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,639
will you make it out of this mess alive?

166
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,919
Can't you stay?

167
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:23,200
I-I could share the body with you.

168
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,919
Sharing a body isn't so good.

169
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,399
When you're
with the princess, I'm there.

170
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,639
When I'm with Si Tian, you're there.

171
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,240
I'm a bit confused.

172
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,720
You can...

173
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,519
You can use my body to be

174
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,440
brothers with Si Tian.

175
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,639
No.

176
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,159
No.

177
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,639
If I don't complete the mission,

178
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:07,919
I...

179
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,320
