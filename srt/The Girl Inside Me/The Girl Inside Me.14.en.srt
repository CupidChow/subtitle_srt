00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:51,880
Your Highness.

4
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,240
Your Highness.

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,079
Well, Father has agreed to our marriage.

6
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,159
To make us a better match,

7
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,560
he's making me his godchild.

8
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:05,792
(Token)

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,359
Do you think I will believe that?

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,480
I'll expose your lie right now.

11
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,359
Father needs to rest.

12
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,680
Father said

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,319
that as long as you like me,

14
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,280
he will agree to it.

15
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,159
I advise you not to waste your time.

16
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,840
Can you find someone better than me?

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,719
You can't.

18
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,840
I won't fall for you.

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,400
Didn't you promise to marry me?

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,599
Aren't your words as good as gold?

21
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,079
You heard it as well.

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,519
Her Highness said she doesn't like me.

23
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,599
Forget it.

24
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,799
No way.

25
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,159
Women often say one thing
and mean another, right?

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,959
She said she doesn't like you.
It means she likes you.

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,120
As a man, how can you give up halfway?

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,280
So, what do we do now?

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,840
What's wrong?

30
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,439
I'm ignoring you.

31
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,360
Why?

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,479
Because I don't want to talk to you.

33
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,319
(That means she wants to talk to me.)

34
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,599
I read a story in the book you gave me.

35
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,840
Do you want to hear it?

36
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,479
What story?

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,240
A farmer found a pig.

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,560
But the pig ran away.

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,680
Guess where the pig ran off to?

40
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,639
Trying to trick me?

41
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,840
The pig came to tell stories.

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,199
You shouldn't say that.

43
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,240
You should say you don't know.

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,360
Then I'd say the pig
came to listen to stories.

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,800
A newbie like you wants to trick me?

46
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,960
Yeah.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,120
I should learn more from you.

48
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,719
Fine, let me test you.

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,879
Go ahead.

50
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,560
Do you know why the pig is so dumb?

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,039
You should ask the pig, not me.

52
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,960
That's why I'm asking you.

53
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,319
Wait. Doesn't that make me a pig?

54
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,479
You fool.

55
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,599
You'll need another ten years
to pull a trick on me.

56
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,159
Tell me what it is.

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,800
My lord, these are all
Chu Xiaoran's relatives.

58
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,039
All his relatives are dead?

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,199
My lord, Chu Xiaoran's family
all came here fleeing famine.

60
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,759
I can't trace their origin.

61
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,840
I only found the remains of his parents.

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,479
Maybe you can lash out
at the remains to vent your anger.

63
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,599
I'll lash you.

64
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,120
My lord, feel free to do that
as long as it makes you happy.

65
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,840
Aren't you lying to me?

66
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,680
Get lost.

67
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,040
I feel much better today.

68
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,079
That's right.

69
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,800
You're getting better and better.

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,439
I am truly happy.

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,879
The credit goes to Her Highness
for bringing the best physician.

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,399
This person

73
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,439
is nothing ordinary.

74
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,199
You know what I mean?

75
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,319
Yes, I do.

76
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,800
For us who are in power,

77
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,800
someone's ability
matters more than his background.

78
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,759
I trust your judgment.

79
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,120
Come on, walk with me
in the imperial garden.

80
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,800
I'd like to hear your deployment

81
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,920
against the backlash from your uncle.

82
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,519
How I miss the bubble tea in the autumn.

83
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,079
Why isn't there any?

84
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,480
Give me a lollipop then.

85
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,519
Why won't you even give me a lollipop?

86
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,839
You're taking too many things.

87
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,800
You need to give something
of equal value in exchange.

88
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,079
God, you're too stingy.

89
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,319
There's a task. Will you take it?

90
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,959
There's a mysterious reward.

91
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,199
What kind of reward?

92
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,319
I don't need anything right now.

93
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:16,279
I don't want it
unless it's something special.

94
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,959
It's something you'd dream of having.

95
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,120
What is it?

96
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,839
What's the task?

97
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,279
The task is to save a person.

98
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,959
As for the reward,

99
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,199
I'll keep it a secret for now.

100
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,759
As long as it's legal,

101
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,319
I'll take on this task.

102
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Send me there.

103
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,519
The time has not yet come.

104
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,160
That person has not fallen ill yet.

105
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Your Highness,
Young Master Chu has arrived.

106
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,079
(This princess is so hard to please.)

107
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,040
(I've been helping
Simpleton for so long.)

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,879
(I guess I'll have to
take extreme measures.)

109
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,360
How dare you

110
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,879
pry into my privacy

111
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,560
without permission?

112
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,399
I've been striving
for your cause wholeheartedly.

113
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,639
I thought you'd at least
be frank with me.

114
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,560
But you're still
keeping secrets from me.

115
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,879
It's about the command token.

116
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,319
You are not a martial artist.

117
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,079
I put you in a difficult position
by involving you in this.

118
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,040
If you are reluctant...

119
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,800
I volunteer.

120
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,160
Your Highness.

121
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,360
For you, I am willing to do anything.

122
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,720
For you, I am willing to do anything.

123
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,600
Even if it means I have to marry you.

124
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,080
Even if it means I have to marry you.

125
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,519
Do you feel it?

126
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,320
It beats only for you.

127
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,840
Do you feel it?

128
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,200
It beats only for you.

129
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,879
No.

130
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,559
I only feel something tough.

131
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,679
Sorry about that.

132
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,399
One must always
carry something for self-defense.

133
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,960
Don't mind it.

134
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,840
How about now?

135
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,919
Do you feel it now?

136
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,840
No.

137
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,240
Feel it a bit longer.

138
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,399
Take it all in.

139
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,240
You're getting even bolder.

140
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,279
Your Highness.

141
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I've been working so hard

142
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,960
to bring peace to you,
the people, and the Great Chu.

143
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,039
Can't you just reward me

144
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,679
for my good work as an encouragement?

145
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,200
What reward do you want?

146
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,559
I want...

147
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,240
Don't ask for something indecent.

148
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,080
Watch your words.

149
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,240
Do you really find me indecent?

150
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,799
Yes.

151
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,879
Alright then.

152
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,919
You know.

153
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,279
It's hard to make connections
through bribery.

154
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,360
We need a fortune
to hire an experienced martial artist.

155
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,200
But I'm short on cash. So can you...

156
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,960
I am tired.

157
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Suit yourself.

158
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
(You think
you're making things hard for me?)

159
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,440
