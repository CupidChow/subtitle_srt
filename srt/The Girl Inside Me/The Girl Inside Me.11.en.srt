=Episode 11=

3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,399
We don't need rewards

4
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,880
to work for you.

5
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,560
How about you give us a rubdown

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,039
after we fulfill the task?

7
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,920
Alright, I agree to your terms.

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,239
If you fail the task,

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,200
I'll punish you severely.

10
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,359
My buddy.

11
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,040
I feel empowered to achieve more
with less effort with your help.

12
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,159
Don't be so distant.

13
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,840
Let's go for a bath together.

14
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,719
It would be a pity
not to scrub a body like yours.

15
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,239
Let's do it twice.

16
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,680
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

17
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,079
Xiaoxiao.

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,199
Can we set some rules?

19
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,000
No.

20
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,280
Can you stop
touching other men in my body?

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,759
It feels very strange.

22
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,360
I'm working hard
to win over the princess.

23
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,080
Can't I have some hobby of my own?

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,919
Despicable man, don't be so selfish.

25
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,599
I-Indeed, you made her

26
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,479
think highly of me.

27
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,759
That's my point.

28
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,240
A man should be magnanimous.

29
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,479
As long as someone has a pure soul,

30
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,240
why does it matter
if he is covered with dust?

31
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,000
Ruyi.

32
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,840
Do you think Chu Xiaoran truly loves me?

33
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,680
Be honest.

34
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,439
He has every reason to admire you

35
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,960
since you're so distinguished.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,680
But in my opinion,

37
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,919
Young Master Chu
cares more for Duke Dingjun.

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,599
What do you mean?

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,159
Let me tell you.

40
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,439
For real?

41
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,319
Your Highness,
Young Master Chu has arrived.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,599
I pay my respects to Your Highness.

43
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,319
I'm a bit tired today.

44
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,159
Give me a shoulder rub.

45
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,360
Didn't you hear me?

46
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,800
Are you speaking to me?

47
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,519
Is there anyone else here?

48
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,439
At your command.

49
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,160
I-I'll be gentler.

50
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,680
It's pointless
to rub her shoulders alone

51
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,519
even if you have
great technique, Simpleton.

52
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,600
Find her sensitive spot.

53
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,279
What's a sensitive spot?

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,959
Stroke her ear.

55
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,079
No.

56
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,959
No.

57
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,639
Not like that.

58
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,160
How?

59
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
Like this.

60
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,639
What are you doing?

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Massaging you.

62
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,279
Who said you could touch my ears?

63
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,519
You didn't forbid it.

64
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,319
Chu Xiaoran, don't be witty.

65
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,399
I'm not in the mood

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,920
to argue with you.

67
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,279
What's bothering Your Highness?

68
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,319
Father has been getting worse.

69
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,279
There's turbulence in the court.

70
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,360
I'm so exhausted.

71
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,600
Ask her what illness His Majesty has.

72
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,399
W-What illness do you have?

73
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,800
Let me do it.

74
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,879
What is His Majesty suffering from?

75
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,680
The imperial physician says

76
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,879
it's a disease of thirst
and excessive concern.

77
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,399
(Isn't that diabetes and anxiety?)

78
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,160
Your Highness,
why not take me to the palace?

79
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,839
Perhaps I can ease
His Majesty's condition.

80
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,920
Do you know what you are saying?

81
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,360
Did I say something wrong?

82
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,959
If you can't cure him,

83
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,399
you'll be put to death.

84
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,199
Aren't you scared?

85
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,879
Your Highness.

86
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,480
For Your Highness, I'm willing to die.

87
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,800
If I could make His Majesty better,

88
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,120
would you accept me?

89
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
What do you mean?

90
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,319
Will you marry me?

91
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:41,839
You...

92
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,160
If you could cure him,

93
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,079
why wouldn't I marry you?

94
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,199
However, if you can't cure him,

95
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,360
even I can't save you.

96
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,399
For Your Highness, I'm willing to die.

97
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,959
However, I have a small request.

98
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,600
What is it?

99
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,560
I want Si Tian to be buried with me.

100
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,600
What?

101
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,600
I mean,

102
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,600
I want him to accompany me to the palace

103
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,720
as my assistant.

104
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,839
Okay?

105
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,480
What's wrong, buddy?

106
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,440
(You've become concerned about me.)

107
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,480
It's nothing.

108
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,360
I'm still hurting from the punishment.

109
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,919
But it's alright.

110
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,399
It's worth it

111
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,519
as long as you're not implicated.

112
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,960
Thank you, buddy.

113
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,559
Come on, let me hold you.

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,919
Thanks, buddy.

115
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,856
No problem.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,279
Mind the steps.

117
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,639
Xiaoxiao, why are you hugging him again?

118
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,080
Stop hugging him.

119
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Chu Xiaoran, you're about to meet
the emperor. Are you scared?

120
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,200
I never thought I'd see
His Majesty in my lifetime.

121
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,200
I'm asking if you're afraid of death.

122
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,120
I am.

123
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,879
But now that I have you,

124
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,879
I'm no longer afraid.

125
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,919
You've become quite a talker.

126
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,440
I pay my respects to you, Father.

127
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,440
I pay my respects to Your Majesty.

128
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,279
Thank you, Your Majesty.

129
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,720
Qingcheng, come here.

130
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,559
Father, I am not a filial child.

131
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,840
I haven't taken good care of you.

132
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,720
It's my fault.

133
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,559
I know

134
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,720
that you're shouldering a heavy burden.

135
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,200
The Crown Prince hasn't matured.

136
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,879
You've worked hard.

137
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,960
It seems

138
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,240
the diabetes is quite severe.

139
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,279
It's troublesome.

140
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Who is he?

141
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,320
Father, he is Chu Xiaoran.

142
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,559
I invited him here to treat you.

143
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,600
To treat me?

144
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,320
How many imperial physicians

145
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,519
and folk doctors have died for this?

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
In that case,
do you still dare to treat me?

147
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,639
Your Majesty.

148
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,879
You're the cornerstone of the state.

149
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,360
I can't cure Your Majesty,

150
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,759
but I'm confident I can ease your pain.

151
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,720
For Your Majesty,

152
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,559
I am willing to risk my life

153
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,279
without fear.

154
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,600
Rest assured, I'm trained in medicine.

155
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,919
I have the basic knowledge.

156
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,480
In that case,

157
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,759
show me some of your skills

158
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,360
so that I can trust you.

159
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,840
This way, you won't be
risking your life in vain.

160
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,759
I have suffered
from chronic headaches for many years.

161
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Such pain is unbearable.

162
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,000
Now that I'm speaking of it,

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,679
my head starts hurting again.

164
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,840
