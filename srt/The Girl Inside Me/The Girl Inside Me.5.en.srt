00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,208
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,079
Take off your pants.

4
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,719
I'd rather be killed than insulted.

5
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,840
So tough?

6
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,439
A man can't give in.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,439
Aren't you afraid of death?

8
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,119
You're distinguished enough

9
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,079
to determine people's fate.

10
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,560
But a true man
must stick to his principles

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,920
even at the cost of his life.

12
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,640
How come there is nothing?

13
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,319
Guards, capture this man
who has offended me.

14
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,439
Make him a eunuch in the palace.

15
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,319
Your Highness, I'm the one
who just got insulted.

16
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,879
The guilty party complains first?

17
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm going to...

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,400
You're laughing?

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm about to be a eunuch.

20
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,680
It's okay.

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,120
We can be sisters like that.

22
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,159
Then how do I pursue the princess?

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,000
Spare him!

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,992
(Cleansing Room)

25
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,560
Dear Jade Emperor and Queen Mother.

26
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
Please don't do this to me.

27
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,080
Don't take it from me
before I even use it.

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,680
Hurry up.

29
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,960
Wait.

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,439
Your Excellency.

31
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,599
Look at the tender skin.

32
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,520
What a pity
if we can't make you one of us.

33
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,199
Take him in.

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,039
W-What are you doing, sister?

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,080
Let's go.

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,479
Chu Xiaoran must be
the one from the divination.

37
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,840
But why doesn't he have
the seven stars on him?

38
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,879
Seven stars.

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,319
He has seven moles
on the sole of his foot,

40
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,520
just like the Big Dipper.

41
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,960
Seven moles.

42
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,439
Oh no.

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,159
Your Excellency, let's talk this out.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,479
Your Excellency, I apologize.

45
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,039
I shouldn't have called you sister.

46
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,120
Your Excellency.

47
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,080
Your Excellency, please let me go.

48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,400
Your Excellency.

49
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,879
You little animal
have too much on your mind.

50
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,159
It would bring you peace

51
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,199
to get you castrated.

52
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,759
Don't.

53
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,159
Your Excellency,
the anesthesia is ready.

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,879
Why bother with the anesthesia?

55
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,800
This little animal is quite tough.

56
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,479
Without the anesthetic,

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,280
wouldn't he feel massive pain?

58
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,159
You old thing.

59
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,599
You're so vicious.

60
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,839
Rest assured.

61
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:23,360
My knife is very sharp.

62
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,759
Wait.

63
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,439
The ending is written.

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,759
It's only a matter of time.

65
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,680
Tell you what. I'm in a relationship
with the princess.

66
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,959
We are of one mind and heart.

67
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,399
I shouldn't have

68
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,519
spoiled her so much
that she gets angry so easily.

69
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,319
She sent me here today just to scare me.

70
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,240
I finally realized her intentions.

71
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,079
This blabbermouth is a dead man.

72
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,759
In that case, I have to think it over.

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,839
Definitely.

74
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,639
Your Excellency, do you believe
everything he says?

75
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,399
He's talking about Her Highness.

76
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,720
But what if it's true.

77
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,759
Your Excellency, I wouldn't dare make up

78
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,720
something like that
about Her Highness, right?

79
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,920
Let me go.

80
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,959
I'll speak well of you in front of her.

81
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,240
Maybe she will be pleased

82
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,839
and send you a few handsome young men.

83
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,800
That's not a bad idea.

84
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,528
Yeah.

85
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,399
Right, where was he sent from?

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,639
From the Princess's Mansion, I think.

87
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,199
Yeah.

88
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,480
Since he was sent
from the Princess's Mansion,

89
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,879
we should just castrate him.

90
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,920
I'm not lying. I'm dating the princess.

91
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,360
I'm dating the princess.

92
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,439
As long as he's alive.

93
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,488
No, no, Your Excellency.

94
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Ruyi, what does Her Highness mean?

95
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,160
She means that it doesn't matter

96
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,720
if he misses a body part
as long as he's alive.

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
Behave.

98
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,480
Ruyi, Her Highness has never
cared about any servant.

99
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,600
So...

100
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,800
Stop.

101
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,680
Who are you?

102
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,680
I come by the princess's command
to take him.

103
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,160
You, raise your head.

104
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,120
Say no more, Your Highness.

105
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,199
I get it.

106
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,839
Who asked you to strip?

107
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,759
Your Highness, your hands
are really well-maintained.

108
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,879
Take your hands off me,

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,480
or you won't get to keep them.

110
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,120
What's with your seven moles?

111
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,319
What seven moles?

112
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,279
It's a serious matter.
Take off your shoes.

113
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,639
I need to take a good look.

114
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,399
So you're interested in my feet.

115
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,920
Alright, let's take a look together.

116
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,240
Look.

117
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
But I haven't washed my feet.

118
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,560
Stop it. It tickles.

119
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,959
Indeed, there are seven.

120
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,639
No, Your Highness.

121
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,389
Young Master Chu is so funny.

122
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:53,160
Stop tickling me, Your Highness.

123
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm so embarrassed, oh heavens.

124
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,639
To be happy,
one must let go of the burdens.

125
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,680
You've gone beyond
letting go of burdens. You've...

126
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,199
Say no more.

127
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,839
One's spirit will eventually
transcend the flesh.

128
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,279
Take it lightly.

129
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,800
You are 22 years old.

130
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,199
Don't tell me you're still a virgin.

131
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,120
You are?

132
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,959
Speak not what is contrary to propriety.

133
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,799
