What's the situation?

119
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,140
Did the monitoring device come loose?

120
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,110
It's nothing. The patient's heart rate is a bit fast.

121
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,490
The machine just triggered an automatic alarm.

122
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,760
He won't be in danger, will he?

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,740
Don't worry.

124
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,990
Coma causes the patient's heartbeat to slow down,

125
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,720
but when entering the awakening state,

126
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,530
the heart rate will increase again.

Then,

128
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
it will gradually return to normal.

129
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,350

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,160
He's prone to developing bedsores.

139
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,400
Remember to turn him over and massage him regularly.

140
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,800
Okay.

141
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,640
This will prevent prolonged pressure on his skin.

152
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
Anyway,

153
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,530
thank you for saving me.

154
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,410
I only did it for the recording pen.

155
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,080
Saving you

156
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,530
was just a coincidence.

157
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,640
I understand.

158
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,300
Regardless of the reason,

159
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,980
I owe you a favor.

160
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,730
So,

161
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,140
until you're fully recovered,

162
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,600
I'll continue to take care of you.

163
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,860
That's not necessary.

164
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,200
Do you know

165
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,740
how worried I was about you?

166
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,550
I was really afraid

167
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,190
that you would just sleep

168
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,770
and never wake up again.

169
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,530
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,210
Gao,

171
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,240
you once told me

172
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,820
that only I could make Xingyao successful

173
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,650
because I was a wolf,

174
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,930
with a heart

175
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,620
that wouldn't rest until the goal was achieved.

176
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,600
But you forgot

177
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,020
that wolves also have a vengeful nature,

178
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,280
vengeful and merciless.

179
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,100
Back then,

180
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,150
when I gave you this fishing rod,

181
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,070
I told you

182
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,340
that if Xingyao had a share for me,

183
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,350
it would definitely have a share for you too.

184
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
However,

185
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,480
your son, well,

186
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,360
after I carefully nurtured him for years

187
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
and even married my daughter to him,

188
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,780
he ended up using your fishing rod to tangle my fishing line.

189
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,320
I had no choice

190
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,850
but to destroy him.

191
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,740
Otherwise,

192
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,180
neither fishing rod could be used anymore.

193
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,740
Gao,

194
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,230
can you understand me?

195
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,200
Don't worry.

196
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,730
Your son is currently in a coma.

197
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,630
I won't touch him.

198
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,420
But for what he did to Jingjing,

199
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,930
he must pay the price.

200
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,700
Mr. An, the hospital called.

201
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,790
Mr. Qi has woken up.

202
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,800
He's really giving us trouble, isn't he?

203
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,200
Mr. Qi has survived a great ordeal.

204
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,460
He must have good fortune coming his way.

205
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,840
Have you found out

206
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,610
about Qi Gege's identity?

207
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,760
Didn't you use Qi Lan's manuscript

208
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
to test her?

209
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,730
I think

210
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,100
they just happen to share the surname Qi.

211
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,370
Mr. An,

212
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,800
why are you suspicious of Qi Gege's identity

213
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,830
again?

214
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,900
Qi Gege

215
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,160
had a secret meeting with Gao Shanshan.

216
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,110
What do you think she's after?

217
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,680
The two of them...

218
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,780
The recording.

219
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,010
The people who want to get the recording,

220
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,260
besides You Zhen,

221
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,920
only You You is left.

222
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,840
Five years ago,

223
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,730
Qi Dong threw You You into the sea.

224
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,650
Five years later,

225
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,660
Qi Gege appears as Qi Dong's fiancée.

226
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,700
So, for many things happened,

227
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,430
once is an accident,

228
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,829
twice is a coincidence,

229
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,510
and the third time?

230
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,520
It's premeditated.

231
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,619
If you want to probe her identity,

232
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,000
I have a suggestion.

233
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,550
Five years ago, You You

234
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,280
worked as a drink promoter in a nightclub, right?

235
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,329
We could find an old acquaintance

236
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:25,770
to catch up with her.

237
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,910
Qi Dong secured the exhibition center project,

238
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,970
making a significant contribution.

239
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,830
It's time to prepare a banquet

240
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,550
to properly celebrate.

241
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,300
Understood.

242
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Did you make this?

243
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,480
Try it.

244
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,640
Doctor.

245
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,950
How do you feel?

246
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,050
Much better.

247
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,540
You're recovering well.

248
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,600
You can be discharged now.

249
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,160
Okay, okay.

250
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,880
Thank you, doctor.

251
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,770
Thank you, doctor.

252
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,060
Congratulations on your recovery.

253
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,790
Thank you.

254
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,110
Take care, doctor.

255
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,360
You've been discharged.

256
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

257
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,400
Let's have...

258
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,630
Steak.

259
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,690
Sure.

260
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,730
-Let me do it.
-You cook steaks well.

261
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,150
Welcome, welcome.

262
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,410
A warm welcome.

263
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,290
How is it?

264
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,020
Are you surprised?

265
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,880
Are you amazed?

266
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,380
Your bonus for this month is gone.

267
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,380
Please don't, Dong.

268
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,790
I haven't been idle these past two days.

269
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,320
I've cleaned this room spotlessly.

270
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,160
Look at this floor.

271
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,880
I've polished it until it shines.

272
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,140
It's so shiny you could use it as a mirror.

273
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,890
And, and over there.

274
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,410
I specially invited a Michelin three-star chef.

275
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,670
All the ingredients were flown in today.

276
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,940
I'm giving you one minute to leave.

277
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,710
I'll consider this as making up for your mistakes.

278
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,510
Alright then.

279
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,840
Dong.

280
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,970
There's one more thing.

281
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,760
Mr. An is hosting a celebration dinner tomorrow night

282
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,280
to celebrate you securing the exhibition center.

283
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,240
Take good care of yourself, Dong.

284
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,840
We'll make a grand appearance tomorrow night.

285
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
Dong, your hair is a bit long.

286
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,290

319
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,300
I'm sorry, I...

320
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,980
This custom-made suit

321
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,560
perfectly accentuates Dong's heroic presence.

322
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,480
At this celebration banquet,

323
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,080
we'll undoubtedly be the best-dressed there.

324
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,910
It's just that your complexion

325
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,370
doesn't look quite right.

326
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,880
If you have something to say, say it quickly.

327
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,320
Dong, I think sometimes in life,

328
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,980
we need to take a leap of faith.

329
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,800
Otherwise, the girl we defended in our youth

330
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,500
might end up becoming someone else's bride.

331
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,280
You...

332
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,220
Speak from experience?

333
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,960
Don't even mention it.

334
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,920
Once it was "good morning" and "good night"...

335
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,200
Now I'm on the blacklist.

336
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,480
I'm just speaking as someone who's been there,

337
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,940
trying to give you some advice.

338
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,610
In matters of love,

339
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,840
we men need to be a bit more proactive.

340
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,160
We need to be straightforward.

341
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,920
Otherwise, the woman won't be able to feel

342
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,760
your affection.

343
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,800
Sometimes we...

344
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
Never mind, forget I said anything.

345
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,720
Do you have something on your mind?

346
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,470
No, I don't.

347
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,320
Did something happen between you and Qi Dong?

348
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,470
What are you talking about?

349
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,890
Are you drinking alcohol or water?

350
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,170
You must be drunk.

351
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,840
I've been learning the art of face reading lately.

352
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,120
One's appearance reflects one's heart.

353
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,840
One's looks change with one's mind.

354
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,680
I see that you have a rosy complexion, You You.

355
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,320
Your skin is glowing.

356
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,120
Your eyes are bright and lifted.

357
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,160
You must be...

358
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,710
Alright, alright, shut up.

359
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,960
What are you even talking about?

360
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,280
He seemed like he wanted to kiss me.

361
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,190
I dodged it.

362
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,110
It's over then.

363
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,600
What nonsense is this?

364
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,510
If I hadn't dodged it,

365
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,960
then I'd really be in trouble.

366
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,680
But You You, even though your body refused,

367
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,160
your heart didn't.

368
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,800
Before, you

369
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,360
were actively flirting and teasing Qi Dong in various ways.

370
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,280
I didn't see you having any psychological burden then.

371
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,150
But it's precisely because you've fallen for him

372
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,580
that you're now retreating as he advances.

373
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,250
Qi Dong and I,

374
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,480
we're just in a working relationship.

375
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,360
Who would risk their life

376
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,930

And who would stay at the hospital

to take care of a business partner without even changing clothes?

379
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,870
So,

380
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,540
we should return to an appropriate position.

381

And the most suitable position for him and me

382
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,830
is that of business partners.

383
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,460
Is it because Qi Dong is An Guoxuan's son?

is the Ninghai Square.

Restarting the Ninghai Square project

398
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,180
will be my first move

399

his skull was severely impacted,

Indeed,

for Xingyao.

However, it doesn't solve

462

the fundamental problem that Xingyao Group

Mr. Qi has just returned to the headquarters,

477
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,480
this is overstepping, isn't it?

478

So, the celebration was just a pretense,

479
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,850

Whether a project is complex or not

494

can only be known once you start working on it.

00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,960
Back then,
