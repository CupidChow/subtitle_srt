[Episode 10]

3
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,840
From the day I met you,

4
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,920
from the moment you hooked your fingers with mine,

5
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,800
I knew

6
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm destined to be with you for life.

7
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,050
So, to prevent you from slipping away from me,

8
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,190
I had to make the first move.

9
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,020
Let me personally put this ring on your finger,

10
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,780
to firmly bind you to me.

11
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,360
It seems we've both strayed from the paths

12
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,690
we were meant to follow.

13
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,600
It's time we returned

14
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,060
to our respective places.

15
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,660
I need to pull myself together.

16
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,470
Only by securing the Ninghai Square project

17
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,170
can I find the clues.

18
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,660
Hello?

19
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,830
What?

20
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,760
You You,

23
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,850
-You Zhen, put the knife down!
-Don't come near me!

24
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,770
Stay back!

25
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,120
-I'll kill you all!
-You Zhen!

26
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,800
I'll kill you all!

27
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,280
-Put the knife down first!
-I'll kill you all!

28
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,720
I'll kill you all!

29
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't come any closer!

30
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,080
We can talk this out if you have any demands, You Zhen!

31
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,640
Put the knife down first!

32
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
If you come any closer, I'll kill you all!

33
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,560
You Zhen, put the knife down first!

34
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,480
Don't come any closer!

35
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,540
Put the knife down.

36
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,930
-Stay back!
-You Zhen!

37
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,900
-Stay back, all of you!
-Drop the knife!

38
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,940
Calm down first!

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,610
Calm down first!

40
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,720
Don't come any closer!

41
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
If you want something, we can work it out.

42
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,440
I'll kill you all!

43
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,540
Kill you all!

44
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,630
Where are my roses?

45
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,330
Where did you put my roses?

46
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,090
Give me back my roses now!

47
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,580
Give me back my roses!

48
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,700
Where are my roses?

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,950
Where did you put my roses?

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,680
Calm down, You Zhen!

51
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,500
Did you take my roses?

52
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,960
Give me back my roses!

53
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,280
What's wrong?

54
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,010
I don't know.

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,600
-Did you take my roses?
-You Zhen, don't move!

56

Give me back my roses!

57
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,000
Give them back to me!

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,120
Put the knife down, You Zhen!

59
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,340
Calm down. If you dare to hurt her,

60
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,670
you'll never find your roses again.

61
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,400
Calm down.

62
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,220
Put the knife down.

63
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,740
Put the knife down.

64
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,420

67
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,520
Go check it out quickly!

68
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,320
Okay.

69
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,770
Calm down.

70
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,520
I know where your roses are.

71
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,310
Where are they?

72
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,780
Downstairs.

73
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,030
I'll take you to them right now.

74
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,780
You've seen them?

75
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,890
Yes. Are your roses

76
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,270
purple?

77
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,159
Come.

78
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,790
Be good.

79
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,470
Put the knife down.

80
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,480
I'll take you

81
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,890
to your roses.

82
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,110
Give me the knife.

83
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,480
You're lying to me!

84
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
You're just like them!

85
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,750
You're all liars!

86
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,190
You're all liars!

87
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,120
Give me back my roses now!

88
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,290
Calm down, You Zhen!

89
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,660
Don't move!

90
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,840
Don't move!

91
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,830
Are you alright?

92
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,590
You're lying to me.

93
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,110
You must have been scared just now.

94
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,920
You're all liars.

95
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,360
How can I possibly be alright?

96
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,200
This lunatic

97
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,070
almost killed me just now!

98
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,840
Bad news!

99
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,720
I'll kill you all.

100
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
The criminal in Bed 8, Gao Shanshan, is missing!

101
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,680
What?

102
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,500
People like him should be locked up.

103
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,840
They should never be released.

104
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,900
They're so dangerous.

105
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,960
Brother, bad news.

106
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,100
Gao Shanshan shook us off and ran away.

107
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,159
Let me do it.

108
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,920
Don't crowd around. Nothing to see here!

109
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,250
Move along, move along!

110
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,740
What are you standing here for?

111
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,750
After him!

112
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,890
Brilliant — killing two birds with one stone.

113
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,360
He tested my identity

114
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
and let Gao Shanshan escape.

115
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,920
It seems

116
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
I won't be able to get the recording.

117
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,380
Now,

118
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,880
the Ninghai Square project is the only solution.

119
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,179
I'm leaving.

120
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,940
Dong,

121
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,750
Gao Shanshan escaped

122
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,800
right under An Guoxuan's nose.

123
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,530
An Guoxuan's men are looking for him everywhere.

124
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,910
What's wrong?

125
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,330
Are you feeling unwell?

126
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,460
Are you alright?

127
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,400
But Dong,

128
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
why did An Guoxuan

129
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,760
go to all that trouble?

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,730
Why did he let Gao Shanshan escape deliberately?

131
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,700
Gao Shanshan has woken up, so he's a ticking time bomb.

132
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,960
If he escapes,

133
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,360
An Guoxuan

134
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,710
will have an opportunity to get rid of him.

135
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,500
So,

136
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,050
An Guoxuan used You Zhen

137
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,800
to test You You

138
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,640
and took advantage of the chaos to let Gao Shanshan escape.

139
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,710
Then he'll quietly eliminate

140
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,190
this potential threat.

141
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,920
But...

142
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,540
You You has got nerves of steel.

143
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,540
She was held hostage by her own father

144
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,540
and then hurt her own father,

145
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,640
yet she looks as if nothing happened.

146
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,680
I'm not drunk.

147
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,620
When people go through extreme pain,

148
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,570
they wrap it up and seal it away,

149
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,890
like it has nothing to do with them.

150
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,350
But in fact, the pain hasn't gone away.

151
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,290
It's always there.

152
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,560
Here.

153
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,610
Sit down.

154
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,550
Look at my father.

155
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,470
After all these years,

156
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,480
he still remembers those purple roses he planted.

157
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,960
Do you think he's really crazy or just pretending?

158
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,760
Could it be...

159
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,080
he's pretending to be crazy to make An Guoxuan

160
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,400
let his guard down?

161
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,480
What if he really is crazy?

162
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,120
If he really is crazy,

163
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,870
that would be even more interesting.

164
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,870
He remembers the roses,

165
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,180
but not me.

166
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,620
Do you know the origin of purple roses?

167
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,870
In ancient Northern Europe,

168
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
the fiancée of Shang Luo, the God of Love,

169
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,130
passed away.

170
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,660
Shang Luo buried his fiancée

171
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,010
in an amethyst at the bottom of a lake.

172
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
Later, on the amethyst,

173
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,300
purple flowers grew all over.

174
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Shang Luo

175
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,270
named them roses.

176
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,760
Those purple roses

177
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,280
were the soul of his fiancée,

178
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,760
transformed into flowers to accompany her lover.

179
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,920
Then why are all the roses I've seen

180
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,160
red?

181
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,520
That's because

182
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,510
this romantic and sad story

183
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,210
reached the ears of Satan.

184
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,000
Satan hates

185
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,400
everything beautiful in the world.

186
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,040
So,

187
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,960
he wanted

188
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,390
to destroy the flowers that stand for love.

189
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,220
Later, to protect the purple roses,

190
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,160
Shang Luo fought against Satan in a deadly battle.

191
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,970
In the end,

192
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,420
his blood dripped onto the purple roses,

193
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,940
dyeing them red.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,930
And that's how red roses came to be.

195
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,690
Sweetheart!

196
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,300
Do you also want to become the God of Love

197
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,550
and dye the roses red?

198
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,490
I don't like purple roses.

199
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,510
Okay, okay, you don't like them.

200
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,590
Come on, let me bandage that for you.

201
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,860
It wasn't until I grew up that I realized

202
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,760
there are no purple roses at all.

203
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,790
They're just hybrid Chinese roses.

204
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,690
His beloved roses

205
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,800
are actually Chinese roses.

206
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,040
Po,

207
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,020
do you think my dad lost his mind because of that?

208
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,410
These flowers are for you.

209
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,950
When did you buy them?

210
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,310
I bought them while I was waiting for you over there.

211
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,010
How much were they?

212
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,870
It's been a while since I gave you a gift.

213
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,200
They're not expensive.

214
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,240
If you like them,

215
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,790
I'll buy you roses often.

216
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,620
What are you doing?

217
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,050
These are my roses!

218
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,130
Are you crazy?

219
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,080
Sorry.

220
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
She's drunk.

221
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,340
And that gives her the right to act like a lunatic in public?

222
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,360
Who's crazy?

223
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,290
Say it clearly!

224
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:31,950
Say it clearly!

225
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,870
What are you doing?

226
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,930
I'm talking about you! You're crazy!

227
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,420
I'll leave this to you.

228
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,890
Got it.

229
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,750
You want to leave before this is settled?

230
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,390
Buddy,

231
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,210
let's talk about compensation.

232
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,750
I'm not talking about anything with you.

233
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,570
Five-digit.

234
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,740
Five-digit?

235
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,390

236
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,500

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,500

Calm down, You Zhen!

259
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,540
What do you think?

260
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,100
I think Qi Gege

261
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,760
doesn't know You Zhen at all.

262
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,090
I'm talking about my high blood pressure.

263
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,440
Mr. An, you've been troubled by trivial matters lately,

264
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,260
not sleeping well.

265
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,840
That's what has pushed your blood pressure up.

266
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,700
High blood pressure isn't scary.

267
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,360
What's scary is not having antihypertensives.

268
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,040
Well...

269
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,500
I'll go get your medicine.

270
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,330
Have you found

271
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,330
Gao Shanshan?

272
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,710
Not...

273
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,080
y-yet.

274
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,150
I want him, dead or alive!

275
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,000
Yes.

276
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,800
What about Qi Gege?

277
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,560
Should we keep investigating?

278
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,480
Even a hundred-foot-deep well may be clear to the bottom,

279
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,440
but a heart merely an inch deep can still be unfathomable.

280
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,300
If you're able to see through her,

281
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,480
would she still be You Zhen's daughter?

282
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,640
Mr. An,

283
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,440
our next move is...

284
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,630
It's time

285
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,400
to let them take over the Ninghai Square project.

286
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,520
Dong.

287
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,120
Dong.

288
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,810
Dong,

289
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,760
how come I didn't know there is

290
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,290
a secret room in this house?

291
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,160
Well,

292
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,190
why did you drink so much alone?

293
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,800
Dong,

294
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,000
so you...

295
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,130
Have a drink with me.

296
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,430
Dong,

297
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,060
I didn't expect

298
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,720
that you've liked You You since childhood.

299
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,810
You've done so much for her.

300
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,300
But why have you been hiding it from me all this time?

301
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,890
It must have been so difficult for you.

302
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,770
If I can't even keep it from you,

303
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,370
how could I possibly hide it from You You?

304
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,560
Dong,

305
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,620
but I don't understand.

306
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,010
Why don't you tell You You?

307
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,490
Because I know You You too well.

308
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,190
She

309
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,840
might seem ruthless

310
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,960
and vengeful,

311
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,200
but she's actually very kind

312
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,120
and soft-hearted.

313
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,460
I really don't want to admit this fact,

314
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,680
but I am indeed An Guoxuan's son.

315
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,720
Instead of telling her the truth

316
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,250
to make her troubled and upset,

317
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,010
I'd rather make her understand

318
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,460
that I am the most suitable partner for her revenge.

319
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,680
I am just

320
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,850
a tool for revenge that she can freely use.

321
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,580
Dong, I understand now.

322
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,170
That's why you were cold

323
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,500
towards You You the other day.

324
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,400
You just didn't want emotions

325
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,000
to affect your revenge plan.

326
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,760
An Guoxuan

327
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,920
is even more vicious and paranoid

328
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,840
than we think.

329
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,020
If we really want to take him down,

330
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,920
we have to stay sharp and calm

331
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,780
at all times.

332
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
We have to be more ruthless than him.

333
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,550
You You

334
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,120
is an angel.

335
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,690
She doesn't belong in hell.

336
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,840
But if the knife, aimed straight at An Guoxuan's heart,

337
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,910
has to

338
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,340
be stained with blood,

339
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,290
the one stabbing him can only be me.

340
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,690
Dong.

341
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,030
Now,

342
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,120
I have more important things to do.

343
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,920
Dong,

344
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,800
impressive.

345
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,720
You've prepared so many hangover remedies.

346
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,520
Remember,

347
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,100
you made all of these.

348
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,020
Deliver them to her later.

349
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,300
When I got up just now,

350
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,460
I passed by You You's bedroom.

351
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,760
She's already left.

352
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,580
Maybe that's for the best.

353
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,850
Maybe it should be this way.

354
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,000
Then I won't be polite.

355
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
You want to eat?

356
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
Cook some yourself.

357
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,360
Come on,

358
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,190
Dong.

359
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,600
I can't let your whole morning's effort go to waste,

360
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,240
right?

361
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,950
There's one more dish.

362
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,920
Since you drank with me last night,

363
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,680
eat.

364
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,980
You You.

365
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,840
Didn't you go to Qi Dong's place?

366
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,270
Why are you back so early?

367
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,100
I haven't asked you yet,

368
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,860
and you're already gossiping.

369
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,620
Tell me,

370
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,880
why did you abandon me last night

371
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,410
and let Qi Dong take me away?

372
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,560
You You,

373
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
you were drunk.

374
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,600
You don't remember.

375
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,010
You ruined a couple's roses,

376
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,130
and the guy wanted you to pay for it.

377
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,360
Luckily, Qi Dong showed up

378
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,640
and came to your rescue timely.

379
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,770
He carried you away.

380
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,160

But

388
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,150
he's been keeping his distance on purpose.

389
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,760

390
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,320

392
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680

393
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,650
If you keep retreating,

394
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,130
maybe You You will get pulled in closer.

395
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,660
I should keep my distance too.

396
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,140
I don't understand.

397
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,580
Obviously,

Qi Dong doesn't want me to know

My background and the choices I've made

401
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,320
have ensured You You and I can never be together.

402

Besides,

403
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,080
the exposure of his background alerted him,

404
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,840
bringing him back

405
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,740
onto the track of taking down An Guoxuan.

406
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,760
And I

407
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,240
should also stay focused

408

what the most important thing is.

The most important thing right now

is to help Qi Dong pass the board's vote

416
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,320
and restart the Ninghai Square project.

417
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,510
But An Guoxuan

418
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,020
still doesn't fully trust You You.

419
