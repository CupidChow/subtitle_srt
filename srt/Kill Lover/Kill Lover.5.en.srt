[Episode 5]

3
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,370
Didn't I already tell you

4
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,070
that before the bidding conference ends,

5
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,170
you're not allowed to leave this house
even half a step?

6
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,360
I've been cooped up at home for too long.

7
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,240
I'm going out

8
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,520
to get some fresh air.

9
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,060
Are you really just going out for some air,

10
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,940
or are you using this as an excuse

11
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,960
to go meet someone?

12
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,000
You're way too controlling.

13
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,300
If I go out,

14
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,280
it's not like I won't see a single soul, right?

15
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,880
Not to mention seeing souls,

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,380
you won't even see a ghost.

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,120
From now on,

18
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,039
I'll have Bu Fan

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,050
keep a close eye on you 24/7.

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,520
Fine.

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,380
The bidding conference is the day after tomorrow.

22
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,660
I must find a way

23
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,600
to send out the quotation.

24
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,640
As long as I'm injured,

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,250
I can go out.

26
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,170
Qi Dong!

27
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
Are you alright, Qi Dong?

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,320
Ms. Mei! Ms. Mei!

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,200
-Ms. Mei!
-Coming!

30
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,270
Come help quickly!

31
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,390
What happened?

32
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,950
I just left for two minutes.

33
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,780
Take him to the hospital.

34
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,270
I-I'll go prepare the car.

35
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,700
Qi Dong, let's go to the hospital.

36
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,730
Let's go.

37
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,740
Mr. Gao.

38
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,570
The target has appeared.

39
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,520
However,

40
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,340
Qi Dong looks like he's injured.

41
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,620
To the hospital.

42
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,860
How is he, doctor?

43
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,780
He has second-degree burns,
but they're mild.

44
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,240
Fortunately, he received timely treatment.

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,110
It's not serious.

46
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,720
In the following days, pay attention to

47
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,650
keeping the wound clean to avoid infection.

48
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,680
You can apply some burn ointment
on the wound.

49
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,720
It will promote healing.

50
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,640
Also,

51
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,860
make sure he gets proper nutrition.

52
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,149
Avoid spicy food.

53
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,640
Under normal circumstances,

54
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,480
in about two weeks,

55
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
the wound should scab over and heal.

56
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,810
Thank you, doctor.

57
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,890
You're welcome.

58
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,360
You...

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,600
Why did you try to protect me?

60
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,820
I've said before,

61
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,370
you are a good blade.

62
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,630
I won't let a good blade become dull.

63
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,560
But

64
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,810
the price for using me as your blade

65
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,970
seems quite high.

66
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,900
You're worth it.

67
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,670
Dong!

68
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,350
Dong. Dong.

69
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,580
Are you alright?

70
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,970
I heard from Ms. Mei that you got burned.

71
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,810
I rushed here from the company.

72
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,690
If you need a skin graft, use mine.

73
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,810
Skin grafts require one's own skin.

74
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,790
Besides, I...

75
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,980
My injury isn't that serious.

76
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,100
That's a relief.

77
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,760
Wait, something's not right.

78
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,600
It should have been Ms. Mei who was cooking.

79
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,950
Why did you get burned?

80
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,070
The prescription bill hasn't been paid yet.

81
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,630
Go ahead.

82
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,680
Dong.

83
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,510
What happened?

84
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,730
This trick of self-inflicted injury

85
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,300
was truly unexpected.

86
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,460
Junior, you're quick-witted,

87
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,860
managing to send Qi Dong into the hospital.

88
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,110
Unexpected indeed.

89
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,410
Qi Dong is tough-skinned and thick-fleshed,

90
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,740
so getting burned isn't a big deal for him.

91
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,040
But what about you, Junior?

92
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,530
Are you hurt?

93
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,430
I'm fine.

94
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,560
Don't worry.

95
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,090
That's good.

96
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,390
Then...

97
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,520

103
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,760

Quickly, take her to the operating room.

107

What's wrong, Junior?

108
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,940
I didn't know you had such a
sentimental side.

109
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,330
I'm getting more and more
interested in you, Junior.

115

This Qi Gege is really something.

116
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,160
It seems the exhibition center project

117
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,290
is already within your grasp, Mr. Gao.

118
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,880
Notify everyone to return to the company

119
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,680
and work overtime to revise
the bidding proposal.

120
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,220
You You is really harsh on herself.

121
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,680
She even resorted to self-harm
to pass on information.

122
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,590
Thankfully, you protected her, Dong.

123
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,990
Otherwise, she would have got major burns.

124
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,980
For the sake of revenge,

125
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,330
she's even willing to give up her life.

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,530
What does a burn matter?

127
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,289
Then why did you bother to save her, Dong?

128
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,620
Couldn't you have just let her get burned?

129
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,210
If she had got major burns,

130
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,900
who would pass information to Gao Shanshan?

131
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,760
You?

132
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,600
Even so, your sacrifice is still too great.

133
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,530
If someone has to make a sacrifice

134
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,250
between her and me,

135
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
I'd rather it be me.

136

You've recovered so quickly.

Three years ago,

163
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,370
you said you wanted to keep a Garfield cat.

164
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,830
I went to the pet store to
choose a cat for you,

165
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,560
but you misunderstood my relationship
with the female shop assistant.

166
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,490
In the end, you abandoned that cat.

I met with her to discuss
your recovery progress,

but you misunderstood it

170
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,720
and caused a scene at the
rehabilitation hospital.

171
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,850

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,440
Don't be angry, Shanshan.

190
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,720
How about

191
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,170
I fire all the bodyguards

192
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,290
after I go home?

193
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,170
I won't spy on you anymore,

194
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,040
okay?

195
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,290
Jingjing.

196
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,770
You have no idea how wonderful you are.

197
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,760
Everything I did

198
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,240
was to please you.

199
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,620
I'm so worried that one day

200
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,210
you'll leave me.

201
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,120
What about Qi Gege?

202
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,670
She's just like the other
women in the photos.

203
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,000
They're all just tools I use to please you.

204
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,980
I'm sorry, Shanshan.

205
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
I was wrong.

206
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Yeah.

207
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,350
You were indeed wrong.

208
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,220
You have no idea how much effort and sacrifice

209
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,380
I've made for you all these years just so that

210
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,440
we could have a better life together.

211
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,600
All you've done is staying
at home, overthinking,

212
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,290
being suspicious of everything,

213
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,200
and doubting your own fiancé.

214
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,190
Have you ever thought about our future?

215
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:53,940
I...

216
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,640
Have you made even the slightest

217
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,970
contribution in this succession battle?

218
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,720
Do you know how serious the consequences

219
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,450
will be if I lose to Qi Dong this time?

220
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,480
Actually...

221
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,840
Actually, you didn't have to

222
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,370
go to other women.

223
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,180
All the things Qi Gege can do,

224
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,560
I can do them too.

225
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,240
I...

226
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,180
I promise I can do better than her.

227
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,620
Trust me, Shanshan, okay?

228
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,740
Trust me.

229
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,540
Of course I trust you.

230
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,720
But actions speak louder than words.

231
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,010
I've been working hard for our future.

232
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,650
You need to work hard too,

233
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,370
right?

234
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,570

[International Commercial Building Underground Garage]

236
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,480
Hello, I'm the gardener from FlowerTalk.

237
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,320
I'm here to take care of the pest control
for your roses.

238
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,280
Here's my ID.

239
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,440
Why did they send someone else?

240
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
I remember it was a young man before.

241
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,540
That's right.

242
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
He quit the job and went back to his hometown
to get married.

243
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,840
From now on, I'll be responsible for Mr. Qi's home.

244
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,940
Please come in.

245
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,030
This way.

246
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,720
Roses are flowers that easily attract pests.

247
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,840
Different insects

248
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,490
require different treatments.

249
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,110
Look.

250
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,640
For example, these cup moths

251
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,670
need to be sprayed with dichlorvos.

252
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,280
And for scale insects,

253
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,160
we need to spray them with

254
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,690
wettable powder of phoxim.

255
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,310
Ms. Qi.

256
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,800
Mr. Qi particularly likes roses,

257
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,800
so he's always had professional gardeners over
to take care of them.

258
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,860
What a coincidence, I like roses too.

259
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,880
You can go now, Ms. Mei.

260
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,170
I'll keep an eye on this.

261
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,150
I'd also like to take this chance to talk
with a professional.

262
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,350
Thank you for your trouble then, Ms. Qi.

263
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,980
You You, I've found Xu Peng.

264
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,970
This guy is a gambling addict.

265
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,960
I hacked his overseas gambling account

266
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,280
and found his IP address.

267
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,680
Guess where he's hiding?

268
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,040
Don't keep me in suspense.

269
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,470
He's hiding in the seized TCM clinic.

270
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,520
What a case of overlooking things
right under our noses.

271
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,920
He may be able to hide for a while,

272
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,480
but definitely not forever.

273
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,940
A venomous insect like him

274
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,079
will die sooner or later.

277
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,329
I didn't know you cared.

278
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
I'm just worried

279
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,080
that you might underperform

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,040
at the bidding conference this afternoon

281
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
due to your injury and blame it on me.

282

290
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,530
Compared to a predictable outcome,

we both

292
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,370

00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,360
don't we?

294
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,260
It seems we're becoming
more and more in sync.

However,

313
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,640
this time I'll be careful with the hot oil.

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,450
How much did Qi Dong pay you

377
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,920
to twist the truth?

378
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,960
I'm not lying.

379
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,190
He planned all of this himself.

380
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,240
Gao Shanshan knew very well that Mr. Fu

381
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,840
hated An Guoxuan to the bone,

382
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,240
so he wouldn't easily

383
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,100
hand over the project to Xingyao.

384
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,160
You think you can win Mr. Fu over just by
going jogging with him every day?

385
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,280
Dream on.

386
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,550
So he proposed

387
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,280
that after inheriting Xingyao,

388
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,380
he would give Mr. Fu 10% of its shares.

389
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,160
And you

390
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,600
were to be thrown in

391
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,670
as a bonus in this deal.

392
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,360
But in fact,

393
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,440
Gao Shanshan didn't even want

394
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,040
to give Mr. Fu that 10% share.

395
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,060
So he bribed me

396
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,350
to secretly record the video of him ra...

397
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,620
Assaulting you

398
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,740
to use it as leverage against Mr. Fu.

399
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,790
Where's the video?

400
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,030
I followed the instructions of
Gao Shanshan's assistant

401
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,160
and went to meet him in the parking lot.

402
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,780
I planned to hand over the video

403
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,640
in exchange for my final payment.

404
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:51,940
Hello.

405
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,550
I'm here.

406
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,040
Rest assured.

407
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,330
The video is only on this USB drive.

408
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,730
There are absolutely no backups.

409
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,290
They snatched it?

410
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,880
It was the day after you jumped into the sea,

411
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,620
before Fu Hao's incident.

412
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,950
You bitch!

413
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,830
I should have killed you back
at the restaurant.

414
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,750
You...

415
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,240
You're actually not dead?

416
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,870
Since you're here,

417
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,530
I guess

418
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,700
Qi Dong must be here too, right?

419
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,850
Clever.

420
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,920
By the looks of it,

421
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,320
you must have secured the
exhibition center project.

422
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,400
Thanks to you.

423
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,620
If it weren't for you and Gao Shanshan's
secret dealings,

424
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,310
painstakingly passing on the bid price,

425
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,470
how could I have

426
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,130
achieved such a great victory

427
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,930
at today's bidding conference?

428
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,030
It seems you've

429
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,470
calculated every step.

430
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,100
If I had calculated every step,

431
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,940
I wouldn't have let you

432
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,210
fall into the hands of this scumbag!

433
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,410
Enough, Qi Dong!

434
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,550
It's okay.

435
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,590
He fainted.

436
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,710
There's no need to dirty your hands
for someone like him.

437
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,720
By the way,

438
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,740
this pen

439
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,390
is yours, right?

440
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,010
I found it on the day of the car accident.

441
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,210
I originally wanted to return it to you.

442
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,700
But you bastard

443
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,350
did a disappearing act on me.

444
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,130
So I had to make the best use of it

445
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,190
and use it as a gift.

446
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,900
This

447
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,820
is the token of love Wenwen gave you, right?

448
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,380
Yes.

449
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,750
Thank you.

450
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,140
I can give you the pen.

451
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,070
But this tracker,

452
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,260
please explain it.

453
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,520
Someone needs to take responsibility
for what happened here.

454
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,840
My faking my own death

455
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,370
is already against the law.

456
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,910
Now that Fu Hao is done for.

457
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,880
my wish has been fulfilled.

458
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,950
I should have quit smoking long ago.

459
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,380
Actually, she

460
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,540
never liked me smoking.

461
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,040
I promised her I'd quit, but I never did.

462
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,880
Back then, I always thought

463
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,340
we had a long future ahead,

464
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,300
and we could take our time.

465
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,550
Now that I think about it...

466
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,000
Gao Shanshan is no match for you,

467
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,820
but you must be careful of An Guoxuan.

468
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,190
He's extremely ruthless.

469
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,260
He's more cruel than anyone else.

470
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,000
Moreover,

471
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,390
to secure his own interests,

472
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,790
he can sacrifice anyone.

473
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,700
Don't worry.

474
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,250
I understand this better than anyone.

475
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,430
These past few years have
truly been exhausting.

476
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,290
I can finally give myself a break.

477
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,650
But you.

478
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,480
If you like her,

479
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,650
go for it.

480
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,520
No matter how many unspeakable difficulties

481
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,480
or obstacles there are,

482
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,740
they're not a problem.

483
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,680
Do you know why I had to wait for you

484
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,480
to show up before taking action?

485
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,000
I wanted to see what your reaction

486
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,500
would be if You You really

487
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,930
encountered danger.

488
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,320
You value more than just her abilities.

489
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,920
You truly care about her.

490
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,530
I've been there.

491
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,040
I see it clearly.

492
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,800
I'm telling you, I don't know

493
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,080
all those twists and turns

494
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,400
and the entangled past
between the two of you.

495
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,000
But there's one thing I know.

496
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,070
I can only regret now,

497
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,970
but you still have the ability to change.

498
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,920
I called the police.

499
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,360
For me,

500
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,770
getting into prison

501
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,550
will make me feel more at ease.

502
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
I'm off.

503
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,460
I'll find the best lawyer for you.

504
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,300
Take care of yourself.

505
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,460
This is the video Xu Peng shot?

506
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:49,940
Yes.

507
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,910
What do you plan to do with it?

508
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,170
Expose it.

509
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,620
Fu Hao attempted to rape me,

510
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,160
and Gao Shanshan instigated it from behind.

511
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,080
This video,

512
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,720
along with Xu Peng's testimony,

513
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,980
is enough to send Gao Shanshan to prison.

514
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,260
What are you doing?

515
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
My ultimate opponent is An Guoxuan.

516
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,740
To sacrifice you

517
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,570
for someone like Gao Shanshan,

518
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
it's not worth it.

519
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,650
At the beginning,

520
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,520
I thought Fu Hao's feelings for Wenwen

521
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,290
were just normal father-daughter affection.

522
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,490
That's why I sent you to deal with Fu Hao.

523
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,480
However,

524
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,540
you chose Gao Shanshan instead of me.

525
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,880
You clearly knew that the sacrifice incident

526
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,240
was Gao Shanshan's doing,

527
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,170
but you didn't tell me, and even
played along with my act.

528
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,830
How could I dare to choose you?

529
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,240
We're even, I suppose.

530
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,870
Haven't you also been using me all along

531
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,870
and secretly helping Gao Shanshan?

532
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,740
I know

533
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,420
there's always been a thorn in your heart.

534
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,730
You're worried that my real purpose
in approaching you

535
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,730
is to get back at you and torment you.

536
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,520
But I can clearly tell you now

537
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,530
that the score of you blinding me

538
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
was already settled five years ago,

539
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
when I threw you into the sea.

540
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,820
Five years ago, you threw me into the sea.

541
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,840
It was actually a show put on
for An Guoxuan,

542
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,080
wasn't it?

543
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,620
If you really wanted to kill me,
there were countless ways.

544
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,200
Why choose

545
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,930
the method with the most flaws?

546
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,680
There were so many fishing boats nearby.

547
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,120
If I had been just a bit lucky,

548
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,250
some fishermen would have rescued me.

549
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,240
For you,

550
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,300
I'm your greatest ally in
bringing down An Guoxuan.

551
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,500
As for me,

552
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,100
you are also my best option.

553
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,950
Now that we're even,

554
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,480
it's time

555
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,320
to start a real collaboration.
