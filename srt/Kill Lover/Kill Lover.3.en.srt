[Kill Lover]

00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,730
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,710
You've indeed improved recently,

4
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,220
but it's far from enough.

5
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,039
If you can't even beat a blind person

6
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,130
like me,

7
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,560
how can you defeat Mr. Fu?

8
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,700
Let alone becoming Xingyao's leader.

9
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,070
Our collaboration

10
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,729
might as well end here.

11
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,950
Dong,

12
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,080
you know Qi Gege is Youyou,

13
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,039
and she's secretly getting involved with Gao Shanshan.

14
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,160
Instead of exposing her,

15
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,640
why are you keeping her around?

16
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,680
Exposing her?

17
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,630
It's not the right time yet.

18
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,699
Let's work together.

19
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,720
Dong,

20
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,430
Youyou is also entangled with Shisi.

21
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,570
I have my own plans for this.

22
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,100
[You've received a WeChat message]

23
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,530
Youyou, look at this.

24
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,660
Shisi died in a car accident.

25
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,490
His body was dumped in the ocean.

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,270
He's just as ruthless as he was

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,060
five years ago.

28
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,150
But I'm no longer the same Youyou as I was five years ago.

29
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,240
Come on.

30
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,080
This woman survived

31
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,409
under those extreme conditions five years ago,

32
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,500
endured in silence,

33
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,900
and plotted her revenge.

34
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,159
She's no ordinary woman.

35
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,210
Right now, if we can just take the exhibition center,

36
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,880
we can get rid of Gao Shanshan

37
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
once and for all.

38
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,320
I will never let anyone else have Youyou.

39
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,240
You still have five minutes.

40
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,410
Five minutes for what?

41
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,550
Washing up, putting on makeup,

42
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,930
and getting ready for the feast

43
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,590
I prepared for you.

44
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,870
Why aren't you eating?

45
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,860
Is it not to your taste?

46
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,780
Is food made by a blind person even safe to eat?

47
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,870
But...

48
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,240
I'm still curious.

49
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,610
You went to all this trouble

50
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,730
to prepare such a feast.

51
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,470
What exactly is it for?

52
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,020
To reward you, of course.

53
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,610
Reward me?

54
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,310
Reward you

55
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,030
for passing the test.

56
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,980
You're now qualified to compete

57
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,880
in the women's sabre event.

58
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,340
Then please

59
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,730
explain to me again

60
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,170
why you brought me to your home.

61
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,030
From what you're saying,

62
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,840
it sounds like you wish

63
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,230
we had gone to your place last night.

64
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,340
First,

65
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,030
as my fiancée,

66
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,960
it's not appropriate that you've never stayed

67
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,020
at my place, right?

68
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,120
Second,

69
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
I brought you here

70
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,700
for special training.

71
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,300
Special training?

72
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,240
Here?

73
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,520
You fainted yesterday

74
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,120
due to stress and anemia.

75
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,480
You need to replenish your iron levels.

76
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,400
Otherwise, with your current stamina,

77
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,960
you won't be able to last three rounds.

78
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,620
Sorry.

79
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,010
I'm not a carnivore.

80
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,010
Since the Stone Age,

81
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,760
humans have been

82
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,210
hardcore carnivores.

83
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,960
When pushed to the brink of hunger,

84
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,510
people don't just eat meat.

85
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,340
They may even resort to cannibalism.

86
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,140
And if you want to defeat your opponent,

87
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,530
the best way

88
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,230
is to devour his flesh,

89
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,620
absorb him into your blood and bones,

90
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,680
and let his strength become your own.

91
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,920
Eat up.

92
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,530
This is one of your required courses —

93
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,980
improving your physical condition.

94
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,440
Shisi's pen.

95
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,210
What did you do to him?

96
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,920
What?

97
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,630
Do you think

98
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,710
I killed Shisi,

99
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,880
chopped him up,

100
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,650
and then cooked him?

101
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,160
If you killed him,

102
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,780
the police

103
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,140
would be on their way here to arrest you now.

104
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,890
Open the door and see

105
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,430
if it's the police

106
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,020
you're talking about.

107
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,800
We are the styling team hired by Mr. Qi.

108
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,480
This is the second required course for your special training:

109
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,000
changing your look.

110
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,520
Let's begin.

111
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,730
-Yes.
-Yes.

112
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,040
Mr. Qi,

113
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,340
it's done.

114
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,500
I think it's great.

115
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,890
Wear this on the day of the competition.

116
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,610
As if you could see it.

117
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,970
I felt it with my heart.

118
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,120
What do you mean?

119
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,310
It's a gift for you.

120
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,020
If it makes you happy,

121
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,770
you can also give it to the police as a gift.

122
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,420
That final move from yesterday —

123
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,910
practice it diligently.

124
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,950
Youyou,

125
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,800
why did you suddenly change your look?

126
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,440
Thanks to Qi Dong.

127
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,200
Any reaction

128
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,540
from An Guoxuan about Shisi's death?

129
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,720
They just posted a brief obituary

130
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,000
on Xingyao's official site

131
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,480
and gave Shisi's family some condolence money.

132
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,590
In this world,

133
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,760
there aren't so many coincidences.

134
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,720
This was

135
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,890
not an accident.

136
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,700
Youyou,

137
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,590
sit down first.

138
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,340
There are

139
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,170
only three possibilities here.

140
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,680
It's show time

141
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,790
for Detective Po.

142
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,640
The first possibility:

143
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,330
Qi Dong did it.

144
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,760
The second possibility:

145
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,190
An Guoxuan found out

146
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,440
Shisi came back with ulterior motives,

147
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,090
so he struck first

148
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,780
to eliminate future threats.

149
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,870
As for the third possibility...

150
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,300
I really can't think of anything.

151
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,010
Since the body has never been found,

152
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,530
perhaps the third possibility

153
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,480
is that Shisi faked his death.

154
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
But I think the most likely scenario

155
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,000
is Qi Dong overheard your conversation with Shisi

156
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,720
and learned about your collaboration,

157
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,880
so he killed Shisi.

158
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,920
Youyou,

159
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,030
next,

160
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,610
he might come after you.

161
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,950
Qi Dong wouldn't dare to act rashly against me.

162
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,280
After all, if anything happens to me, his fiancée,

163
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
he can forget about getting Xingyao

164
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,580
from An Guoxuan.

165
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,380
If he is pretending to be blind

166
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,460
and already knows who you really are,

167
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,880
could it be that he wants to keep you close

168
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,240
and torture you slowly?

169
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,140
Whether he's really blind or not,

170
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,580
since I've joined the game,

171
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,890
I won't back down.

172
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,770
[Ninghai Amateur Fencing Competition]

173
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,970
Dong.

174
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,000
He's here.

175
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,080
Mr. Fu,

176
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,600
what are your expectations for your club during this year's competition?

177
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,960
Can you shed the nickname of "Mr. Fu, the 16th" this year?

178
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,200
Your club has placed last for a few years.

179
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,800
Why do you insist on competing again this year?

180
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,380
Fencing

181
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,120
is not just about skills.

182
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,360
It's also about philosophy

183
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,120
and mind.

184
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,940
It may seem

185
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,760
like a duel between people,

186
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,670
but actually,

187
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,640
it's a battle with oneself.

188
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,600
It seems my team members

189
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,120
are facing powerful opponents,

190
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,720
but in fact,

191
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
they're facing their inner demons.

so he built a club.

377
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,530
Wenwen wanted to compete,

378
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,790
so he became a sponsor.

379
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,000
Coincidentally,

380
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
the first time Wenwen came to my clinic,

381
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,720
she was just like you,

382
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,800
with a dislocated arm.

383
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,490
That girl

384
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,040
was much stronger than you.

385
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,770
How come I've never heard him mention her?

386
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,680
Three years ago,

387
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,490
Wenwen committed suicide.

388
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,700
Suicide?

389
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,050
Then... why did she commit suicide?

390
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,790
I heard

391
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,040
a man broke her heart.

392
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,520
She couldn't get over it.

393
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,280
What a pity.

394
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,670
Here.

395
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,800
Take one dose in the morning and one in the evening

396
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,040
for seven consecutive days.

397
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,810
Also, apply safflower oil and mugwort externally.

398
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,940
Thank you, Uncle He.

399
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,790
I'm leaving.

400
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,630
Wait.

401
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,850
Take these

402
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,610
local specialties for Mr. Fu.

403
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,660
Okay.

404
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,420
Be careful.

405
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,040
It's quite heavy.

406
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,560
Why is it so heavy?

407
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,590
He must have lost his mind,

408
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,760
asking you, an injured lady,

409
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,520
to carry something this heavy.

410
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,920
-It's okay.
-Let me do it.

411
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,590
Dong.

412
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,190
Follow them.

413
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,780
You can move your arm freely now?

414
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,290
Yes.

415
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,010
He's skills are truly impressive, right?

416
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,660
Mr. Fu.

417
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,940
I'm sorry.

418
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,060
I admit

419
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,920
back then,

420
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,410
I participated in the fencing competition

421
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,170
for the exhibition center's project.

422
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,150
I really didn't know about your daughter.

423
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,580
I didn't know she liked fencing either.

424
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,300
I swear

425
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,190
I never meant to take

426
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,250
advantage of that to get close to you.

427
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,370
When you're in a position of power,

428
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,340
everyone

429
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,920
who comes to you must want something.

430
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,680
It's normal.

431
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,640
No need to apologize.

432
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,640
Your original intention may be false,

433
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,910
but your actions were real.

434
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,590
For that,

435
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,670
I should thank you.

436
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,320
The older I get,

437
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,280
the more I try to numb myself.

438
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,240
Luckily, you spent the past few days

439
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,960
fencing and running with me

440
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,880
every day.

441
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,490
I really thought Wenwen had come back.

442
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,200
By the way,

443
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,980
have you ever thought about

444
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,960
leaving Qi Dong

445
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,380
and coming to work for me?

446
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,520
Okay.

447
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,030
In three days,

448
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,640
meet me at the Ningyue Wharf.

449
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,370
We'll discuss the details of our collaboration.

450
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,020
You

451
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,460
helped me fulfill a wish,

452
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,080
so I should return the favor.

453
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,020
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

454
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,140
But... why the wharf?

455
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,950
The year Wenwen died,

456
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,300
on her birthday, I promised her

457
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,130
I'd take her for sea fishing.

458
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,220
Just

459
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
consider it

460
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,430
as fulfilling

461
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,590
one last wish for me.

462
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

463
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,800
Take a good rest.

464
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
Mr. Fu, go back early.

465
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,040
During these days,

466
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,770
apart from fencing, jogging,

467
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,110
and hiking with Fu Hao,

468
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,290
you haven't done anything else.

469
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,970
I lost the competition,

470
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,290
won Fu Hao's favor,

471
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,590
and built up the relationship step by step.

472
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,330
Isn't that your plan all along?

473
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,380
Why do I smell herbal medicine?

474
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,930
You have a nose like a dog's.

475
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,050
When I was running with Fu Hao,

476
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,170
I injured my arm.

477
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,720
He took me to a TCM clinic.

478
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,880
Which arm was injured?

479
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,770
Let me take a look.

480
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
Give me your hand.

481
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,400
The doctor told me

482
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,920
to apply the safflower oil, no rubbing.

483
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,700
When did you become so obedient?

484
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,740
Following medical advice is common sense.

485
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,700
Then

486
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,650
from now on, don't play tricks

487
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,080
or act on your own.

488
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,200
After all, you can't afford to bear the consequences

489
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,580
of going behind my back.

490
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,460
Behave yourself.

491
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,690
Dong,

492
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,070
do you think Youyou was telling the truth?

493
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,070
What do you think?

494
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,500
In my opinion,

495
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,450
not a single word from her is true.

496
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,250
She changes her story depending on who she's with.

497
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,230
She's not afraid of anything.

498
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,130
Don't forget

499
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,480
she's still secretly in contact with Gao Shanshan.

500
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,890
Do you think it matters whether she was telling

501
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:09,820
the truth or not?

502
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,350
You're right.

503
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,360
Anyway,

504
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,800
Dong, you have a backup plan.

505
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,000
Have you found Shisi?

506
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,600
I'm sending more people to look for him.

507
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,000
He definitely hasn't left Ninghai.

508
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,550
Find him as soon as possible.

509
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,350
That guy

510
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,280
must be hiding something.

511
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:23,950
Also,

512
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,730
something is wrong with that thing Xu Peng moved into the car.

513
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,660
Keep a close eye on that TCM clinic.

514
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,200
Okay.

515
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,660
So the side gig you mentioned

516
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,470
is being an internet cafe manager here?

517
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,460
Youyou,

518
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,470
this internet cafe

519
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,660
has got the best server configurations

520
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,010
and the fastest speed in Ninghai.

521
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,010
Being a manager here is just a cover.

522
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,340
It's convenient for playing games, right?

523
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,140
That's right.

524
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,610
No, no, no.

525
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,740
That's not it.

526
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,110
I've quitted online games.

527
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,080
I even gave my account to that chubby guy.

528
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,160
During this time,

529
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,240
I've been fully dedicated

530
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,210
to serving you, Youyou.

531
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,610
Youyou,

532
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,240
you've finally gained Mr. Fu's trust.

533
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,660
Next, do you really plan to discuss collaboration with Mr. Fu

534
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,940
behind Qi Dong's back?

535
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,730
My choice has always been Gao Shanshan.

536
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,960
But I have a bad feeling about this.

537
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,990
Gao Shanshan is not trustworthy.

538
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,050
In this world,

539
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,400
apart from you and Godmother,

540
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,820
I don't trust anyone else.

541
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,820
Have you really made all the necessary preparations?

542
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,540
There's no turning back.

543
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,210
I can only take this gamble.

544
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,260
But what I'm betting on

545
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,720
is not Gao Shanshan's moral quality,

546
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,760
but human nature.

547
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,680
And what I'm counting on is not his kindness,

548
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,720
but his ambition.

549
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,360
Once I secure the exhibition center's project

550
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,610
and help him take down Qi Dong,

551
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,430
then I'll negotiate with him.

552
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,490
What's wrong? You can't catch any fish,

553
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,830
so you're getting restless?

554
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,990
Mr. Fu, you're joking.

555
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,120
It's true that I can't catch any fish.

556
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,000
But you just don't want to catch any.

557
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Your bait

558
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,380
is almost eaten up by those fish,

559
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,560
yet you haven't reeled in a single one.

560
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,700
Those who don't know

561
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,430
might think you're from an animal protection association,

562
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,890
out here feeding the fish.

563
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Put more bait

564
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,760
so that the small fish can eat their fill.

565
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,360
Once the small fish are full,

566
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,580
the big fish that eat them

567
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,730
will take the bait.

568
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,080
Let's stop fishing.

569
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,480
Let's have dinner first.

570
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,150
Okay.

571
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,690
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

572
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,520
Cheers.

573
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,040
Eat.

574
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,240
I'm so sorry, Mr. Fu.

575
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,200
I've never liked

576
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,720
eating fish since I was a child,

577
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,920
especially sea fish.

578
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,340
I'm allergic to sea fish.

579
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,760
Actually, Wenwen

580
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,820
didn't like eating fish either.

581
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,910
In fact,

582
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,590
she didn't even like fencing.

583
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,120
I like it,

584
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,720
so I had made her practice since she was a kid.

585
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,880
She was very gifted.

586
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,920
Do you remember the move you used

587
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,160
against Huang Meng?

588
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,900
The one who gets hit

589
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,600
would have a terrifying

590
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,130
feeling of dizziness.

591
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,990
I wonder if you're feeling it.

592
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,560
While you're still conscious,

593
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,090
I'll tell you

594
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,420
the whole story.

595
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,940
Wenwen

596
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,320
was actually adopted by me from an orphanage.

597
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,550
I loved her very much.

598
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,950
She was

599
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,320
like an angel sent to me from heaven,

600
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,280
pure and flawless.

601
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,920
I cherished her dearly.

602
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,720
I had given her

603
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,070
the best of everything.

604
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,020
I gave her whatever she wanted.

605
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,740
There was only one condition —

606
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,570
she was not allowed to leave me.

607
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,800
But...

608
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,390
she betrayed me for a man.

609
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,460
She wanted to elope with him.

610
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,490
You know what?

611
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,410
That man was Shisi.

612
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,620
And he's a subordinate of An Guoxuan.

613
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,750
He's just a thug.

614
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,610
Do you know

615
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,790
why I hate An Guoxuan that much?

616
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,750
Because

617
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,120
he knew clearly

618
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,710
my daughter committed suicide

619
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,890
because of that thug,

620
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,320
but he still made him his butler.

621
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,580
That was the ultimate insult to me!

622
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,590
Look!

623
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,190
You think I don't know about your tricks with Qi Dong?

624
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,230
I didn't eat any fish.

625
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,970
I didn't drink wine either.

626
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,640
Could it be...

627
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,720
Yes.

628
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,960
What's the use of spitting out the wine?

629
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,300
The drug was here.

630
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,630
You're so despicable!

631
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,760
Qi Dong is really clever.

632
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,580
He chose you

633
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,030
to be a substitute for Wenwen.

634
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,340
It's perfect.

635
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,240
But do you know why

636
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,160
I still walked into it even though I knew

637
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,550
it was a trap?

638
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,670
Because

639
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,710
you can help me

640
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,550
fix my last regret.

641
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,500
These are all my men.

642
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,970
You can't escape.

643
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,400
Stop!

644
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,420
Stop!

645
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,280
Stop running!
