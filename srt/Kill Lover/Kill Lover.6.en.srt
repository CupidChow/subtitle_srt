00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,640
[Kill Lover]

2
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,690
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,860
The company that won the bid

4
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
is a subsidiary of Xingyao Group —

5
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,570
Xingkong.

6
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,440
Whoever secures the exhibition center's project

7
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,070
will become the successor

8
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,350
in charge of Ninghai's reconstruction

9
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,190
project.

10
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,680
Shanshan!

11
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,759
Shanshan, come down first, okay?

12
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,830
We can talk things over at home!

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Talk things over?

14
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,720
Will your father give me a chance to talk things over?

15
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,380
Will Qi Dong give me a chance to talk things over?

16
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,910
Didn't you say

17
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,580
we'll work hard together?

18
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,720
I've already figured out a way

19
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,200
to have the bidding judges

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,680
invalidate the competition!

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,940
We still have a chance!

22
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,800
Shanshan,

23
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,680
come down.

24
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,710
Jingjing,

25
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,260
I truly love you!

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,240
I don't want to be called a live-in son-in-law.

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,829
I don't want to be looked down on either!

28
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,630
I want to try my best to prove that I'm worthy of you!

29
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,530
You don't have to.

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,360
You've always done well.

31
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,170
It's me who hasn't done enough.

32
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,940
So this time,

33
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,829
let me be the one who fights for you

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,200
and us.

35
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,170
Okay?

36
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,420
Come, come.

37
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,000
Shanshan!

38
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,960
Shanshan!

39
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,829
Shanshan!

40
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,310
Shanshan!

41
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,220
Shanshan!

42
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,320
Jingjing.

43
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,320
The future I promised you hasn't come true yet.

44
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,420
Why would I want to die?

45
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,820
Shanshan.

46
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,470
You scared me to death!

47
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,210
I was just worried

48
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,580
if I failed at the bidding conference,

49
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,400
you would be

50
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,550
disappointed in me and us

51
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,250
and you would leave me because of that.

52
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,820
Shanshan.

53
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,659
Why are you so silly?

54
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,130
Jingjing.

55
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,410
Promise me,

56
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,490
no matter what happens,

57
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,820
don't push me away.

58
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,240
Okay?

59
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,200
No matter what you become,

60
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,110
I will never leave you.

61
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,960
I'm really tired.

62
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm really worried I won't be able to hold on.

63
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,790
Trust me.

64
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,170
I'll always be by your side.

65
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I'll do everything I can to help you.

66
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,080
This time,

67
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,160
I didn't just bring news about the bidding.

68
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,300
I also brought someone with me.

69
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,950
Show yourself.

70
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:18,930
Dong.

71
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,520
Dong.

72
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,520
Bad news.

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,730
It's okay.

74
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,650
Go ahead.

75
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
We just got word from Hanhai Group.

76
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,360
This round of bidding has been voided.

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
The bidding will restart next week.

78
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,570
Why?

79
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,100
There was a public report claiming

80
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,760
Tianyu Construction secretly stole

81
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,230
Xingyao Group's bid data.

82
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:40,670
The evidence is solid.

83
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,490
Tianyu has been disqualified.

84
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,690
They accepted the decision

85
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,530
without any protest.

86
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,700
A perfectly staged play.

87
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,180
Gao Shanshan

88
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,220
must have bribed Tianyu's bid manager

89
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,650
and had a contingency plan in case they lost.

90
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,050
Then what should we do next?

91
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,360
Keep the news about Xu Peng's arrest under wraps.

92
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,810
Don't alert them now.

93
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,070
And Mr. Qi, I want you to put on a show with me,

94
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,920
to make Gao Shanshan believe

95
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,320
that I still work for him.

96
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,090
Always happy to play along.

97
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,820
Show yourself.

98
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,600
Isn't this Qi Dong's housekeeper?

99
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,440
Ms. An saved my daughter's life.

100
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,510
I'm here to repay the kindness.

101
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,430
Shanshan,

102
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,650
Ms. Mei is on our side.

103
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,870
What are you doing

104
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,080
in my study in the middle of the night?

105
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,740
I'm here to comfort you.

106
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,920
Comfort me?

107
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,650
You won the bid,

108
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,740
but the bidding was invalidated.

109
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,360
You must be feeling upset.

110
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,440
Looks like

111
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,929
you didn't sleep well.

112
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,140
How much longer

113
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,220
are you going to keep acting?

114
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,040
What act?

115
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,490
Don't think I don't know

116
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,440
you've colluded with Gao Shanshan.

117
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,240
You did everything you could to leak pricing data to him.

118
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,640
Do you have any evidence?

119
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,320
In order to leak pricing data to him,

120
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,490
you got me burned.

121
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,000
Isn't this the best evidence?

122
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,060
From now on,

123
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,490
you're not allowed to step out of this room.

124
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,250
Let go! Let go of me!

125
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,950
What are you doing? Let go of me!

126
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,190
Let go! Let go of me!

127
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,230
Qi Dong, let go of me!

128
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,370
Qi Dong!

129
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,540
Let me go, Qi Dong!

130
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,170
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,320
Qi Dong, let me go!

132
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,190
Let me go, Qi Dong!

133
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,610
What are you going to do?

134
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,930
I'm going to tie you up today!

135
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,960
How dare you tie me up?

136
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,760
Qi Dong!

137
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,550
Release me right now!

138
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,720
Listen.

139
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,520
You bit me.

140
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,250
This is what you get!

141
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,650
You won't get any food for three days.

142
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,140
Let's see if you'll still have any strength left!

143
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,920
Qi Dong! Qi Dong!

144
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,230
Let me go!

145
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,680
Why...

146
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,820
are you quarreling

147
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,280
in the middle of the night?

148
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,670
Watch her.

149
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,610
Don't let her leave this room!

150
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,230
Should I still bring her meals?

151
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,740
Three meals a day. No exception.

152
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,760
Ms. Qi, I brought you breakfast.

153
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,400
Come in.

154
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,280
Ms. Qi, it's time for breakfast.

155
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,160
My hands are tied.

156
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,650
How am I supposed to eat?

157
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,080
But...

158
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,940
Mr. Qi told me to keep an eye on you.

159
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,200
It's just eating breakfast.

160
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,530
I'm not going anywhere.

161
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,030
Besides, if I starve,

162
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,560
that's on you, right?

163
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,640
Alright then.

164
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,720
Ms. Qi, please don't try to escape.

165
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,970
Don't worry.

166
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,180
Mr. Gao.

167
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,820
Ms. Qi has successfully escaped.

168
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,440
Mr. Gao, she's here.

169
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,310
You've suffered

170
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,260
these days, Junior.

171
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,550
Junior, you...

172
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,070
I went through hell

173
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,800
and even hurt myself to get you that information.

174
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,820
But you lost.

175
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,650
Have you been playing me?

176
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,060
Funny.

177
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,440
I haven't even asked you about the pricing data,

178
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,880
and you're already questioning me.

179
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,560
You don't trust me?

180
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,120
Never doubt those I work with.

181
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,780
Never work with those I doubt.

182
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,500
That's my principle.

183
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,200
Please trust me, Junior.

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
Every decision I make

185
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,560
is for

186
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,720
us.

187
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,960
Qi Dong doesn't trust me anymore.

188
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,360
Am I

189
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,930
still useful to you?

190
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,510
Is there still an "us"?

191
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,280
All these years,

192
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,870
this is the first time someone has walked beside me.

193
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,400
Do you know how important you are to me?

194
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,470
Don't use that trick you use on An Jingjing

195
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,470
on me.

196
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:46,980
Qi Gege,

197
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,760
do you know which aspect of you

198
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,800
impresses me the most?

199
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
It's your ambition to reach the top.

200
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,790
I like you

201
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,260
because we are the same kind of people.

202
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,380
We weren't born with silver spoons,

203
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,990
but we want to defy our fate.

204
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,480
For that,

205
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,710
we can sacrifice everything.

206
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,170
Morality, righteousness,

207
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,020
freedom, ideals,

208
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,840
loyalty, and love

209
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,320
are just shackles the powerful

210
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,540
place on the weak.

211
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,440
Since we both scorn

212
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,680
those mundane rules,

213
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,500
why don't we break them

214
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,300
and

215
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,120
climb to the top together

216
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,750
to enjoy the view from up there?

217
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,740
It's truly fascinating,

218
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,560
but...

219
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,530
to reach the top,

220
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,160
whose bones

221
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,750
will the steps beneath be built upon?

222
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,840
Don't worry.

223
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,170
They won't be yours.

224
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,460
Qi Dong is allergic to ginger.

225
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,960
This is a bottle of pure ginger extract.

226
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,040
His birthday is in five days.

227
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,560
Just put a few drops in his food,

228
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,800
and he'll become our stepping stone.

229
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,820
I've never killed anyone before.

230
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,340
Killing people?

231
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,980
It's just

232
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,960
a little lesson.

233
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,290
Senior, you seem

234
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,330
quite skilled at this kind of thing.

235
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,100
You really want to know me?

236
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,520
I've got plenty of secrets.

237
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,940
I'll tell you slowly.

238
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,320
Po.

239
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,010
Help me look into how An Jingjing got paralyzed.

240
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,850
Youyou,

241
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,400
you think An Jingjing's paralysis

242
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,520
from skiing

243
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,430
wasn't an accident?

244
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,540
Gao Shanshan

245
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,290
stops at nothing to achieve his goals.

246
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,450
He sacrificed me for the exhibition center.

247
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,640
And he wants to poison Qi Dong

248
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,800
for the bidding.

249
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,400
So it's possible that he hurt An Jingjing

250
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,920
just to become the An family's

251
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,560
son-in-law.

252
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,600
Oh no!

253
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,660
The ribs.

254
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,980
What's that smell?

255
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,080
I'm sorry, Mr. Qi.

256
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,910
I accidentally burned the food.

257
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,360
How is she?

258
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,610
She's fine.

259
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,570
I fed her breakfast.

260
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,640
She ate a lot.

261
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,470
Don't worry, Mr. Qi.

262
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,510
I'm delivering

263
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,610
lunch to her.

264
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,750
Let me do it.

265
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,270
Ms. Qi is still angry.

266
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,120
I'm afraid you two will argue again if you meet.

267
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,480
You've figured it out or calmed down?

268
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,230
You're personally bringing me lunch now.

269
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,500
You untied her?

270
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,160
Ms. Qi couldn't eat well

271
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,080
or sleep well

272
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,290
all tied up,

273
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,400
so I...

274
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,560
If it weren't for Ms. Mei,

275
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,490
I wouldn't have come up with such a good new proposal.

276
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,680
Consider this new proposal

277
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,440
my way of making up for what I did.

278
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,700
Can we call a truce now?

279
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,460
You think this draft design alone

280
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,840
is enough to wipe

281
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,310
the slate clean between us?

282
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,600
You can't keep me tied up forever, can you?

283
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,930
You still have five days

284
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,090
to perfect the design proposal.

285
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,750
But...

286
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,580
don't try to play any trick

287
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,320
under my nose.

288
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,420
Don't worry.

289
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,570
I don't want to be tied up again.

290
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,610
[5 days until the bidding conference]

291
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,980
[4 days until the bidding conference]

292
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,180
[2 days until the bidding conference]

293
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,180
You only have 48 hours left.

294
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,230
[To Qi Dong] [Subject: Ninghai City Exhibition Center Project's Structural Design Blueprints]

295
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,980
[Use email]

296
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,730
[To Qi Dong] [Subject: Ninghai City Exhibition Center Project's Structural Design Blueprints]

297
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,520
Ms. Mei.

298
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,610
Ms. Qi,

299
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,240
why did you come downstairs?

300
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,540
Don't worry.

301
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,040
I won't burn down the kitchen

302
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,390
or scald myself today.

303
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,280
It's Qi Dong's birthday today.

304
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,940
I want to cook a bowl of noodles myself

305
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,670
to ease the tension between us.

306
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,130
Alright then.

307
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,630
I'm almost done here.

308
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,780
Call me if you need anything.

309
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,500
Okay.

310
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,060
What?

311
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,930
Sneaking a look at the bid letter again?

312
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,230
One who offers unsolicited hospitality

313
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,130
must be harboring evil intentions.

314
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,860
I did steal a lot of your time,

315
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,170
making you

316
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,980
forget your own birthday.

317
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,940
You really did forget?

318
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,430
Don't tell me

319
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,630
that you never celebrate your birthday.

320
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,880
I indeed never celebrate my birthday.

321
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,010
Birthdays

322
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,020
don't mean anything to me.

323
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,280
But...

324
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,570
this bowl of longevity noodles you made for me

325
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,880
happens to be my mother's

326
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,410
favorite knotted noodles.

327
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,270
What a coincidence.

328
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,720
I only know how to make knotted noodles.

329
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,680
My mother taught me that.

330
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,970
They say on the seventh day after someone dies,

331
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,250
the soul of the deceased returns home.

332
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,110
On the seventh day after my mother's death,

333
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,570
I made her a bowl of knotted noodles.

334
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,640
To me,

335
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,280
that day is more important than my birthday.

336
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,290
Alright, enough of that.

337
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,050
Wait.

338
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,230
I didn't have time to prepare candles,

339
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,640
but a sense of ceremony is necessary.

340
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
Make a wish.

341
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,580
Oh, right.

342
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,830
You just told me a secret.

343
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,350
Now, I'll tell you one in return.

344
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,610
I put ginger juice in it.

345
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,960
Are you ready?

346
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,650
Now it's your show time.

347
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Alright, you can make a wish now.

348
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,930
Eat.

349
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,940
The noodles are getting soggy.

350
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,320
You...

351
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,160
What's...

352
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,360
What's... What's wrong with you?

353
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,260
Qi Dong!

354
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,520
Qi Dong!

355
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,700
Qi Dong, are you alright? Qi Dong!

356
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,410
Ms. Mei!

357
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,740
Call an ambulance now!

358
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,810
Ms. Mei! Ms. Mei!

359
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,900
Call an ambulance now!

360
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,020
Okay! Right away!

361
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,330
Mr. Gao,

362
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,970
Ms. Mei just replied.

363
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,760
Qi Dong definitely won't

364
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,840
be able to attend tomorrow's bidding conference.

365
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,160
The wine tonight is so sweet.

366
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,550
Too bad Qi Dong will be spending the night in a hospital bed.

367
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,040
Mr. Gao,

368
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,760
you've already

369
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,330
won over Ms. Mei.

370
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,710
Why did you still ask Qi Gege to do it?

371
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,090
Could it be...

372
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,140
you think Qi Gege and Qi Dong

373
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,300
worked together

374
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,060
to give you false information?

375
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,600
There are only

376
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,960
two possibilities for the failed bid.

377
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,950
One is that Qi Gege faked her loyalty

378
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,870
and worked with Qi Dong to set up a trap.

379
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,640
