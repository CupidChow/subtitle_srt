[Kill Lover]

2
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,720
[Episode 7]

3
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,830
Of course you're different.

4
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,770
You're the son of my enemy.

5
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,329
Dong.

6
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,860
Ms. Mei has been fired.

7
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,170
Got it.

8
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,900
Now that a mole has been eliminated,

9
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,250
I guess Gao Shanshan will stop for a while.

10
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,600
He's a vengeful man.

11
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,190
He'll take action again soon.

12
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,720
We can't let our guard down.

13
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,300
Mr. An, you're here.

14
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,160
Say it.

15
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
15 minutes.

16
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,940
Then I'll use these 15 minutes

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,260
to let you fish with me.

18
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,120
I have to fish with you?

19
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,960
I gave this fishing rod

20
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,370
to your father back then.

21
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,090
I didn't expect that it would still exist after all these years.

22
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,130
That's right.

23
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,680
Back then, you,

24
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,480
my dad and You Zhen

25
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,660
were known as the Iron Triangle.

26
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,980
In order to get a project,

27
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,780
you guys would rack your brains.

28
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,590
My dad even pretended to be a Chinese Singaporean

29
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,720
and fished with others affectedly to discuss business.

30
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,430
We didn't earn

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,900
a single penny from that project.

32
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,320
Your dad, who was a rough guy,

33
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,600
made this fake hobby come true

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,400
and actually took a fancy to fishing.

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,310
You Zhen and I pooled money

36
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,490
to buy this fishing rod for him.

37
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,880
Don't underestimate this fishing rod.

38
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,140
It's purely imported.

39
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,240
It's called... high fiber...

40
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,900
High-modulus carbon fiber and titanium alloy.

41
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,190
That's right.

42
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,880
It's lightweight

43
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,120
with good flexibility

44
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,380
and high sensitivity.

45
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,540
Look.

46
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,560
The texture is really good.

47
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,660
It looks quite new.

48
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,730
Your dad must have been reluctant to use it, huh?

49
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,530
This fishing rod has only been used twice in total.

50
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,150
It was first used before my dad went to prison.

51
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,980
Then I'm using it now.

52
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,620
Before my dad went to prison,

53
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,200
he was also here to fish for the last time.

54
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,250
He said the forced demolition of Happy Garden wasn't anyone's fault.

55
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,250
It was caused by his own negligence.

56
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,320
He was also willing to accept legal punishment.

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,860
You have to take responsibility

58
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,920
for the Happy Garden project.

59
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,050
This is not up to you.

60
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,190
An,

61
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,890
aren't you afraid that if I go to prison,

62
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,820
I'll reveal all your dirty secrets from 10 years ago?

63
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,880
Your son, Shanshan, is studying at

64
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,120
the Luminy Academy of Architecture and Design in France.

65
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,570
He'll graduate in a year, right?

66
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,540
Don't worry,

67
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,230
I've been asking people to look after him.

68
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,240
Whether he can graduate smoothly or not

69
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,770
will depend on how deep your fatherly love is.

70
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,610
All these years,

71
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,470
I've been carefully nurturing you.

72
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,760
It's not only because you're my

73
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,890
future son-in-law,

74
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,800
but it's also because of your father.

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,120
I hope that you can

76
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,920
bear the burden of Xingyao.

77
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,000
But it looks like

78
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,970
I've forced your growth and my efforts are in vain.

79
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,440
You've studied at school for so many years,

80
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,000
but you can't compare with

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
your father, who was an uncultured man.

82
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,330
That's right.

83
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,840
My father's greatest strength

84
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,920
is his lack of education.

85
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,520
He doesn't play by the rules.

86
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,960
His biggest flaw

87
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,640
is also his lack of education.

88
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,270
He didn't even realize it when he was being used.

89
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,480
It's been years since anyone dared to speak to me like this.

90
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,180
Show your hand.

91
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
You're smart indeed, Mr. An.

92
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,760
How are the preparations going?

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,600
Don't worry. All the accounts are ready.

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,060
The trap has also been set.

95
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,560
If any problems come up in the Ninghai Square's

96
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,920
construction site later,

97
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,320
You Zhen will take all the blame.

98
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,250
Mr. An, do you think this is enough?

99
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,970
Where did you get this recording?

100
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,000
My father gave it to me before he went to prison.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,530
He said it would be useful at a critical moment.

102
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,060
I didn't want to take it out.

103
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,030
But your own son has

104
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,030
pushed me too hard.

105
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,920
Gao has even

106
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,120
made this back-up plan.

107
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,770
Tell me what you want.

108
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,510
I want to exchange it for your recording.

109
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,590
I've already backed up this recording.

110
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,080
Consider the one thrown into

111
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,280
the lake as an appetizer for you, Mr. An.

112
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,550
You have such a big appetite.

113
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,970
My father died in prison muddledly.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,530
That was how his life ended.

115
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,690
But I'm different.

116
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,590
Right, Mr. An?

117
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,159
[Po]

118
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,040
Hello?

119
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,760
Po.

120
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,120
You You, what took you so long to answer the phone?

121
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,100
This morning on Xingyao's official website, I saw

122
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,920
the announcement of Gao Shanshan

123
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,640
also working as the general manager of the subsidiary, Xingkong,

124
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,450
and being in charge of the exhibition center project.

125
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,500
Qi Dong has been demoted to deputy general manager of Xingkong.

126
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,520
What?

127
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,450
The exhibition center project has been entrusted to Gao Shanshan.

128
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,180
It looks like this doesn't affect you much, huh?

129
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,740
To be precise,

130
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm just not surprised that you've

131
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,890
broken your promise.

132
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,080
You only announced

133
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,400
the ownership of the exhibition center project,

134
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,760
but you didn't announce

135
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,400
the appointment of the group's general manager.

136
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,059
It shows that this is just your delaying tactic.

137
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,340
People always say that

138
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,620
a father knows his son the best.

139
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,030
But in my opinion,

140
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,610
you seem to be quite good at guessing my thoughts.

141
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,290
Then let me take a guess.

142
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,520
Gao Shanshan got something on you.

143
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,660
Am I right?

144
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,820
It looks like my guess is right.

145
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,030
Now I know what to do.

146
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,420
Next Monday,

147
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,400
I will announce

148
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,320
Gao Shanshan's appointment

149
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,790
as the group's general manager.

150
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,550
One week

151
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,950
is enough.

152
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,500
Junior.

153
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,850
Are you here to see Qi Dong?

154
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,960
Does it have anything to do with you?

155
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Of course it does.

156
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,910
If you want to know the reason,

157
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,740
just come with me.

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
You've asked me to come here

159
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,240
not just to show me

160
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,640
your golf skills, right?

161
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,960
Junior, you probably don't know this yet.

162
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,200
I've not only replaced Qi Dong

163
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,010
as the head of the Xingkong Group,

164
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,550
but at next week's shareholders' meeting,

165
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,160
Mr. An will also publicly appoint me as

166
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,760
the group's general manager

167
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,820
and give me 30% of the shares.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,040
Sometimes,

169
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,900
I really admire you.

170
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,480
You kept failing in your fight

171
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,060
and then kept fighting after every failure.

172
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,040
Every time, you were like an indestructible cockroach

173
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,240
and came back to life.

174
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,010
Just tell me.

175
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,160
I'm quite curious.

176
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,990
What kind of dirty trick did you use

177
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,990
to manipulate An Guoxuan?

178
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,970
It was nothing special.

179
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,920
I merely went fishing with Mr. An.

180
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,180
To catch a fish,

181
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,260
as long as you place the hook deep enough

182
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,000
and use enough bait,

183
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,930
no matter how big the fish is,

184
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,490
it'll still take the bait.

185
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,510
What are you doing, Junior?

186
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,790
You're really breaking my heart.

187
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,760
You also have a heart?

188
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,550
Can you feel it?

189
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,110
It's bleeding.

190
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,360
It says that in its entire life,

191
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,600
it hates betrayal the most.

192
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,900
Let go of me!

193
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,500
I remember that not long ago,

194
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,570
I was even playing golf with you here.

195
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,520
Now you've completely broken my heart.

196
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,980
You need to make it up to me.

197
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,220
You need to make it up to me.

198
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,840
Let go of me!

199
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,300
Let go of me! Let go!

200
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,230
Gao Shanshan, what are you doing?

201
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,940
What are you doing?

202
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,560
Let go of me! Let go!

203
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,700
Qi Dong! Qi Dong!

204
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,020
No!

205
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,490
All these years,

206
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,800
it's the first time I've seen

207
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,130
my brother get so angry.

208
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,040
That's interesting.

209
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,800
I've warned you.

210
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,910
A man and a woman were in a room alone.

211
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,600
You can't blame me for that.

212
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,260
I couldn't help but think that

213
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,550
Junior might be hinting that I could...

214
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,730
You You.

215
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,530
What's going on?

216
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,360
Qi Dong hurt Gao Shanshan's head.

217
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,220
Gao Shanshan called the police in advance

218
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,280
and then deliberately used me

219
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,340
to provoke Qi Dong.

220
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,350
In this way, before next week's shareholders' meeting,

221
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,440
Qi Dong will have to stay in the detention center.

222
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,500
Then Gao Shanshan will have no worry.

223
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,440
Qi Dong shouldn't have been impulsive.

224
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,540
Wasn't he always so calm before?

225
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Why couldn't he stay calm this time?

226
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,360
It was my fault, too.

227
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,780
I was so eager to find out what Gao Shanshan

228
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,590
had on An Guoxuan exactly.

229
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,410
That was why I fell into his trap.

230
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,690
It's such a pity.

231
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,920
Originally, you and Qi Dong

232
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,240
could have formed a strong alliance.

233
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,680
But Gao Shanshan's action

234
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,010
disrupted everything.

235
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,300
From now on,

236
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,360
you'll have to fight alone.

237
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,080
Before Qi Dong is released,

238
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,060
I have to find some clues as soon as possible

239
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,600
to solve the problem fundamentally.

240
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,040
This is the only way to prevent Gao Shanshan from succeeding.

241
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,620
But what does Gao Shanshan actually have on Mr. An?

242
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,380
We don't have any clues at all.

243
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,950
I merely went fishing with Mr. An.

244
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,570
No matter how big the fish is,

245
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,130
it'll still take the bait.

246
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,310
I remember it now.

247
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,520
He once mentioned that

248
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,240
he had gone fishing with An Guoxuan.

249
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,050
Perhaps

250
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,340
there are clues there.

251
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,060
Po,

252
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,960
can you find out

253
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,410
where he usually likes to go fishing?

254
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,470
No problem. It's just a piece of cake.

256
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,320
Are you sure it's this person?

257
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,960
Yes.

258
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,800
Okay. Thank you.

259
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,730
You're welcome.

260
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,520
You You, I've inquired about it.

261
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,560
A man saw two people fishing here.

262
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,340
The younger one seemed to be Gao Shanshan.

263
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,840
He saw him throw something that looked like a recording pen

264
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,740
into the lake.

265
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,390
Contact the divers.

266
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,020
How are the preparations going?

267
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,040
Don't worry. All the accounts are ready.

268
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,480
The trap has also been set.

269
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,880
If any problems come up in the Ninghai Square's

270
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,200
construction site later,

271
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,790
You Zhen will take all the blame.

272
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,040
The recording pen was soaked in water for too long.

273
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,840
This is all that I could restore.

274
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,690
It's enough.

275
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,640
This is the recording about what happened

276
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,480
10 years ago before my parents' accident.

277
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,540
I think the person who made this recording was Gao Qing.

278
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,440
Before Gao Qing

279
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,880
went to prison, he must have left

280
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,920
this recording to his son

281
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,890
as the secret weapon to deal with An Guoxuan.

282
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,490
No matter how big the cost is,

283
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,640
we must obtain

284
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,040
the complete recording.

285
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,560
This recording is a crucial bargaining chip

286
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,900
for Gao Shanshan's rise to power.

287
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,870
If I were him,

288
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,490
I would definitely encrypt it

289
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,840
so that even if someone stole it,

290
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,910
he wouldn't be able to open it.

291
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,910
Instead of taking risks to steal it,

292
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,590
we'd better make him give us the recording voluntarily.

293
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,430
As long as

294
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,570
we can get something on Gao Shanshan,

295
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,640
when he has no other choices,

296
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,340
he'll surely exchange the recording for it.

297
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,990
No wonder you asked me to

298
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,800
investigate An Jingjing's paralysis.

299
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,080
But I've already investigated it.

300
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,840
About An Jingjing's skiing accident,

301
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,560
they've filed a case and reached a verdict.

302
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,760
An Guoxuan didn't accept any mediation.

303
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,420
The perpetrator, Liu Fei, was sentenced to three years in prison.

304
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,920
Gao Shanshan is

305
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,960
very scheming.

306
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,600
He's also good at leaving himself a fallback option.

307
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,660
According to my intuition,

308
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,390
there must be something fishy about this matter.

309
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,780
Where is Liu Fei now?

310
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,400
After this guy was released from prison,

311
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,880
there's no news about him at all.

312
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,280
It's as if he had vanished from the world.

313
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,150
It further proves that Gao Shanshan is hiding something.

314
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,450
Does Liu Fei have any other relatives in Ninghai?

315
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,360
I've checked about it.

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,490

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,860
You still dare to move?

371
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,310
Guys, take out your mobile phones.

372
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,310
Record this and just post it online.

373
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,780
I don't believe that

374
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,840
she can snatch all the mobile phones.

375
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,620
I'll take responsibility if anything happens.

376
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,420
Ms. An, why don't we

377
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,640
just give up?

378
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,580
You're lucky today.

379
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,810
Let's go.

380
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,880
Wait.

381
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,940
An Jingjing, let me tell you,

382
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,030
I'll keep

383
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,450
this video forever.

384
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,460
If you dare to cause trouble for Chen Xi

385
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,120
and this wedding dress shop again,

386
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,250
then we'll meet at the police station.

387
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,910
Qi Gege, your smugness won't last long.

388
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,410
In just three days,

389
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,360
you'll definitely lose.

390
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,770
Let's go.

391
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,640
Are you okay?

392
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,010
Come on. Let me help you up.

393
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:20,920
It's alright.

394
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,260
I'm fine.

395
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,240
Thanks. Thank you.

396
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,310
[Payee: Chen Xi] [Payer: Gao Shanshan]

397
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,190
You You, you're amazing.

398
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,820
You managed to get all this information out of her.

399
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,480
It's all thanks to God's help.

400
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,300
An Jingjing has been secretly

401
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,830
investigating Gao Shanshan all these years.

402
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,320
In the end, she discovered that

403
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Gao Shanshan

404
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,060
occasionally transferred money to Chen Xi.

405
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,180
She thought he was keeping a mistress.

406
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,030
But in fact,

407
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,070
Chen Xi was just an intermediary in the process.

408
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,530
She would withdraw the money

409
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,990
and then give it to Liu Fei.

410
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,720
With these transfer records

411
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,980
and Chen Xi's testimony,

412
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,240
as long as we can find Liu Fei,

413
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,030
we'll get the upper hand over Gao Shanshan.

414
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,040
That's right.

415
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,960
However,

416
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,510
Chen Xi also doesn't know where Liu Fei is now.

417
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,840
She only knows that he's a gambler.

418
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,600
When he has no money,

419
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,610
he'll ask Gao Shanshan to transfer money to him.

420
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,890
Then Chen Xi will

421
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,220
put the cash she has withdrawn

422
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,720
at the place specified by him.

423
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,400
Then let's wait a bit longer.

424
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,380
I can't wait any longer.

425
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,870
But only with these transfer records,

426
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,990
will Gao Shanshan give us the recording?

427
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,840
I don't know.

428
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,030
But even though there's not much chance of success,

429
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,560
I still have to give it a try.

430
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:35,910
Junior.

431
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,800
Why are you here alone?

432
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,590
Where's Qi Dong?

433
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,130
Why isn't he with you?

434
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,790
I forgot.

435
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
He's still in the detention center.

436
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,060
It's a normal transaction.

437
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,720
It's okay for me to come alone.

438
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,540
But if you want to play dirty tricks,

439
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,040
I'm afraid the place

440
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,760
you'll go to isn't the detention center,

441
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,080
but prison.

442
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,880
How did you find out about it?

443
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,840
It was all thanks to An Jingjing.

444
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,610
No one knows you better than she does.

445
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,810
I surely needed to

446
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,830
accept the big gift from her.

447
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,680
You asked someone to investigate me again.

448
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,110
Where's the recording?

449
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,880
I'm quite curious.

450
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,760
How did you know that

451
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,490
the evidence I had against An Guoxuan was a recording?

452
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,220
Isn't this just a coincidence?

453
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,980
You like fishing,

454
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,910
while I like scuba diving.

455
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,760
Even God is helping me.

456
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,950
I'm impressed.

457
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
I'm actually feeling a bit regretful now.

458
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,090
I should have cherished you back then.

459
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,080
With your assistance,

460
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,400
I wouldn't have needed any recordings.

461
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,360
Cut the crap.

462
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,460
Let's get to the point.

463
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
Liu Fei and his cousin are under my protection now.

464
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,480
And they're willing to cooperate with me to testify against you.

465
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,920
The recording is here.

466
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,280
How are the preparations going?

467
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,200
Don't worry. All the accounts are ready.

468
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,580
The trap has also been set.

469
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,040
If any problems come up in the Ninghai Square's

470
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,340
construction site later,

471
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,770
You Zhen will take all the blame.

472
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,650
The three of us have built this empire,

473
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,840
so why should we let You Zhen possess it alone?

474
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,220
We've endured it for so many years.

475
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,800
Now we've finally got a chance

476
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,570
to get rid of this obstacle.

477
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,630
Who let you in?

478
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,200
The stuff is fine.

479
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,150
Give me the recording pen.

480
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,750
Delete all the backup files.

481
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,960
If you want to make a deal,

482
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,620
you need to get all the goods ready, huh?

483
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,460
Where are Liu Fei and his cousin?

484
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,930
I can't hand them over to you.

485
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,840
You have no other choices, either.

486
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,840
At least, you should let me see

487
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,040
how they are now, huh?

488
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,960
Ask your people to send you a video.

489
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,020
It looks like you're not sincere

490
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,690
about making a deal with me.

491
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,350
You're the one who's not sincere.

492
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,620
What's Liu Fei's name now?

493
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,970
Let me tell you the truth.

494
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,050
I gave him a new identity.

495
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,030
He has already changed his name.

496
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,510
You haven't even met him yet.

497
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,720
Why are you trying to bluff me here?

498
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,900
I'll give you one last chance.

499
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,450
Come to my side.

500
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,520
I can give you anything you want.

501
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,410
I'm sorry then.

502
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,830
You're really so disgusting.

503
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,990
I can't convince myself.

504
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,660
An Jingjing was right.

505
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,950
I want to have everything that belongs

506
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,100
to Qi Dong,

507
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,130
including you.

508
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,660
I'll kill you!

509
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,810
If you kill her,

510
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,210
I'll be the witness.

511
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,340
Liu Fei?

512
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,540
Why are you here?

513
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,290
You wanted to kill me.

514
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,880
Of course I had to find a safe place

515
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,770
to hide myself.

516
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,610
After all, in this world,

517
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,290
there's no place safer than a detention center.

518
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,150
So you went to the detention center to find him?

519
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,370
That's right.

520
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,160
Otherwise, why would I make my own hands dirty?

521
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,970
Indeed, when it comes to playing tricks,

522
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,170
even 10 Gao Shanshans

523
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,090
are no match for Qi Dong.

524
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,560
Gao Shanshan.

525
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,720
Don't come any closer!

526
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,490
We've already called the police.

527
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,890
Just surrender.

528
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,060
You committed attempted murder just now.

529
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,840
Four years ago, you also hired Liu Fei

530
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,170
to cripple An Jingjing.

531
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,440
It's enough to sentence you to 8 or 10 years in prison.

532
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,900
If you guys dare to hurt me,

533
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,100
I'll expose An Guoxuan's recording.

534
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,400
Expose it.

535
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,730
Expose it right now.

536
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,170
How I wish you could do that.

537
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,480
It'd be best if An Guoxuan goes to prison with you.

538
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,610
Then the whole company will be mine alone.

539
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,370
Fine.

540
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,520
At worst, we'll all suffer in the end.

541
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,550
If something happens to An Guoxuan,

542
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,080
Xingyao will also be implicated.

543
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,380
By that time, you, Qi Dong, will only

544
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,960
get a worthless empty shell.

545
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,210
You forced me to do this.

546
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,610
Shanshan, don't do that!

547
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,840
An Jingjing.

548
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,320
Today, I've asked you to come here

549
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,640
because I want you to see his true nature clearly.

550
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,400
Your legs

551
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,150
were crippled by Gao Shanshan.

552
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,660
Four years ago,

553
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,640
he hired Liu Fei to deliberately crash into you at the ski resort

554
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,720
and cripple your legs

555
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,440
so that you would gradually fall for him

556
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,100
and never be able to leave him.

557
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,380
Shanshan.

558
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,710
The police are coming.

559
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,670
You need to hold me hostage

560
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,930
so that you can escape.

561
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,070
An Jingjing, have you lost your mind?

562
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,570
Let go of her.

563
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,390
I can let you leave.

564
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,400
You think I'd believe that?

565
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,680
If you dare to come closer,

566
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,340
I'll make her die with me!

567
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,020
Shanshan, leave at once!

568
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,900
I leave this to you.

569
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,070
Dong, be careful!

570
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,210
In a while,

571
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,150
my people will come to pick me up.

572
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,100
By that time,

573
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Qi Dong will never be able to find me.

574
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,270
Moreover,

575
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,690
I have you here to keep me company.

576
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,520
Qi Dong!

577
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,400
Call the police!

578
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,680
Don't let Gao Shanshan escape!

579
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,660
Gao Shanshan, let go of her!

580
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,880
I've already called the police.

581
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,790
Qi Dong, you can't defeat me.

582
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,260
If you dare to come closer,

583
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,320
I'll kill her!

584
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,490
Anyway, in a while,

585
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,910
someone will come to pick me up.

586
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,910
Then you'll never be able to find me.

587
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:39,860
Gao Shanshan.

588
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,320
I'll kill you!

589
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,060
Where are you now?

590
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,510
