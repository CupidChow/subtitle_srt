00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,780
[Kill Lover]

2
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,910
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,230
Godmother.

4
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,600
When I went abroad,

5
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,740
I should have forced you to come with me.

6
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,539
If anything had happened to you,

7
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,000
how could I have faced your parents?

8
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,600
If that had happened,

9
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,310
I wouldn't have known the truth,

10
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,620
and I wouldn't have known

11
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,080
that it was An Guoxuan

12
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,360
who destroyed my family.

13
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,470
Do you think your impulsiveness
and immaturity

14
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,070
can bring down An Guoxuan?

15
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,910
If I remember correctly,

16
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,380
this music box

17
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,020
was a birthday gift from your mother.

18
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,270
If the fishing boat hadn't passed by

19
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,720
and those on the boat hadn't heard the music,

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,850
suspecting someone had fallen into the water,

21
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,760
you would have lost your life.

22
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,630
Revenge isn't about acting on impulse.

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,260
If you want to defeat your enemies,

24
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,890
you must plan for the long term

25
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,310
and take it step by step.

26
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,560
I'll give you a new identity

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,320
and send you abroad to study.

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,810
Once you're ready,

29
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,540
you can return to Ninghai.

30
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,430
From today on,

31
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,370
the old Youyou

32
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,000
is dead.

33
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,710
From now on,

34
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,329
your name is Qi Gege.

35
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
Stop right there.

36
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,040
Who are you?

37
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,300
This is my fiancée,

38
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,440
Qi Gege.

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,440
Mr. Qi.

40
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,690
Shisi.

41
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,940
I got evidence of your corruption back then,

42
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,320
and I thought An Guoxuan

43
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,440
had already driven you out of Ninghai.

44
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,130
How come

45
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,340
you suddenly came back?

46
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,270
Mr. An calmed down

47
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,580
and took pity on me,

48
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,800
so he let me come back to be the butler.

49
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,030
Since you've chosen to come back
and serve as a dog,

50
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,890
don't have any other thoughts.

51
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,540
Even if I'm a dog,

52
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,519
I should at least be a qualified watchdog.

53
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,459
Well then,

54
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,440
you'd better take good care of

55
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,640
my fiancée's safety.

56
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,640
After all,

57
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,840
she's also

58
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,280
half your master.

59
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,370
Understood.

60
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,890
Today is the anniversary of
your mother's passing.

61
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,950
Mr. An asked me to bring some flowers.

62
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,909
My mother liked many kinds of flowers,

63
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,690
but she particularly disliked
the smell of chamomile.

64
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,200
Is An Guoxuan

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,080
sending flowers to my mother

66
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,980
or for me to see?

67
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,410
I dare not speculate

68
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
Mr. An's intentions.

69
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,540
Ms. Qi, since you're Mr. Qi's fiancée,

70
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,500
I believe you'll be attending

71
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,150
the family dinner tonight, right?

72
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,010
Of course.

73
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,560
Mr. Qi.

74
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,290
Today,

75
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,100
you should wear a black tie.

76
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
[Kind Mother Qi Xiuqin]

77
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,830
Now, quickly explain to me

78
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,720
why you're here.

79
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,490
I'm here for you, of course.

80
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,360
Because I never fight unprepared.

81
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,920
Go on.

82
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,240
I've always been curious how

83
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,790
the crown prince of the mighty Xingyao Group

84
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,610
became a blind man of no use.

85
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,760
Upon investigation, I found out

86
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,960
that it was actually a girl

87
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,250
who blinded you.

88
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,570
And that girl named Youyou

89
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,280
died

90
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,880
shortly after that.

91
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,930
You didn't kill her, did you?

92
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,159
It seems you've done quite some investigation.

93
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,690
Looks like I guessed right.

94
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,690
So what if I did?

95
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,530
What?

96
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,920
Are you afraid of becoming the next Youyou?

97
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:10,770
No.

98
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,880
I'm smarter than her.

99
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,850
I know how to make the right choice.

100
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,940
It seems you're quite satisfied
with your new identity.

101
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,030
Of course I am.

102
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,650
The identity of your fiancée will

103
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,680
make it more convenient for me
to get closer to An Guoxuan

104
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,740
and help you become the future owner
of Xingyao, Mr. Qi.

105
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,860
I hope you cooperate well with me

106
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,010
at tonight's family dinner

107
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,010
and behave yourself.

108
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,370
What's wrong?

109
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,490
I'm wondering

110
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,870
what kind of people

111
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,630
those who live in this mansion might be.

112
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,010
From now on,

113
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,210
countless eyes will be watching you.

114
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,020
If you show even the slightest weakness,

115
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,330
they'll be like vultures,

116
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,140
tearing you apart and devouring you.

117
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,960
So,

118
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,570
always remember your role

119
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,800
and never let your guard down.

120
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,350
Don't worry.

121
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,290
I definitely won't turn tonight's family dinner

122
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,410
into the Last Supper.

123
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
Mr. Qi. Ms. Qi.

124
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,630
Please come in.

125
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,560
What are you doing here?

126
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,940
Is this how you welcome your brother?

127
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,680
My surname is An, while yours is Qi.

128
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,320
We're not even family.

129
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,520
Besides,

130
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,780
why should you come back, you blind fool?

131
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,130
I'm blind,

132
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,250
and you're lame.

133
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,810
Don't you think

134
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,960
we make the perfect siblings?

135
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,710
You...

136
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,510
Who are you?

137
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,950
This is Qi Gege,

138
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,700
my fiancée.

139
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,130
Call her sister-in-law.

140
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,930
Brother, you haven't come back
for dinner in ages,

141
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,490
and the moment you do,

142
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,080
you bring such explosive news?

143
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,170
You know,

144
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,890
I'm always very efficient in
getting things done.

145
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,610
Unlike you,

146
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,510
who didn't even attend the engagement party.

147
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,330
Had to go all the way to Haizhou.

148
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,480
In the end,

149
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,890
it was all for nothing.

150
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,130
So you met in Haizhou?

151
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,620
I went to the design exhibition in Haizhou

152
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,880
to find new designers.

153
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,390
As luck would have it, I ran into Brother,

154
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,030
and I met Sister-in-law for the first time.

155
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,980
Brother-in-law, you're so young, but why

156
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,180
does your memory seem to be failing you?

157
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,890
I clearly remember it was you

158
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,710
who personally handed your
business card to Gege.

159
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,900
Am I right?

160
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,480
That's correct.

161
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,390
Senior went to Haizhou

162
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,510
and visited me three times

163
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,840
just to talk to me,

164
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,600
hoping I would join Xingyao.

165
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,880
Unfortunately,

166
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,530
I'm not interested.

167
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,350
Senior?

168
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,200
It's such a coincidence that

169
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,220
Ms. Qi and I both graduated from

170
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,130
the Lumini School of Design and Architecture.

171
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,860
What's even more coincidental

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,860
is that we were fellow disciples.

173
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,160
Qi Dong, what are you implying?

174
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,440
What could I possibly imply?

175
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,640
I'm just trying to remind my dear sister

176
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,280
to keep a close eye on your fiancé.

177
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,800
My relationship with Shanshan

178
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,410
is none of your business.

179
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,820
You're just like your mother,

180
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,540
full of ulterior motives.

181
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,320
You'll stop at nothing to get ahead.

182
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,030
Jingjing!

183
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,830
How many times have I told you

184
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,470
not to be so rude?

185
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,240
Hello, Mr. An.

186
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,200
I heard from Shisi

187
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,760
that right after you landed,

188
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,220
you went to pay respects to Qi Dong's mother.

189
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,360
That's good.

190
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,080
Alright,

191
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,290
let's eat first.

192
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,320
Let's go.

193
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm not going.

194
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,750
Ms. An says she's not in a good mood,

195
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,750
so she's not coming down for dinner.

196
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,920
She's not young anymore, yet she's
still throwing tantrums like a child.

197
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,760
Well then.

198
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,230
Prepare a portion of food for her

199
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,480
and take it upstairs.

200
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,040
Yes.

201
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,910
Sorry about that.

202
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,570
She's my only daughter. I've spoiled her.

203
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,650
It's all my fault.

204
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,500
Originally, this trip to Haizhou

205
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,140
was to invite Ms. Qi to join Xingyao

206
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,470
as the chief designer.

207
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,210
As a result, not only did it not work out,

208
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,360
but it also caused a misunderstanding with Jingjing.

209
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,000
However,

210
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,240
it brought Brother and Ms. Qi together.

211
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,080
By the way,

212
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,680
you two have only known each other

213
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,280
for about three days, right?

214
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,150
To hate someone,

215
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,680
it takes a lifetime.

216
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,340
But to fall in love with someone,

217
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,730
it only takes an instant.

218
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,080
Gege.

219
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,150
When did you prepare this?

220
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,880
Here.

221
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,570
From the day I met you,

222
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,190
from the moment you hooked your fingers
with mine,

223
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,170
I knew

224
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,630
I'm destined to with you for life.

225
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,870
So, to prevent you from
slipping away from me,

226
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,150
I had to make the first move.

227
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,760
Let me personally put this ring
on your finger,

228
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,080
to firmly bind you to me.

229
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,140
Ms. Qi, you're really something.

230
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,670
In just a few days,

231
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,660
you've made my son, who was
as cold as iron, blossom.

232
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,920
You are...

233
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,760
Let's sit.

234
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,960
The first woman he's ever brought home.

235
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,840
However,

236
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,600
Ms. Qi, why do I feel

237
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,000
like we've met before?

238
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,230
Perhaps it's because

239
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,600
we were destined to become family.

240
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,640
Well said.

241
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,220
Since we're family,

242
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,490
Ms. Qi, why don't you share

243
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,530
how you and my son got together?

244
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,460
When I was a judge in Haizhou,

245
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,090
there was a student

246
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,940
who deliberately tried to
take revenge on me.

247
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,140
It was Qi Dong who showed up and saved me.

248
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,580
From that moment on,

249
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,630
I knew

250
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,790
that the rest of my life

251
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,390
belonged to him.

252
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,940
What a heroic rescue.

253
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,240
But

254
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,990
it was too coincidental, wasn't it?

255
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,790
Could it be that Brother had been

256
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,910
following Ms. Qi all along?

257
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,560
That's right.

258
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,020
I had indeed been planning

259
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,070
for a long time to be with Gege.

260
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,960
Unlike you,

261
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,860
who can't get what you want.

262
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,560
It seems Ms. Qi's appearance

263
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,520
has put my son and son-in-law

264
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,010
at odds with each other.

265
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,160
But they both know very well

266
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,760
that what makes them most uneasy

267
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,020
is still the exhibition center project.

268
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,170
Ms. Qi.

269
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,320
Which one of them do you think

270
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,280
will win the project?

271
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,950
Mr. An,

272
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,670
what you really want to know is

273
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,480
between Qi Dong and Gao Shanshan,

274
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,880
who will inherit Xingyao, right?

275
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,960
In recent years, my health

276
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,260
has been getting worse and worse.

277
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,480
There have been many rumors
about Xingyao out there.

278
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,840
I'd like to hear

279
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,200
different opinions.

280
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,210
After all, listening to both sides
leads to clarity.

281
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,020
On the surface,

282
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,520
it's a fight for the inheritance of Xingyao.

283
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,480
But actually,

284
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,990
it's about Xingyao's operational difficulties
in recent years.

285
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,790
Sales have plummeted.

286
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,140
Xingyao urgently needs a revolution,

287
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,810
a drastic cure for a desperate disease.

288
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,550
So whoever can lead Xingyao

289
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,890
to break through the siege

290
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,290
and make a comeback from the brink of defeat

291
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,000
is surely going to be

292
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,200
the future leader of Xingyao, isn't he?

293
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,720
"Break through the siege and make a comeback
from the brink of defeat," well said.

294
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,780
Ms. Qi,

295
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,840
you're indeed intelligent and beautiful.

296
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,200
No wonder both of them

297
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,050
want to bring you under their wing.

298
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,870
Ms. Qi.

299
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,040
You're welcome to join

300
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,500
my department at any time.

301
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,700
You really are

302
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,290
persistent, aren't you?

303
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,160
You two are really like

304
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,430
sworn enemies who are bound to meet.

305
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,220
Why don't you channel that competitive spirit

306
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,020
into something more important?

307
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,880
How long has it been since you
played Go with me?

308
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,560
Shanshan,

309
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,990
let's play Go.

310
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,490
Let's eat first.

311
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,950
This morning at the cemetery,

312
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,680
you already knew who I am, didn't you?

313
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,480
That's right.

314
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,070
The reason why you didn't expose my identity

315
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,860
is that you wanted to see

316
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,150
if I had what it takes to go on.

317
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,320
Now it seems

318
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,740
I have a good eye.

319
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,400
You went through all that trouble to
come back to the An family

320
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,530
for revenge, right?

321
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,660
Because you harbor hatred in your heart.

322
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,960
You hate Qi Dong for exposing your embezzlement
of project funds,

323
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,440
but you hate even more the master

324
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,760
you served loyally for 10 years, An Guoxuan,

325
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,490
who drove you

326
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,470
out of Ninghai

327
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,440
like a stray dog.

328
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,370
Don't get smart.

329
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,370
I can expose your identity anytime.

330
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,450
Three years ago,

331
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,340
you fell in love with a rich girl.

332
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,960
and you wanted to elope with her.

333
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,160
However, An Guoxuan

334
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,520
drove you out of Ninghai,

335
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,960
separating you two lovebirds.

336
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,120
When you came back,

337
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,050
that girl

338
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,940
had died.

339
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,910
I didn't expect

340
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,720
you to be such a romantic.

341
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,840
What do you want?

342
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,170
Since we both have secrets,

343
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,730
and our goals align,

344
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,140
why don't

345
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,090
we join forces?

346
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,840
I'll consider it.

347
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,470
However, I must warn you.

348
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,000
Although Qi Dong is blind,

349
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,330
his mind is still sharp.

350
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,180
You've been lurking by his side.

351
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,640
Aren't you afraid that one day

352
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
he'll discover your true identity?

353
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
Someone was here.

354
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,220
Qi Dong.

355
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,690
Where have you been?

356
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,250
Are you worried about me?

357
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,720
However,

358
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,950
I've discovered that this house

359
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,080
seems to be haunted.

360
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,960
Are you scared of ghosts?

361
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,180
Sometimes,

362
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,570
humans are

363
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,430
much scarier than ghosts.

364
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,230
Are you scared of me then?

365
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,060
You seem to enjoy dancing with ghosts.

366
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,270
Especially with you.

367
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,800
This time I saw Mr. Qi,

368
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,040
I noticed his movements have become
increasingly agile.

369
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
It's hard to imagine what kind of effort

370
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,240
he's been putting in behind the scenes.

371
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,540
This son of mine

372
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,600
is indeed quite remarkable.

373
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,760
Also, look into

374
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,220
this Qi Gege.

375
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,410
Yes, sir.

376
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,560
I said I don't want to eat. Take it all away!

377
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,320
Fine, don't eat then.

378
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,210
If you lose some weight, you'll look even more beautiful
in the wedding dress in a few days.

379
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,780
I'm not wearing a wedding dress.
I'm not getting married.

380
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,840
You and that Qi Gege can both get lost!

381
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,190
Shanshan...

382
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,660
A woman like Qi Gege

383
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,330
is nothing but a disposable pawn.

384
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,360
But you

385
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,660
are different from her.

386
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,300
How am I different?

387
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,680
In my world,

388
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,830
you're the only one.

389
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,760
How is it?

390
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,160
Isn't this place exactly the same as

391
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,640
the apartment you lived in back in France, Youyou?

392
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,120
Ms. Ruan will never find out

393
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,520
that you've secretly returned to Ninghai.

394
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,160
Come on, Youyou.

395
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,170
Have a seat.

396
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,310
Actually,

397
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,630
Godmother has already done so much for me.

398
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,160
I really can't let her worry
about me anymore.

399
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,950
Just one word from you,

400
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,750
and I've run my legs off.

401
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,570
You've been following me around
since we were kids.

402
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,050
Don't you remember how many scoldings I've taken
for fighting on your behalf?

403
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,350
Stop, stop.

404
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,630
I'm sorry, Youyou.

405
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,250
I won't complain anymore.

406
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,480
Oh, by the way, Youyou,

407
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,010
how was the family dinner today?

408
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,670
Did you make a big impression?

409
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,210
Qi Dong proposed to me
in front of An Guoxuan.

410
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,900
Dong,

411
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,610
are you serious about the proposal?

412
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,460
I always felt you had special
feelings for Youyou.

413
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,820
That lunatic Qi Dong

414
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,710
actually came up with this trick.

415
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,910
However, I'm starting to get interested

416
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,540
in this fiancé of mine.

417
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,530
My five years of effort

418
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,080
haven't been in vain after all.

419
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,810
Tonight, I've officially entered
the An family.

420
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,390
So our next step is...

421
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,360
To team up with Gao Shanshan

422
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,290
and kick Qi Dong out of the picture.

["Big City, Small Love" Wedding Photography]

424
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,080
Ms. An.

425
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,950
We've been waiting for you.

426
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,640
We've just received a few new

wedding dresses designed by top designers.

428
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,480
Please have a browse.

429
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,120
Shanshan,

430
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,640
why don't you pick one for me?

431
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,840
Sure.

432
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,510
This way, please.

433
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,500
How about this one?

434
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,170
This one is too plain, isn't it?

435
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,920
I prefer something with more
design elements

436
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,760
and shinier.

437
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,920
I remember

438
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,280
there's a handcrafted designer piece
in this store.

439
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,770
You have an excellent eye.

440
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,300
That's our store's prized possession.

441
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,880
Let me take you to see it.

442
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,640
Alright.

443
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,250
Wait for me here.

444
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,490

Senior.

446
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,840
How do you like the wedding dress I chose?

447
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,950
Your taste is indeed similar to mine, Junior.

448
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,010
However,

449
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,480
I didn't expect you to

450
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,940
win Qi Dong over so quickly

451
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,080
and become my sister-in-law, Junior.

452
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,160
I told you,

453
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,520
he's just an appetizer I'm serving you.

454
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,200
So how do you plan to serve

455
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,670
this appetizer, Junior?

456
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,880
I'll join Xingkong

457
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,330
and personally handle the exhibition center project.

458
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,600
I'll pretend to help him secure the project,

459
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,050
but at the crucial moment,

460
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,050
I'll pull the rug out from under him.

461
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,260
By then,

462
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,800
you'll be able to reap the benefits, Senior.

463
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,950
You're making me impatient.

464
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,270
Haste

465
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,270
makes waste.

Okay.

473
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,120
Brother.

474
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,010
Why are you here?

475
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,240
Of course I'm here to choose
a wedding dress for Qi Gege.

476
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,880
What?

477
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,640
You can get married,

478
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,620
but I can't get engaged?

479
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,200
That's not what I mean.

480
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,600
It's just you've come to the wrong place.

481

This is the changing area.

482
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:03,950
Is that so?

483
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,130
Oh no.

484
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,670
I forgot Qi Gege's

485
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,310
exact measurements.

486
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,200
Maybe I should give her a call.

487
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,220
Call...

488
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,260
Never mind.

489
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,040
I almost forgot that

490
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,830
I asked her to give me the initial design

491
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,090
draft for the exhibition center today.

492
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,560
She's probably busy.

493
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,980
I'll just have her come with me next time.

494
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,660
Take your time choosing.

495
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,360
Oh, right.

496
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,420
Remember,

497
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,810
don't just pick any dress randomly.

498
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,840
You know my sister's temper.

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,310

[Xingkong]

503
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,450
Hello, Mr. Qi.

504
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,470
Have you seen Qi Gege?

505
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,400
I haven't noticed.

506
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,280
It's your first day officially on the job.

507
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,540
How are you adjusting?

508
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,480
Intimidated by your authority, Mr. Qi,

509
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,950
the colleagues are all very friendly to me.

510
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,290
Then I hope you won't

511
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,770
become arrogant because of this.

512
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,160
Where's your design?

513
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,320
This design features

514
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,190
a roof covered with a
diagonal rib structure.

515
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,190
The transparent space made of glass

516
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,270
spans the entire building,

517
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,490
blurring the boundaries between
indoor and outdoor.

518
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,460
When paired with unique lighting design,

519
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,080
it perfectly aligns with the
exhibition center's

520
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,480
main theme of a lazy and mysterious
semi-transparent style.

521
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,040
I wonder

522
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,190
if you're satisfied, Mr. Qi.

523
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,560
You should ask Mr. Fu, the head
of the bidding committee,

524
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,000
if he would be satisfied.

525
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,380
The quality of the design proposal

526
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,440
is not his concern.

527
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,040
To deal with Mr. Fu,

528
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,770
we need to tailor our approach.

529
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,070
I didn't expect that

530
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,540
you're also a seasoned

531
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,730
traditional Chinese medicine
practitioner, Ms. Qi.

532
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,040
I wouldn't say I'm a seasoned practitioner,

533
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,080
but to treat you,

534
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,760
I'm more than qualified.

535
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,450
Tell me,

536
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,500
what exactly are you up to?

537
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,550
The Ninghai City Amateur Fencing Competition.

538
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,160
You must have heard of it, right, Mr. Qi?

539
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,620
You want to

540
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,350
participate in this competition?

541
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,150
That's right.

542
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,700
Mr. Fu is one of the sponsors.

543
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,490
He's a die-hard fencing fan.

544
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,580
He's sponsored quite a few

545
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,660
amateur fencers to compete over the years,

546
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,980
but their best ranking

547
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,740
was only top 16.

548
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,600
This is also how he got the nickname

549
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,960
"Mr. Fu, the 16th."

550
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,170
I was thinking,

551
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,000
if we could help him redeem himself,

552
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,520
even if the exhibition center project

553
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,840
isn't a sure thing,

554
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,620
it would at least give us
some advantage, right?

555
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,550
It seems you're

556
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,040
quite confident

557
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,290
in your fencing skills, Ms. Qi.

558
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,429
Fencing requires speed,

559
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,980
accuracy, and explosive power.

560
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,480
I'll compete with you by locating the sound
through hearing.

561
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,800
If you want to win,

562
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,320
bring out your full potential.

563
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,820
Are you alright?

564
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,710
I don't think you're really blind.

565
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,040
Your eyes must have grown somewhere else.

566
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,700
Some things

567
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,710
are not meant to be seen,

568
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,310
but to be felt with the heart.

569
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,690
Oh my.

570
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,450
Why is this guy so harsh?

571
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,950
He's just a madman.

572
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,920
He's already holding back.

573
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,730
I think he was just taking the opportunity
to get back at you.

574
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,080
Could it be that last time at the bridal shop,

575
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,160
he already discovered that you were

576
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,560
having a secret meeting with Gao Shanshan?

577
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,170
If what you said is true,

578
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,570
then it's just as I suspected.

579
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,870
He's been putting on an act
with me all along.

580
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,620
He's been pretending to be blind.

581
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,500
Youyou.

582
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,360
You must have guessed by now.

583
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,150
No matter what kind of villain

584
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,280
I am in your eyes now,

585
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,550
you will eventually understand me.
