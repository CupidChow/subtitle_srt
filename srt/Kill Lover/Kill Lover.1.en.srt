Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,820
I'd like to share a little story with you all.

4
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,480
Before black swans were discovered in Australia,

5
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,640
all Europeans

6
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,190
believed only one thing:

7
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,680
that all swans

8
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,950
were white.

9
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,280
Indeed,

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,900
all the swans they had seen

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
were white.

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,440
You killed my mother ten years ago.

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,039
Until 1697...

14
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,640
You framed my father and sent him to prison.

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,940
Dad...

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,990
An...

17
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,700
You used dirty tactics

18
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,720
to achieve your current success.

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,680
The reason Xingyao has become...

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,840
It's been ten years.

21
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,520
Is that we always maintain a wolf-like spirit...

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,920
I've finally waited for this opportunity.

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,759
We must not only work diligently

24
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,020
and do our jobs well...

25
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,930
Today,

26
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,150
I'll make you pay blood for blood.

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,440
Only then can Xingyao

28
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,160
ride the wind and break the waves,

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,490
and achieve new glory.

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,240
Great!

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,300

33

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,610
My eyes hurt so much.

35
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,000
Catch her!

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,320
Qi Dong.

37
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,670
Take me to the hospital.

39

40
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,660
Take two yellow croakers to the boat.

41
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,950
Sir, is our food ready yet?

42
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,310
It's ready, it's ready.

43
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,460
Sir, give me a fish.

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,390
Alright!

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,890
The fish is here.

46
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,040
Set sail.

47
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,560
A wild large yellow croaker is quite valuable.

48
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,690
But it's not as precious as you.

49
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,380
Catching you

50
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,430
is much more troublesome than catching fish.

51
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,100
To adapt to the darkness,

52
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,680
I've endured so much.

53
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,840
You'll have to pay just as much.

54
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,790
Knowing that these two months

55
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,570
have been even more difficult for you than for me,

56
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,320
I feel much better.

57
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,659
Thank you.

58
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,130
I heard

59
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,690
that fish gall can treat red and swollen eyes.

60
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,300
After you blinded me,

61
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,250
I've been soaking medicine in fish gall

62
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,710
and taking it quite often.

63
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,370
Well, it seems

64
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,500
it hasn't had much effect, has it?

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,900
The hydrogen cyanide toxin in fish gall

66
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,260
is no less potent than the same dose of arsenic.

67
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,520
If not treated promptly after poisoning,

68
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,780
it can cause failure of all organs in the abdominal cavity.

69
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,580
So today,

70
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,650
I've specially prepared this delicacy for you.

71
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,659
Do you like it,

72
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
You You?

73
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,240
Who else but You Zhen's daughter

74
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,000
would use such a foolish method

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,530
to assassinate An Guoxuan?

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,630
If it weren't for you,

77
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,790
I would have succeeded by now.

78
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,170
Ten years ago,

79
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,260
You Zhen misappropriated project funds

80
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,970
and even caused a death.

81
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,470
The victim was none other than You Zhen's wife, Qi Lan.

82
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,070
And their daughter, You You,

83
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,810
went from being the pride of society

84

to selling drinks in nightclubs.

85
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,040
Tell me,

86
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,580
if your mother knew what you've done,

87
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,200
what would she think?

88
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,560
My mother won't come back to life,

89
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,280
and you won't regain your sight.

90
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,750
Don't think that just because you took the poisoned wine for An Guoxuan,

91
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,170
he'll suddenly care about you,

92
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,950
his neglected bastard son.

93
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,200
In my entire life,

94
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,520
I've hated nothing more than being called a bastard.

95
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,480
However, I'll make an exception and forgive you this time.

96

103
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,240

What did you do to my father?

105
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,220
Why so agitated?

106
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,920

who's suffering more alive than dead?

108
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,630
I just told him

109
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,550
that his daughter

110
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,810
wouldn't live past today.

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,380
that you all could attend

192
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,560
my daughter's engagement party.

193
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,020
But I regret to say

194
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,820
I must apologize to everyone.

195
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,840
My future son-in-law,

196
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,640
Gao Shanshan,

197
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,590
is out on business today

198
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,850
and is unable

199
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,680
to attend the engagement party.

200
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,270
Originally,

201
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,340
given my temperament,

202
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,830
Gao Shanshan

203
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,360
would never be allowed to set foot in the An family's house again.

204
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,160
However,

205
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,710
he has prepared a

206
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,470
engagement gift for Jingjing.

207
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,790
I've come to terms with it,

208
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,020
and even think

209
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,380
that my daughter

210
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,190
has quite good taste.

211
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,100
This gift

212
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,940
is

213
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,960
a prenuptial

214
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,800
property agreement.

215
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,210
An Jingjing's

216
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,540
pre-marital and post-marital

217
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,700
assets

218
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,360
all belong to

219
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,710
An Jingjing personally.

220
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,650
Moreover, Gao Shanshan

221
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,320
will transfer all his personal real estate

222
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,760
and savings

223
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,740
to

224
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,350
An Jingjing's name.

225
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,770
That's really bold!

226
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,760
Shanshan says

227
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,880
the title he dislikes the most

228
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,430
is being called the An family's live-in son-in-law.

229
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,800
He doesn't care

230
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,080
if others slander him,

231
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,180
or even care less about

232
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,320
what surname their future children will have.

233
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,920
But he wants the world to know

234
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,740
that he's marrying An Jingjing

235
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,960
not because of me, An Guoxuan,

236
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,330
but because

237
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,240
he really loves Jingjing.

238
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,640
Tell me.

239
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,720
Gao Shanshan isn't going to the engagement party.

240
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,950
What's he suddenly doing in Haizhou?

241
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,600
I...

242
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,740
I don't know.

243
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,300
Do you know what my favorite ball to hit is?

244
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,760
A direct hit.

245
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,100
Because it's powerful.

246
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,650
One hit,

247
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,910
and your forehead explodes.

248
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,540
One.

249
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,140
Two.

250
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,460
I'll tell you.

251
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,510
I'll tell you.

252
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,000
Mr. Gao went to Haizhou

253
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,680
to find the judge for the architectural design exhibition,

254
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,060
Qi Gege.

255
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,550
[Haizhou City]

256
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,440
Why did Gao Shanshan come to find her?

257
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
I've heard of Qi Gege for a long time.

258
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,560
She is the only Chinese person who has won

259
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,220
the French NDA Architecture Design Gold Award.

260
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,349
The exhibition center is related to

261
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,869
the selection of Xingyao's heir.

262
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,880
And a top-level designer

263
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
like Qi Gege

264
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,960
can help him secure this project.

265
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,089
In that case,

266
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,160
the key to the competition between Gao Shanshan and Dong

267
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,290
is all about Qi Gege.

268
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,750
Here she comes.

269
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,700
The show begins.

270
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,660
Finally, she's here.

271
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,040
If Ms. Qi didn't come,

272
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
today would have been a wasted trip.

273
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,420
That's Qi Gege.

274
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,440
All of us top-tier

275
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,630
headhunters from construction companies

276
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,440
are here for Ms. Qi.

277
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,160
Ms. Qi.

278
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,580
We've been waiting for you all this time.

279
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,360
The drinks are ready.

280
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
We headhunters

281
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,120
are all waiting for Ms. Qi

282
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,090
to help us select the future rising stars.

283
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,290
I remember now.

284
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
She's the youngest judge this year.

285
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,940
Why did she place a glass of red wine?

286
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,390
This proves

287
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,120
that this designer's work

288
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,030
is not bad,

289
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,780
but like this red wine,

290
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,410
it still needs to be treasured and fermented for a few years.

291
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,290
She's been looking at this work for so long,

292
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,550
it must be good, right?

293
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,510
It's actually champagne!

294
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,550
This means that this designer

295
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,110
can celebrate in advance.

296
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,040
What does this glass of cola mean?

297
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,260
I really feel sorry for this student.

298
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,040
Ms. Qi's meaning is

299
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,280
to suggest that this designer

300
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,470
should stay away from the design industry

301
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,090
and be a happy couch potato.

302
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,720
Qi Gege.

303
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,030
Ms. Qi.

304
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,230
Thank you.

305
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,190
Your eyes.

306
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,750
It was an accident.

307
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,030
But when I hear your voice,

308
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,780
it feels familiar somehow.

309
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,780
Familiar?

310
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,590
Perhaps we're destined to be partners.

311
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,460
These shoes are called "tears of an era."

312
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,990
I didn't expect you to be so nostalgic, Ms. Qi.

313
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,500
However, these shoes

314
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,510
don't seem to fit you well.

315
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,980
It's the last pair of this classic style.

316
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,420
Even if they don't fit,

317
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,060
I have to have them.

318
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,510
I'm just like you, Ms. Qi.

319
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Whenever I set my eyes on something,

320
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,850
I won't let it go.

321
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,860
So today,

322
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,240
which piece have you set your eyes on?

323
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,370
What I'm interested in is not the work.

324
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,880
It's you.

325
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,020
I forgot to introduce myself.

326
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,480
I'm the CEO of Xingkong Company in Ninghai City,

327
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,280
Qi Dong.

328
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,710
Ninghai?

329
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,930
I've only heard of Xingyao,

330
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,960
but never heard of Xingkong.

331
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,830
I believe

332
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,280
that if Ms. Qi joins our Xingkong,

333
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,240
Xingkong will soon

334
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,890
make a name for itself in the industry.

335
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,870
I'm sorry, then.

336
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,180
When I choose partners,

337
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,900
it's like choosing shoes.

338
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,890
I only like classic styles.

339
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,840
Classic styles are a thing of the past.

340
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,600
Innovation

341
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,220
is the future tense.

342
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:41,870
Classics are classics

343
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,420
because they have stood the test of time.

344
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,500
Unlike so-called innovations,

345
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,860
which may seem eye-catching,

346
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,120
but are actually just a momentary trend,

347
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,750
and will soon be eliminated.

348
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,260
Right, Brother?

349
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,300
If you want to go further,

350
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,400
comfort seems more important than being classic.

351
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,870
Otherwise, you'll end up like Ms. Qi just now,

352
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,400
who, in a moment of carelessness,

353
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,040
fell.

354
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,360
The relationship between you two...

355
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,560
I'm Vice President of Xingyao Group.

356
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,550
Gao Shanshan.

357
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,620
Qi Dong

358
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,390
is my fiancée's brother.

359
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,680
[Gao Shanshan]

360
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,700
So you're the one who,

361
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,340
within three years, will reclaim the South China market for Xingyao, Mr. Gao?

362
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,310
Junior, if you could join Xingyao,

363
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,330
I believe it won't take three years

364
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,000
for Xingyao to become

365
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,230
the leader in the national construction industry again.

366
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,960
You have such confidence in me?

367
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:48,770
Of course.

368
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,190
After all, we studied under the same teachers.

369
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,790
We both graduated from Lumini.

370
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,120
I trust your judgment.

371
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,190
Let me think about it.

372
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,860
Brother, your eyes are not in good condition.

373
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,720
You should go back and rest early.

374
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,650
Your sunglasses.

375
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,150
Throw them away for me.

376
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,410
Considering your sincerity,

377
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,350
and for our future,

378
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,120
I forgive you for what happened today.

379
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,690
My Jingjing is still the most understanding.

380
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,360
I originally bought a 3 a.m. flight

381
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,040
to fly back.

382
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,770
I wanted you to see me first thing when you open your eyes tomorrow morning.

383
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,160
But something came up at the last minute and delayed me.

384
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,040
Okay.

385
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,030
Then you must come back as soon as possible, okay?

386
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,760
Don't worry.

387
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,120
How could I miss

388
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,310
the sight of you

389
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,560
in your wedding dress for the first time?

390
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,520
Get some rest early.

391
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,180
Good night.

392
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,260
Good night.

393
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,120
[Hang up]

394
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,280
Mr. Gao,

395
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,400
I'm sorry.

396
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,440
Qi Dong played his trump card.

397
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,300
I still told him your itinerary.

398
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,090
If he didn't come to interfere,

399
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,450
I would actually feel uncomfortable.

400
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,960
What if Qi Gege really chooses Qi Dong?

401
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,960
After he went blind,

402
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,020
it only took him a year to move freely.

403
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,710
Now he has established a subsidiary company.

404
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,310
We can't be sure he doesn't have any ambitions.

405
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,760
A discarded pawn of the group,

406
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,040
with a bleak future.

407
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,910
Isn't it obvious who she will choose?

408
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,930
Who is it?

409
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
It's me.

410
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,980
Junior, you called me here.

411
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,780
It's probably not just about playing chess, is it?

412
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,190
It must be tiring to play the role of a caring fiancé.

413
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:29,980
What do you mean?

414
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,090
In less than 15 minutes,

415
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,100
you've checked your phone five times.

416
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,830
Afraid your partner might suddenly check on you?

417
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,300
Ms. Qi, are you trying to help me relieve my worries?

418
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,100
This endgame

419
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,040
has troubled me for a long time.

420
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,840
I've never been able to solve it,

421
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,670
until I met you, Senior.

422
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,360
Is that so?

423
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
I want to help you.

424
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,920
Help you reach the highest position in Xingyao.

425
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,070
By then,

426
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,920
you won't be limited by your status as a live-in son-in-law.

427
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,800
I've never believed in

428
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,260
kindness without reason.

429
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,480
Everything

430
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,440
has a price tag.

431
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,710
I want 15% of Xingyao's shares.

432
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,460
Your ambition is not small.

433
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,640
Since you can see

434
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,490
that I'm an ambitious woman,

435
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,290
then you have no choice but to choose me.

436
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,890
Why should I trust you?

437
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,240
Because I will eliminate Qi Dong

438
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,370
as an appetizer

439
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,220
for you.

440
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,620
Let me remind you, Junior,

441
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,080
blindness hasn't been an obstacle for Qi Dong.

442
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,270
Don't underestimate him.

443
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,820
I already have a plan.

444
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,610
You just need to wait and see.

445
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,860
Dong.

446
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,690
Qi Gege has such poor taste.

447
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,580
She actually chose Gao Shanshan.

448
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,320
Those who reveal their hand too early

449
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,780
are destined to be losers.

450
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,450
Qi Gege must be mine.

451
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,510
Dong,

452
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,870
isn't that the fat guy from yesterday?

453
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,070
Let's follow and see.

454
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,640
What are you going to do?

455
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,540
Using a cup of cola

456
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,420
to sentence someone to death

457
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,120
must feel great, right?

458
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,180
Does it feel good?

459
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,110
Does it feel good?

460
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,510
I want to experience that feeling too.

461
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,390
So many of you

462
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,800
bullying a girl,

463
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,400
what's that about?

464
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,450
Get lost!

465
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,290
This has nothing to do with you.

466
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,780
A blind man thinks he can play the hero.

467
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,750
Today, I'll cripple you.

468
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,080
Move aside.

469
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,380
Come here.

470
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,720
Watch out!

471
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,050
Come with me.

472
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:58,990
Where are they?

473
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,330
Where did they go?

474
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,030
Let me help you treat your wound.

475
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,560
You've been following me.

476
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,370
Ms. Qi, is this how you

477
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,860
thank the person who saved your life?

478
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,100
What a coincidence.

479
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,930
It seems you think the same as Gao Shanshan.

480
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,990
I'm different from him.

481
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,680
What I want,

482
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,430
I will definitely get.

483
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,720
What I can't have,

484
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,710
I'll destroy.

485
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,930
Thank you.

486
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,240
Gao Shanshan's offer is very good.

487
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,040
Give me a reason to refuse him.

488
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,240
Once I take control of Xingyao,

489
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,370
I can give you equity shares in Xingyao.

490
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,400
Mr. Qi,

491
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,700
how much do you plan to give me?

492
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,760
Let me guess.

493
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,540
Did Gao Shanshan promise you

494
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,930
that after helping him take control of Xingyao,

495
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,830
he'd give you 10% of the shares?

496
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,800
A little more than that.

497
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,290
I can give you double.

498
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,550
30%.

499
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,040
Mr. Qi,

500
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,150
are you planning

501
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,920
to make me the mistress of Xingyao?

502
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,680
Do you know

503
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,110
what it takes

504
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,900
to become the mistress of Xingyao?

505
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,990
As for me,

506
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,140
I don't like women who are too forward.

507
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,290
But your boldness,

508
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,000
I admire it.

509
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,770
So,

510
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,740
does your promise

511
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,060
still stand?

512
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,180
First thing tomorrow morning,

513
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,270
come back to Ninghai with me.

514
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,860
Then let's toast

515
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,690
to a successful partnership.

516
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,570
Well done.

517
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,030
Thanks, Po.

518
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,000
Goodbye.

519
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,450
How's it going, Po?

520
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,590
You You,

521
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,690
everything has been taken care of.

522
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,750
How about your end?

523
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,250
Don't worry,

524
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,260
the fish has taken the bait.

525
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,720
A sophisticated hunter

526
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,580
often appears in the form of prey.

527
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,100
Qi Dong would never dream

528
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,000
that he is the real prey.

529
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,930
But, You You,

530
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,920
why did you suddenly change your mind

531
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,780
and decide not to go after Qi Dong,

532
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,330
but instead lure him to cooperate with you?

533
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,360
Although Qi Dong has trained himself

534
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,290
to appear no different from normal people,

535
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,080
I've checked his medical records.

536
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,680
The treatment wasn't ideal.

537
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,710
He's genuinely blind

538
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,470
and wouldn't expect me to be alive.

539
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,740
So,

540
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,390
rather than alerting him,

541
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,260
it's better to use him as a stepping stone

542
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,120
to enter their inner circle.

543
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,350
I see.

544
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,290
An Guoxuan is now in a semi-retired state

545
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,290
and rarely appears in public.

546
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,640
We can use Qi Dong to enter the An family

547
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,190
and get close to An Guoxuan.

548
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,050
That's right.

549
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,790
However, Qi Dong is a very suspicious fox.

550
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,659
If I approach him directly,

551
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,670
he will definitely suspect my motives are impure.

552
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,760
So,

553
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,370
you used the strategy of "third party profits from the quarrel",

554
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,100
using Gao Shanshan to attract Qi Dong's attention,

555
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,100
then orchestrated a heroic rescue,

556
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,630
luring him into our trap.

557
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,270
After I take power,

558
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,250
I'll completely eliminate him.

559
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,469
That will be much more interesting

560
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,730
than killing him now.

561
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,429
That's so cruel. I like it.

562
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,820
It's just the prelude.

563
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,060
The game

564
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,639
has only just begun.

565
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,260
