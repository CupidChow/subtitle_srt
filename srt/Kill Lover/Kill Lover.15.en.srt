I have to accomplish.

Ninghai Square

she couldn't make it come true.

to find out what happened back then,

88

although An Guoxuan's previous funds have been recovered,

110
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,610
Xingyao Group is heavily in debt

111
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,659

The project's funding gap has already been filled.

130

Qi Dong contributed the most.

133
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,970
He went to the Housing Construction Bureau again and again

134
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,130
and convinced the officials

135
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,650
to trust Xingyao's construction capabilities again.

137
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,730
Xingyao also talked to and persuaded many investors into

138
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,090
increasing funds and expanding shares.

139
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,360

141
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,380
Actually, Ninghai Square

142
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,290
was already a key government project.

145
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,770
The most important thing is that

146
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,930
the design proposal You You presented

147
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,850
was improved and optimized according to

149

and received unanimous praise.

150

That was the key to restarting the project.

Qi Lan's design concepts

152
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,770
were indeed very advanced.

Even by today's standards,

154
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,320
they're still very creative.

155
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,890

Previously,

165
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,810

166

But later,

167
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,780
I also noticed that

From now on,

Godmother.

176
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,200

177
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,590
the two most important

Silly child,

181
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,170
we're a family, so there's no need for such formalities.

182

183

00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,250
there's one more thing I want to tell you.

191
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,770
You You.

192
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,310
It turns out that

193
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,350
Ms. Ruan and your parents

194
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,570
were college classmates.

195
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,920
Why haven't you ever mentioned that?

196
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,320
You've just found out?

197
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,520
I thought that

198
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,370
Ms. Ruan and your mom were best friends,

199
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,370
and your dad was the third wheel between them.

200
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,570
Don't talk nonsense.

201
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,980
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,050
Actually, Qi Dong's

203
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,460
guess is right.

204
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,930
Her mother and I

205
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,690
were indeed best friends in high school.

206
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,650
We both ended up going to the same university

207
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,850
and choosing the same major.

208
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,610
We even lived in the same dorm room.

209
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,410
Our relationship

210
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,610
was certainly closer than with others.

211
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,630
During that time,

212
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,500
we also met

213
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,050
your father, You Zhen.

214
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,740
In college,

215
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,630
the three of us

216
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,460
were practically inseparable.

217
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,270
After graduation,

218
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,030
Qi Lan and You Zhen got married.

219
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,110
I was worried that with their own little family,

220
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,430
there wouldn't be a place for me anymore.

221
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,870
I was overthinking it.

222
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,090
Even after they got married,

223
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,410
I was still their closest friend.

224
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,780
Before You You was born,

225
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,130
I had already reserved the position of Godmother.

226
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,170
The first person who held you after you were born

227
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,130
wasn't your father,

228
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,110
but me.

229
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,990
Godmother.

230
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,490
Luckily, I still have you.

231
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,570
Silly child, what are you talking about?

232
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,290
Oh, right,

233
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,900
what did you ask me just now?

234
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,570
I wanted to ask you for the recipe for this chicken soup.

235
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,930
I want to make it for Qi Dong

236
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,860
after I learn it.

237
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,320
That's easy.

238
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,100
Next time, come to me earlier.

239
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:14,970
I'll teach you.

240
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,710
Okay.

241
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,450
Just now,

242
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,810
why didn't you let me ask Godmother

243
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,090
about Rose?

244
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,550
Because I suspect that...

245
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,450
she's Rose.

246
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,500
That's impossible.

247
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,680
Why?

248
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,550
Although back then,

249
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,760
at An Guoxuan's place,

250
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,350
I only saw him and Gao Qing,

251
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,730
I also discovered

252
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,800
a lady's brooch.

253
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,290
It was identical to the one

254
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,490
she wore in the photo.

255
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,180
The design of this brooch is quite common.

256
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,890
It's not a custom-made item.

257
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,750
Perhaps it's just a coincidence.

258
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,530
Besides,

259
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,770
you deliberately dropped your chopsticks just now.

260
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,970
Your purpose was to check the tattoo on Godmother's ankle, right?

261
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,170
But she doesn't have a tattoo, does she?

262
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,610
But we've also analyzed that

263
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,450
with your father's cautious personality,

264
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,730
unless it was betrayal by a trusted confidant,

265
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,970
An Guoxuan wouldn't have been able

266
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,170
to shift all the blame

267
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,650
onto him alone.

268
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,420
Moreover, Rose has reappeared recently.

269
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,690
She was able to control Gao Shanshan

270
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,350
right under An Guoxuan's nose

271
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,900
and incited him to burn the documents.

272
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,330
Moreover, she even managed to arrive at

273
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,990
the Swiss Bank one step ahead.

274
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,460
All these things

275
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,040
happened around you.

276
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,130
Don't you think there were too many coincidences?

277
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,120
However,

278
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,830
we don't have concrete evidence right now.

279
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,080
I'll investigate all these things thoroughly.

280
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,810
I also hope that it had nothing to do with Ms. Ruan.

281
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,290
Don't worry.

282
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,170
I will definitely give you an explanation.

283
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,880
I told you to

284
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,130
stop pestering me.

285
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,730
I just want to pester you.

286
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,940
I'm here because I have something to tell you.

287
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,580
I'm pregnant.

288
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,240
Aren't you happy?

289
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,800
So what are you going to do?

290
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,310
Of course I'm going to give birth to the baby.

291
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,990
Don't you love having a daughter?

292
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,120
I'm going to name her

293
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,250
You You as well.

294
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,890
In this way,

295
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,110
we will have

296
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,340
our own daughter.

I'll tell you one last time.

It's over between us.

300
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,810
I have a family.

301
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,530
There's no future for us.

302
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,560

I only have one daughter,

306
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,530

377
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,290
I've always thought that

378
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,250
the tombstone

379
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,310
was established for me by Ruan Bi.

380
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,100
But I never thought that

381
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,750
it was to commemorate her unborn child.

382
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:46,910
What's more,

383
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,480
the child was also named You You.

384
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,700
And she buried

385
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,840
that brooch, too.

386
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,260
I guess she hates my parents very much.

387
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,050
I gave the administrator some money

388
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,780
and asked him to handle it well.

389
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,440
So for the past couple of days,

390
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,480
you've been dealing with

391
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,280
all these emotions by yourself?

392
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,100
Ruan Bi clearly harmed my parents,

393
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,700
but she's been so nice to me.

394
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,780
All these years,

395
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,610
I've truly considered her as my only support.

396
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,150
But only till now do I understand that

397
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,150
she's been using me all this time.

398
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,620
And five years ago,

399
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,130
when you asked me to fake my death to escape,

400
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,560
from that moment onwards,

401
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,170
she already started using both of us

402
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,600
to reap the benefits.

403
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,540
Qi Dong.

404
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,430
It was you who woke me up

405
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,050
and made me see the reality clearly.

406
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,290
So,

407
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,010
whether Ruan Bi is truly sincere or not,

408
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,620
it doesn't matter anymore.

409
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,270
She harmed my mother

410
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,220
and conspired with An Guoxuan to frame my father.

411
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,430
She even killed Gao Shanshan.

412
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,490
These are all facts.

413
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,970
She has done so many terrible things.

414
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,710
I will definitely make her pay the price.

415
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,510
However,

416
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,260
she has hidden her tracks too well.

417
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,490
We have no way of finding the evidence

418
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,150
of her previous crimes.

419
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,610
So,

420
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,090
I have to force her to take action initiatively

421
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,660
and expose her weaknesses.

422
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,400
It looks like

423
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,720
you already have a plan in mind.

424
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,910
Why did you ask me to meet you here?

425
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,170
What's wrong?

426
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,610
Godmother,

427
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,320
did my parents ever mention

428
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,680
a name to you back then?

429
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,610
Rose.

430
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,660
I've heard of it.

431
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,610
I visited your father a few years ago.

432
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,510
He kept saying Rose.

433
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,660
What's wrong?

434
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,070
Rose was the woman whom my father had an affair with.

435
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,750
How can you be so sure?

436
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,130
Among the rose seeds my dad had hidden for 15 years,

437
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,730
there were letters between him and that woman.

438
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,170
That's impossible.

439
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,340
There must be a misunderstanding.

440
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,870
I surely understand the relationship between

441
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,850
You Zhen and Qi Lan, don't I?

442
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,760
They loved each other deeply.

443
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,470
This kind of thing would never happen.

444
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,990
If I hadn't seen those letters with my own eyes,

445
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,290
I wouldn't have wanted to believe it, either.

446
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,110
Godmother,

447
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,700
did my mother really never tell you anything about this?

448
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,870
Actually, your mother

449
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,910
seemed weak,

450
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,770
but she hated showing weakness the most.

451
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,460
If this matter was true,

452
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,150
she would definitely keep it to herself.

453
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,440
The older generation has its own affairs.

454
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,910
Don't overthink it.

455
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,010
Now that your mother has passed away

456
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,010
and your father is in this condition,

457
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,740
you have no way of verifying it.

458
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,610
Just let it go.

459
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,270
I can't let it go.

460
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,230
Even till now,

461
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,360
Rose hasn't even stopped.

462
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,560
She not only manipulated Gao Shanshan

463
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,410
but also wanted to take away

464
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,270
the money that could save Qi Dong.

465
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,450
Actually, I've seen her twice.

466
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,930
I first saw her at the Swiss Bank,

467
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,330
and then I saw her

468
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,090
right here.

469
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,730
However, back then,

470
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,050
I didn't understand what it meant.

471
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,260
Later,

472
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,840
among the letters between her and my father, I found that

473
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,050
she told my father she was

474
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,560
pregnant on that day.

475
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,830
But that woman

476
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,470
lost ultimately.

477
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,170
My father chose his family

478
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,550
and me.

479
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,730
So what if she was pregnant?

480
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,690
She still couldn't capture my father's heart.

481
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,890
That girl who should have been my sister

482
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,860
never came into this world.

483
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,710
I think I should have been sad.

484
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,300
But for some reason,

485
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,850
I feel incredibly lucky for her.

486
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,100
Because her mother

487
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,030
was a mistress who ruined someone else's family

488
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,340
and even did so many terrible things.

489
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,450
So even if she had been born,

490
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,530
being raised by such a mother,

491
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,860
she wouldn't have been happy, either.

492
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,570
Godmother,

493
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,730
you once said that

494
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,390
no matter what difficulties I encounter, I can come to you.

00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,050
You have to help me find her.

498
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,770

00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,940
[Ninghai Square]

565
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,090
Please calm down, everyone!

566
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,340
Compensation! Compensation!

567
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,970
Everyone, please stay calm.

568
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,400
Compensation!

569
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,380
Compensation!

570
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,330
Fifteen years ago,

571
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,450
Ninghai Square collapsed accidentally.

572
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,170
Today, the tragedy has reoccurred.

573
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,160
Do you think the blueprint should be

574
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,960
mainly liable for the accident?

575
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,970
Hello, everyone.

576
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,720
I'm You You, the current

577
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,290
chief designer of Ninghai Square.

578
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,650
Regarding this accident,

579
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,970
please allow me to clarify something.

580
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,290
The blueprint of Ninghai Square

581
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,890
has already undergone a detailed safety assessment by

582
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,660
a professional building appraisal agency

583
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,740
to ensure safety, compliance and stability

584
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,620
of the architectural structure.

585
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,360
It fully complies with

586
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,910
the safety requirements for construction.

587
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,090
You guys have jointly used all these

588
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,510
tricks to deceive us.

589
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,510
Compensation!

590
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,730
Compensation! Compensation! Compensation!

591
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,430
Alright, alright.

592
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,540
Calm down.

593
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,730
Everyone, please calm down.

594
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,530
Come on, everyone. Listen to me.

595
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,860
Currently, the accident

596
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,050
is still under investigation.

597
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,890
Please give us three days.

598
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,770
I promise to figure out the truth for you all.

599
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,040
What truth?

600
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,710
My son is injured because of you guys!

601
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,850
How are you going to compensate him for his injuries?

602
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,760
Compensation!

603
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,010
Compensation! Compensation!

604
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:01,930
We want compensation!

605
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,770
Compensation! Compensation!

606
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,050
Compensation!

607
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,650
If you have any issues, come at me.

608
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,410
We can't work anymore!

609
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,940
We need an explanation now!

610
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:14,930
Godmother.

611
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,120
Ms. Ruan.

612
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,450
I heard that you and the late chief designer,

613
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,930
Qi Lan, were close friends.

614
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,610
Do you think there are flaws

615
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,310
in Qi Lan's design?

616
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,740
Qi Lan was indeed my close friend and confidante.

617
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,810
I'm very sad

618
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,240
about her death.

619
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,410
But I dare to guarantee on my honor that

620
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,330
she was absolutely not an irresponsible designer

621
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,790
as you described.

622
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,300
You You, as her daughter,

623
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,090
is even more outstanding than her mother.

624
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,550
I have full confidence in her capabilities.

625
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,980
As for the true cause of the accident,

626
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,170
if it's our responsibility,

627
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,610
we will absolutely not shirk it.

628
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,080
On behalf of You You, I promise you all that

629
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,700
each victim here will

630
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,270
receive our highest standards of

631
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,410
compensation and treatment.

632
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,850
So please rest assured, everyone.

633
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,850
But as far as we know,

634
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,540
after this accident occurred,

635
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,240
many investors withdrew their funds.

636
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,610
The Ninghai project is actually facing bankruptcy, too.

637
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,190
Where will you get the money to fulfill

638
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,450
this so-called promise?

639
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,010
If you don't have money, how can you compensate us?

640
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,810
That's right.

641
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,530
Compensation!

642
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,410
I'll say this again.

643
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,750
The Ninghai Square project will not be suspended.

644
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,050
The funding gap

645
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,140
will be filled by the Bihai Group.

646
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,810
I will also take the lead in financing

647
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,530
and continue to implement the project.

648
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,410
As for the design issues you all

649
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,440
are worried and concerned about,

650
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,200
please rest assured.

651
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,760
I will make a new proposal for you.

652
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,730
Please trust me, everyone.

653
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,580
I won't let you suffer from the same problem again.

654
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,210
Godmother,

655
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,930
it must be that woman who tampered with the project.

656
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,780
It must be her.

657
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,810
Except her,

658
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,970
I can't think of anyone else.

659
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,050
Calm down.

660
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,990
Now we need to first figure out

661
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,330
what she has tampered with in our project.

662
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,260
Only by doing that can we catch her.

663
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,510
Let me handle this matter.

664
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:58,810
No.

665
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,130
You You is at her most vulnerable time now

666
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,390
and needs you the most.

667
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,250
Staying with her is the most important thing for you.

668
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,430
Don't worry.

669
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,330
I'll definitely figure out the truth.

670
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,260
Wait for my news.

671
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,370
The most urgent matter now

672
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,090
is to minimize the negative impact

673
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,020
on this project.

674
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,890
This is the fruit of your mother's efforts.

675
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,290
It can't be ruined again.

676
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,340
But now with all parties withdrawing their investments,

677
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,610
the funding gap exceeds 50%‌ of the total budget.

678
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,340
It's hard to fill the gap again.

679
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,370
What I said just now

680
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,430
was not to appease the reporters.

681
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,870
I will invest in this project.

682
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,700
What's more,

683
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,770
I will mobilize all the resources around me

684
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,970
to find new financing for this project.

685
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,050
I absolutely won't let this project

686
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,850
repeat the mistakes of the past.

687
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,390
Godmother.

688
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,660
I'm sorry.

689
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,030
I've made you involved in this again.

690
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,350
Why have I always made you worry about me?

691
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,970
What are you talking about?

692
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,440
You are my daughter.

693
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,010
Your business is my business.

694
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,060
Are you feeling better?

695
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:18,810
Much better.

696
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,210
But when I think of how Ruan Bi pretended

697
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,210
to care about me,

698
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,290
I feel sick.

699
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,540
Don't worry.

700
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,969
She can't keep

701
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,540
pretending for so long.

702
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,250
She proposed to invest in the Ninghai Square project today.

703
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,250
Wasn't she just trying to take advantage of the situation

704
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,980
and use this collapse accident

705
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,969
to become the largest shareholder of the project?

706
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,830
Then just let her have her way.

707
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,940
Let her join the project first.

708
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,080
With your provocation,

709
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,969
she has already given herself away.

710
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:57,450
The collapse accident which she created out of anger

711
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,650
is full of loopholes.

712
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,850
Bu Fan is currently monitoring her 24 hours a day.

713
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,410
I believe that it won't take long

714
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,930
before we find the person who tampered with it.

715
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,790
By following this clue in the investigation,

716
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,950
we'll surely find

717
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,530
the evidence of her crimes soon.

718
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,130
Finally,

719
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,070
we'll kick her out of the project.

720
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,910
After Ruan Bi is arrested,

721
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,160
this fund

722
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,020
will remain in the project.

723
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,980
It's like using her help

724
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,430
to complete the Ninghai Square project.

725
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,690
Dong, I found the person.

726
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,610
The surveillance camera I had installed secretly

727
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,170
captured the whole process.

728
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,080
Unexpectedly,

729
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,550
it was someone we know.

730
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:36,650
Who is it?

731
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,990
Are you satisfied?

732
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,530
Yes, I am.

733
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,040
No matter what method you use,

734
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,490
you have to destroy the Ninghai Square project.

735
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,570
Okay.

736
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,660
I'm very satisfied with everything you've done.

737
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,730
You've been a spy by An Guoxuan's side for so long.

738
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,990
Though he has ended up like this,

739
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,530
he still doesn't know you're my person.

740
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,850
I've always had a question.

741
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,820
Why didn't you let Barbie

742
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,990
expose You You's identity directly?

743
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,690
Your greatest strength

744
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,020
is your simplicity.

745
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,330
If we had exposed You You's identity so soon,

746
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,860
what else could I play with?

747
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,580
I just love watching them

748
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,850
fight like dogs.

749
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:47,870
Tell me.

750
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,210
What should I do next?

751
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,940
During this period of time,

752
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,690
you should go to Haizhou to lay low.

753
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,570
What about you?

754
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,850
The collapse accident

755
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,290
was just a prelude.

756
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,340
The climax

757
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,150
hasn't even begun yet.

758
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,730
Currently, Zhao Ke is

759
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,090
the key to a breakthrough of everything.

760
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,320
We must find him.

761
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,190
Got it.

762
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,170
You're awake.

763
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,390
Bu Fan

764
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,910
has found Zhao Ke's flight information.

765
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,050
He took an early flight today

766
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,010
to Haizhou.

767
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,410
He won't be able to escape.

768
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,880
Let's go to Haizhou now.

769
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:57,730
No.

770
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,510
I have to stay here.

771
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,010
Why?

772
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,770
If I leave now,

773
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,240
it will alert our enemy.

774
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,970
Ruan Bi will become suspicious.

775
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,740
So,

776
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,410
only when I stay here

777
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,770
can we make her relax her vigilance.

778
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,090
But I don't want to leave you

779
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,890
alone here.

780
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,060
I've been thinking that

781
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,500
Ruan Bi clearly had so many chances to kill me.

782
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,680
But why has she

783
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,810
always kept me by her side?

784
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,380
I think

785
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,420
the reason is that she hates me.

786
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,690
She hates me for taking everything from her daughter.

787
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,610
So,

788
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,470
she wants to destroy me bit by bit.

789
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,090
There are mysteries hidden in mysteries.

790
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,330
There are changes arising from variations.

791
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,050
She is so focused on destroying me that

792
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,180
she doesn't realize

793
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,060
you've already outflanked her

794
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,230
to solve the problem fundamentally.

795
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,650
But I still don't want you to take this risk.

796
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,370
I can't bear the cost of

797
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,770
losing you.

798
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:03,730
Qi Dong.

799
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,680
I know that

800
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,670
I'm very important to you.

801
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,250
You're also important to me.

802
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,800
The trip to Haizhou

803
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,520
is full of danger, too.

804
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,750
But I believe that

805
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,750
you can protect yourself.

806
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:20,860
So,

807
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,810
I also hope that

808
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,290
you can trust me.

809
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,250
It's this ship, right?

810
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:34,610
Yes.

811
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,040
Let's go.
