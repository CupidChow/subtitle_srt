00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,790
[Kill Lover]

2
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,690
[Episode 4]

3
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,960
You You,

4
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,290
don't be sad.

5
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,030
Daddy knows magic.

6
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,770
I can make it as good as new.

7
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:36,960
Really?

8
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,200
Mom, look!

9
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,480
Daddy fixed it for me.

10
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,990
Isn't it just like new?

11
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,579
It seems Daddy's skills still need some work.

12
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,520
Look,

13
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,079
this crack is still so obvious.

14
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,520
It's because of this crack

15
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,800
that it becomes

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
a unique music box in this world.

17
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,340
It belongs to me alone.

18
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,680
I remember

19
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,360
this music box

20
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,560
was given to you as a burial gift.

21
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,780
Unexpectedly,

22
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,320
you didn't die after five years,

23
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,850
and it's still here.

24
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,210
You fixed it, didn't you?

25
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,120
However, some things,

26
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,960
once broken, remain broken.

27
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,720
Even if repaired,

28
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,740
it's just self-deception.

29
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Pretending to be blind when your sight has been restored,

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,800
so

31
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,460
who's really deceiving themselves?

32
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,390
If I don't pretend to be blind,

33
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,600
how can I appreciate

34
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,260
your brilliant performance?

35
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,600
You You.

36
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,520
Knowing my identity,

37
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,480
yet still allowing me to enter your inner circle.

38
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,680
Knowing I'm working with Gao Shanshan,

39
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,270
yet going along with it.

40
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,010
I can't help but feel

41
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,210
that the one who's really performing

42
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,600
seems to be you.

43
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,070
Then why do you think

44
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,010
after knowing all of this,

45
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,750
I still saved you?

46
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,080
It's simple.

47
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,620
If I had died there,

48
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,340
when the police investigate,

49
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,110
you wouldn't be able to escape involvement.

50
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,510
That's the first reason.

51
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,250
Continue.

52
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Secondly,

53
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,030
perhaps for you,

54
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,140
I still have some value to be exploited.

55
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,610
I always have a feeling

56
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,280
that your goal

57
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,900
is far more than just being

58
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,060
the heir of Xingyao.

59
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,820
So,

60
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,100
you felt it would be

61
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,720
a waste to expose my abilities

62
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,640
to An Guoxuan.

63
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,290
You couldn't bear to let me die.

64
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,710
As An Guoxuan's illegitimate son,

65
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,760
you already harbored resentment towards him.

66
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,159
You never expected

67
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,940
that he would be so cruel.

68
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:37,080
You became blind while shielding him from poison,

69
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
yet he discarded you like an old shoe

70
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,320
and instead

71
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,100
supported Gao Shanshan.

72
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,820
I guess

73
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,070
what you want

74
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,159
is not just Xingyao,

75
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,700
but also

76
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,500
to make An Guoxuan

77
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,520
experience the despair of losing everything.

78
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,620
Your guess is not bad,

79
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,450
but unfortunately,

80
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,570
you have too many flaws.

81
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,600
An old fox like An Guoxuan

82
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,640
only needs to take a slight sniff

83
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,090
to figure out your background.

84
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,640
When I was young,

85
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,360
I thought when things broke,

86
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,290
they could be repaired.

87
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,000
As I grew up,

88
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,640
I realized

89
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,200
that even if fixed,

90
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,090
the cracks would never disappear.

91
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,960
So,

92
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,540
whenever I see something

93
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
with flaws now,

94
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,290
I destroy it.

95
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,760
This way,

96
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,590
the flaw

97
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,020
will never exist again.

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,770
You guessed correctly.

99
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
You

100
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,900
are indeed still useful to me.

101
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,670
However,

102
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,340
you can only be used by me.

103
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,800
As long as you can wholeheartedly

104
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,080
be my pawn,

105
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,850
I promise

106
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,220
I can make your wishes come true.

107
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,110
You You,

108
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,240
look at this report,

109
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,760
it mentions the TCM clinic and local products.

110
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,160
Qi Dong must have used the information he got from you

111
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,280
to follow the trail

112
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,130
[has been officially arrested on charges of embezzlement and bribery]

113
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,130
["Integrity Ninghai" has announced the latest news: Fu Hao, President of Hanhai Group]

114
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,760
and found evidence of Mr. Fu's corruption and bribery.

115
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,090
Then he sent Mr. Fu to prison immediately.

116
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,680
However,

117
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,600
if Qi Dong wanted to use corruption and bribery

118
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,700
to bring down Mr. Fu,

119
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,230
why did he still plan the sacrifice incident?

120
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,670
The order is wrong.

121
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,530
Qi Dong's first choice

122
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,930
should have been to use me

123
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,660
to take the project from Fu Hao.

124
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,410
As for bringing down Fu Hao,

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,170
that should have been the backup plan.

126
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,720
Why are all these people

127
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,640
so cunning?

128
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,150
It's making me confused.

129
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,450
It seems I have the heart of Conan

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,490
but the brain of Kogoro.

131
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,049
It's not that complicated.

132
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,640
Qi Dong had already found out about

133
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,480
the relationship between Fu Hao and Wenwen.

134
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,560
So he molded me into a second Wenwen,

135
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,520
hoping to take down Mr. Fu in one go.

136
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,840
However,

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,840
later he discovered that I was

138
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,560
secretly working with Gao Shanshan,

139
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,920
so he changed his strategy.

140
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,960
He decided to directly bring down Fu Hao.

141
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,740
This way,

142
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,420
he and Gao Shanshan

143
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,680
would be back on the same starting line.

144
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,410
Now that you've explained it, it all makes sense.

145
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,600
However,

146
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,280
there's one thing I still can't figure out.

147
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,320
That day at the Binhai Restaurant,

148
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,850
I saw Fu Hao's driver, Xu Peng,

149
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,310
secretly recording a video.

150
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,410
I'm wondering,

151
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,600
if Qi Dong had already

152
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,840
bribed Xu Peng

153
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,800
to record videos to blackmail Fu Hao,

154
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,560
then he already had the opportunity

155
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,120
to directly secure the exhibition center project

156
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,670
and beat Gao Shanshan.

157
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,420
So why would he

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,270
send Fu Hao to prison

159
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,520
when he had such an advantage?

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,090
This Qi Dong is really hard to figure out.

161
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,400
It was the same before.

162
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,600
Even though he knew your true identity,

163
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,090
he still pretended to be blind for so long.

164
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,240
Qi Dong is indeed

165
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,310
more difficult to deal with than we imagined.

166
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,060
But the outcome

167
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,850
is still uncertain.

168
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,960
Xu Peng has gone into hiding.

169
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,370
I want you to find him before Qi Dong does.

170
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,410
As long as we can force out the truth

171
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,960
and make him hand over the evidence

172
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,400
of Qi Dong planning the sacrifice incident,

173
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,160
we can use this to keep Qi Dong in check,

174
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,040
or even send him to prison.

175
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,040
I'm good at finding people.

176
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,240
I guarantee I'll complete the mission.

177
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,240
There's one more thing

178
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,240
I need you to express deliver to Gao Shanshan.

179
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,340
Mr. Gao,

180
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,430
Mr. Fu has been arrested.

181
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,430
The news about Fu Hao is everywhere.

182
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,520
Do I really need you to tell me again?

183
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,170
It must be Qi Dong's doing.

184
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,580
Mr. Gao has worked so hard for so long,

185
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,380
yet that Qi Dong guy still managed to ruin everything.

186
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,100
Oh, right.

187
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,020
Ms. Qi's package has arrived.

188
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,590
Why would she send sunglasses?

189
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,780
How could a blind person,

190
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,180
single-handedly make it to the Haibin Restaurant,

191
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,790
fight off ten people,

192
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,500
and then jump into the sea to save someone?

193
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,450
Ms. Qi is hinting

194
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,450
that Qi Dong isn't blind.

195
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,640
The fish has taken the bait.

196
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,100
Guess I’ll be making a full fish banquet

197
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,770
to celebrate him getting his sight back.

198
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,880
Mr. An.

199
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,480
Qi Gege's identity

200
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,600
seems to be fine,

201
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,620
[Personal Information]

202
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,170
but her experiences before studying abroad

203
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,220
are all blank.

204
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,510
What do you think?

205
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,920
As long as something exists,

206
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,180
it's impossible to erase all traces of it,

207
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,150
unless...

208
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,850
Go on.

209
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,300
Some people intentionally want to erase

210
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,830
traces of the past.

211
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,310
Some things

212
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,740
can not

213
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,120
be erased.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,460
We're in for a treat today.

215
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,870
Shanshan is cooking himself.

216
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,860
Let me have a taste.

217
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,050
You've really inherited your father's skills.

218
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,900
Tell me.

219
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,830
You've gone to such great lengths,

220
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,260
prepared a whole table of dishes.

221
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,960
Do you have some good news to announce?

222
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,560
Actually, I prepared this family dinner today

223
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,050
to celebrate Ms. Qi's narrow escape.

224
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,890
Let's hear about it.

225
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,100
Mr. Fu, that beast in human clothing,

226
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,350
appeared to be mentoring juniors.

227
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,210
But in reality,

228
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,750
he coveted Ms. Qi's beauty.

229
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,260
So he took her to Binhai Restaurant.

230
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,520
Fortunately, Brother single-handedly

231
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
rescued Ms. Qi.

232
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,600
Otherwise, the consequences

233
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,020
would have been unthinkable.

234
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,550
Brother is really amazing.

235
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,410
He can do so much even though he can't see.

236
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,030
I really want to know

237
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,330
how Brother managed to get through all those bodyguards

238
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,390
and arrested Mr. Fu?

239
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,580
You two,

240
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,940
did you send someone to lurk at the scene?

241
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,180
It's as if

242
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,280
you saw it with your own eyes.

243
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,510
Your eyes have recovered?

244
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,930
They have.

245
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,820
When?

246
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,040
Before I went to Haizhou.

247
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,420
Okay.

248
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,050
Brother,

249
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,880
since you've already regained your sight,

250
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,960
why do you continue to pretend to be blind after coming back?

251
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,920
Could it be

252
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,050
that you want to constantly remind Dad

253
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,790
that you took the poison for him,

254
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,150
so you can exploit his guilt

255
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,560
to smoothly become the successor of Xingyao?

256
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,240
So what's the problem with that?

257
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,990
This...

258
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,430
Of course there's a problem!

259
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,710
This is deception.

260
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,580
Dad,

261
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,980
I remember you said

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,560
you hate people who deceive you the most,

263
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,200
right?

264
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,760
Dad has always been a man of his word,

265
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,600
so

266
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,670
Qi Dong has no right to inherit Xingyao.

267
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,720
Mr. An,

268
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,270
have you ever lived in darkness?

269
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,540
Do you know

270
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,300
how desperate that is

271
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,450
to be trapped in endless darkness,

272
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,110
unable to see tomorrow's sun?

273
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,540
This kind of life,

274
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,920
Qi Dong endured for five whole years.

275
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,010
Five years,

276
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,990
enough to change a person's life.

277
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,620
His blindness cost him his inheritance rights.

278
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,020
He just wants you to consider his sacrifice

279
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,980
and let him return to Xingyao,

280
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,180
to contribute to the group, that's all.

281
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,780
Moreover, Fu Hao's imprisonment

282
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,310
was due to Qi Dong's report.

283
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,120
I thought Brother had some brilliant plan,

284
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,840
but it turns out he just got angry after failing to bribe Fu Hao

285
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,260
and reported him.

286
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:30,960
No,

287
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,910
someone else tried to bribe Fu Hao.

288
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,640
Qi Dong asked me to get close to him

289
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,680
to investigate clues and evidence.

290
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,080
Because Qi Dong understood that

291
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,880
Fu Hao hated Xingyao to the bone.

292
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,590
As long as he's in power,

293
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,800
neither Xingkong nor Xingyao

294
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,550
could secure the exhibition center project.

295
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,700
Not just the exhibition center,

296
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,100
but also Maogang Phase III and Jinyu Bay.

297
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,030
Any project in his hands,

298
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,780
he wouldn't give a single one to Xingyao.

299
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,020
I never forgive

300
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,830
those who deceive me.

301
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,360
But today,

302
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,150
I forgive you.

303
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,370
Because I'm very satisfied

304
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,680
with what you've done.

305
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,200
Dad!

306
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,790
You should think carefully

307
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,850
about why you

308
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,380
couldn't deal with Fu Hao.

309
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,040
Uncle An,

310
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,890
it's my fault.

311
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,960
What I want is not

312
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,560
an attitude of admitting incompetence,

313
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,490
but the ability to solve problems.

314
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,520
As the future

315
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,980
successor to lead Xingyao to the next level,

316
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,570
when encountering obstacles like Fu Hao,

317
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,010
you must eliminate them.

318
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,510
Mr. An,

319
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,870
what you just said makes me feel

320
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,930
that you shouldn't blame Qi Dong,

321
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,660
but should praise him instead.

322
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,610
Qi Dong's

323
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,770
merits and faults balance out.

324
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,520
It's you who deserves a reward.

325
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,550
Qi Dong,

326
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,760
you've found yourself an excellent fiancée.

327
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,020
Open it and take a look.

328
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,990
This blueprint is over a decade old,

329
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:32,380
[Qi Lan]

330
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,780
but the design concept is very advanced.

331
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,680
Qi Lan

332
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,330
truly deserves her title

333
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,420
as the top female designer back then.

334
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,440
This level of work,

335
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,470
even by today's standards, is still top-notch.

336
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,190
That's right.

337
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,370
If it weren't for that accident back then,

338
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,160
Qi Lan would have already won

339
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,960
all the domestic and international architectural design awards by now.

340
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,890
You know about her?

341
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,590
Of course.

342
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
When I was working on the exhibition center,

343
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,680
I went through all of Xingyao's

344
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,080
past project documents,

345
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,760
including the Ninghai Square project.

346
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,220
It was very well designed.

347
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,280
This blueprint,

348
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,480
I've been keeping it all this time.

349
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,940
Today, I'm giving it to you

350
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,980
because I see in you

351
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,800
the same sharp spirit that Qi Lan had back then.

352
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,680
What's the use of just having sharp spirit?

353
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,410
Architecture isn't just theoretical planning.

354
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,720
Even the best design,

355
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,450
if it can't be realized,

356
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,160
is nothing more than a piece of waste paper.

357
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,000
No.

358
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,170
The building on this blueprint

359
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,440
will become Ninghai City's

360
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,410
landmark building.

361
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,950
I plan

362
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,810
to restart the Ninghai Square project.

363
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,360
The two of you,

364
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,660
whoever wins the exhibition center,

365
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,480
will be the heir,

366
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,390
responsible for the Ninghai project's

367
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,390
reconstruction.

368
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,520
Mom, I've finished all my homework.

369
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,360
You little smooth talker.

370
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,090
You want Mom to go out and play with you, don't you?

371
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,400
Dad said,

372
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,530
Ninghai Square is Mom's labor of love.

373
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,640
Don't worry, Mom,

374
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,100
I won't bother you.

375
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,400
Well,

376
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,200
it is indeed Mom's labor of love.

377
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,850
But

378
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,180
you are Mom's precious darling.

379
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,210
What are you doing here?

380
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,860
Your performance just now

381
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,010
was very good.

382
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,570
[Qi Lan]

383
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,760
An Guoxuan used the manuscript to test me.

384
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,240
It shows that he already suspects my identity.

385
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,920
We need to be more careful in our future actions.

386
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,290
It's not just An Guoxuan.

387
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,440
Gao Shanshan threw a grand banquet today.

388
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,040
He must have known in advance that I've regained my sight.

389
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,070
Tell me,

390
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,960
how did he find out?

391
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,960
Sometimes,

392
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,480
the one who knows you best

393
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,230
isn't necessarily your teammate,

394
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,130
but could be your opponent.

395
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,980
What about you?

396
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,490
Are you my opponent

397
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,830
or teammate?

398
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,680
I am your blade.

399
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,040
They say a powerful weapon in hand,

400
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,720
should not be entrusted to others.

401
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,250
You are indeed a fine blade,

402
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,790
one that must be firmly grasped.

403
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,100
However,

405
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,440
who is it truly pointed at?

406
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,240
What?

407

Are you scared?

408
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,930
I'm warning you,

go to waste.

411
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,930
Otherwise, I won't hesitate

412
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,950
to tell An Guoxuan right now

413
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,850
about your true identity.

414
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,920
You wouldn't bear to do that.

415
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,710
Starting tomorrow,

416
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,520
you'll move into my villa

417
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,400
and never leave my sight.

418
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,440
Not bad.

419
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,550
It only took 30 minutes this time.

420
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,360
I'm not as good as you, Senior.

421
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,680
You can run the whole course

422
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,410
without even breaking a sweat.

423
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,770
You called me here,

424
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,840
not to reprimand me, I hope?

425
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,920
You think I don't know

426
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,000
that the blind act alone

427
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,210
isn't enough to bring down Qi Dong?

428
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,320
I just wanted to give Qi Dong

429
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,640
a taste of his own medicine.

430
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,900
But on second thought,

431
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,180
it's indeed better to go with the flow

432
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,520
and give him a favor like what you did, Junior.

433
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,450
If he doesn't experience your firefighting skills,

434
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,750
how can he keep you by his side

435
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,340
to set himself on fire?

436
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,340
As expected, you're still more inscrutable, Senior.

437
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,880
If I didn't even have this level of tacit understanding

438
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,020
and insight,

439
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,880
wouldn't it be a waste of your good intentions, Junior?

440
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,540
Moreover, this family dinner

441
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,050
has made the battle lines clearer.

442
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,600
An Guoxuan has finally brought the succession struggle

443
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,040
out into the open.

444
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,720
Back to the point,

445
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,230
now that Fu Hao has fallen,

446

handling matters strictly by the book.

451
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,920
So to win the project,

452
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,080
we must present something substantial

453
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,560
at the bidding conference.

454
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,720
My plan is

455
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,250
to first stabilize Qi Dong,

456
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,640
then take advantage of the situation

457
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,440
to obtain Xingkong's bid price.

458
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,440
When the time comes, my people will contact you.

459
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,050
You can then make your move based on Qi Dong's pricing strategy.

460

Senior, what do you think?

461
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,700
Are you satisfied with this plan?

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,320
I can now answer

463
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,120
the question you asked earlier.

464
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,770
I came by car,

465
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,800
so naturally I didn't sweat.

466
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,280
I'm the type of person who naturally likes to take shortcuts.

467
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,970
With the help of yours,

468
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,970
why not take advantage of it?

her passionate outburst

473
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,540

you're not allowed

Dong has instructed

that no one is allowed

Ms. Qi,

530
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,130
you'll be staying in the suite on the second floor.

531
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,730
It's already been prepared.

532
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,360
This

533
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,250

00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,570
Dong is waiting for you.

536
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,790
If you like darkness so much,

537
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,330
why bother treating your eyes?

538
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,330
In that case,

539
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,640
wouldn't I miss out on

541
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,670
What a pity that would be.

542
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,760
Alright,

543
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,700
let's get to the point.

544
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,290
What gives you the right to let Bu Fan confiscate my things?

545
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,680
Perhaps it's because I've spent

546
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,260
a long time surviving in darkness,

547
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,920
so I particularly understand

548
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,040
why people

549
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,120
have a dark side.

550
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,190
This darkness is like a black hole,

551
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,720
forcing one's desires

552
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,980
to approach infinity.

553
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,060
So to avoid being swallowed by darkness,

554
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,860
I have to take precautions.

555
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,740
After all,

556
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,410
you have a long list of prior offenses.

557
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,580
If you distrust me so much,

558
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,890
why bother cooperating with me?

559
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,120
Trust

560
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,640
takes time and process to build.

561
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,490
Since I'm allowing you to stay by my side,

562
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,740
it means I'm confident

563
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,900
that I can make you willingly work for me.

564
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,420
