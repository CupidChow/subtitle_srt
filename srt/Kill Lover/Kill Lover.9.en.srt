191
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,220
the celebration banquet,

192
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,040
running all around to
handle public relations,

193
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,070
while you, Mr. Qi,

194
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,680
are hiding out here.

195
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,440
Looks like I can't hide after all, can I?

196
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,240
Indeed.

197
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,160
There are some things

198
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
you can't escape no matter how hard you try.

199
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,840
For example,

200
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
your background.

201
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,540
Not only does your body

202
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,220
carry An Guoxuan's blood,

203
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,490
but it also hides a shameful past.

204
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,830
If I'm not mistaken,

205
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,720
five years ago,

206
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,820
you sent a fisherman

207
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,940
to save You You.

208
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,400
It was done flawlessly.

209
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,800
But what about now?

210
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,440
First, it was Barbie,

211
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,900
then An Jingjing.

212
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,350
You've failed repeatedly,

213
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,560
putting yourself and You You

214
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,680
in danger.

215
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,820
What's wrong?

216
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
Could it be that emotions

217
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,970
have clouded your judgment?

218
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,990
Since You You stepped on this path,

219
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,700
it's like she's been walking on a tightrope.

220
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,930
One small misstep,

221
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,070
and she'll fall into an abyss of no return.

222
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,600
I will not only protect her,

223
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,020
but also prevent anyone from affecting her.

224
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,490
Like you, for instance.

225
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,610
You might still have a chance
to turn things around,

226
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,720
but she doesn't.

227
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,830
She can't afford to lose.

228
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,050
Therefore,

229
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,430
I don't want

230
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,290
You You's future life

231
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,040
to have any connection with you.

232
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,590
Can you help me, mister?

233
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,040
Mister!

234
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,520
Mister!

235
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,120
My music box is missing.

236
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,950
Can you help me look for it?

237
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,940
Mister.

238
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,800
Can you help me look for it?

239
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,920
Come here.

240
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,600
This was a birthday gift from my father.

241
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,720
You broke it.

242
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,180
You have to compensate me.

243
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,550
I'm sorry.

244
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,630
Since you helped me find it,

245
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,120
I won't ask for compensation.

246
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,500
But you have to agree to my request first.

247
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,080
What request?

248
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,070
I haven't decided yet.

249
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,260
Tell me what you can do first.

250
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,120
I can play the piano.

251
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,990
You can play the piano?

252
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,940
Can you play this piece?

253
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,320
It's "Childhood Memories."

254
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,170
That's great!

255
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,520
I've been wondering what birthday gift

256
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,040
I should prepare for my father.

257
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,320
How about this, you teach me how to play this piece,

258
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,730
and I'll forgive you.

259
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,670
Pinky swear. Come on.

260
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,040
♪ Now I wanna to see your soul ♪

261
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,260
♪ When time is enough slow ♪

262
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,760
♪ Walk in a beautiful path where the flowers grow ♪

263
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,960
♪ Now I wanna to see your soul ♪

264
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,290
♪ The answer is sure ♪

265
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,500
♪ That I will be the only one to you ♪

266
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,040
How was it? Do you think I'm ready
to play on my own?

267
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,720
That's not "Childhood Memories."

268
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,080
♪ Now I wanna to see your soul ♪

269
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,040
It's more like "Childhood Nightmare."

270
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,590
♪ The answer is sure ♪

271
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,390
I'm going back to the city today.

272
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,200
Why don't you teach me again next summer?

273
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:34,110
♪ That I will be the only one to you ♪

274
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,200
We made a pinky promise.

275
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,860
Cross my heart and hope to die.

276
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,910
My dad's here to pick me up.

277
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,820
I'm leaving. See you next year.

278
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,440
Her name is You You.

279
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,120
So she knows how to play the piano.

280
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,880
Since You You stepped on this path,

281
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,600
it's like she's been walking a tightrope.

282
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,000
She can't afford to lose.

283
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,510
I don't want

284
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,610
You You's future life

285
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,240
to have any connection with you.

286
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,080
All my life,

287
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,150
you've never hit me.

288
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Now you're even hitting me

289
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,440
for an illegitimate child!

290
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,760
It's exactly because I didn't hit you enough

291
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,490
that you've become so spoiled!

292
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,589
You think Gao Shanshan loves you?

293
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,569
What he loves is being the son-in-law
of the An family

294
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,829
and the position of Xingyao's successor!

295
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,800
For his own purposes,

296
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,369
he didn't hesitate to turn you
into what you are now,

297
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,880
even risking your life!

298
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,700
He's absolutely

299
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,040
unscrupulous!

300
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,170
That's not true.

301
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,780
It's all Qi Dong and Qi Gege who framed Shanshan.

302
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,680
He wouldn't treat me like this!

303
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,830
He said

304
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,790
everyone else was just his pawn.

305
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,070
I'm the only one in his life now.

306
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,220
Dad, you've got it wrong.

307
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,150
You've all got it wrong!

308
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,900
I was indeed wrong,

309
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
for being

310
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,560
too permissive with you.

311
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,510
You've been poisoned by Gao Shanshan
for so many years.

312
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,360
If it weren't for Qi Dong's investigation,

313
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,610
I wouldn't know about this until now.

314
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,890
Didn't you give me a gift?

315
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,180
Here.

316
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,560
I have a gift for you too.

317
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,070
Ms. An.

318
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,810
These are the chat records of Gao Shanshan
and Liu Fei

319
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,740
conspiring to frame you back then.

320
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,690
Come on,

321
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,050
take a good look.

322
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,450
[Okay, as long as everything's ready.]

323
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,450
[I get things done for money. Don't worry.]

324
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,630
Take a good look.

325
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,650
Take a good, long look!

326
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,860
Keep a close eye on her!

327
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,440
Don't let her out again!

328
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, sir!

329
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,980
What are you looking at, slacking off here?

330
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,610
Manager,

331
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,760
this is the trending topic

332
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,880
that was just taken down this morning.

333
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,010
Luckily, I was quick enough to save it.

334
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,630
Is this true?

335
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,320
Ms. An publicly revealed that

336
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,140
Mr. Qi's mother failed to seduce Mr. An,

337
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,980
and then turned the tables on him,

338
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,310
accusing Mr. An of rape.

339
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,930
Rich families are indeed full of drama, aren't they?

340
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,160
Their family has been causing
quite a stir lately.

341
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,680
Mr. Gao is under police investigation,

342
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,600
lying in the hospital as
a vegetative patient,

343
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,130
and Mr. An is caught in
a public opinion storm.

344
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,470
Ms. An.

345
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,970
I'm here to try on wedding dresses.

346
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,180
I'll take that one.

347
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,990
The one Shanshan likes.

348
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,570
Okay.

349
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,660
I'll take you to the fitting room.

350
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,120
Qi Dong.

351
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,630
Qi Dong!

352
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,210
Qi Dong.

353
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,960
Bu Fan.

354
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,330
Do you know where Qi Dong is?

355
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,200
I've been looking for Dong all morning.

356
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,060
I was just about to ask you, Ms. Qi.

357
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,540
He's neither at the company nor the villa.

358
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,340
Let's do this.

359
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,680
Let's split up and search.

360
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,920
Whoever finds him will call
the other person.

361
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,480
Okay.

362
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,920
Hello?

363
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:44,990
Hello?

364
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,410
Is this Ms. Qi?

365
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
This is Chen Xi from the bridal shop.

366
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,160
There's something

367
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,560
I'd like to tell you.

368
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,830
How's my daughter's condition?

369
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,910
Unfortunately,

370
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,450
I'm afriad Ms. An

371
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,770
will have to

372
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,130
spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair.

373
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,410
No, that can't be.

374
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,300
She's still so young.

375
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,470
Get your director here for me.

376
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,510
This...

377
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,930
Bring him here.

378
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,400
Then I'll go find him.

379
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,220
Mr. An.

380
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,100
Mr. An!

381
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,290
Open the door, Jingjing!

382
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,510
Jingjing!

383
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,990
I need to talk to you.

384
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,720
Open the door!

385
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,040
Open the door, Jingjing!

386
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,640
I must speak to you face to face!

387
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,280
Jingjing!

388
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,850
If you don't open the door, I'm coming in!

389
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,840
Jingjing!

390
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,670
Jingjing!

391
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,800
Jingjing.

392
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,630
No matter what you become,

393
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,110
I will always be by your side.

394
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,420
Get out of here!

395
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,860
I don't need your pity.

396
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,030
I'm nothing but

397
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,460
a complete cripple now!

398
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,910
Just leave me alone here,

399
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,040
so no one can see

400
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,780
what I've become.

401
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,880
Go away!

402
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,540
-Go away!
-Jingjing!

403
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,920
-Go away!
-Jingjing!

404
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,360
-I like you!
-Go away!

405
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,060
I like you.

406
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,600
It's not pity.

407
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,240
Shanshan.

408
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,160
You once gave me a ray of light
in the darkness.

409
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,800
I thought it was

410
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,730
the salvation in my hopeless life.

411
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,680
But I never expected that you were

412
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,880
the one who pushed me into the darkness.

413
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,340
I'm just a fool.

414
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,920
Everyone is laughing at me.

415
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,180
What's the point of living anymore?

416
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,530
Being betrayed by someone
who doesn't even love you.

417
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,060
Is that worth dying for?

418
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,800
What are you doing here?

419
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,750
Of course, I'm here to enjoy watching you
do silly things.

420
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,040
Go away!

421
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,650
What's the rush?

422
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,860
Actually, misjudging people

423
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,840
isn't really your fault.

424
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,260
The fault lies with those who deceived you.

425
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,190
Why punish yourself for

426
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,980
Gao Shanshan's mistakes?

427
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,840
If you don't even care about yourself,

428
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,900
how can you expect others to love you?

429
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,830
Let me die. It's none of your business!

430
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,910
As soon as I let go,

431
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,330
your body

432
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,350
will plummet sharply

433
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,910
under the force of gravity.

434
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,740
Your heart

435
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,600
will beat faster and faster.

436
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,380
And then,

437
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,830
you'll crash hard onto the ground.

438
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,380
The moment your body hits the ground,

439
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,240
the reactive force of the collision

440
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,040
will violently push against your bones

441
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,240
and internal organs.

442
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,130
And you'll be like a

443
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,350
watermelon smashed hard onto the ground.

444
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,440
With a loud bang,

445
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,220
you'll instantly shatter into pieces!

446
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,340
You only have three seconds.

447
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,800
No... No...

448
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,710
Three.

449
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,940
No...

450
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,940
Two.

451
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,410
One!

452
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,810
Your body's instinct is telling you

453
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,360
you don't want to die.

454
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,960
Live well.

455
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,690
Life is the most important thing.

456
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,870
Only by living

457
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,100
can we see the bad guys

458
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,130
get punished,

459
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,040
right?

460
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,420
When it rains,

461
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,620
you need to use an umbrella.

462
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,420
From now on, the only one who'll hold

463
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,870
an umbrella for you is yourself.

464
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,300
Take it.

465
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,670
Don't let others look down on you.

466
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,250
Hello.

467
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,430
Ms. Qi, I've found Dong.

468
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,720
He's at the cemetery.

469
00:27:59,130 --> 00:27:59,950
Got it.

470
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:38,220
[Kind Mother Qi Xiuqin]

471
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,990
[Kind Mother Qi Xiuqin]

472
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,200
Some things can be washed away,

473
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,200
but some things

474
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,880
can never be.

475
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,320
But that's okay.

476
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,510
Actually, I'm quite grateful to An Jingjing.

477
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,950
These past few days,

478
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,640
I've been lost.

479
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,850
Her little stunt actually

480
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,480
reminded me of who I really am.

481
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,310
What about you?

482
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,430
Have you remembered who you are?

483
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,700
[Kind Father Zhou Conggeng]

484
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,820
I think you've already guessed it.

485
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,420
That explosion

486
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,000
wasn't an accident.

487
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,160
It was An Guoxuan's doing.

488
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,870
Gao Shanshan

489
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,240
threatened him with the recording

490
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,770
they used to frame my father

491
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,210
back then.

492
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,240
That was something An Guoxuan

493
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,040
absolutely could not tolerate.

494
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,560
Have you found any evidence?

495
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,880
I'm sorry,

496
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,010
I overlooked it.

497
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,610
Lately, my

498
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,830
mind has been quite chaotic.

499
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,690
First, you were in a coma,

500
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,060
and then there was the celebration banquet.

501
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,200
It seems we've both strayed

502
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,600
from our original paths.

503
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,360
It's time for us to return

504
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,020
to our respective positions.

505
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,870
I still miss the old you.

506
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,070
When I was in the detention center,

507
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,520
you disregarded your own safety

508
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,200
and found the evidence of Gao Shanshan

509
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,000
framing An Jingjing on your own.

510
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,990
You also recklessly

511
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,540
went to make a deal with Gao Shanshan.

512
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,530
It's exactly because you are You You.

513
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,040
Your father, You Zhen,

514
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,170
was imprisoned because of An Guoxuan.

515
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,950
Your mother, Qi Lan, died
because of An Guoxuan.

516
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,920
And you...

517
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,250
You're the one I personally
pushed into the sea,

518
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,840
making you unable to live in this world

519
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,360
with your true identity.

520
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,320
Only when An Guoxuan is brought to justice

521
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,160
can your father's name be cleared,

522
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,640
and justice be served for
your mother's death.

523
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,240
Only then

524
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,680
can you reclaim your own name.

525
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,360
I understand.

526
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,130
Alright.
