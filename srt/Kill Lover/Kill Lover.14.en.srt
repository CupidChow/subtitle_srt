What if there's a fire?

379
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,020
What is this?

380
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,570
Whatever it is,

381
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,640
you can talk to me about it.

382
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,690
The person in the photo

383
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,360
is the Rose my father mentioned.

384
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,100
She's also the one behind Gao Shanshan.

385
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,560
Back then,

386
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,480
she colluded with An Guoxuan

387
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,720
to frame my father.

388
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,390
It's kind of pathetic, really.

389
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,270
Actually, back then,

390
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,690
I saw that woman.

391
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,020
But...

392
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,950
I did nothing.

393
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,720
If

394
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,340
I had realized it earlier,

395
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,940
maybe

396
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,150
I could've stopped all of this.

397
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,570
And my mother

398
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,460
wouldn't have died. Right?

399
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,270
When I was a kid,

400
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,620
I made the same mistake.

401
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,140
I completely understand you.

402
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,740
But we can't dwell on the past.

403
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,250
It'll only hurt ourselves.

404
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,280
Actually,

405
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,280
back then, everyone said

406
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,820
my father was responsible for my mother's death.

407
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,580
But

408
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,900
I never believed their nonsense.

409
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,120
For 15 years,

410
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,340
I firmly believed my father was innocent.

411
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,250
That belief is what gave me the strength

412
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,550
to bring down An Guoxuan.

413
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,320
I thought

414
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,960
I could finally prove I was right.

415
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,490
But I never expected

416
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,900
that the one who was the most wrong

417
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,780
was me.

418
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,010
My father wasn't innocent at all.

419
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,610
He really was the one who caused my mom's death.

420
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,120
And everything I held on to

421
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,550
was the biggest joke of all.

422
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,200
That day,

423
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,340
when I found out the truth,

424
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,900
[How I wish I could hold your hand in front of others, You Zhen]

425
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,560
for a second,

426
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,350
I felt like

427
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,390
all the years

428
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,460
I fought to survive

429
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,370
meant absolutely nothing.

430
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,540
When you were a kid, you were all alone.

431
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,010
You had to cling to the only hope you could find

432
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,600
just to keep going.

433
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,250
But it's different now.

434
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,490
Because now you have me.

435
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,260
Of course it's different now.

436
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,070
Your presence

437
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,120
has given my life

438
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,560
new meaning.

439
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,150
No matter what you decide to do next,

440
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,390
I'll be right there with you.

441
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,989
My mother died because of Rose.

442
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,340
I must find her.

443
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,080
And I will

444
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,040
make her pay.

445
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,840
There's one more thing

446
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,190
I have to do.

447
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,159
Ninghai Square

448
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,659
carries so much of my mother's hard work.

449
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,989
But she died

450
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,810
before she could make it a reality.

451
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,679
I must make sure Ninghai Square is built

452
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:45,679
to fulfill her wish.

453
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,150
Okay.
