00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,530
Come and taste how my cooking turned out.

12
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,449
What's wrong?

13
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,960
The flavor is too strong.

14
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
I'm not used to it.

Oysters.

17
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,200
I have a friend,

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,840
who opened an oyster bar in Hong Kong.

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,040
Every year, they air-ship me a box.

20
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,290
They're very fresh.

21
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,520
And eating oysters

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,720
is all about finesse.

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,730
If you do it wrong, they go to waste.

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,600
Watch how I eat.

25
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Eating oysters

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,350
is all about one word: swallow.

27
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,360
Only this way can you ensure

28
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,690
the maximum freshness.

29
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,790
You should try it too.

30

The oysters are fresh, aren't they?

31
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,510
These are French copper oysters,

32
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,420
also known as the king of oysters.

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,500
Lemon chicken takes effort,

34
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,360
but compared to oysters,

35
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,620
it's nothing.

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,640
Moreover, I prepared

37
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,570
this set of oysters especially for you.

38
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,100
I've added some special ingredients inside.

39
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,579
What ingredients?

40
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,780
Do you know

41
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,000
how Native Americans catch wolves?

42
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,640
There's a little thing called a wolfkiller.

43
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,540
No weapons, no blood.

44
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,390
They tie baleen with waxed string,

45
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,780
then wrap it in a ball of fat.

46
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,050
The wolf eats this thing.

47
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,270
Stomach acid dissolves the wax string,

48
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,390
and the baleen springs open.

49
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,540
It struggles for a few days,

50
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,200
but in the end, death is inevitable.

51
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,920
It staggers, walking a few steps before collapsing.

52
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,130
I've been thinking,

53
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,810
such a good thing,

54
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,320
why not use it on humans?

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,350
But the only problem is

56
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,649
how to get people to eat it.

57
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,600
The Native Americans

58
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,560

inside animal carcasses

60
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,400
and left them on wolf trails.

You little fox, willingly coming to my doorstep.

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,190

how You Zhen was framed

85
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,360

aren't you?

87
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,890
Then you plan to record it all and send it to the police.

88
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,340
Don't worry,

89
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,240

He was nothing more than my

94

95
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,920
Being able to die with Qi Dong

96
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,100

There's no water here.

115

Aren't you afraid of being discovered?

119
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,230
I dare say,

120
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,809
the method I used in your body

121
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,240
is known to very few people in the country.

122
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,880
And the best part is,

00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,890
it's clean

124

127
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,960
sepsis will take your life.

128
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,700
But the autopsy

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,640

130

You really aren't afraid of karma, are you?

131
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,450
What do I have to fear?

132
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,470
You were the ones who wronged me first.

She should have enjoyed a better life.

Now,

138
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,480
it's time for you to pay back.

happens all the time.

143
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,410
And the forensic experts

144
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,800
will only conclude malnutrition,

146
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,460
leading to death by sepsis.

147
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,390
There are plenty of such cases.

148
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,360
As for me,

149
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,750
I'll testify when the time comes.

150
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,040
I'll say,

"My poor goddaughter,

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,690
you and Qi Dong will both be dead.

tell me,

197
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,760

Then you appeared.

218
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,220
It's all over now.

219
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,390
Zhao Ke confessed to everything.

220
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,600
Ruan Bi...

221
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,600
She has fled from Ninghai now,

222
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,130
but the police have issued a wanted notice.

223
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,460
The follow-up...

224
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
Let's leave it to the police.

225
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,180
Now,

226
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,540
you only have one task:

227
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,000
to recover your health.

228
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,680
Rest well.

229
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,480
I promise you.

230
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,530
I really can't walk anymore.

231
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,700
The doctor said

232
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,870
during this period,

233
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,020
you need to move around more.

234
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,880
This will help your body recover.

235
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,340
The doctor said to take walks,

236
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,770
but this is almost like military training.

237
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,610
We must have walked at least five kms.

238
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,050
Strictly speaking,

239
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,890
from the time we left until now,

240
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,650
we've walked a total of 1.7 kms.

241
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,920
Just hang in there a little longer,

242
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,940
we're almost at the finish line.

243
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,030
I really can't walk anymore.

244
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,800
I'm a bit thirsty.

245
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,480
Thank you.

246
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,960
Why is it a bit cold?

247
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,119
Here.

248
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,420
Are you Doraemon?

249
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,970
How do you have everything?

250
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,109
I'm your personal Doraemon.

251
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,390
Is that so?

252
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,520
However,

253
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,810
I prefer Nobita.

254
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,300
Are you angry?

255
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,160
Not at all.

256
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,020
Actually,

257
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,700
you're still my favorite.

258
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,670
But Coach Qi,

259
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,340
where's the finish line for today's training?

260
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,070
You'll know when we get there.

261
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,770
Let's go.

262
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,760
Wait for me.

263
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,120
Mom,

264
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,340
I've brought You You to see you.

265
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,830
Why did you suddenly decide to bring me here?

266
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,840
Before my mother passed away,

267
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,200
she wrote me a letter.

268
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,640
She told me

269
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,290
to live well,

270
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,640
but I've been blinded by hatred all this time.

271
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,730
I've repeatedly put myself

272
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,960
and you in dangerous situations.

273
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,520
Looking back now,

274
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,240
was it really worth it?

275
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,400
I've gradually come to understand

276
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,000
what my mother meant

277
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
by the three words "live life well",

278
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,530
and what they truly mean.

279
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:08,720
You You,

280
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,970
it's time to

281
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,850
let go of some things.

282
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,480
Do you think

283
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,800
I haven't let go yet?

284
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,080
Since leaving the hospital,

285
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,920
you haven't mentioned anything about Ruan Bi.

286
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,850
I'm worried...

287
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,740
Because I've come to understand,

288
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,360
so I'm not in a hurry anymore.

289
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,610
Five years ago,

290
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,040
when you rescued me

291
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,170
and took me to Ruan Bi,

292
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,040
she told me

293
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,330
that revenge

294
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,260
isn't everything in life.

295
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,220
At that time, I agreed verbally,

296
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,710
but I didn't really believe it in my heart.

297
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,960
Like a kite,

298
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,180
that thread of revenge

299
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,560
was my everything.

300
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,250
But after going through this,

301
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,490
I've actually come to understand.

302
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,470
Ruan Bi hated my father so much

303
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,080
that she dedicated her whole life to it.

304
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,290
In the end,

305
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,080
what did she gain?

306
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,640
Her life was just destroyed by hatred.

307
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,260
When I was alone in the warehouse,

308
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,800
I thought a lot.

309
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,860
I can't be like her.

310
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,750
I'm much luckier than Ruan Bi

311
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,600
because

312
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
I have you.

313
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,330
Just like now,

314
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,840
without the constraint of that thread,

315
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,710
living a simple life

316
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,630
is so wonderful.

317
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,730
[You're the only one who can protect you. Live well.]

318
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,730
[I love you so much. You have to rely on yourself in the future. Don't count on anyone.]

319
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,730
[Qi Dong, I'm so tired. I can't grow up with you. Please forgive me.]

320
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,820
Auntie,

321
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,410
don't worry.

322
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,950
Qi Dong and I

323
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,440
will definitely do as you said

324
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,240
and live a good life.

325
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,080
No matter where you want to go

326
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,180
or what kind of life you want to live,

327
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,440
I will always be with you.

328
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,570
However,

329
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,720
there's someone more important

330
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,400
that we should go see now.

331
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,830
Hello.

332
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,220
Hello.

333
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,640
Excuse me, where is You Zhen?

334
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,920
You Zhen?

335
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,160
The caregiver was just taking him for a walk

336
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,440
in the yard earlier.

337
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,200
Head nurse,

338
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,960
head nurse, something's wrong!

339
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,240
I just went to the bathroom for a moment,

340
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,560
and You Zhen disappeared.

341
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,630
He's gone?

342
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,600
I'm sorry about this.

343
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,840
We'll go look for him right away.

344
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,610
Don't worry.

345
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,040
He just left a short while ago.

346
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,500
He couldn't have gone far.

347
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,680
Let's split up and search.

348
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,210
Alright.

349
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,320
Dad!

350
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,060
You Zhen!

351
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,200
Dad!

352
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,770
Dad!

353
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,760
Has You Zhen been here today?

354
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,540
No.

355
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,160
Dad!

356
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,910
Come to the Ninghai construction site.

357
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,810
Ruan Bi.

358
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,130
Where's my dad?

359
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,390
I thought you hated him.

360
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,200
Why did you come to save him?

361
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,440
I'm not like you.

362
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,880
Hating someone doesn't mean destroying them.

363
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
You're wrong.

364
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,740
I love him.

365
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,640
I love You Zhen very much.

366
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,240
I love him deeply.

367
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,210
At least I used to.

368
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,060
Although Qi Lan and I were best friends,

369
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,680
I've always been jealous of her.

370
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,990
She's prettier than me.

371
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,330
Her family background is better than mine.

372
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,740
When I'm next to her,

373
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,300
I'm always just a backdrop.

374
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,880
I was the one who fell for You Zhen first.

375
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,390
I never thought he'd confess to Qi Lan first.

376
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,480
Such an outstanding man,

377
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,680
he should have been mine.

378
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,600
Later,

379
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,880
they got married.

380
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,040
You Zhen's career kept growing,

381
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,750
and I became even more jealous of her.

382
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,790
As for Qi Lan,

383
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,290
she was completely focused on her work.

384
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,020
They rarely saw each other and blamed each other.

385
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,790
I knew

386
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,260
that at that moment,

387
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,870
my chance had come.

388
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,950
[Lan, Happy Birthday]

389
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,200
Later, I got pregnant.

390
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,520
Just as I was sharing this good news

391
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,020
with You Zhen,

392
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,800
do you know what he said to me?

393
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,660
Ruan Bi,

394
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,460
I'll tell you one last time,

395
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,470
I only have one daughter,

396
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,630
and that's You You.

397
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,380
You Zhen...

398
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,770
We're over.

399
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,020
He told me

400
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,220
he wanted to return to his family for you.

401
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,480
In the end, it even caused me to miscarry.

402
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,380
Just when I was in despair,

403
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,060
An Guoxuan found me.

404
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,640
At that time, I wanted You Zhen dead.

405
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,680
You Zhen once told me

406
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,540
about Xingyao's business situation.

407
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,940
I can help you fabricate

408
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,950
evidence of Xingyao's financial embezzlement

409
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
and then frame You Zhen.

410
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,530
How can I believe

411
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,920
that you've let go of your feelings for You Zhen?

412
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,970
This was given to me by You Zhen.

413
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,670
I will prove it with my actions

414
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,390
that I have nothing

415
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,010
but hatred for him.

416
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,480
However, after it's done,

417
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,300
I want 30% of Xingyao's shares.

418
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,300
This is what You Zhen owes me.

419
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,680
Deal.

420
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,770
I should have had a share

421
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,540
of Xingyao Group, too.

422
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,200
But I didn't expect that bastard An Guoxuan...

423
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,530
He went back on his word.

424
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,990
Now Qi Lan is dead.

425
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,000
You Zhen has fallen from grace.

426
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,330
It's time for you to fulfill your promise.

427
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,600
Here's five million.

428
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,940
And this brooch.

429
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,170
Keep it as a memento.

430
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,200
What do you mean?

431
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,750
Five million.

432
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,840
It's not a small amount.

433
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,240
That's all you're worth.

434
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,720
Otherwise...

435
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,630
Do you want to end up like Qi Lan?

436
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,640
I hate An Guoxuan.

437
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,560
I hate You Zhen.

438
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,440
I hate Qi Lan.

439
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,720
I hate you even more.

440
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,120
Now Qi Lan is dead.

441
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,950
An Guoxuan is living a fate worse than death.

442
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,130
It's You Zhen's turn now.

443
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,430
And you.

444
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,040
Where is my father?

445
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,250
Where is your father?

446
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,530
Where is your father?

447
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:00,970
Dad!

448
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,250
You may be able to save your father who betrayed the family,

449
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,350
but you killed your mother who loved you.

450
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,070
No!

451
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,000
You're the one who killed my mother.

452
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,600
It's you, You You.

453
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,920
If it weren't for you,

454
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,990
your father wouldn't have abandoned me.

455
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,440
I wouldn't have gone to Qi Lan.

456
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,900
Qi Lan wouldn't have died.

457
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,930
You're the one who caused your mother's death.

458
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,780
It's you, You You.

459
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,380
You murderer!

460
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,810
Actually, at that time,

461
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,560
I could have saved your mother.

462
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,100
Ruan Bi.

463
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,260
Save me, Ruan Bi.

464
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,790
You You was still so young.

465
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,370
She couldn't be without a mother.

466
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,170
What about my child?

467
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,920
She couldn't be without a mother.

468
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,910
You You.

469
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,790
Mom.

470
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,950
I still can't forget

471
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,310
the horrified look in Qi Lan's eyes as she stared at me.

472
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,830
She begged me to save her.

473
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,380
She said her daughter was still young.

474
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,440
I watched as her strength slowly faded,

475
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,370
and then she fell.

476
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,460
Let me go.

477
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,770
I really want to let go.

478
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,210
to crush you to pieces.

479
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,680
But I promised Qi Dong.

480
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,080
I have to live well.

481
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,210
I need to start over.

482
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,190
I already have someone to protect.

483
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,170
So,

484
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,080
I will never let my life

485
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,800
be destroyed because of you.

486
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,990
Why did you save me?

487
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,230
I didn't save you.

488
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,850
I saved myself.

489
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,380
I'll go save your father.

490

Ruan Bi is now facing at least three charges:

508
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,130
murder,

509
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,830
illegal detention,

510
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,520
and economic crimes.

511
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,990
However,

512
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,200
the process from investigation and evidence collection to prosecution

513
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,660
will certainly be very complex and lengthy.

514
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,580
In other words,

515
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,780
there might not be any results in the short term.

516
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,010
But the good news is,

517
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
the bad guys can't escape in the end.

518
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,380
In other words,

519
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,170
you've completely won.

520
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,360
Are you happy?

521
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,080
Not as happy as I imagined.

522
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,770
I finally understand a saying now:

523
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,920
Revenge is not for the dead,

524
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,800
but for the self-satisfaction of those left behind.

525
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,700
At this moment,

526
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,160
I've completely let it go.

527
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,250
Your father has been sent to the hospital.

528
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,050
Let's go.

529
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:09,860
Let's go.

[Three days later]

531
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,540
Roses.

532
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,080
I want to plant roses.

533
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,180
Roses.

534
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,450
I never expected

535
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,440
that your father would be in such good health.

536
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,320
It's only been a few days,

537
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,840
and he's already recovered.

538
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,500
Aren't you going to visit him?

539
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,620
I'd rather not disturb him.

540
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,370
The roses he speaks of,

541
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,970
whether they represent love or hate,

542
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,500
it doesn't matter anymore.

543
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,700
Let him

544
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,480
live forever in his own world.

545
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,500
What's wrong with that?

546
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,550
Purple roses.

547
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:30,530
Okay.

548
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,520
Do you remember?

549
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,190
Today, 15 years ago,

550
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,620
we met here for the first time.

551
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
I remember now.

552
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,320
No wonder the passwords for your computer and the secret chamber

553
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,380
are all 0721.

554
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,870
It's the date we first met.

555
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,030
It's far more than that.

556
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,520
Even my phone password,

557
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,170
bank card password...

558
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,170
All passwords are the same.

559
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,770
Oh, right.

00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,910

of the staff?

563
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,280
Why can't you go three sentences without mentioning work?

564
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,440
Who was it that said

565
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,570
we should complete Mom's life's work?

566
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,440
I did.

574
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,360

575
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,290

576
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,030
I'm destined to with you for life.

577
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,720
That phrase...

578
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,800
Why does it sound so familiar?

579
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,280

I'm destined to with you for life.

584
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,840
When I said those words,

585
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,790
I meant it.
