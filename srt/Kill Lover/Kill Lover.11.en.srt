Didn't you say that

17
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,370
we would bring An Guoxuan to justice together?

18
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,300
We're about to succeed now.

Yes, I am.

26

there was a big fire at Ninghai Square's temporary office.

98

Although there were no casualties,

99
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,640
all the project's past documents were destroyed in the fire.

100
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,370
This has cast a shadow on the restart

101
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,100
of the Ninghai Square project.

102
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,100
According to reports,

103
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,000
An Guoxuan, President of the Xingyao Group,

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
has launched an investigation

105
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,760
to thoroughly look into the fire accident

106
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,360
and strengthen construction management

107
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,690
to ensure the smooth progress of the financing conference.

108
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,230
You're awake.

109
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,120
How long have I been asleep?

110
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,380
Almost a week.

111
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,640
You...

112
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,910
Don't worry about me.

113
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,460
I'm much better than you.

114
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,530
A couple of days ago,

115
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,260
I already mostly recovered.

116
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,420
I made you some pear soup.

117
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,980
The doctor said that

118
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,930
you had inhaled too much smoke.

119
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,970
You need to eat some food that's good for your lungs.

120
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,770
Here.

121
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,280
You made this?

122
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,940
You could've waited till I woke up before making it.

123
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,040
I just didn't know when you would wake up.

124
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,680
So...

125
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,120
I made a little bit every day to get it ready.

126
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,200
When I was in a coma before,

127
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,240
you were taking care of me all this time, weren't you?

128
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,170
Now it's my turn to take care of you.

129
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,770
During the fire,

130
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,740
there were some things I didn't have the chance to tell you.

131
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,340
But I don't want to just gloss over it like that.

132
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,880
At that moment,

133
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,090
I had only one thought in my mind,

134
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,930
that is, if I'm lucky enough to survive today,

135
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,340
I have to hold onto you tightly.

136
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,590
After experiencing this fire,

137
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,710
I've deeply realized that

138
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,290
we don't know which will come first, an accident or tomorrow,

139
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,390
so I don't want to,

140
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,260
and I'm not willing to let my feelings be buried.

141
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,760
You You.

142
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,460
I want to be with you.

143
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,700
What a pity.

144
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,940
What's the pity?

145
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,360
It's a pity that

146
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,580
the clues we worked so hard to find

147
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,550
have all been burned in the fire.

148
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,090
Who set that fire?

149
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,930
We are finally together,

150
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,270
and this is what you're discussing with me now?

151
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,550
I almost forgot about someone.

152
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,780
Gao Shanshan.

153
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,310
Gao Shanshan

154
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,670
had plenty of reasons to set this fire.

155
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,200
He not only hates An Guoxuan

156
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,600
but also hates you and me.

157
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,070
But where do you think

158
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Gao Shanshan is hiding himself now?

159
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,960
To find Gao Shanshan,

160
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,080
An Guoxuan is more anxious about it than we are.

161
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,910
Let him look for Gao Shanshan.

162
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,400
It might also be the mysterious third person

163
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
from the recording.

164
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,410
We were just about to investigate him,

165
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,200
and then he tried to set a fire to kill us.

166
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,320
Actually,

167
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,860
the one from the recording...

168
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,800
Why are you still here?

169
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,280
Visiting hours are over.

170
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,240
Family members should leave now.

171
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,500
Got it. I'll leave now.

172
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,320
When you're discharged from the hospital,

173
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,780
I'll take you out to relax.

174
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,910
Where will we go?

175
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,180
It's a secret.

176
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,260
It'll be a bit far away.

177
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,890
Maybe

178
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,100
we'll stay there for the night.

179
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,320
Rest well.

180
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,370
Take good care of yourself.

181
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,850
I'm leaving now.

182
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,130
You're back.

183
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,560

186
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,690
He came too suddenly.

187
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,540
I didn't have time to tell you.

188
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,680
The investigation results of the fire accident

189
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,760
are out.

190
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,460
Outside the construction site,

191
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,520
there was a private car

192
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,920
which captured photos of the perpetrator.

193
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,110
Take a look.

194
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,820
Except Gao Shanshan,

195
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,120
who else could it be?

196
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,270
It's just that

197
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,730
he has already gone crazy.

198
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,850
I'm afraid he might do something even worse.

199
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,720
It's just that recording, isn't it?

200
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,240
A secretly recorded tape can't be considered as evidence.

201
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,630
Even if it's handed over to the police,

202
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,230
they can't do anything to me.

203
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,630
Now

204
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,960
it's a crucial period for Xingyao's financing.

205
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,290
If the recording is exposed,

206
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,750
it will have a major impact

207
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,530
on the Ninghai Square project.

208
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,870
You have only one objective.

209
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,100
Keep a close eye on the financing for me.

210
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,490
Gao Shanshan.

211
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,480
Because of Gao Shanshan,

212
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,210
you were almost killed in the fire,

213
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,020
and Jingjing has become like this now.

214
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,880
He must pay the price.

215
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,620
He must pay the price!

216
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,690
Mr. An!

217
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,800

221
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,190
Mr. Qi.

222
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,330
Please come with me.

223
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,560
Doctor,

224
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,930
why did An Guoxuan suddenly faint?

225
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,390
There were no signs at all.

226
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,200
Regarding Mr. An's condition,

227
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,640
the preliminary diagnosis is

228
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,320
a ‌sudden loss of consciousness caused by

229
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
a ruptured intracranial aneurysm.

230
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,170
Mr. An needs to be hospitalized for recovery.

231
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,440
Before his condition stabilizes,

232
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,060
he must avoid overexertion.

233
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,190
Don't let him handle

234
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,590
company matters personally.

235
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,440
If it happens again,

236
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,380
it'll be very dangerous for him.

237
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,160
Dong,

238
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,080
now that An Guoxuan

239
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,390
certainly doesn't have the energy to manage the company,

240
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,720
what are you going to do?

241
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,099
How about this?

242
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,000
Now you can first follow up on

243
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,280
the construction progress of the Ninghai Square project.

244
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,359
Pay special attention to quality control issues.

245
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,560
If you discover any suspicious issues,

246
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,079
inform me immediately.

247
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,040
Got it.

248
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,270
As for the other matter,

249
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,030
how are the preparations going?

250
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,900
Leave it to me. Dong, don't worry.

251
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,480
Oh, by the way, Dong,

252
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,500
why did you choose Qijia Village?

253
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,600
Because this is the first time,

254
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,800
and it might also be the last time.

255
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
What?

256
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,140
You'll stay overnight for the first date?

257
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,050
That's adult love indeed.

Your relationship is developing so fast.

260
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,170
can finally be put into use.

and this Classic Seductive Perfume.

265
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,740
I guarantee that your whole body

266

Qi Dong will be deeply attracted by you.

269

You've never even been in a love relationship.

270
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,000
Where did you get all this stuff?

271
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,780
Don't look down on me, okay?

272
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,740
I've been married and divorced three times in games.

273
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,120
Oh, right.

274
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,440
For such a seductive night,

275
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,060
a set of pure and sexy lingerie is a must.

276
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,750
Stop!

277
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,500
Qi Dong and I

278
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,890
haven't reached that stage yet.

279
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,640
We'll just stay there for one night.

280
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,570
Why are you bringing so much stuff?

What do you know?

282
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,920
Actually,

283
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,410
this is my first time giving flowers to a girl.

284
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,200
Well,

285
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,740
where are we going today?

286
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,690

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
I heard that

292
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,180
when you were a kid,

293
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,080
during every summer vacation,

294
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,440
you would try to persuade your mother

295
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,760
into going back to your hometown.

296

I'll accompany you to relive your childhood.

300
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,450
You've done quite a lot of background research.

301
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,620
Speaking of which,

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,090

everyone with the surname Qi must live in Qijia Village?

307
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,110
Well, I noticed that when we were coming here just now,

308
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,510
you seemed quite familiar with this place.

309

even saved a little boy.

Let me tell you a story.

I remember it was the same that day.

347
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,260
The sun was shining brightly,

348
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,580
and the beach was warm.

But that little boy

350
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,620
was walking towards the deep sea.

351
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
His silhouette

352
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,770
looked so sad,

353
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,210
as if he would be

354
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,770
swallowed by the cold sea water at any moment.

355
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,350
At that time, I had no choice

356
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,630
but to break the hand of the little girl in the music box

357
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,940
and then hide it.

358
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,560
I asked him to help me find it.

359
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,160
Then with the excuse that he broke my music box,

360
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,060
I asked him to teach me how to play the piano.

361
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,490
I just hoped that

362
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,320
his summer

363
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,770

00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,140
However,

365
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,070
I didn't even ask about his name.

00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,680
too many things happened.

Gradually,

369
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,410
I couldn't even remember what he looked like.

370
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,680
I wonder

371
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,360
whether he's doing well now.

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,620
I'm sure he's doing very well now.

00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,080
Why?

375
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,720
Because sad memories

376
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,560
will be replaced by new ones.

377
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,580
So no matter how much pain he was in at that time,

378
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,800
every time he hears this piece of music,

379
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,080
he'll remember how you accompanied him

380
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,880
to go through the entire summer.

381
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,360
So I'm sure he's happy.

382
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,880
That's good.

383
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,560
Then my lie wasn't in vain.

384
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,360

Qijia Village

400
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,080
is far away from the light pollution in the city.

401
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,480
So this is also the best place

402
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,010
to observe meteor showers.

403
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,840
Moreover,

404
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,000
tonight, the Perseus will be at

405
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,860
its most active phase of the year.

406
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
So,

407
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,280
we're just spending the night by the sea today?

408
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,810
What did you think?

409
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,810
I brought all the equipment in vain.

410
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,080
What did you say?

411
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,250
I mean...

412
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,250
Do I look like the type of

413
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,800
girl who would wish upon a shooting star?

414
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,920
Of course not.

415
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,520
However,

416
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,160
I'm that little boy who would

417
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,430
want to bring the girl he loves...

418
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,340
to see a meteor shower.

419
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,900
Why are you looking at me like that?

420
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,410
I didn't expect you to be

421
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,810
such a romantic person.

422
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,090
I'm really not.

423
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,810
But for you,

424
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,520
I can be.

425
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,720
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

426
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,800
You can go inside first.

427
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,660
Just go inside!

428
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,560
Fire! The Fire!

429
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,690
We don't need to put out this fire, huh?

430
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,360
It looks like tonight's meteor shower

431
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,160
won't appear.

432
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
The weather by the sea is unpredictable.

433
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,320
I think

434
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,880
the rain will stop soon.

435
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,460
When I was a kid,

436
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,240
I once waited for a meteor shower like this, too.

437
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,970
It was just the same as tonight.

438
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,420
We agreed to wait for the meteor shower,

439
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,810
so we can't fall asleep.

440
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,450
Meteors are just dust in the universe.

441
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,720
They are drawn to Earth by gravity‌

442
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,920
and have friction with the atmosphere,

443
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,880
which generates high temperatures and electron transitions

444
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,990
to form light trails in the night sky.

445
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,360
The meteors that fall on Earth each year

446
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,040
amount to hundreds of thousands of tons.

447
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,000
You're such a killjoy.

448
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,570
Let's go. It's about to rain.

449
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,010
Tonight's meteor shower won't appear again.

450
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,940
I'm not leaving. I just want to see the meteor shower.

451
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,960
Perhaps I was just not that lucky.

452
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,840
Not only did I not see the meteor shower,

453
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,880
but I also didn't manage to wait till the rain stopped.

454
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,960
In the end,

455
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,800
that little boy and I

456
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,380
had a fever for a week.

457
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,810
Look.

458
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,530
The rain has stopped.

459
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,360
I didn't expect that

460
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,010
you would be so naive.

461
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,860
You still believe in wishing upon a shooting star.

462
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,040
I didn't believe it originally.

463
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,840
But then I met you,

464
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
and I believed it.

465
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,000
Look.

466
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,650
Are we like shooting stars?

467
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,830
After traveling trillions of light-years,

468
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,830
we finally had the chance to meet.

469
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,030
Yes, indeed.
