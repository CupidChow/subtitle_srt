I might as well let your own son tell you.

This way, the revelation of my identity

63
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,300
would be more meaningful.

101
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,860

Into An Guoxuan's pocket.

107
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,240

or Gao Shanshan who takes over at all.

113
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,610
Because the person he's trying to find

114
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,000
is not a successor,

115
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,480
but merely a puppet to take the fall for him.

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,650

An Guoxuan is pretending to be sick

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,050

as soon as possible

119
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,480

In that case,

126
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,960
we need to obtain the evidence

of his previous asset transfers as soon as possible

128
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,430
and bring him to justice

129
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,000
before Xingyao collapses.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,600
When An Guoxuan transferred the assets,

131
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,800
he did it flawlessly,

132
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,480
leaving almost no clues.

133
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,610
Even if we expose him in advance,

134
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,170
he can still clear himself of
any wrongdoing.

135
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,000

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,260
the retribution of cause and effect.

191
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,260
But don't worry.

192
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,520
I won't kill you.

193
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,950
I'm no longer the You You I used to be.

194
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,400
Now,

195
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,860
I want you to live on.

196
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,730
I want everyone to know your crimes.

197
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,320
I want you to watch with your own eyes

198
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,720
as your empire crumbles.

199
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,740
I want

200
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:13,940
to make your life

201
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,460
even more painful than death.

202
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,350
For the sake of climbing the social ladder,

203
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,030
you could sacrifice love,

204
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,220
friendship,

205
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,240
and even family ties.

206
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,320
In the end, you'll surely be abandoned
by everyone

207
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,960
and left with nothing.

208
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,400
An Guoxuan,

209
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,040
now we're even.

210
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,960
Our great revenge is fulfilled.

211
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,890
How does it feel?

212
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,690
It's not quite

213
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,180
what I imagined.

214
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,360
How is it different?

215
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,280
I've imagined countless times

216
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,080
the scene of getting my revenge,

217
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,320
but not once

218
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,000
was it like today.

219
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,240
With the setting sun,

220
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,890
the evening breeze,

221
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,760
and you by my side.

222
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,580
Why

223
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,560
are you staring at me?

224
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,270
I want to remember your smile
at this moment.

225
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,580
Forever.

226
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,260
Qi Dong.

227
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,760
You are suspected of assisting An Guoxuan

228
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,160
in transferring assets.

229
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,160
Please come with us

230
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,360
and cooperate with the investigation.

231
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,450
What's going on?

232
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,970
Although you can forgive me for
what happened back then,

233
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,940
I can't forgive myself.

234
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,290
The only way to bring down An Guoxuan

235
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,280
was for me to cooperate with him

236
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,540
in completing the final asset transfer.

237
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,510
I think

238
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,300
this is the price I should pay

239
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,180
for my inaction back then.

240
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,350
You You.

241
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,580
Everything is over now.

242
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,770
I hope

243
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,950
you can start your life anew.

Qi Dong is a good kid.

even at the cost of going to prison.

288

But...

289
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,920
Did he really have to go this far?

290
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,800
Perhaps he's using his own way

291
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,880
to make it up to you.

292
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,830
No matter how the process went,

294

You can't end up trapping yourself instead.

296
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,730
Now,

297
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,230
is there anything you want to do?

298
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,040
Hello.

299
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm here to see You Zhen.

300
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,320
What's your relationship with him?

301
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
I'm his daughter.

302
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,720
You Zhen is over there.

303
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,120
I am your father.

304
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,200
Dad.

305
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,120
No one can stop me from planting roses.

306
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,920
No one.

307
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,260
Look.

308
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,370
Look what I brought you.

309
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,270
This isn't my purple rose.

310
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,080
I want to plant it myself!

311
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,290
Okay.

312
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,520
The pit you dug is too shallow.

313
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,130
You can't grow roses in it.

314
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,740
Let me help you.

315
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,480
Come on.

316
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:16,970
Come on.

317
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,360
I have a lot of

318
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,790
rose seeds.

319
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,710
How about I plant them with you?

320
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,350
Okay.

321
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,890
Let's

322
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,730
plant lots and lots of purple roses

323
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,860
together, shall we?

324
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,750
Don't cry. Don't cry.

325
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,710
Did the rose thorns hurt your hand?

326
00:20:59,340 --> 00:20:59,940
So,

327
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,050
do you want to be the God of Love

328
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,320
and dye the roses red?

329
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,220
Do you also want to be the God of Love

330
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,420
and dye the roses red?

331
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,680
I don't like purple roses.

332
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,010
Dad,

333
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,210
you recognize me.

334
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,640
I know that

335
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,410
you don't like purple roses.

336
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,130
But you're different from them.

337
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,720
You're willing to plant roses with me.

338
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,610
So,

339
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,040
can you do me a favor?

340
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,520
Many years ago,

341
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,030
I stored a lot of

342
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,480
purple rose seeds

343
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,240
at Xiangyang Flower Shop.

344
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,080
Can you retrieve them for me?

345
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,930
Can you?

346
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,720
Okay.

347
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,560
Tell me how to get them.

348
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,160
Those seeds

349
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,600
are in the storage box

350
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,220
in the warehouse.

351
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,800
The password is

352
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,660
my daughter's birthday.

353
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,240
Don't tell anyone, okay?

354
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,460
Hello.

355
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,630

358
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,520
I'd like to retrieve

359
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,920

360
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,000
I stored here.

361
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,640
How long have they been stored?

362
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,480
15 years.

363
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,570
They're over there.

364

it's driving me crazy.

who kept trying to piece me back together,

563
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,450
preventing me from falling into the abyss

564
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,240
and being blinded by hatred.

565
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,600
Why didn't you tell me anything?

566
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,250
Qi Dong.

567
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,080
Qi Dong.

568
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,820
When I was by your side,

569
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,920
what did you tell me?

570
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,700
You said you don't want the next life.

571
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,160
You want this life.

572
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,760
So,

573
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,680
this time,

574
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,770
let me protect you instead.

575
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:13,790
Okay?
