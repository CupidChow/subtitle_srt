  L.U.C.A.: The Beginning

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:36,590
  This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual names, places, organizations, religious references, and incidents is entirely coincidental.

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,970
  This episode was filmed with adequate accommodations to ensure the safety and the emotional well-being of the infant and minor actors used.

00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,120
 Previously  
 Ji Oh! Stop it!

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,100
 Do you realize how much money I invested in you?

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,180
 Whose hand will you take? Work with me.

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,990
 You're the only person I can trust right now, Team Captain.

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,360
 Stop. It won't open anymore.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,650
 They cleaned up everything without a trace.

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,460
 It's a piece of cake for me to clear the false accusations of the baby's mom.

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,180
 But what about your daughter?

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,980
 Having found my parents is a lie, isn't it?

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,630
 Ji Oh's the killer. Why are you being like this when you know everything?

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,260
 You are the one who killed him, Director. And he was such a good man.

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,950
 The world is not prepared to accept a child like that.

21
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,500
 - What if there were 100 people like you?   
   - Don't come near me.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,200
  or 1,000 or 10,000? If that happened, no one would call you a monster.

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,860
 What you want to change isn't the world, but the people in it.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,790
 Once the clones are made, we'll handle them, going forward.

25
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,970
 Put his corpse alone into a body bag and bring it frozen to Juan Airport.

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,700
  - Get out.  
   - He is the bastard who killed your mom and dad.

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,190
 You're not a monster, Ji Oh. But we made you to be one.

28
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,060
 As long as we're gone, you won't have to live as a monster.

29
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,090
 Don't go! I love you, Gu Reum!

30
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,250
 Final Episode

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,520
Until you die,

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,880
you will never escape from them.

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,780
You should go. If you don't, you'll die too.

34
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,650
Your wife,

35
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,490
your daughter,

36
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,350
I'll kill them both.

37
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,790

38
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,650
What is it that you want?

39
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,260
I don't know.

40
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,800
If you've done this job for long enough,

41
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,900
you no longer know why you're doing it.

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,990
You just do it.

43
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,160
Do I have to die for this to end?

44
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,640
No.

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,860
When I die, that will also end it.

46
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,480
If you go now, you can live.

47
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,040
Ji Oh.

48
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,890
I no longer

49
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,480
have anyone I want to protect.

50
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,960
There's no reason for me to stay alive.

51
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,680
I'm sick of it.

52
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,660
Let's end it here.

53
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,500
Those pathetic bastards.

54
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,120
It's me.

55
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,790
I'd like to buy a powerful gun.

56
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,430
I'm not going to turn in my resignation. Why would I do that?

57
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,880
Think of it as a holiday gift, and get one ready for me.

58
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,790
I'll call you again, from a different number.

59
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,150
Let's take the car. My guys will clean up the mess.

60
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,950
Find Gu Reum first.

61
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,420
We need to clean up the scene first. For now, let's get going.

62
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,290
Find her!

63
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,410
Yes, I understand.

64
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,960
He tried to kill me. That bastard!

65
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,840
That bastard who was nothing but a worm that crawled under my feet.

66
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,930
Look at what he did to me.

67
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,590
Look!

68
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,410
You'll be fine after taking some painkillers and antibiotics.

69
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,200
You go and take care of  Director Kim. No actually, bring him here.

70
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,770
So that I can explain to him why he must die!

71
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,660
Why are you being so touchy?

72
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,600
Why I am being so touchy?

73
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,200
I had a knife to my throat and you're asking me why I am being touchy?

74
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,510
-Please, stop it. 
 -What did you say?

75
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,160
We'll take care of Director Kim ourselves.

76
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,300
You should focus on the internal issues.

77
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,440
What did you just say?

78
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,290
You see, no matter how stupid someone is,

79
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,790
we don't turn over our family member to others.

80
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,920
You think you guys are all that high and mighty?

81
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,700
-Yes, we are. 
 -What?

82
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,810
Great, you came at the right time.

83
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,560
I'll call a few guys to help you, so go and get Director Kim here.

84
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,480
I've heard about you.

85
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,840
You're from the Intelligence Service, aren't you?

86
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,570
Go on.

87
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,330
Can you find someone for me?

88
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,480
I heard your wife took your baby and disappeared.

89
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,600
I will find her right away.

90
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,050
-What price are you willing to pay? 
 -Hey!

91
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,610
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

92
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,010
- I can give you one thing that you want, whatever it may be.
 - Hey!

93
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,620
Fine.

94
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,600
-I'll use all my resources to—
-What do you think you're doing right now?

95
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,290
Hey! Is finding Gu Reum what is important in this situation?

96
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,950
Do you think she's the only woman in the world?

97
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,800
She's the one person who helped me when the world had abandoned me. So watch what you say.

98
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,180
Watch what I say?

99
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,840
Now that a few people have kneeled in front of you, do you think you've actually become a king?

100
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,290
I'm the one who raised you to that status!

101
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,220
It's true that you did.

102
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,920
But you don't have the power to bring me back down to where I was.

103
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,330
Don't you know who I am?

104
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,080
Should I make Gu Reum a murderer again and put her in prison

105
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,500
and sell your daughter to an overseas laboratory?

106
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,110
Is that what it will take for you to realize who I am?

107
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,740
- Is that your plan? 
 - Yes!

108
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,110
So you should know your place.

109
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,680
You filthy crossbreed mixed with animals, how dare you!

110
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,820
Let go!

111
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,020
Let go, let go, let go.

112
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,620
Get off of me!

113
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,480
Let me ask you again. Is that your plan?

114
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,190
Let go. Let go right now!

115
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,020
Ji Oh!

116
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,800
Ji Oh, I'm your mother.

117
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,070
I'm your mother.

118
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,670
Your son is a monster.

119
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,240
There's no way you would be human.

120
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,210
For now, let's do this.

121
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,100
We should close this place down and turn it into a research facility.

122
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,930
If you're going to make more kids, then you'll need more space anyway.

123
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,780
What about the believers who will come for church services this week?

124
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,960
We can send them to the leaders in other areas.

125
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,130
Oh and,

126
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,050
we need someone to manage this place in her stead.

127
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,110
Are you alright?

128
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,560
You are alright.

129
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,610
After all, you're not the child of just one person.

130
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,660
You are the son of every creature that's evolved for decades.

131
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,910
In the end, I am a monster.

132
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,440
You don't need to feel guilty about it.

133
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,500
Let's forget everything that has happened so far and focus on the future.

134
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,580
For Gu Reum

135
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,050
and for your daughter

136
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,350
to protect this place,  propagating  a new species is the only way.

137
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,710
We must make a new world of our own.

138
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,950
You gave me despair so you can find hope.

139
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,920
You should hope that my hope does not become your despair.

140
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,440
You should have never made something like me in the first place.

141
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,050
Please achieve your goals.

142
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,770
That's enough.

143
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,170
- Hello? 
 - Seonbae, it's Gu Reum.

144
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,010
Hey, Gu Reum!

145
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,820
  There was no one else I could trust, so I contacted you.

146
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,940
  There is something that I have to do. Please take care of the baby for a few days.

147
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,780
 She eats well and doesn't cry too much either. So she won't cause much trouble.

148
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,090
 Just don't be surprised if her eyes change color from time to time.

149
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,890
 Even if I warn you ahead of time, you'll probably find it surprising.

150
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,140
 I'm sorry about that. I will contact you.

151
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,360
I'm going crazy.

Can I see the items myself and give you the money then?

158

You ordered a cell-phone?

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,720
Take off your helmet, you bastard.

160
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,930
You bastards. I told you not to, but you still go around selling burner phones.

161
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,730
- You want to die? 
 - No, you see, I only deliver...

162
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,560
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,390
The phone.

164
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,270
- Does this actually work? 
 - Of course.

165
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,120
Our business is built on credibility, so our products are totally reliable.

166
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,140
- I'm sorry. 
 - Do you know or not that this is illegal?

167
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,860
But are you... a police officer?

168
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,080
Answer me. Is this illegal, or not?

169
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,130
It's illegal.

170
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,570
- Then lend me some money. 
 - Huh?

171
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,000
Lend me some money.

172
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,280
Yes, hello?

173
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,290
 Seonbae, it's me, Gu Reum.

174
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,650
Hey, you brat. Where are you? What are you up to?

175
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,500
Did I do something wrong? Why are you doing this to me?

176
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,930
- What about the baby? 
 - Is the baby the problem right now?

177
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,650
Yes.

178
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,410
Ah, yes it is.

179
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,960
Where is the baby? She's well, right?

180
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,850
Yes, because of that, I can't even speak to my wife anymore.

181
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:07,100
So I left the baby with my mom for now. But she's throwing fits, asking me if I made a baby out of wedlock and have a second family.

182
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,700
Forget it. What are you trying to do right now?

183
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,060
You saw the business card, right? Please track the location of the phone number.

184
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,140
Have you lost your mind? How can I find the location without a warrant?

185
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,830
Please do it. I received it from Team Captain.

186
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,950
You met Team Captain?   When? Where?

187
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,280
Did something happen between you and Team Caption?

188
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,810
  - I'm sorry Yu Cheol. 
 - No way...

189
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,670
No, no, nothing happened. So, did you meet the Team Captain or not?

190
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,360
I'll tell you later.

191
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,970
Why later? Tell me now.

192
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,500
Seonbae, please track the location of the phone number.

193
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,580
 I 'm asking a favor. This will be the last thing I ask of you.

194
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,170
Why should do that for you when I don't even know what it's for?

195
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,560
I entrusted you with my baby. It's the same as if I've entrusted my life to you.

196
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,710
Please trust me this just once more.

197
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,940
Never mind. If you want make a request of me, you should meet me and do it face to face.

198
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,410
 Kim Cheol Su

199
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,450
  The number you have called does not exist...

200
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,930
 Please confirm the number again—

201
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,790
Damn it.

202
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,120
Why did you change your phone number again?

203
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,570
Where have you been these days?

204
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,500
We are everywhere and nowhere.

205
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,280
The bureau director is very angry

206
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,220
that you didn't submit your resignation as requested, and instead took a leave instead.

207
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,210
So did he tell you to get a resignation letter from me?

208
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,250
The organization has turned its back on you.

209
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,610
That is your special talent, Seonbae.

210
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,970
So you should think of it as a good life experience. There is nothing else you can do.

211
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,610
Look, I'm very cool.

212
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,370
You can trample on my ancestors, family, relatives, or career. I don't care.

213
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,550
But you shouldn't trample on my pride.

214
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:38,260
Even a lion, the king of the jungle, gets pushed out of the pride when he gets old.

215
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,930
But what can he do? He thinks he should at least eat to live, so he goes hunting alone.

216
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,110
But after hunting with his pride all his life, can he hunt alone?

217
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,870
He couldn't even catch a rabbit and starved to death.

218
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,500
What a pathetic way to spend his last years, isn't it?

219
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,030
Do you know why he failed at surviving? Because he didn't have a gun.

220
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,710
If that old lion had one last bullet left, what do you think would have happened?

221
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:16,220
Don't live too hard. You'll get old too.

222
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,720
Yes, you see Direction Kim, don't you?

223
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,510
That's right. He just left.

224
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,750
Keep him under surveillance for 24 hours and see what he's up to.

225
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,960
It doesn't show?

226
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,270
It's under a false name, and there is no match with this phone number.

227
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,220
It's a burner phone, and it's also been disconnected.

228
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,400
Even if he changes his phone he would still call the person he used to talk to.

229
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,990
Can't you narrow down the frequent calls made with Kim Cheol Su's number and track those down?

230
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,730
Do you think I don't know that?

231
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,520
Call records and location tracking can only be done with a warrant.

232
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,420
But there is no basis to request a warrant, is there?

233
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,390
Seonbae, you were investigating a violent crime case recently, weren't you?

234
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,560
I'm in the Violent Crimes department, so all are cases are violent crimes.

235
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,280
Say that the business card was found at the crime scene and submit it as evidence.

236
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,440
There is blood on that business card. Isn't that enough to get a warrant?

237
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,620
Seonbae?

238
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,170
You have a head for scheming. Where are you?

239
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,950
- I'm in the middle of shopping. 
 - What a life of leisure you lead.

240
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,380
I'm buying some formula and diapers for the baby.

241
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,070
- You don't need to. I bought them already. 
 - But still.

242
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,210
The baby is doing well.

243
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,960
I promise not to arrest you. So let's talk in person next time.

244
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,650
Later.

245
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,400
If you've really staked your life, you should attack, too.

246
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,470
I'm hanging up.

247
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,830
 Dear You Formula

248
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,570
Are you alright?

249
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,760
Seonbae.

250
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,320
Here.

251
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,950
This person spoke to Kim Cheol Su once in a while. But a new number was added.

252
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,560
Here, the same number appears for this person, too.

253
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,690
This is the fourth week.

254
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,100
How do you feel?

255
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,540
How am I supposed to feel?

256
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,980
You are its father, since this was made from your cells.

257
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,200
These are all your children.

258
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,440
So they also won't consider me as their father.

259
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,520
It depends on what you do.

260
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,030
I was never interested in what my father did, but you are different from I am.

261
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,850
How many is your final goal?

262
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,640
- 10,000. 
 - Why?

263
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,600
The world's smallest country is Vatican City, and its population is 10,000.

264
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,530
That's the reason?

265
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,390
I'm not sure, to be honest. It's just an image.

266
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,030
One Pope and 10,000 citizens.

267
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,280
You can be sloppy. I do like that part of you.

268
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,050
Here.

269
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,870
A home should have at least one of these.

270
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,410
This...

271
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,080
I have the data to create photos.

272
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:47,940
It's an edited photo, but it was done well, so it should be fine. If you don't like it, you can throw it away.

273
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:21,050
Gu Reum, look at this. I am not certain, but it seems suspicious.

274
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,740
Almost no traffic pattern, it exited the hotel at 6 p.m. and moved to this building.

275
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,500
And that is all.

276
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,370
The movement speed is fast. So they're traveling by car, aren't they?

277
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,940
- It appears that way. 
 - Let's look into this building first.

278
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,310
It should be easier than the hotel.

279
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,370
How do we look into a building, just like that?

280
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,730
They're in a car, so they will probably move to the parking lot.

281
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,890
Ah, Seonbae. Please lend me your handcuffs.

282
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,230
Yes, Seonbae?

283
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,780
You arrived. Do you see anything?

284
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,390
- No. 
 - But it's moving right now.

285
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,420
It stopped. I think they parked the car.

286
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,560
I don't see them, though.

287
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,540
They've definitely stopped. They are there.

288
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,530
Let's hang up for now.

289
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,490
What is this?

290
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,410
What? Is there a fire?

291
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:08,810
Detective Ha has come to Director Kim's office.

292
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,090
I understand. Keep a mark on her and capture her when the backup arrives.

293
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,100
Your wife was found. I will send my men.

294
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,610
- Where is she right now? 
 - My men were dispatched.

295
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,490
- We will capture her, so just wait. 
 - Where is she?

296
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,510
Why did you do it?

297
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,550
Ugh, I look ridiculous.

298
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:07,190
This is my last warning to you, do not injure my pride.

299
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,250
You will die.

300
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,340
This vermin b**ch. Do you know who I am?

301
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,710
I don't want to know. I only want to hear one thing from you. Why did you do it?

302
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:34,950
You should have known your place and not misbehaved. How dare such a lowly police officer mess with us?

303
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,210
Do you think you've won because you put cuffs on me? How would you like me to kill you?

304
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,620
How do you want to die?

305
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:54,290
Not that. Why did you do that to my mom and dad?

306
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:59,880
Why do you think? They are the same as you.

307
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,400
They annoyed me.

308
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,900
Do you know what your Dad said after he stole Ji Oh?

309
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,010
 He has the right to live as a human being. Please let him go so he can live an ordinary life.

310
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,590
 Where is the boy?

311
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,820
 Please stop. You must stop.

312
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,640
That arrogant bastard, how dare he lecture me?

313
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,650
So that's why you killed him? Because he annoyed you?

314
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,230
We are the ones who make history, and you guys are the vermin.

315
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,660
Don't you know what happens to vermin if it crawls onto a human body?

316
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,870
Follow them.

317
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,580
Do you think I was the only one there when your parents died?

318
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,260
Did you think your vengeance would be complete if you catch just me?

319
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,740
You are the one who will get hurt in the end.

320
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,580
If you want to live even a few days longer, run away right now and live quietly as if you were dead.

321
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,860
Don't die acting foolish like your Team Captain.

322
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,470
I will praise you for having come this far.

323
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,190
Undo my handcuffs.

324
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,970
Are there really more people besides you?

325
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:47,950
I am the one who killed them, but if you include those who let it happen, covered it up and falsified the events,

326
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,930
how many people do you think were involved?

327
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,320
I don't know. You tell me.

328
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,460
It will all be revealed when an official investigation begins.

329
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,920
Did you record this?

330
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,240
We killed Ha Yeong Jae!

331
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,500
We also killed Team Captain Choi!

332
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,630
Submit that to a court. See if it's admissible as evidence.

333
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,570
Try releasing that to the media. See if there is a single line ever written about it.

334
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,140
Do you know whose side they are all on?

335
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,720
I know that they are not on our side.

336
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,420
But while we have no power, we have tenacity.

337
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,460
So let's take this case to the end.

338
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,510
Let's see if your power or our tenacity prevails.

339
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,130
Seonbae, this is Gu Reum.

340
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,580
It's over? You got him?

341
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,140
I got him, and I recorded the proof of the crime.

342
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,570
For now, go to our meeting place. After visiting my mom's house to get the baby, I'll go there right away.

343
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,300
Let's go.

344
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,420
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

345
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,350
Okay, okay.

346
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,720
Car key.

347
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,060
You couldn't catch one person?

348
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,460
Go after them.

349
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,220
I will send you more people, so leave your location tracking on.

350
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:02,680
Did you see that? Whatever you do and wherever you are, we will always find you.

351
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,910
If you release me now, I will take care of the false accusation against you.

352
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,490
Make sure to run away well.

353
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:24,150
If you get caught, your daughter will be experimented on for the rest of her life, and she will die a miserable death.

354
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,610
Shut your damn mouth.

355
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,280
Is this the right place?

356
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,260
I will confirm it.

357
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,600
They are on their way here.

358
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,810
Seonbae.

359
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,100
Is that Kim Cheol Su?

360
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,800
What about the baby?

361
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,340
Baby, it's alright, Mom is here.

362
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,910
Was my baby doing well?

363
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:57,700
It's alright. You missed Mom, didn't you?

364
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,150
I think you missed her more.

365
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,710
Sleep well.

366
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,590
I got his confession.

367
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:16,360
It won't be easy to be admissible as evidence, but it should be enough as investigation material.

368
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,570
What about you?

369
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,120
How about turning yourself in? How long can you be on the run with a baby?

370
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,720
If I turn myself in but my name can't be cleared, what happens to the baby?

371
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,440
That's true. That's a problem, too.

372
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:43,040
Once Kim Cheol Su's investigation is complete, my name could be cleared.

373
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,410
I will wait until then.

374
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,450
Alright, let's give that a try.

375
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:54,840
I put some diapers, formula, baby clothes, and a little bit of money in there.

376
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,480
Don't go to motels or saunas. You should sleep in a clean place.

377
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,710
Seonbae, I will repay you many times more.

378
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:08,670
Of course you should. It's my emergency fund that I've scraped and saved without my wife knowing.

379
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,840
I'll take that guy in, so you take the baby and leave.

380
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,710
Yes, Seonbae.

381
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,920
Gu Reum!

382
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,180
- Take the baby and leave now. 
 - Seonbae.

383
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,400
I will stop him, so hurry and go.

384
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,020
Let's go.

385
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,030
- Hurry and look for her. 
 - Yes.

386
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,640
 Sharp Curve Ahead
 Slow Down

387
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,280
They are making me use my last bullet.

388
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:49,090
It's alright, it's alright.

389
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:28,960
♫  Your eyes, keep your heart  ♫

390
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,690
  -Don't go. 
 -I'm sorry.

391
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,930
 I'm grateful, and I loved you a lot.

392
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:35,810
 Don't go! You can't! I love you, Gu Reum.

393
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,260
 No!

394
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,180
 Make sure to run away well. If you get caught, your daughter will be experimented on for the rest of her life,

395
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,910
 and she will die a miserable death.

♫  in this life  ♫

397
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,240
You can wait just a little longer, can't you?

398
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,150
Mom will come to get you soon.

399
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:00,830
So don't cry, and wait a little longer.

400
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,870
Okay?

401
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:14,300
Let's not get caught by those people, even if we die.

402
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:20,880
So make sure to stay hidden well.

Bingo.

419
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,120
We got her. We will bring her in.

420
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,310
You should not do this.

421
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,160
Where is the baby, Gu Reum?

422
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,120
Far away.

423
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,030
Far away where?

424
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,470
I don't know. I sent her very far away.

425
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:55,020
Everything is finished now. We can finally create our world.

426
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:12,000
I really liked your eyes in the past.

427
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,480
A puppy who longed for someone to touch him, even though he was scared to death.

428
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,350
That's how your eyes looked.

429
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,770
That look in your eyes has disappeared.

430
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,760
I was scared of everything.

431
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,500
Because I was different from others, but that's no longer true.

432
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,010
There is no reason that I have to become like others.

433
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,600
I know. I know it all.

434
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,630
But Ji Oh, I am scared more of people who have nothing to fear.

435
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:38,030
People like that are the people who ruin this world, in the end.

436
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,180
The world is already ruined.

437
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:45,600
I can't fix it, but I can give hope that things could get better.

438
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,080
That is what I want, and that is why people like me are needed.

439
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,660
Is that so wrong?

440
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,820
Consider what it means to clone humans.

441
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:58,260
You are cloning your rage. People should never be born due to rage.

442
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:02,050
I am not a complete human anyway.

443
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:04,940
And that is why I liked you.

444
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,430
Because you were incomplete.

445
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,500
Because I could fill what you didn't have.

446
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,920
So Ji Oh,

447
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,240
please come back.

448
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:44,070
You are the one who left. You come back.

449
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,140
Ji Oh.

450
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,310
Don't speak. We can go to the hospital.

451
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,640
Two... one... two...

452
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,320
I...

453
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,710
I... came back.

454
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,480
I would like for us to leave now.

455
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,820
Don't say anything. Don't.

456
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,490
Don't. Don't!

457
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,890
This crazy...

458
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:03,680
Okay.

459
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,530
Why did you do that?

460
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:23,370
Hold on... hold on...

461
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,740
Why did you do that!?

462
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:33,420
Because you're worth a lot of money.

463
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:45,730
Have you ever felt pain here before?

464
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:51,690
No, no... don't do it.

465
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,500
I know this for certain now.

466
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:03,910
A human is not a righteous existence.
