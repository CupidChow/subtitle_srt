 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning

00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,330
♫    Voice to me.  ♫

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,930
♫   Find tree.  ♫

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,170
♫  Please let me sleep on it,  ♫

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,040
♫   So I can breathe in.  ♫

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,270
 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:36,620
 This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual names, places, organizations, religious references, and incidents is entirely coincidental.

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,870
 The episode was filmed with adequate accommodations to ensure the safety and the emotional well-being of the infant and minor actors used.

9
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,390
 Previously   
 You're always off to somewhere alone. Each time you use your electricity, you lose your memories.

10
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,300
  It was me who set that fire.

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,370
 Don't do it!

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,720
 Ji Oh is our first successful prototype. As such, he was to give away his cells.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,850
  And as the last universal common ancestor he was to go extinct for the greater good.

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,800
 If you see him again, you've got to keep him with you at all costs. He isn't human.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,900
 If you're the bad guy, this will all come to an end. With you, I'm not so sure.

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,200
 About Professor Oh, it was your doing, right?

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,360
 This is only the beginning. If you don't show up, I'm going to kill everyone you know.

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,510
 I'm your father.

19
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,070
 You're my son.

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,060
 The more I see him, the more his eyes look just like mine.

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,430
 - Gu Reum, it's time to let go. 
 - I'll continue with my investigation.

22
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,030
 The maximum voltage your body handles is the total voltage you can produce.

23
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,500
 We need surrogate mothers. Can you have them ready?

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,890
 That isn't anything a human can do.

25
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,760
 That's what faith does.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,030
 You're more superior than anyone.  Run.

27
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,760
 Don't you have a reason to live?

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,370
 Live to find the answer to that question.

29
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,970
 That arm is mine!

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,130
 Episode 7

31
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:08,910

32
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,040
Team Leader! Are you alright?

33
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,550
You're hurt. Let me see.

34
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,950
Didn't I tell you to stay outside?

35
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,210
Can't we just stop?

36
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,890
Get out of my way.

37
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,430
Can't we run away, too? Why must we always fight to death?

38
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,820
We get paid for it.

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,070
Okay. I'll take the lead.

40
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,280
Ji- Ji Oh.

41
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,760
Ji Oh—

42
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,980
Ji—

43
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,200
Ji Oh. Ji Oh.

44
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,630
Why are you?  What happened to you?

45
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,030
Let's get out of here first.

46
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,830
I can't. I have to find someone.

47
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,170
Later. At this rate, we'll all die from the fumes.

48
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,980
I must find him.

49
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,280
- I can't leave until I find him. 
 - Come on, Ji Oh.

50
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,500
He knows everything. He is Ryu Jung Kwon.

51
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,040
Aren't you dead yet?

52
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,610
People don't die that easily.

53
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,040
I see, you aren't  a human either.

54
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,070
What's all this? You, crazy bastards.

55
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,130
Ji Oh. Stop it!

56
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,700
Ji Oh.

57
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,530
Come on, wake up.

58
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,140
 Human Tech

59
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,160
 Limited Access

60
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,700
Run away.

61
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,650
Don't say that.

62
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,400
We're going to the hospital. Just hang in there a little longer.

63
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,550
Run away.

64
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,410
You must not get caught.

65
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,840
Just go anywhere.

66
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,070
I'll find you.

67
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Where's a doctor? Where's a doctor?

68
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,310
Please come this way.

69
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,650
Take that gauze off.

70
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,850
- Maybe it's a dent in her skull? Prepare a CT now. 
 - Yes.

71
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,500
Are you her guardian? Please wait outside.

72
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,500
Please, don't let her die.

73
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,610
Please save her.

74
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,510
I beg of you. Please save her.

75
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,430
Please let her live.

76
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,220
Team Leader?

77
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,180
Team Leader!

78
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,850
Team Leader!!

79
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,380
Team Leader, Team Leader.

80
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,870
I told you to stay outside.

81
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,650
Okay, so let's get out of here together.

82
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,550
Find that bastard. He's probably in here.

83
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,970
Let's get out of here first.

84
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm sure he's still in here.

85
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,900
Let's just leave! Why is that important now?

86
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,910
Find him. Find him, I'm telling you.

87
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,090
The injury is quite deep, but not to the point of denting her skull.

88
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,230
But here, there is a slight fracture.

89
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,540
I don't see any brain hemorrhage, but there is a possibility of delayed hemorrhage.

90
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,930
Is it something dangerous?

91
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,810
It rarely happens, but it's best to closely monitor her for a while.

92
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,480
- How long?
 - When she wakes, I'll tell you what her  prognosis is.

93
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,830
Now, you can wait outside.

94
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,040
I'm sorry.

95
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,410
I'm sorry.

96
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,880
Are you sure he escaped? Did you look everywhere?

97
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,910
Stop whining about where you're hurt. Just watch for him! This is no time for a fancy hospital for you jerks!

98
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,660
I'm told a detective came in. Along with Ji Oh—

99
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,490
Do you realize how much money I invested in you?

100
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,750
All that money is gone.  Vaporized! So, shut up!

101
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,650
You lost it all. And yet, you have the gall to talk!

102
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,970
I'll clean up the mess myself.

103
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,170
How much money did you spend?

104
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,380
Not even a hundred billion won. ($90 million)

105
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,440
Imagine making a thing like Ji Oh and get it out in the world.

106
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,810
Your followers will be eager to bring all their money to you, calling the thing the Angel's child or even, its envoy.

107
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,540
Never mind a few hundred million wons.  In no time, you can get a few trillions off them.

108
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,660
With that money, you could buy off the media and even get political clout. How wonderful that'd be.

109
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,560
Will you throw away the whole thing just because of one kid acting wild?

110
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,290
If not me, who's going to clean up the mess, Spiritual Leader?

111
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,370
Why can't you see my loyalty to you?

112
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,220
Don't you dare talk about  loyalty.

113
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,540
Wow, that really hurts.

114
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,880
The life style you enjoy so much,

115
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,280
and the position you have now are all thanks to me.

116
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,890
That's why I'm loyal to you.

117
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,600
Or should we kill them all now and call it quits?

118
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,470
Just living as a plain cult leader is what you want?

119
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,150
Have you lost your mind because I let you hit me once? Do you think I'm a joke?

120
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,850
If I thought you were a joke, would I have been loyal to you?

121
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,620
You still have the frozen embryos, don't you?

122
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,450
Dr. Ryu, you're a man of sense. You probably knew you'd die when the research was over.

123
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,590
Of course, I did.

124
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,120
I'm the only one who's survived out of all my colleagues.

125
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,650
So you must have an insurance and still have the frozen embryos, right?

126
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,930
Of course. Having backup is a given for any research.

127
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,310
All we have to do is to find and kill Ji Oh and the cop.

128
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,230
And we can regroup the researchers and the lab to start again.

129
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,390
And you just have to get money out of your followers and fund the experiment.

130
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,550
If you have other ways for the cleanup, tell me. I'm at your service.

131
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,810
Go.

132
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:09,120
Go and clean up. We need to  take what we can from the lab somehow.

133
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,790
Let's go.

134
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,160
I'll see you later then.

135
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,020
That cocky bastard.

136
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,970
Whose hand will you take? Hers or mine?

137
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,630
Not sure.

138
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,420
You should've decided that by now.

139
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:54,150
To do all the things I want, I'll have to take the hand of the one more ambitious of the two.

140
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,810
Then you should take my hand.

141
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,060
About the frozen embryos, open just one, and I'll manage the rest.

142
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,700
What do you plan to do with them?

143
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,030
What else? Sell them and make money.

144
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,410
Was I too straightforward with my answer?

145
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:18,450
Should I have said, "For the world peace?",  or something along that line?

146
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,970
Of all the time I've known you,

147
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,420
this is the most honest I've seen you.

148
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,650
Work with me. In return, I'll put word out there for you.

149
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,800
Ryu Jung Kwon, the ultimate scientist of Korea just created a new human race.

150
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,490
The Supreme Creator.

151
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,910
When my creations come out in the world,  the present human race will go extinct.

152
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,260
Just as all Neanderthals got obliterated and only Homo Sapiens survived.

153
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,860
People don't die that easily. We're a species of such tenacity.

154
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,940
You're just being naive, Dr. Ryu.

155
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,560
Who called the reporters?

156
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,680
I wouldn't know. I just rolled out of bed, and I'm here.

157
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,610
- What about Gu Reum?
 - Her phone is turned off.

158
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,080
 Just a moment. Keep off.

159
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,960
 Just a moment.

160
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,300
What just happened here?

161
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,890
I know, right?

162
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,500
Team Captain, I'm told we have a witness. There.

163
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,200
- Is he the one? 
 - Yes, he's the sole survivor.

164
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,980
- You take charge here. You ride with him on the ambulance. Let's meet later at the hospital.
 - Yes, sir.

165
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,300
Call Gu Reum, and if she answers, tell her to come to the scene right away.

166
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,180
Yes, sir.

167
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,480
 An intruder broke into Human Tech Biotechnology lab which conducts research for the national government.

168
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,440
 Eleven people including the researchers and the security officers were found dead.

169
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,280
 And one sustained injury.

170
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,410
 The injured researcher pointed to a police officer as the culprit.

171
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,480
 The police officer in question can't be reached at the moment.

172
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,650
  and is said to be in hiding.

173
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:04,930
 The police suspect the culprit targeted the industrial secrets that were being investigated by the state-conrolled lab

174
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,260
 but the culprit was caught in the act of committing the crime.

175
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,840
 The police are focusing on  who is behind the incident and his whereabouts.

176
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,880
 Patient ID A2840: Hanuel Ae Gu Reum 
 DOB: 11/28/1988   Date of Admittance: 5/18/2020: Blood type: O

177
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,780
Is this the police? We need you here quickly.

178
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,510
 Security alert

179
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,520
- Sir, please. You aren't supposed to do that.  
- Sir, what are you doing?

180
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,720
- Please get out of the way. 
 - What are you doing? Who are you to move the patient?

181
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,520
- I beg of you. Get out of the way. 
 - You shouldn't be doing that.

182
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,620
- Make way!
 - Get the police! Quickly!

183
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,320
Gu Reum!

184
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,990
Ji Oh.

185
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,350
Are you awake? Are you alright?

186
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,240
No. Where am I?

187
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,390
Now here is...

188
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,130
You trust me, right?

189
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,270
No, I don't.

190
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,150
Let's go.

191
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,470
All of your colleagues died. How can you eat at a time like this?

192
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,930
Then, should I not eat and die, too?

193
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,520
Go on and eat.

194
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,480
Did you get that female police officer?

195
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,080
You'd better get her quickly. She's a murderer.

196
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,950
- We just ran away without paying the hospital, didn't we?
 - Yeah.

197
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,110
Anyhow, why were you there?

198
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,340
I was brought there by force.

199
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,820
I met my father there.

200
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,120
Father? You mean your real father?

201
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,320
I don't know. He said he was my father.

202
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,280
He's been the one who sent people to chase me all this time.

203
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,800
Why did he do that?

204
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,280
To kill me.

205
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,120
- And he calls himself a father?
 - I guess.

206
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,620
But he told me to stay alive.

207
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,680
What do you mean? Didn't you say he tried to kill you?

208
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,650
Ji Oh, come here.

209
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,380
-Why?
-I'm wondering if you're talking nonsense because you hurt your head.

210
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,810
You're the one who got hurt. And it's my fault.

211
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,900
I know. And I remember you going wild back in there.

212
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,660
Drop me off at the police station.

213
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,760
No, actually let's go back to the lab.

214
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,340
I'll request backup there and ransack the place top to bottom.

215
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,230
You should go hide somewhere safe. We'll meet again later.

216
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,740
I'll get the man who calls himself as your father and question him. And I'll let you know.

217
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,480
For now, don't think about anything.

218
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,040
I can't.

219
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,280
You can't do what?

220
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,860
I can't let you go anywhere.

221
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,130
What are you talking about?

222
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,680
Do you trust the police?

223
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,190
How can I not? I'm one of them.

224
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,690
I don't trust the police.

225
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,010
Well, I don't trust  you . Let's go.

226
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,220
I said, let's go.

227
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,380
Just stay with me for a few days.

228
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,500
Should I drive?

229
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,710
You've become a murderer.

230
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,500
The news says you're the one who killed the people at the lab.

231
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,340
I didn't run away because of the hospital bill.

232
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,210
I ran because I was afraid someone might report us upon seeing the news.

233
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,030
Where are you going?

234
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,580
To the police station. So move, I'm going to drive.

235
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,550
-Gu Reum.
-I said, get out of my way.

236
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,820
You didn't kill those people at the lab.

237
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:50,220
Who knows, I might've killed them. If you're going to be falsely accused, I'll just turn myself in.

238
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,780
I can't let you become a murderer.

239
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,630
I'm a police officer. I can get myself out of this mess.

240
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,650
I didn't do anything on the first floor. Yet all the dead bodies were found there.

241
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,730
The lab in the basement wasn't even in the news.

242
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,170
If you go there now, you'll get screwed.  You'll walk right into their trap while you know.

243
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,760
What does the media know, anyway?

244
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,500
Don't underestimate the police. If the crime scene was tampered with, they'd know it right away.

245
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,910
This happened only yesterday.

246
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,210
Overnight, they manipulated  the crime scene and framed you as the murderer.

247
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,030
They aren't humans, but monsters. Who knows what they're capable of.

248
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,170
Then what do you want me to do? Just do nothing?

249
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,410
When I'm pinned as a murderer, hiding with you for a few days won't solve anything for me.

250
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,320
Start with what you're good at.

251
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,760
What's that?

252
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,750
Understanding the circumstance.

253
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,880
S-sorry. I thought this was my place.

254
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,770
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

255
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,150
This  is  my place.

256
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,420
Who are you? Huh?

257
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,220
You're late tonight.

258
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,960
You took my phone and even my car.

259
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,320
Ji Oh, so I was desperate and went to the police station to report my car stolen.

260
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,980
I was asked to bring my vehicle registration and the proof of insurance. So I came back home,

261
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,210
and began frantically looking for them. But I couldn't find them.

262
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,660
But when I thought about it,

263
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,560
I realized I'd left the registration and the proof of insurance in my car.

264
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,350
So I had to go back to the station, the last place where I wanted to be.

265
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,280
They asked if my car might've got towed for illegal parking,

266
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,990
or if someone I knew might be driving it.

267
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:00,080
So I left there having answered the flurry of questions and called my insurance company.

268
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,670
I was asked again if I parked illegally.

269
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,590
or if someone I knew was driving. The same questions all over again!

270
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,910
Like a broken record, all because of you, punk.

271
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,850
After all that you did, don't you have any shame to show up here again?

272
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,950
We agreed not to see each other, remember? Do you think I'm a pushover?

273
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,480
Of course, I'm a sucker. Look at that. You even brought your girlfrend here.

274
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,110
You think this is a motel, huh?

275
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,890
Well, enjoy your stay and come again!

276
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,150
-I'm not his girlfriend. 
-What are you then?

277
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,240
- I'm a cop.
 - A cop?

278
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,670
You? Really?

279
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,350
She  is  a cop. I swear.

280
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,170
So she is. A police.

281
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,160
I came because he said you were his close friend. Sorry for troubling you.

282
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,040
Not at all. You can trouble me anytime you want.

283
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,730
To tell you the truth, I'm Ji Oh's best friend.

284
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,170
I meant it in good ways, of course.

285
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,230
Ji Oh, you're not spending the night here, are you?

286
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,650
No, we aren't. We'll just look up a few things, make a few calls and leave.

287
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,640
Oh no, you're welcome to stay the night here.

288
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,910
Anyhow, what did you do for you to turn and run as you did?

289
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,030
What, do you have a case against you that's being suspended?

290
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,250
No, no, definitely not.

291
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,730
I swear I'm a good, productive member of the society.

292
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,880
Did you eat? Hey, Ji Oh, are the ramen noodles almost done?

293
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,390
Make them chewy.

294
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,630
You like your noodles chewy, right?

295
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,220
-Yes.
-That's good to hear.

296
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,670
- Get up, please. 
- Oh, yes.

297
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,860
Chewy, very chewy.

298
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,370
Wow, detective.

299
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,500
How could you look so beautiful even in my clothes?

300
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,940
Please have some. The noodles are nice and chewy.

301
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,110
Once all the equipment arrives, I'll do a full body examination on you.

302
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,840
So for the time being, don't overexert yourself and rest.

303
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,250
That's a hand that's done a lot of hard labor.

304
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,220
Don't mention it.

305
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,970
You did  work hard.

306
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,000
In spite of your injury, did you move all the dead bodies to the first floor

307
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,220
and trouble yourself to close off the lab as well?

308
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,800
No, this girl here did everything.

309
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,130
How loyal you are.

310
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,420
I understand you work under Director Kim, right?

311
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,210
I also heard it's you, Team Leader, who captured Ji Oh.

312
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,650
Yes, that's right.

313
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,980
I saw the profiles of the two of you.

314
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,690
While seving in the army, you killed people and for that, you were sentenced to life.

315
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:55,010
And Director Kim came to your rescue. Correct?

316
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,480
- Yes, that's correct. 
 - Are you satisfied?

317
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,590
Satisfied in what ways, please?

318
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,920
Of course, I mean with your future.

319
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,860
There's no way you're satisfied with your present life.

320
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,830
I'm not sure about the future because it isn't here yet.

321
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,750
Going forward, you two, work under me.

322
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:22,340
Report to me whatever Director Kim asks you to do, and ultimately, you'll do what I ask you to do.

323
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,750
Why should I do that?

324
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,210
Because I will give you two things.

325
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,550
First, I'll tell you how you two became murderers.

326
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:37,500
Second, I'll give you each one thing you want to have.

327
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,070
Be it a thing or a person.

328
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:52,590
 The traces of Lieutenant Ha's money transactions led to a substantial fund in a foreign bank account.

329
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,960
 The joint forces of the prosecution and the police looked into the account, and concluded

330
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,530
  that Lieutenant Ha  entered Human Tech to steal industrial secrets.

331
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,620
 The investigation is being expedited

332
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,570
 I don't know where she got it.

333
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,310
 She brought with her the personnel records of the former employees.

334
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,050
 She demanded to know where they were and inquired about their finances.

335
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,950
 Even though I let her know they left the company, she kept coming back and ransacked our office.

336
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,720
 The research staff went on to say Lieutenant Ha, under the pretext of investigation

337
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,630
 visited Human Tech several times.

338
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:25,960
 The last time she sneaked into the lab, she was recognized by the research staff.

339
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,930
 Hence, she resorted to murdering the people.

340
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,390
 She is a police officer who took away the lives of eleven people.

341
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,960
 And the public's opinion of her is cold and critical.

342
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,690
They wrote the news really well. It sounds all true.

343
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,880
All their comments lined up with the graphics. How professional.

344
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,570
Let's eat something. You haven't eaten anything today.

345
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,430
I should eat. That way I can get my brain to work.

346
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,390
I'm fine. Okay, really.

347
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,980
I feel as if I'm almost there.

348
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,920
They aren't doing this to catch me.

349
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,090
They're placing the blame on me in order to hide the lab in the basement.

350
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,500
I just need to locate the lab and show it to the world.

351
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,720
They've done everything to manipulate the case. But once people learn there's the lab, it's over.

352
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,220
It's nothing.

353
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,420
They couldn't have left the lab down there still. What if they cleaned it out?

354
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:17,390
Even if the evidence is gone, its trace remains, and that trace becomes evidence.

355
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,150
I'm good at looking for things like that.

356
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,710
-It's too easy? 
 -It is.

357
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,940
Anything that's too easy could be dangerous. I just don't want you to be in danger.

358
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,810
Is there anything more dangerous than being framed for murdering eleven people?

359
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,410
You dying.

360
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,670
I'm sure you're going to talk about the lab to anyone who's willing to listen.

361
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:47,710
Most likely, no one's going to act on it. And you'll go there by yourself. What if that's precisely what they want?

362
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,440
If I'm scared of that, I can't do anything.

363
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,400
You said your father was there.

364
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:58,370
I'll know why you live like this, and what happened to my mom and dad all at once.

365
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:01,650
I guess you'll know then why your dad took me as well.

366
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:06,510
Of course. Aren't you curious, too, why you came to my house?

367
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:11,630
  He tried to sell you off. Then he set the lab on fire and took you away.

368
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:17,190
 Because you were special and much coveted as a living and breathing being to be experimented on.

369
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:21,200
- Let's just leave. 
- What are you  saying?

370
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,570
Can we just put everything behind and leave?  Wherever that is.

371
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,520
Are you crazy or acting crazy?

372
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,360
It took me over ten years to come this far in search of my mom and dad.

373
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,120
Isn't it enough that you suffered for ten years? You can stop now.

374
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,750
How can I stop?

375
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,770
I've lived in a dark room my whole life.

376
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,180
I felt my way around in the dark and barely  found the switch.

377
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,340
When all I need to do is just turn it on, you're telling me to run?

378
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,780
When you turn on the switch, what if the room is hell and isn't the world you hoped for?

379
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,170
When the truth is ugly,  it's better to live with the misunderstanding.

380
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,480
You live like that. In the dark, for all eternity.

381
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,790
No matter how ugly the truth is, I'm going to turn on the switch and get a good look at it.

382
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,590
I can do this. Yes, I can.

383
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,730
- Hello, this is 911 emergency.
 -  Oh, no, no, nothing.

384
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,770
Damn it, do  you have to pick it up so quick?

385
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,720
Do you think this is your problem alone?

386
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:49,600
This is our problem.

387
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,710
You and I are not us.

388
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,420
I'm still a police officer, and you're still a murder suspect.

389
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:01,010
Then arrest me. I did all that happened in the lab. Why aren't you arresting me?

390
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,750
Why aren't you running away?

391
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,830
Because If I run, I fear I may never get caught by you again.

392
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,380
Run away. I don't need you anymore.

393
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,480
But wherever you run, I'll catch you, for sure.

394
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,770
That's what I do.

395
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,260
Damn it. I don't care.

396
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,110
What are you doing?

397
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,900
Why? What, what?

398
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,680
  Hello?

399
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,580
 Hello?

400
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,250
 How may I help you? This is 911 emergency.

401
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:09,130
It's not what you think. A friend of mine works there, and I just wanted to say hello.

402
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,730
Clearly, you two are friends and exactly the same.

403
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,120
The kind of people that I want to trust, but I can't.

404
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,350
Give me the phone.

405
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,700
Hey, hey, hey, you bastard!

406
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,690
I signed a two-year contract for this! How many times did you do to me?

407
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,560
Water, water!

408
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,400
I've never asked you to trust me.

409
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,610
I wouldn't have even if you did.

410
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,790
- Then you can't be betrayed by me.  
 - What?

411
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,530
When there's no trust, there's no betrayal.

412
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:06,170
-There's no way Gu Reum would've done something like this.
-The evidence is irrefutable. What can we do?

413
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:09,070
All of you, focus on finding Gu Reum.

414
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:14,640
I'm just saying it's strange. We haven't even started our investigation, but the reporters know everything already.

415
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,860
Don't you feel as if the media is directing the course of our investigation?

416
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,700
So? Are you going to do what the media tells you to do?

417
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,150
-Of course not.
-Then why are you bothered with the media?

418
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:27,240
Why are you g- getting angry with me?

419
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,520
Didn't I tell you to look after  that junior detective? Do I have to do everything around here?

420
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,820
Anyhow, Team Captain, this case left our jurisdiction. Is it okay for us to conduct our own investigation?

421
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:42,640
No matter what anyone says, Gu Reum was on my team. If anyone catches her, it'll be me.

422
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,800
All of you, go out there and find her.

423
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,360
-Yes. 
 -Yes, Sir.

424
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,400
 Juan Metropolitan Police Agency

425
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,020
But why do you think Gu Reum did what she did?

426
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,060
How can anyone know what other people think?

427
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,180
- Do you know Gu Reum was looking for someone?
- Someone, who?

428
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,930
Ryu Jung Kwon. She said he was a mad scientist.

429
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:07,370
According to her, the man was related to Human Tech.

430
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:18,980
In other words, what she targeted wasn't Human Tech, but Ryu Jung Kwon.

431
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,770
I'm not sure. Who knows she might've misled all of us.

432
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,050
 Unknown caller

433
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,110
-Hello? 
 -Team Captain, it's me.

434
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,490
-Gu Reum? 
 -Yes.

435
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,040
You brat, did you eat?

436
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,750
I have a favor to ask of you. I trust no one, but you now.

437
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,480
Okay. Trust me.

438
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,320
Get officially investigated, and I'll help you with what I can under the law.

439
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,720
I didn't do it.

440
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,380
Hence, undergo an official investigation and prove your innocence. What are you doing hiding?

441
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,850
There's something I want to show you.

442
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,300
Show what? Just show your face.

443
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,530
At the research center, there's a huge lab that even the building diagram doesn't show.

444
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:06,180
In there, I saw animals and babies, too.

445
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,800
What are you talking about? We scanned the crime scene top to bottom.

446
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,200
I saw it myself and the secret pathway to it, as well.

447
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,320
Okay, I'll go back there and look. In the meantime, I need you to return to the station.

448
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,530
Don't let yourself get caught by anyone. If anyone catches you, let that be me.

449
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,500
Come with me to see the basement.

450
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,940
- Right now? 
 - See it with your own eyes.

451
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,790
Call the investigators and reporters there tomorrow and let them see.

452
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:29,150
Since we don't know how we will extricate ourselves,  we'd better end the whole thing with one shot.

453
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,520
Okay.  Where should we meet?

454
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,950
On the first floor at Human Tech. Someone could be tailing you, so be careful.

455
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:40,550
Listen to you, do you know how many years I've been on the force? You're like shoveling in front of  a forklift crane.

456
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,300
It's  you  who need to be careful.

457
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,770
It's me.

458
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,780
Did Ha Gu Reum call you?

459
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,840
  Yes, we're supposed to meet.

460
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,220
 She suggested getting a good look at the facility in the basement.

461
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,310
You know the police folks are simpletons.  Of course, except you, Team Captain.

462
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,890
What should I do?

463
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:28,120
I'll support you with my guys. Bring her in. If she isn't willing, kill her.

464
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,590
Do we need to go that far?

465
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,590
Why should  you  decide whether we need to, or not? When she even figured out who Ryu Jung Kwon is,

466
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:42,130
there is no guarantee she can't find out about the people you murdered in the past, is there?

467
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
Understood, Sir.

468
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,350
If she won't cooperate, I'll kill her.

469
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,120
Team Captain.

470
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,400
Are you here?

471
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,450
You came.

472
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:04,960
What a fine world do we live in? The youngest on the team gets to order around the Team Captain.

473
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,120
I apologize, Team Captain.

474
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,000
For what?

475
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,290
What are you sorry for?

476
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,390
For this? Or, for that?

477
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:25,390
Or, for killing, or running away? What are you sorry for?

478
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,950
You know well it wasn't me.

479
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:30,430
So I told you not to do anything.

480
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,960
Why won't you listen?

481
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,530
I'll prove what I said with the proof.

482
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,030
It's here.

483
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:42,890
This is the secret entrance to the elevator that goes down there.

484
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,970
It was here–

485
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:52,080
Just a minute.

486
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,700
It was definitely here.

487
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,300
This door opened.

488
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,860
Stop it.

489
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,800
It won't open now.

490
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:21,730
Even if you do, there's nothing inside.

491
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,540
They cleaned up everything without a trace.

492
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,200
Team Captain.

493
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,220
Do you remember?

494
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,820
I told you never to be caught whatever you do.

495
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,890
And I told you I wouldn't be able to protect you, if you did.

496
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,810
Team Captain.

497
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:48,180
You just got found out.

498
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,390
It's your fault.

499
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,070
Don't make me take out my gun. Let's just go.

500
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,910
Why are being like this, Team Captain? What–

501
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,200
What is this?

502
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,170
I'm sorry.

503
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,390
Let me live, too.

504
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,490
You won't be able to get yourself free of the murder charge. Basically, it's like your trial is over, and you stand guilty.

505
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:26,420
Be it the government, or the National Assembly, or the judiciary. There's no place his hand can't reach.

506
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,780
Please, don't be like this.

507
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:34,090
People like us can never win.

508
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,240
Come with me and just tell him where Ji Oh is. That's the only way you live.

509
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,350
Won't you come?

510
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,400
Got it.

511
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,390
I'll be outside.

512
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,880
Team Captain.

513
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,880
Team Captain. Team Captain!

514
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,390
Team Captain.

515
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:54,720
I tried to save you.

516
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,150
But you chose this.

517
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,080
Ji Oh.

518
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,530
Let's go.

519
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,120
This life. Damn it.

520
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:04,790
It's me. Starting now, comb through all  the CCTVs in the area beginning with Human Tech.

521
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,430
Why the CCTVs all of sudden?

522
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,310
Where are you now?

523
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,170
Gu Reum?

524
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:17,370
 The so-called Lieutenant Ha's case is getting cold.

525
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:21,900
 Last night, Lieutenant Ha is known to have confided to her colleague her wish to surrender.

526
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,970
 When the colleague came trusting her words, she battered him,

527
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:28,010
 and she stole his gun with live bullets and ran away.

528
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:31,060
 The joint forces of the police and the prosecution have decided that she poses  a flight  threat,

529
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,320
 and hence, they're going to reveal her identity.

530
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,070
 Her full name is Haneul Ae Gu Reum

531
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:39,500
 The police released her picture and urged the cooperation of the public.

532
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,380
  The rapidity of making the decision to reveal her identity is unprecedented.

533
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,490
Don't ever put your life on the line for me again.

534
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,350
Because I don't intend to die on your behalf.

535
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,630
And,

536
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,050
thanks.

537
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,430
I'll go and wash my hands.

538
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:32,040
It's 5-402. Check the CCTV.

539
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,680
Just have a look when I tell you to.

540
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,700
Since this is the spot where they disappeared, they'll be somewhere in the footage.

541
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,690
Sit, sit.

542
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,900
How nice for you. I really envy you.

543
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,020
For what?

544
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,920
You have no friend like me.

545
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,420
Thanks.

546
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,560
That wasn't what I hoped to hear.

547
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,400
I hoped you'd say, "So long." Or, "Take care, and we'll never see each other again." Something along that line.

548
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,730
I just need to crash with you for a few days.

549
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:06,000
Ji Oh, I'm not sure they're them. But I hear they know where I live.

550
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,230
Don't you remember the time they came here? They practically destroyed everything in here.

551
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:12,300
I just need to stay here for a few days. What should I do when I have nowhere to go?

552
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,380
Until when do you intend to hang out with that murderer?

553
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:20,890
You could run away to the place alone and hide there forever. Then, you don't have to come back here ever.

554
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,880
To that place? What place?

555
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,860
Right, you don't remember the place. Of course, you don't.

556
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:32,200
That was your most favorite place.

557
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,080
The place where we worked together.

558
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,860
Yes, yes.

559
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:09,040
I checked the CCTV back there and confirmed this  building was where they were seen the last time.

560
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,420
- Did you look into this one as well? 
 - No, not yet.

561
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,240
Go ahead, have a look.

562
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,910
I'll make the call for you. You just go.

563
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,800
I promise I'll make the call.

564
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,890
If you didn't snatch up my phone, I could make the call right away.

565
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,370
So, were we there before?

566
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:36,910
Ji Oh, would I lie just to get you off my back?

567
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:43,000
Please go. I just don't want to get tangled up with you anymore.

568
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,450
Let's go.

569
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,910
How about that one?

570
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,200
I confirmed they came in here. We'll go door to door.

571
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,430
- Did you look at the electricity boxes in the other places?
 - Yes.

572
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:13,020
With the exception of 301, it appears all the residents are inside their units.

573
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,700
- How about the backup? 
 - I'm told they'll be here soon.

574
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:21,300
You keep watch here. And you, come with me.

575
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,230
Yes, hello?

576
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,120
Run quick!

577
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,240
We can slip past them, Gu Reum.

578
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,990
They're my colleagues.

579
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,610
Do you still consider them as such?

580
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,670
- Come quickly.
 - Follow me.

581
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:15,170
Go ahead and block that entrance, first.

582
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,860
And you, go to that corner.

583
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,960
Hey.

584
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,200
Go over there.

585
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,070
Let's go.

586
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:15,020
It's good that we have a few rooms in here.

587
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:19,420
Here's better than the lab in the basement, right? You have the window, too.

588
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,020
There aren't any windows in my room.

589
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:24,010
Hang in there a little. I'll move you to a better place.

590
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:26,020
Is there anything else you need?

591
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,030
Nothing.

592
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:32,480
Let's work towards your quick recovery.

593
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,930
It's not legal for you to get sick for long when there's so much to do.

594
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,530
What a load of crap.

595
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,660
Just leave them there. I'll organize them later.

596
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,360
You saying that aggravates me more than he does.

597
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:17,230
What are we doing in this sacred temple? It's not like science just threw itself in the arms of God.

598
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:21,250
What about the fertilized eggs?

599
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:26,100
After three weeks of incubaton,  we'll implant them inside the surrogates.

600
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:30,600
Do you know why we don't build a separate lab, and instead, squeeze it in here that's way too small as is?

601
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,330
Because the Spiritual Leader no longer trusts us.

602
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:38,130
She wants everything within her reach and watch it closely.

603
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,730
Don't you agree?

604
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:43,610
I don't care as long as I can research and experiment.

605
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,950
This is why I like you, Dr. Ryu.

606
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,740
You have an ambition, but not a desire.

607
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,000
What about the rest of the fertilized eggs?

608
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,730
At the end of the three-week incubation, and once the eggs start their differentiation, I'll hand you the rest.

609
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,800
How are you doing looking for Ji Oh?

610
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:07,760
You do just what you need to do. I'll kill those two.

611
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,060
What are you going to do? You have nowhere to go, right?

612
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,060
Yeah.

613
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,950
No matter how hard I think, I can't think of a place to go to.

614
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:29,920
Worse, I don't know whom I should see.

615
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:34,980
Besides, I'm at a loss as to where I should start solving the case.

616
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:38,760
I'm clueless, and that frustrates me.

617
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,930
Come with me.

618
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:44,020
Where to?

619
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,070
Anywhere.

620
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:51,030
Just come with me.

621
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:59,290
♫  Your eyes, keep your heart.  ♫

622
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:03,750
♫  The hidden shadow  ♫

623
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,950
Let's go.

624
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:15,020
♫  The light shining through the night  ♫

625
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,450
♫  In this life  ♫

626
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,820
 This was your most favorite place.

627
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,330
 This is where we worked together. 
♫  Sunk into the sadness  ♫

628
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,920
 Seowoon Ranch?

629
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,060
 The owner of that farm liked us a lot. He said we were good workers.  
♫  Close your eyes.  ♫

630
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:35,160
 But I had to work so hard alone because you went into town and never returned. 
♫  so that I won't disappear  ♫

631
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,160
 He'll be happy to see you.

632
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,400
♫  Hold my hand  ♫

633
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,530
♫  so I am not afraid.  ♫

634
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:52,600
♫  Let me hold you in my arms.  ♫

635
01:01:52,600 --> 01:02:01,000
♫  I hope we can stay together.  ♫

636
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,950
♫  We don't have to run away  ♫

637
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:12,620
♫  like now.  ♫

638
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,160
♫  Your heart.  ♫

639
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,490
 L.U.C.A.: The Beginning

640
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:18,800
 Live here with me.

641
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,890
 Looks like I have to go back. I just heard someone died again because of me.

642
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:26,220
 At the end of ten months, all three of you will receive eternal life  as the mothers of the angels.

643
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,400
 I'm positive I put them in here.

644
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,390
 You're the only one who knows. Where did they go?

645
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:30,660
 Get her.

646
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,950
 - Sir. 
 - Really, where are you now?

647
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:34,220
 Can you get me  a sample DNA of the bone remains?

648
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,520
 Can't you just forget? 
 Alien Registration Card: Li Xuenan  - Jin Fenggilo

649
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,360
 You must hang on.

650
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,650
 I haven't seen her  yet.

651
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:38,700
 Keep watching.

652
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,030
 The accident happened because of the high voltage electricity.

653
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:44,540
 I won't let you live the way I do even if that means I have to destroy this world  and make a new one.

654
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:48,060
♫  Along with my fears that are collapsing  ♫

655
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,680
♫  Hold on to the memories  ♫
