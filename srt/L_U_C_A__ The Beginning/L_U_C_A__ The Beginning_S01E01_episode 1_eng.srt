5
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:36,540
 This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to actual names, places, organizations, religious references, and incidents is entirely coincidental.

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,440
 The episode was filmed with adequate accommodations to ensure the safety and the emotional well-being of the infant and minor actors used.

9
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,020
 I slept a dreamless sleep.

10
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,390
 I woke up without any memory.

11
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,180
 I do not know who I am.

12
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,270
 My sweet baby.

13
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,520
 Do not forget.

14
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,780
 You are not a monster.

15
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,860
 You are not a monster.

17
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,960
 I wake up in a strange place every time.

18
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,420
 Am I a fugitive or a hunter?

19
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,590
♫  Voice to me  ♫

20
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,070
♫  Find tree  ♫

21
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,300
- Who are you?  
 - Get away.

22
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,520
 Get out! Get out of the way! Be careful and hold him, quick!

23
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,890
 Take him to the emergency room. Quickly!

24
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,320
 Move him here. Quickly!

25
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,530
 A year later

26
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,790
Step back, please!

27
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,220
Search the records of the owner and all the tenants. See if any of them buried the body or if it came with the house.

28
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,770
- Ask them to remove the crane. 
 - Yes, sir.

29
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,010
Quite a number of tenants lived here, month-to-month, and moved out.

30
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,540
I doubt searching their records will help us much.

31
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,830
When the time of death is established, that'll narrow your search to before and after death.

32
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,900
-  I said to remove that damn fork crane! 
 - Hey!

33
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,770
Good afternoon, Detective.

34
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,950
I'm from the company.

35
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,960
Why aren't you blocking off the crime scene? You can't just let anybody in.

36
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,600
Something like  this shouldn't put the whole construction schedule on hold. We fall behind and can't make living.

37
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,910
Can't you limit your restriction to just around here and allow us to work in the rest of the construction site?

38
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,660
I ask for your cooperation.

39
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,390
- Who's in charge of the site?
 - That's me.

40
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,010
Tell them to stop that thing. How noisy.

41
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,650
Hey!

42
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,120
Hey, kill the fork crane!

43
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,800
Who are you?

44
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,120
Good afternoon, sir.

45
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,090
As far as I can see, this is the skeleton of a man.

46
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,110
His teeth indicate a dental implant.

47
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,900
And what are you doing at my crime scene? Are you from the Property &amp; Crime Scene Unit?

48
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,890
I'm from the Criminal Investigation Unit.

49
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,340
 Juan Metropolitan Police Agency
  Criminal Investigation 
  Inspector Hanul Gu Reum

50
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,380
Why is the CIU here? No one told me.

51
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,730
Since when did we start going around informing you?

52
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,850
Anyway, aren't we supposed to cordon off the crime scene?

53
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,770
Look at that rowdy crowd. You need to preserve the crime scene first.

54
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:33,330
I already have my hands full without you poking around in my case.

55
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,820
Hey, you! Stop right there!

56
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,940
Hey, hey, stop him!

57
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,720
- Who the hell is that guy?
 - Hey, get him quickly.

58
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,020
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

59
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,610
Damn it!

60
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,480
Damn it, look at this mess.

61
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,590
Let's start by blocking access to the crime scene.

62
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:56,550
Otherwise, it'll become difficult to determine how the death occurred or if the body was abandoned here.

63
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,420
Thanks for your words of advice.

64
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,300
Where specifically in the CIU do you work? I have many of my peers working in the unit.

65
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,500
If you're curious, ask your peers yourself.

66
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,200
Hey! Are you  a fancy photojournalist or what?

67
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,450
Get the damn pictures done already. You need to send the bones off for analysis.

68
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,520
Got it, sir.

69
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,760
 National Forensic Service

70
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,460
I believe you received a skeleton collected from a demolition site today.

71
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,590
I did. Why?

72
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,010
What do you want me to do this time?

73
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:51,730
Tell me if the bones match the medical data here.

74
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,590
Name of Insured: Kang Yong Su
  Address: Juan-si Dong-gu Sinmi-dong, Dalrae Mansion Apt 303

75
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,860
This has dental records.

76
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,840
Yes, it does.

77
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,100
Kang Yong Su?

78
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,440
Who is he?

79
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,270
It's confidential. I'm investigating the case quietly.

80
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,720
How do they look? Even with a casual look, you can tell the records match him, right?

81
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,890
Nothing we do is casual.

82
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,890
Then look at them carefully.
  Medical Records of the Insured

83
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,990
It's a match, right?

84
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,460
Whether a skeleton or a dead body, once it's here, it's not legal to disclose personal data.

85
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,280
If you must know, send in a formal, written request.

86
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,830
Professor, what's the point of a written request between us?

87
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,850
Here. Ta-da!

88
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,540
It's to bribe you. Go on. Eat.

89
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,360
For a bribe, it's too little.

90
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,890
What counts is the thought.

91
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,660
What matters with bribing  is how much you spend, not how much you think.

92
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,850
Come on, Teacher!

93
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,350
I've done enough for you because I was your teacher.

94
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,830
Paperwork or a reason, bring it to me via the official route next time.

95
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,360
Here, you eat one. These are the ones with red bean paste, right?

96
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,380
It's him, right?
  Medical Records of the Insured

97
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm not sure these are the bones of Kang Yong Su.

98
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,580
But he did have some dental surgery done.

99
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,560
See? My guess was right.

100
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,270
The surgical operation sites and where the metal was used match.

101
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,740
You are sure of it, right?

102
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,450
Don't be pushy. I'm only telling you what I think.

103
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,180
Hey, you from the CIU.

104
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,520
- Get in. 
 - I'm alright. I'll take the next one.

105
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,230
Get in.

106
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,650
- What brings you here? 
 - I have some business to attend to.

107
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,960
Doing a background check on me?  After all, that's what you folks do well.

108
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,400
We do.

109
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,410
We don't run them on everyone (background checks). Only the ones of a  certain  class.

110
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,430
I'm pretty high in the hierarchy of my unit, too. Right?

111
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,270
Indeed, you're pretty high up there.

112
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,070
To me, you're two plain ajussis (older men) with potbellies.

113
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,580
You have quite a way with words, I see.

114
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,760
Sure I do. After all,  I'm with the Criminal Investigation Unit.

115
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,030
Guess what? I already know you got canned from the CIU.

116
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,520
I called up my colleague. He said you were being transferred to another unit because of the trouble you caused.

117
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,020
He was set on shipping you off to the worst unit possible and making you suffer.

118
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,580
Who was your colleague?

119
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,520
Go, find out yourself.

120
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,600
Shame on you. You shouldn't pose as a member of the CIU when you're not and meddle in someone else's crime scene.

121
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,540
I'm not an imposter.

122
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,740
I belong with the CIU until tomorrow when I report to the new unit.

123
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,880
Is that so?

124
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,830
Should I take your case to the folks in the Inspection Unit and let them decide if you're an imposter or not?

125
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,120
Using the kind of language you're using now to intimidate

126
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,200
is just too old, isn't it?

127
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,710
It's time for the CIU to grow up, don't you think?

128
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,240
It's also time for you to lose some of your belly fat.

129
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,980
Good day, sirs.

130
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,950
Who does she think she is?

131
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,920
See? I told you to lose your belly fat.

132
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,640
- Sir, it's going down. 
 - Damn it!

133
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,880
No problem. We can go up.

134

 Dagyeong Resources

135
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,680
I'm from Dagyeong Resources to collect the trash.

136
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,160

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,510
You'll ruin the shock absorbers.

- Okay. 
 - There's one coming up.

142
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,980
Hey, you just did it again.

That just hit the spot.

152
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,850
Ji Oh, about the cosmetics company we stopped by earlier.

153
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,460
They experiment by completely shaving the fur off of dogs and using their shampoo on their bare skin.

154
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,110
Yes, for a skin test.

155
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,050
Not only that, they test their shampoo in the dogs' eyes, too.

156
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,190
Yes, to test it on their eyes as well.

157
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:27,000
Even when their skin gets severely irritated and their eyes go blind,

158
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,910
the company withholds even a drop of antibiotics or painkillers until the dogs die.

159
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,660
The company is invested in seeing the test results.

160
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,770
Even so, burning the dogs in a furnace like this is too cruel, right?

161
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,180
Doesn't matter. They're dead.

162
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,500
They're killed by the experiment.

163
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,320
- They're only animals. 
 - Even so!

164
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,950
Though I make a living doing what I do,

165
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,120
I feel that we humans have no right to treat animals as we do.

166
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,030
We don't do it because we have the right.

167
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,530
We do it because we have the power.

168
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,080
Just because we have power, can we do what we do?

169
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,720
It's only natural.

170
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,840
Natural? No, we're cruel.

171
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,740
A tiger isn't being cruel when it hunts and feeds itself on a hare.

172
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,100
That isn't the same as this.

173
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,470
Not different, really.

174
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,970
The tiger does what it does for its survival.

175
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,960
We humans, without doing a thing like that, can survive.

176
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,570
Researchers, too, experiment and research to make a living.

177
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,900
Boy, is he coldhearted or what?

178
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,330
- Did you grow up not loved? 
 - Yes.

179
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,920
Forget it. Just go out there and do the cleanup. Rude guy.

180

 Kang Yong Su: Deceased 
  Human bones are found in Uicheon a second time.

 Male, in his late teens or early 20s. Blue light?

 Police investigate another homicide in the city of Juan.

  Affair with the professor killed in an accident?
 His wife missing.

 Kim Ji Suk missing
  800,000 won, paid or loaned?

199
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,270
They're either dead or missing.

200
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,000
You all know we're updating our computer network by integrating artificial intelligence next year, right?

201
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,300
Yes, we do.

202
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,400
By the way, why isn't Team Leader Lee here yet?

203
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,050
Are you coming to work just now?

204
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,850
We had to stop by a crime scene. Did you eat?

205
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,590
How can I eat with you in my unit?

206
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,230
Your team is dead last in making arrests.

207
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,570
We may be at the bottom, but we aren't dead last.

208
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,550
The last or the second from the last, what difference does it make?

209
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:48,410
Give us easy cases. In no time, we'll improve on the number of arrests we make.

210
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:53,250
We're shorthanded already, and worse, we receive hard cases all the time.

211
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,270
I only give you your quota.

212
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,240
To be frank, while you say we're your best,

213
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,270
you send all of your cold cases our way.

214
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,090
Hey!

215
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,010
If you have a grievance, talk directly to me, not Chief. What are you, crazy?

216
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,730
Have you really gone mad?

217
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,890
- Come on, Team Leader. 
 - If you insert yourself where you shouldn't, what does that make me?

218
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,660
My apologies, sir.

219
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,020
I'm sorry, sir.

220
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,890
Good going  especially on the day we have a newcomer.

221
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,690
A newcomer?

222
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,260
Is the new hire already here?

223
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,200
I'm embarrassed to even introduce her to you.

224
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,230
She just got transferred here today.

225
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,180
She isn't a new hire but came from the Criminal Investigation Unit.

226
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,470
We all know the CIU doesn't hire just anyone.

227
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,930
She's a competent talent at your disposal. So don't tell me again you're shorthanded.

228
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,350
You can thank me with your performance.

229
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,810
Say hello to your team.  This is your work family.

230
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,360
Yes, sir.

231
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,810
Allegiance! I'm Haneule Gu Reum.

232
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,990
( T/N:.  She's making a joke of her name Gu Reum.    Gureum means cloud. Haneule means in the sky)

233
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,240
I'm late.

234
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,540
- One more rice and soup here, please! 
 - Yes!

235
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,270
Sunbaenim. I apologize for yesterday.

236
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:38,250
No apology necessary. What's with the Sunbaenim? Just call me, mister. It suits me with my potbelly and all.

237
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,210
Some men have it worse than yours. In fact, yours isn't bad at all.

238
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,990
Have some more, Team Leader.

239
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,010
Is your name Gu Reum's Haneul? So your clan name is Gu?

240
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,770
No, it's Haneule Gu Reum. My clan is Ha.

241
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,030
Can I call you Haneul then?

242
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,410
You can call me, Gu Reum.

243
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,970
Is that so?

244
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,710
Do you have something to say?

245
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,220
- I'll do my best. 
 - Behave, okay?

246
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,250
I love you, Team Leader.

247
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,290
What gibberish.

248
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,330
Let's drink up.

249
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,600
Here we go.

250
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,560
Here.

251
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,150
Drink up.

252
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,750
Alright, let's drink up.

253
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,290
Do you drink while on duty?

254
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,320
Look at you, a police officer drinking in broad daylight.

255
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,780
You said to drink up.

256
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,330
This isn't the CIU where the boys in fancy suits hang out.

257
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,830
You can't drink when you don't know when you might get stabbed on the job.

258
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,430
- Sorry, sir. 
 - We need to be on alert at all times.

259
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,650
- I won't go easy on you just because you're a girl. 
 - Yes, Sir!

260
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,140
You're part of my team now.

261
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,910
Don't get yourself hurt.

262
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,020
If you do,

263
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,940
give me a holler.

264
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,070
No, thank you. I'm on duty.

265
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,540
It's okay when I give you a drink.

266
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,180
- No, thank you. 
 - Drink.  It's alright. Have one.

267
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,760
This is to commemorate you becoming part of us.

268
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,800
Okay, then.

269
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,540
Do you drink while on duty?

270
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:14,670
- Are you having fun?  
  - Can I get you another drink? It's really okay now.

271
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,110
I'll take care of it myself.

272
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,420
 NIS (National Intelligence Service)

273
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,560
I exalt the Holy Lord for all the glory of being chosen

274
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,910
as the mother of  one hundred and one cherubim who will save the world.

275
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,010
I exalt the Holy Lord for all the glory of being chosen

276
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,310
as the mother of  one hundred and one cherubim who will save the world.

277
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,510
The police discovered a skeleton a few days ago.

278
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,730
They went through the dental records, so I expect the identity of the bones will come out soon.

279
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,550
There's no evidence of murder in the remains.  There's no need to worry.

280
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,760
If they find evidence of murder,  should I be worried?

281
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,370
Not at all.

282
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:37,290
Traces of the past keep emerging but there is no conclusion.

283
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:41,480
I think the research will succeed soon.

284
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,250
Did you see it today?  There is a line of believers who are willing to dedicate their children.

285
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:56,520
It's starting to build momentum like an abundance of faith ready to burst.

286
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,830
Only one needle is required to burst the balloon.

287
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,960
The research was initially successful.

288
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,500
Sir, what we are hoping for isn't an initial outcome.

289
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:15,710
If something doesn't emerge at the next human sacrifice, close the lab.

290
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,150
You know that we are conducting identical research in Sweden.

291
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,480
It will be better to scout for manpower from there to build a new round.

292
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,780
If we shut the lab, what will happen to the existing researchers?

293
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,370
Didn't you kill them all in the past, too?

294
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,040
Yes, I understand.

295
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,300
Until the next human sacrifice.

296
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,190
We're almost there.

297
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,000
We're almost there.

298
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,600
- We're from Dagyeong Resources.  
 - Okay.

299
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,160
 Dagyeong Resources - Medical Waste Collection Vehicle

300
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,200
Excuse me?

301
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,540
Aren't you taking these?

302
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,920
No, I'm sorry.

303
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,620
Here.

304
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,230
 Dagyeong Resources

00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,160
 Human Tech

306
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,510
 Dagyeong Resources

307
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,650
- What are they doing here? 
 - Why do you ask?

308
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,820
- There was some strange smell. 
 - I know, right?

309
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,960
This place is really weird, you know?

310
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,510
I don't feel this way in other places. But whenever I come here, I feel my hair stand on end

311
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,020
and a chill runs up my spine.  This place makes me feel nasty.

312
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,360
Really, nasty.

313
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,680
I don't drink for no reason, you know.

315
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,730
Who are you?

316
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,410
I'm from the police.  This is Human Tech, correct?

317
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,380
What's this about?

318
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,540
I have some questions.

319
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,850
Go ahead.

320
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,100
Aren't you even going to offer me a cup of coffee?

321
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,720
From other places, we usually collect dogs, cats, mice or rabbits. That's about it, right?

322
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,310
But from this place, about once in every month, we get things that are totally shocking.

323
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:34,260
It was before you were hired, so about six months ago?  They dumped a bear.

324
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,490
- A bear? 
 - That's right.

325
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,040
Last year, they dumped a gorilla.

326
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,270
- No way. 
 - Yes, way.

327
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,940
Look at you. Hey, a gorilla is nothing.

328
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,180
- Once, we collected a dolphin, you know? 
 - Come on, it's not a zoo.

329
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,170
Hey, that's why it's strange.

330
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,890
These days, there hasn't been anything special, though.

331
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,590
Because it's about time they dump a chimpanzee.

332
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,470
Gosh, I'm really curious about what research they do.

333
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,520
Hey, watch it! You spilled all of my drink.

334
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,200
Thank you.

335
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,540
By any chance, did a woman named Kim Ji Suk work here before?

336
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,170
- I don't know a person by that name. 
 - What about Kang Yong Su?

337
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,250
- Nope. 
 - You know it right away, eh?

338
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,210
Although it's a research lab, it's very tiny.

339
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:45,040
I know most of the people who worked here. By the way, what's this about?

340
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,810
This happened a while back.

341
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,630
Kang Yong Su received some money from Kim Ji Suk.

342
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:55,610
Looking into Kim Ji Suk's bank account, I learned the money was deposited by Human Tech.

343
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:59,490
I'm not sure. I don't know anything about it.

344
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:06,620
To see the HR and bank records, I guess I'll have to see your boss and ask for help, right?

345
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,330
How can I get a hold of your boss?

346
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,550
- We don't have a boss.
 - Pardon?

347
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,620
This company is bankrupt, so all assets are now owned by the creditors.

348
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:20,580
As you can see, most of the employees have left the company already, and there are just a few of us and the mice.

349
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,550
We might get let go at any moment, and all the company-related paperwork should be in the hands of the creditors already.

350
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,150
Who is the main creditor?

351
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,170
I heard they're some private equity fund company.

352
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,930
We're not sure. After all, we're mere researchers.

357
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,060
It started dividing itself, but the alpha cell produced potassium and sodium ions.

358
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,100
As a result, the beta and gamma cells are dead now.

359
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,130
The only method is for the differentiation to occur simultaneously, not by sequential division.

360
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,960
But the temperature of the mother cell is different, so in theory, simultaneous differentiation is impossible—

361
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,790
We've succeeded with that method before.

362
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,470
We only succeeded previously because a variable we hadn't thought of worked in our favor.

363
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:39,140
So we should consider the previous case as a result of random differentiation.

- Is there anything coincidental in science? 
 - No, there isn't.

Is science the work of a god's blessing?

366
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:56,700
- No, it isn't. 
 - Yet, are you saying I stumbled on my success, thanks to a blessing from God?

367
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,430
I didn't mean that, sir.

372
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:45,730
So far, we've succeeded in fusing cells. Now we need to work on their division.

373
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,610
We're adjusting the level of ionization.

374
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,820
It's taking longer than I thought.

375
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,110
You know I'm not good with big words. To put it simply, it's not going well, correct?

376
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,390
I'll expedite.

377
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:04,200
I've been informed Sweden is doing the same experiment we and their progress is faster than ours.

378
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,270
I'm the one who started the experiment and succeeded first.

379
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:12,650
And you blew it all.  Of course, it wasn't your fault.

380
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,600
You succeeded once, as you said.

Apparently, the patience of the investors is reaching its limit.

For them, choosing is difficult, but dumping is easy.

384
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,600
- I can do it.  
 - Then, please do.

Compared to a believer waiting for salvation or a terminally ill patient waiting for a miracle,

389
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:51,100
a scientist waiting on the result of his life's work is much more desperate.

390
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,700
I don't know about that. All I know is that I'm more desperate than you.

but after a few decades have passed, I feel like it was never there.

470
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:59,810
The very idea of using both hands is gone from me now.

471
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,860
This will hurt.

472
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,150
 A-01

473
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,010
You should go home and rest. Why are you here?

474
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,700
I just sprained my arm a bit.

475
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,650
Now that you're hurt, do you think it's worth getting hurt?

476
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,510
No.

477
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:49,060
Can you see with that?  Try this.

478
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,650
- What's this?
 - Instead of asking, look at it for yourself.

479
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:01,520
That's the vehicle the guy who saved you was driving. The license plate is registered to Dagyeong Resources.

480
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,190
It's a vehicle used to collect waste.

481
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,830
I called the place and learned the guy would be on night duty.

482
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,360
Pay him a visit. That's the address there.

483
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,280
Thank you.

484
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,870
I'm scheduled for night duty today.

485
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:13,340
Night duty when you're hurt?

486
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,280
He was your savior today. Get some beverages on your way to see him.

487
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,570
After you see him,  you can go straight home.

488
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:21,950
It's okay. I have money.

489
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:25,210
This is from our expense fund. You're part of my team now.

490
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:26,150
Still, I shouldn't.

491
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,210
Take it, kiddo.

492
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,570
This is how the Crime Investigation Unit works.

493
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,670
Moving, huh?

494
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,200
No. Just thinking about what I should buy.

495
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,740
Rude.

496
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,440
If you get hurt again, I'll kill you.

497
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,930
A guy like this can never hide his true nature. Somewhere, somehow, his power will reveal itself.

498
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,160
So he can't live in hiding for the rest of his life.

499
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,870
It's inevitable he gets caught in the end.

500
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,520
He appeared after one year.

501
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,940
So this was a defibrillator, right? Is there any human who can do this with his bare hands, without any equipment?

502
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,740
No.

503
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,070
Of course not. If anyone can do this, they aren't human.

504
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,540
It's Ji Oh alright.

505
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,960
What a miracle!

506
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,320
This guy just saved your lab.

507
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,750
I let you maintain this lab so you can make one more of him. When I was just about to shut it down,

508
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,830
this guy showed up  in the nick of time.

509
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,450
I can't say he's a finished product yet.

510
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:44,420
I still need to see how his cells get divided and how they develop their distinct marks.

511
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,640
You know I don't understand such technical terms.

512
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,850
Let me ask you one thing.

513
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:52,960
Whether he's a finished product or not, can you make one just like him?

514
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:59,520
You haven't yet. Hence you've failed.

515
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,060
What the investors want is a final product.

516
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,180
If we retrieve him and breakdown his skin, muscles, nerves, blood, and bones

517
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,720
and make what they want, you and I can live happily ever after.

518
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,090
Of course, we won't live together.

519
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,940
I can't  just dissect him.

520
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,000
Alright, just listen to me this one time.

521
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,760
There is no more research to do or analyze. If he runs away again, we're left with nothing.

522
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,300
Just make what the investors want, and it's finished.

523
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,210
That's why you originally made him in the first place.

524
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,950
But still...

525
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:35,810
Do you want the world to know you made him, publish your work in academia, or win a Nobel Prize?

526
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:39,600
Do you think mere academia is deserving of my research?

527
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,870
So you know.

528
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:46,010
I will retrieve him, so you just be prepared.

529
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:51,970
I'm telling you again, but this is the last chance you will get.

530
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:09,560
The information is from the police. It's a business collecting trash and called Dagyeong Resources.

531
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,410
- Take note of its address and security system.
 - Yes.

532
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,800
Collect him from there, and be careful to not be seen.

533
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,940
I understand.

534
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,750
Who is it that requires all of us to go?

535
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:33,120
You usually move alone, and at most with one other.

536
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,150
Don't let it get to your head.

537
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:38,550
The guys before you died because they did.

538
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,060
Are you serious?

539
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:45,320
If you slip, we get in trouble. We need to finish this quickly.

540
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,800
What does this person do?

541
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,540
Not a person. It's a monster.

542
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,370
Hey, hurry up and come.

543
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:53,180
I thought you possessed not an ounce of affection, but you saved someone today.

544
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,550
What were so you embarrassed about that you ran away?

545
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:00,530
You could've gotten a hero's medal and appeared on the news. How good would that be?

546
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,060
Because I didn't want to be bothered.

547
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,940
Don't be like that. Should I call the broadcasting station?

548
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,120
No. I said I'm fine.

549
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,900
Why would you throw away an opportunity like this?

550
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,350
Are you guilty of something? Being chased?

551
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:16,800
Would there be big trouble if your face is known?

552
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,440
Come on. Drink.

553
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,700
Well, you're not that kind of kid.

554
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:28,050
From my life experiences, I can tell the kind of people capable of committing crimes.

555
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:29,800
What did you do before you came here?

556
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,610
Just this and that.

557
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:36,140
You don't look like you had a hard life. What did your father do?

558
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,340
I don't have a father.

559
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,790
Did he pass?

560
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,910
- No. 
 - Oh!

561
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:43,200
Did he divorce your mom?

562
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,290
I don't have a mom either.

563
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,160
Drink.

564
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,860
 No signal detected

565
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,280
 No signal detected

566
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,180
I'm going to stop working next year, so you take over my car.

567
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,500
It's a junk car.

568
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,520
I'll give it to you cheap.

569
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,540
I'm not buying it.

570
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:48,050
There is a world of difference between driving your own car

571
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,480
and driving one as a part-time gig.

572
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,640
You need to start saving if you want to get married and have a family.

573
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,890
Why do I need to do that?

574
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:01,170
Then, are you going to live alone for the rest of your life?

575
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,270
Yes.

576
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:04,360
Look at you, kid.

577
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:15,940
Humans have their families because they aren't strong enough to live alone.

578
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:21,010
Because they're weak, they stick together as a family and help out and care for each other.

579
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:25,950
From the standpoint of any  human organism keen on preserving self-interest,  a family is the smallest unit of gansters.

580
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:31,910
How can you say that at your age? What will you become when you're older?

581
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,670
What will you become when you're older, mister?

582
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,740
Hey, I'm done with growing up.

583
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,950
Now that you're all grown up, what have you become?

584
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,550
Not much, as you see.

585
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:50,570
Don't laugh. In no time, you may end up like me.

586
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,970
I may have already.

587
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:57,440
That isn't a thing a young man like yourself should say.

588
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,180
You need to get your mind straight from now on.

589
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,980
Frankly, what do you have?

590
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:08,140
You have no money, no social skills, and no humanity.

591
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:16,860
Listen to me.

592
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,900
I say this because I don't have a son and think of you as my own.

593
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,510
As for me, because I don't have a father, I don't consider you as my own.

594
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:29,670
You always have to have the last word, don't you?

595
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,770
Let's put these away. 
  Safety first

596
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,130
Who are they?

597
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,610
Who are you? Not just anyone can come in—

598
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:15,430
It's been a while. Has it been a year?

599
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,570
That place from before.

600
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:26,460
Why? You don't remember?

601
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:54,840
Who the hell are you? Why are you doing this to me?

602
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,180
Let's go quietly.

603
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,130
Don't do it.

604
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,010
Don't do it.

605
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:19,630
Ji Oh.

606
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,360
Give him the shot.

607
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,050
Run away.

608
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:30,160
Don't do it.

609
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,470
I said don't do it!

610
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,340
 Dagyeong Resources

611
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,850
 Dagyeong Incineration Plant

612
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:17,300
I didn't know my part-timer did something as great as that.

613
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,550
He's normally quiet and diligent.

614
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,680
When I interviewed him, he seemed like a fine person

615
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,510
So I hired him.

616
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:28,110
Where did they go?

617
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,680
Mr. Kim!  Mr. Kim!

618
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,810
Hey, Ji Oh!

619
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,310
Did they get off already?

620
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:39,820
No, after they finish burning the waste, they're supposed to report to the employee on duty before they leave.

621
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,720
I can't believe the man left the incinerator on.

622
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,200
What's he doing?

623
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:48,480
What's wrong?

624
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,650
Look, look! In there.

625
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,330
I think we lost him.

626
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:57,850
What should we do now?

627
01:01:57,850 --> 01:01:59,670
Bring the car. Let's go to his place.

628
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,850
Do you think he would've gone there?

629
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:09,710
All animals, when they're hunted, run home by instinct.

630
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:29,490
When the body is burnt like that, how would I know if it's Mr. Kim or Ji Oh?

631
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:31,350
Can't you tell them apart by their body types?

632
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,130
I can't, really.

633
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:35,500
I honestly know nothing.

634
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,050
I was at my station all along.

635
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:42,200
You were with me. Explain to him for me.

636
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,010
The two were together, right?

637
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:49,380
Yes, the lady detective and I. The two of us.

638
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,900
- No. I mean your employees.
 - Oh.

639
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,790
They aren't full-time.

640
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:57,350
Mr. Kim is the main driver and Ji Oh is a part-timer.

641
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,530
So were they together?

642
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:03,890
Sure. The two are supposed to finish burning the waste and then turn off the incinerator.

643
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:07,230
Then they report before they leave. But this evening, they just disappeared without a word.

644
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:10,210
Team Leader,  I have their employee identification records.

645
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,250
 Employee Identification Records
  Kim Man Sik

646
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:15,060
So Kim Man Sik is the one in charge and Ji Oh is the part-timer?

647
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:15,890
Yes.

648
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,310
Isn't there anyone else new?

649
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:21,350
Team Leader, they cut all the electric circuits connected to the CCTVs.

650
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:24,000
Nothing is recorded.

651
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,350
Not me!

652
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:31,500
We don't have monitors to observe the images in the CCTVs.

653
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,660
Alright, alright.

654
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:37,050
- I'll call you if I need you again. 
 - Okay.

655
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,980
How about the CCTVs outside of the incinerator and the driveways leading to it?

656
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,150
They're the same.

657
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:48,230
Of the two, whoever is alive is a suspect. You two head out to Kim Man Sik's place.

658
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,770
You  go to the part-timer's place.

659
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:52,070
And you, go with him.

660
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:54,420
Move quickly.

661
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,350
If I say this, I might sound really old.

662
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:50,370
Normally when you work with your superior, you're supposed to drive.

663
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:54,130
I said I would, but you offered to drive because I injured my arm. 
  Employee Identification Records: Ji Oh

664
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:55,750
Oh, right.

665
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,870
I did say that.

666
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:04,650
Still, as a matter of protocol, You could've persisted a little and offered to drive.

667
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:08,430
I'm sorry. I'll drive then.

668
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:11,420
No, no. I'm fine because I'm the new generation.

669
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:15,530
I'm telling you what to do when you drive with the other superiors.

670
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:17,970
No, no. I should drive.

671
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:21,100
I'm just saying. You don't need to get all upset.

672
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,280
What's that?

673
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,880
That's...

674
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:33,380
What's wrong with that guy?

675
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,250
Hey, Gu Reum, what are you doing?

676
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:41,210
Gu Reum! Damn it.

677
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:45,190
Gu Reum!

678
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,080
Seriously.

679
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,290
I'm sorry. So sorry.

680
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,830
 Sae Han Ave. 54th St. 8

681
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,740
Sir, it's Sae Han Ave. 54th St. 8.

682
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:14,010
I need backup right away.

683
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:29,550
Don't come at me!

684
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:21,860
Run away again, if you can walk.

685
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,140
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

686
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:27,480
Because you won't listen. I asked you to come quietly.

687
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:04,830

688
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:14,430
 The animal scenes were simulated and filmed safely.

689

♫   Please let me sleep on it, so I can breathe in.  ♫

690

 I don't remember. Where is this?

694
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:41,530
  He won't remember who he is. I must bring him in.

695
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:43,980
 I clearly remembered who you are.

696
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,600
  - The kid came back. 
 - There's no chart?

697
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:49,850
 If he's dead, bring me his body. As soon as possible, in the freshest condition.

01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:52,540
  So you're saying it's human blood and yet it isn't?

 What did I do to you?

701
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:58,500
  I wanted to know that, so I've been looking for you all my life.
