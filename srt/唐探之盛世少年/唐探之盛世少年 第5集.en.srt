1
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,280
Why are they like this?

2
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,800
Who locked them up?

3
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,220
Wang Ji, that bastard.

4
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,320
It’s easy for him to die.

5
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
He should be cut into pieces.

6
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,880
and fall into hell.

7
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,880
These girls

8
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,980
were bought by Wang Ji, right?

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
You’re right.

10
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,080
After Wang Ji bought these girls,

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,080
he will use the drug to control them.

12
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,600
Some of them adapted to the drug

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,480
and became the wife of the Land of Bliss.

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,440
and can't live without the Land of Bliss forever.

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,600
while some lose their mind.

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,039
and indulged in illusions.

17
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,600
Till your life runs out

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,840
Just like them.

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,640
Miss Yu,

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,600
Since you know what this beast has done,

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
why are you still helping the evil?

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,759
What is your purpose

23
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,680
to lure us here?

24
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,680
Let go of my hand first.

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,810
You're going to strangle him to death.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,729
It's a secret place.

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,340
but it's also a safe place.

28
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,800
If she really wants to harm us,

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,759
and avenge Wang Ji,

30
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,200
he wouldn't have brought us here.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Miss Qingyue,

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,600
do you have a favor to ask?

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,320
One year ago,

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,360
other girls and I

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,920
were robbed by a group of bandits from the Western Region.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,360
This girl has beautiful eyes.

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,920
It'll sell at a good price.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,680
No.

39
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,079
My eyes!

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,040
Take them away.

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,160
My eyes!

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,360
No!

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,240
No!

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,680
Don't!

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,840
Stop!

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,480
I'll take this woman.

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,930
To thank him for saving my life,

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,880
I entrusted this defect to Wang Ji.

49
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,440
Qingyue,

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,440
I saved your life.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
How did I treat you?

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Feed them

53
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,120
to them.

54
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,360
The Land of Bliss is a place

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,600
for the rich.

56
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,840
To me,

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
to be alive.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,720
Later, someone sent a few girls from the Western Region.

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,250
Qingyue.

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,560
You knew it was a drug.

61
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,079
You've been doing evil deeds for the tiger all these years.

62
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,960
I know.

63
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,960
I knew it from the beginning.

64
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,520
So I killed him

65
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,360
to atone for my sins.

66
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,520
What?

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
You killed Wang Ji?

68
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,000
You are the cat demon who can control the Blood Vine.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,040
What demon?

70
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,600
I really doubt your left head.

71
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Right head.

72
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,010
What do you mean?

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,240
Miss Qingyue.

74
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,760
You fed Wang Ji

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,240
Did you feed Wang Ji?

76
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,320
Yes.

77
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,640
Qingyue.

78
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,840
Miss Qingyue.

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,320
I know what you did

80
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,440
is a helpless act.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,680
You saved us today.

82
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,680
We won’t reveal the cause of Wang Ji’s death

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,610
Wang Ji’s death.

84
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,520
That's right.

85
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,360
That fat pig.

86
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,220
He'll die soon.

87
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,960
You should torture him more.

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,480
I know you are not a villain.

89
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,680
But where did

90
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,720
come from?

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,860
Please tell me.

92
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,920
I feel very comfortable this time.

93
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,880
Here's your money.

94
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,480
That fatty is lucky.

95
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,760
This time,

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,480
I'll give you this.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,040
What is this?

98
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,520
This is the seed of murder.

99
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,320
Who do you dislike?

100
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
Feed him.

101
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Wait.

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Slow down.

103
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,760
We can't get out of the city gate.

104
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,890
That's all we can do.

105
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,600
Let's go.

106
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,040
Thank you.

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Get up.

108
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,010
It's no big deal.

109
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,840
I don't want to leave.

110
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,040
I can't bear to chase.

111
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
I didn't expect that

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
would let a murderer go.

113
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,840
Don’t forget

114
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,159
we are also suspects.

115
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,920
Next,

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,770
It's our turn to fight back.

117
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,560
Left head water.

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,080
Right head.

119
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,210
What does that mean?

120
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,500
Just shake it and you'll know.

121
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,020
My lord.

122
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,560
A dancer from the Western Region envoy is here to see you.

123
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
He said Lord Hakule

124
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,400
I know you've been tired these days.

125
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,560
and ordered her to come and serve you.

126
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,480
to rest.

127
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,960
The Western Region does know the meaning of the world.

128
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,120
They are stronger than the women in Central Plain.

129
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,720
All right.

130
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,800
You should rest too.

131
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,960
No need to guard outside.

132
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,320
Yes.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,760
Come on.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,040
Let's see how you can help me.

135
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,760
Commander.

136
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,140
Is your strength okay?

137
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,240
You're quite strong.

138
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,000
Women from the Western Region are all good.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,640
but her hair.

140
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,440
It's a bit heavy.

141
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,500
Don't move.

142
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,960
Nameless.

143
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,560
How dare you!

144
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,160
I have no choice.

145
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,500
Please forgive me.

146
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,800
I had no choice but to kill the dancer who offered His Majesty.

147
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,080
I had no choice but to kill him.

148
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,800
and abducting an imperial official.

149
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,860
If you really think I am the murderer,

150
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,800
What's your motive?

151
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,280
The dancer sent from the Western Region died.

152
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,960
Whether it's the Western Region or the Tang Dynasty,

153
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
or the motive.

154
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,000
You only need one murderer in front of His Majesty.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,860
And that dancer

156
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,560
died after you touched it.

157
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,960
If it was me,

158
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
why would I make it so complicated?

159
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,300
It'll be easier

160
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,400
Isn't it easier?

161
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,360
Your Majesty is wise.

162
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,960
Of course I know the cause.

163
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,700
Don't move.

164
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,960
Commander

165
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,159
Sorry.

166
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,690
The cause of Grando's death was the blood vine

167
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,080
due to excessive bleeding.

168
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,240
Bloodthirsty Vine is fierce.

169
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,200
He likes human blood.

170
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,280
You're going crazy.

171
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,640
If you find the cause of death, you'll be cleared of suspicion.

172
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,160
The blood vine went through the abdomen.

173
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,920
It means

174
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,880
someone fed her the seed of the Bloodthirsty Vine.

175
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,440
Grando's daily life

176
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,840
is in charge of.

177
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,440
You mean...

178
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,280
Ersa is dead. She's dead too.

179
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,320
But she's dead too.

180
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,920
That's why we kidnapped her.

181
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,720
She was murdered

182
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,039
she was murdered.

183
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,400
Miss Granduo and I

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
with Miss Gu Landi.

185
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,799
Yes.

186
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
You have no proof.

187
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
You could have killed her

188
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,620
you killed her in the same way.

189
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,320
The way Grando and Alisha died

190
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,600
The cause of death and the cause of death are the same.

191
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
But there's only one difference.

192
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,800
What's the difference?

193
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Your expression.

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Grandas look like clouds and rain.

195
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,160
but she didn't.

196
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,760
You mean that Grando doesn't feel pain?

197
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,360
That's because

198
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,400
took a drug.

199
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,120
called Soul Captivating Powder.

200
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,640
It's made from thorn apple from the Western Region.

201
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,840
The Soul Captivating Powder will weaken one's mind.

202
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,300
and amplify their desire.

203
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
and obey

204
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,680
to the pharmacist.

205
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,800
The Land of Bliss?

206
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,120
You mean...

207
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
the murderer is in the Land of Bliss?

208
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,840
Wang Ji has been feeding

209
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,120
for the red-crown girl in the Land of Bliss.

210
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,780
Therefore,

211
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,960
the Land of Bliss became

212
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,080
the Land of Bliss.

213
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,360
The Hall of Bliss is full of courtesans.

214
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Wang Ji is not that bold.

215
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,560
Most of the red servants

216
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,040
mostly came from Notrey.

217
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,520
There's no deal.

218
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,280
This saves the cost of the Land of Bliss.

219
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,120
The woman who came from the Notraid is unyielding.

220
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,680
and even escaped and resisted.

221
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,360
So Wang Ji controlled them with Soul Captivating Powder.

222
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,080
That’s why you killed them.

223
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,360
Don’t frame me.

224
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,680
Wang Ji wasn’t killed by Nameless.

225
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,080
because the woman in his hand

226
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,600
can't stand his oppression.

227
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,320
He got the Bloody Vine seed from the human traffickers

228
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
and killed him.

229
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,480
This is the seed of murder.

230
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,480
Who do you dislike?

231
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,560
Feed him.

232
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,520
Wait.

233
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,640
According to my investigation,

234
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,920
when the Jade Sword Boat ran away,

235
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,160
the source of the poison on the arrow wound

236
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
came from

237
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,680
thorn apple.

238
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,600
