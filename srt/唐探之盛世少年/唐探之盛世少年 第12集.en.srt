1
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,440
I never expected that for such a small matter

2
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,680
you would actually come to thank me in person.

3
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,880
I'm even more surprised

4
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,200
that with just my name

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,760
you could find this place

6
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,680
in the vast city of Chang'an.

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,440
Miss Yu here

8
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,940
is a local of Chang'an.

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,770
Besides,

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,120
the Xu family leather shop

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,519
is quite famous in Chang'an

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,450
and easy to find.

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,800
Miss Xu,

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
please accept this small gift

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,600
as a token of my appreciation.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:11,960
I...

17
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,100
Delicious treats!

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,740
Delicious treats!

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Then I thank you for this.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,120
Compared to Miss Xu saving my life,

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,240
these little pastries

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,970
are nothing.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,680
My father suffers from a brain condition.

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,640
He has the mind of a five-year-old child.

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,800
If he has offended you,

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,259
please be understanding.

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,979
There's no offense at all.

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,289
What caused your father's condition?

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,000
My master is skilled in medicine.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,259
Perhaps he could help.

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,960
My father's condition...

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,620
It's not actually an illness.

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,680
It's...

34
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,080
Ancestors forgive me.

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,560
Xu Yang had no choice.

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,600
You've been working hard over there.

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,000
It's time you came back to see the children.

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,160
According to tradition,

39
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,920
paper figures must not have their eyes dotted,

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,580
or wandering spirits might be attracted to them

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
and possess them.

42
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,840
The golden bird transforms into spirit,

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,440
the soul returns to the body.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,329
You're back.

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
You've returned.

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,040
You're back.

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
You've come back.

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,720
You've returned.

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,880
Three ethereal souls and seven corporeal souls

50
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,680
reduced to just one ethereal and three corporeal souls.

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,610
Did the paper effigy successfully come back to life?

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,000
My brother handled this matter.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,560
I'm not entirely sure about the details.

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,840
What about the paper effigy?

55
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,360
Burned.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Let's not talk about this anymore.

57
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,170
It's all in the past.

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,880
Miss Xu.

59
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,650
I've come here today

60
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,320
not only to express my gratitude

61
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,920
but also to seek your guidance on something.

62
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,120
I wouldn't dare call it guidance.

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm just a humble craftsman

64
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,680
but I'll tell you everything I know.

65
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,640
Miss Liu.

66
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,480
The wounds on the corpse,

67
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,720
how did you stitch them, Miss Xu?

68
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,370
Come and see.

69
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,680
The needles and threads for stitching flesh are different from sewing.

70
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,600
Small needles are used when the body isn't stiff yet,

71
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,160
otherwise, large needles are used.

72
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,000
Thick thread is for large pieces of flesh.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,260
Thin thread is for small pieces of flesh.

74
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,520
Silk thread is used for the face.

75
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,960
And this gold thread

76
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,200
is buried inside to connect bones.

77
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
It's also for good fortune,

78
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
so in the next life,

79
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,520
one might wear gold and silver.

80
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,579
Miss Xu, you are truly kind-hearted.

81
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,280
It's still considered a lowly profession.

82
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,400
Haven't you heard,

83
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,760
better be a roadside dog

84
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,960
than a corpse tailor?

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,840
Miss Xu,

86
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,480
do you know

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,320
how to sew puppets?

88
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
What puppets?

89
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,320
I've never heard of them.

90
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,760
Sister.

91
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,399
There are corpses at the execution ground.

92
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,459
You have a visitor.

93
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,399
It's nothing, brother,

94
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,360
just an old friend visiting.

95
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,160
But what about my father?

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,360
I can't worry about that now.

97
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,240
The execution is about to begin.

98
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,900
The families are all waiting.

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,800
Please hurry up.

100
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll go get the cart.

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,159
Alright.

102
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,220
It's okay, Miss Xu.

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,040
You can go now.

104
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,360
We have nothing to do anyway.

105
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,159
We can help look after your father.

106
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,800
Thank you all for your help.

107
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,360
Uncle.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,860
Where's Uncle?

109
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,960
Uncle.

110
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,320
Uncle.

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,080
Uncle.

112
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,440
Uncle.

113
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,480
Uncle.

114
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,360
It's fun in here.

115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,200
Look.

116
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,200
Look.

117
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,680
Look.

118
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,160
Uncle.

119
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,280
Uncle.

120
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,480
Shh.

121
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,360
It's dangerous here.

122
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,180
Let me protect you.

123
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,650
Just protect yourself.

124
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,280
This corpse

125
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,280
somehow looks familiar.

126
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,480
It's that demon.

127
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,420
How did he end up dead here?

128
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,520
I knew it.

129
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,240
How could anyone be invulnerable to weapons?

130
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,200
So that means

131
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,720
he's also a puppet.

132
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,940
If that's the case,

133
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,640
all the bodies here

134
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,400
are puppets.

135
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,330
Beautiful lady.

136
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,840
Beautiful lady.

137
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,330
Beautiful lady.

138
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,640
Look!

139
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,400
Uncle.

140
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,840
Miss Liu.

141
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
How did her body end up here?

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,800
That's right.

143
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,840
Didn't we bury Miss Liu?

144
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,130
Could she have risen from the dead?

145
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,800
Miss Xu

146
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,240
must have waited until we left

147
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,700
and dug up Miss Liu's body.

148
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,400
I can't believe

149
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,680
Xu Qiniang is in league with those evil people.

150
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,920
Perhaps

151
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,640
she was forced to do it.

152
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,560
Now all of this

153
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,680
can only be clarified by questioning Miss Xu.

154
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,480
We must hurry.

155
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,240
If the Destiny Puppet appears in this world,

156
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,880
something major will happen.

157
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,410
Let's go.

158
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,130
Let's go.

159
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,970
Miss Xu, be careful!

160
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,960
Miss Xu!

161
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,240
Sister!

162
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Help him quickly!

163
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,040
What a terrible death.

164
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,530
He's not breathing.

165
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,200
Girl.

166
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,360
Girl.

167
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,640
Chief Producer.

168
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,240
Zhao Wentao.

169
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,640
Producers.

170
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,200
Yu Runde, Ren Hailong, Xie Zhenggang, Jin Ruting.

171
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,059
Co-Producers.

172
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,520
Planning.

173
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:41,840
Xu Zhongyan, Song Hongmei, Xiao Nan, Meng Yaoyue.

174
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,159
Coordinators.

175
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,760
Qu Xiaojun, Zhang Jingjing, Xu Ping, Zhao Weiping, Shen Yarong, Zhang Jie, Lei Zhe.

176
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,120
