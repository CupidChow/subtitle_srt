1
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,760
Lord Fang.

2
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,800
I was...

3
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,840
I was...

4
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,370
Mr. Fang.

5
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,460
You were distracted just now.

6
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,140
Commander, please

7
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,080
to investigate

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,700
for those innocent women.

9
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,780
Please investigate thoroughly.

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,900
Search carefully.

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,480
Commander

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,720
There's no one in the room.

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,240
The tribute values all applications

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,080
were not taken away.

15
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,400
It seems that he has escaped. Let's go.

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,060
He escaped.

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,000
Nameless! Let's go!

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,520
It seems that what you said is true.

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,000
Hakurot must have discovered his crime

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,860
He was exposed.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,320
He fled to escape punishment.

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,600
What happened?

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,320
How did Hakule know about it in advance?

24
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:45,920
It's okay.

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,729
He can't escape.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,080
Take this!

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,600
Let's go.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,320
Fall in!

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,360
Follow Lord Fox Cao.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,840
Yes.

31
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:53,840
Go!

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,680
Go!

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,200
Hya!

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,240
Go!

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,720
Hakule.

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,480
You killed people in the name of the envoy of the Western Region.

37
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,120
Notrey!

38
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,140
Forced to sell.

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,280
Now the evidence is solid.

40
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,410
Do you plead guilty?

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
You guys

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,760
You always ruined my plan

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,300
and forced me to risk my life with you.

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,920
Hawk!

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,320
Do you admit your crime?

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,960
I am the ambassador of the country.

47
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
How dare you

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,040
You want me to plead guilty?

49
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,920
I won't.

50
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,840
You're still denying your death.

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,600
How dare you

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Kill him.

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,760
Wait.

54
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
There's one more thing I don't understand.

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,120
Granduo is the tribute you gave to His Majesty.

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,250
Why did you kill her?

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,600
to the Emperor of Tang?

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,130
In order to exchange for some rewards,

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,640
someone offered a higher price,

60
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,040
I'll kill him.

61
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,560
Is human life

62
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
in your eyes?

63
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,600
A weak woman

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,450
You can't ride horses and keep the world safe.

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,280
and the bottom can't cultivate to relieve the hunger.

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,200
It's no different from ants.

67
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,480
Ants are also living creatures.

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,720
You are unforgivable!

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,120
No.

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,060
Hand him over to General Fang.

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,660
He will be punished by law.

72
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,640
Miss Yu.

73
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,680
Please don’t.

74
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,480
The suspect has been arrested.

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,880
Don't slaughter in vain.

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,320
Stab!

77
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,360
Stab me.

78
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,420
If you don't kill me today,

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,400
I won't die.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,760
Go to hell!

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,440
Miss Yu.

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,200
Come on!

83
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,959
The murderer is brought to justice.

84
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,800
After this,

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,500
Lord Fang will report to His Majesty.

86
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
You two are free.

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,160
You can come and go anytime.

88
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,840
I wonder

89
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,380
what's your next plan?

90
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,740
I, the Monster Wolf, have returned to the world.

91
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,440
Lang.

92
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,000
If you dare

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,320
in front of us again,

94
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,280
I won’t go easy on you.

95
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,840
Miss Yu.

96
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,140
What about you?

97
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,360
I'll keep looking for the Wujie Mirror.

98
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,320
to extend my life.

99
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,720
Okay.

100
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,560
I'll also ask everyone in the government

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,420
to help you find the Wujie Mirror.

102
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,200
After we parted today,

103
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,680
I wonder when we can meet again.

104
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,140
Miss Yu.

105
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:49,760
Take care.

106
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,050
Goodbye.

107
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,120
Miss Yu.

108
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,000
The owner said

109
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,480
this sachet can repel evil and avoid harm.

110
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,340
This is for you.

111
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
It can keep you safe.

112
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,920
There are not so many

113
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,000
in this world.

114
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,170
Even if there is,

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,780
what's the use of a sachet?

116
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,560
I only trust my sword on my waist.

117
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,720
Miss Yu, actually I...

118
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,400
can't exorcise evil and avoid evil,

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,240
but on the way,

120
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,200
it's inevitable to encounter insects.

121
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,880
This sachet

122
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,080
is useful.

123
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,080
Thank you.

124
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,360
Miss Yu.

125
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,680
In the future,

126
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,159
no one as strong as me

127
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,040
to protect you.

128
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Don't be impulsive.

129
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,730
Don't make any trouble.

130
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,480
Sir.

131
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,520
This blind girl

132
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,450
wants to see you.

133
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,040
Miss Chu Mo. I'm here to see you. I'm here to see you. I'm here.

134
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,970
All these years,

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,360
I've been wandering around the world alone.

136
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,200
I can't stay here anymore.

137
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,440
Why don't I accompany you along the way?

138
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,800
Take care of me on the way.

139
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Nameless.

140
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,520
I don't know.

141
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,240
Miss Chu Mo,

142
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
Didn't you leave Hezhou?

143
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,960
Didn't she leave with Lady Liu?

144
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,120
Your eyes...

145
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,840
My Lord.

146
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,920
Please save Sister Liu.

147
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,800
What do you think?

148
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,840
Her eyes...

149
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,080
Get up.

150
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,400
What happened?

151
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,920
That day,

152
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,159
Sister Liu.

153
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,000
After he rescued us,

154
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,560
Min Ja.

155
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,440
Min Ja!

156
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,440
Min Ja.

157
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,240
We are all runners.

158
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,040
There are no shops or posts here.

159
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,400
May I get some water?

160
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,500
Thank you, auntie.

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
Be careful.

162
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,120
Where are you going

163
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,880
Where are you going?

164
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,520
Home.

165
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,800
Girls.

166
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Where do you live?

167
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,840
We...

168
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,320
Sister.

169
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,330
Drink it.

170
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,680
How about

171
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
stay in Izusei Village?

172
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,240
My eyes!

173
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Stop!

174
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,080
Chu Mo.

175
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,800
Sister Liu.

176
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm here

177
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,320
My eyes.

178
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Chu Mo.

179

190
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,600

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160

196
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,400

197
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,360
Why are we following him?

198
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,560

200
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,960
The Xuanyuan mirror is still missing.

201
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,090
I should look for it.

202
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,600
But Miss Liu disappeared mysteriously.

203
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,000
How can I leave her alone?

204
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,680

205
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,520
Miss Liu saved my life.

206
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,680
Since I know it,

207
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,880
I can't just stand by.

208
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
Besides, if he wants to save someone,

209
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,520
he'll set us up.

210
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,320

211
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,320
He must have fallen for Miss Liu.

212
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,560
Miss Liu is so loyal.

213
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
If he goes to save Miss Liu alone,

214
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,280
Miss Liu will definitely marry him.

215
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,800
By then,

216
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,440
we owe Miss Liu a lifetime.

217
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:48,960
