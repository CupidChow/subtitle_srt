1
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,720
Arrest them!

2
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:04,760
Don't move.

3
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,090
Don't move! Don't move!

4
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,400
Commander.

5
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,620
What are you doing?

6
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,120
Why are you grabbing me too?

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,760
Why?

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,880
Do you know who she is?

9
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,720
She is a gift from the King of Tang from the Western Region.

10
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,039
Are you looking at me

11
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,530
or the bronze mirror in my hand?

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,039
If I say it's a mirror,

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,840
will you give in?

14
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,360
That depends on

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,560
if you can get out or not.

16
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,490
Get out! Get out!

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,440
Are you alive to take it?

18
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,000
It's just a mirror.

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,400
You're really ignorant.

20
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,440
Mirror.

21
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,690
Do you know what this mirror is?

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
I don't know.

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,920
I wonder

24
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,680
I've been traveling around for so many years,

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,160
I've seen all kinds of good things.

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,220
This shabby mirror

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,600
doesn't suit me.

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,120
I'm not bragging.

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Our chopsticks

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,400
are top-quality mutton fat jade.

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
and the entrance.

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,840
should be washed with hot spring water.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
Wolf.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,560
She must have a reason

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,140
must have her reasons.

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,250
It's not as simple as you think.

37
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,090
The Imperial Guard?

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,240
How did this lowly

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,840
find out who I am?

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,320
This person is not simple.

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
When I fought her just now,

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,520
the sword on her waist

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,720
is a soft sword.

44
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,800
Only the Imperial Guards in the palace have it.

45
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,680
I guess this lady

46
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,120
from Chang’an.

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,400
Lang,

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,160
how can you say

49
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,960
you are knowledgeable?

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,760
What Lang?

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,079
I told you my name is the Monster Wolf.

52
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,960
You blew the yellow cow skin.

53
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,640
The thief, Nether Wolf.

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,040
He's just a thief.

55
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,120
How arrogant!

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,960
This chain is locked in death row.

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,440
It's made of iron.

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,400
The lock is created by the descendants of Mo family.

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,000
You...

60
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,160
don't waste your time.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,040
I think you have an extraordinary temperament.

62
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,079
and knowledgeable.

63
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,880
You must have a good background.

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,880
But why did you

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,090
such a sneaky thing?

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,160
I was...

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,560
Forget it.

68
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,920
I have nothing to say to people like you.

69
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,880
Next door.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,880
Tell me.

71
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,970
What is this bronze mirror?

72
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,500
I'll get it for you.

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,720
I think

74
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,360
you want to own it.

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,260
Even if he revealed his identity,

76
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,560
I can't let him know.

77
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,420
I'm here for the Xuanyuan mirror.

78
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,080
Legend has it that there are four magical mirrors in ancient times.

79
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,200
The Xuanyuan mirror can prolong your life.

80
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,360
Prince Qin's bone mirror

81
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,600
can reflect the bone and meridians of human body.

82
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,320
The Liunose Mirror knows the cause and effect.

83
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,120
The Wujie Mirror can cure the pain.

84
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,380
My father was a royal guard in the palace.

85
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,160
I don't know where he got the evil aura.

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,240
I'm not feeling well.

87
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,519
No medicine can cure him.

88
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,680
I traveled all over the world

89
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,440
to find the legendary Wujie Mirror.

90
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
to cure my father.

91
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
You have good eyesight.

92
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,960
My sword on my waist

93
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,930
was indeed taught by my father.

94
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,440
A free meal.

95
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,570
I won't eat for free.

96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,800
When I'm full,

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,040
I'll escape.

98
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,760
Are you crazy?

99
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,640
Lang.

100
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,370
Miss Yu saved your life.

101
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,840
saved your life.

102
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Even if this meal doesn't poison us,

103
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,980
we can't escape the next meal.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,160
Looks like

105
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,160
can't stay here.

106
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,120
I can't die here.

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,330
I'm leaving now.

108
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,480
Where do you think the Governor's office is?

109
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
One step at a time.

110
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,320
Take five steps.

111
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,720
There are different orders.

112
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,920
You don't know.

113
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,000
Even if you can get out of the prison,

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,480
we can't get out of the Governor's Office.

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,400
Since you know the Governor so well,

116
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,200
I'd like to hear your opinion.

117
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,640
Make a diversion.

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,560
That will do.

119
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,280
Help! Fire!

120
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,040
Help!

121
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
Help! Help!

122
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,120
Help!

123
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,160
Help! Help! Help!

124
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:02,800
Hurry!

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,240
Put out the fire!

126
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,320
What are you doing?

127
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,000
Isn't it faster to get in and light the fire?

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Then why did you light the grass in my prison?

129
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,260
Aren't you coming with me?

130
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,000
Otherwise, how would I know if you are right?

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I didn't say I won't leave, Lang.

132
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,920
Help! Help!

133
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,000
Fire! Put out the fire!

134
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,080
Yeah!

135
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,040
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

136
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:57,960
Get changed.

137
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,720
Sword.

138
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,800
Take him away.

139
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
I'm innocent, my lord.

140
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,090
Cut the crap.

141
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,320
Looks like we have

142
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,330
has informed the whole city

143
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,690
The prison has escaped.

144
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,440
but the city gate

145
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,400
can't get out.

146
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's get out if we can't.

147
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,010
Let's get out of here first.

148
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,360
If we break in,

149
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,000
we'll be more certain

150
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
we are the murderers.

151
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,640
What do you mean?

152
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,200
Are you blaming me?

153
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
I didn't say that.

154
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
For now,

155
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,600
is to investigate in secret

156
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,860
and find the murderer,

157
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,400
to get rid of us.

158
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,250
Where should we go next?

159
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,240
Autopsy.

160
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,080
Do you have to be so bold?

161
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,480
Don't talk if you can.

162
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,020
You've been talking a lot.

163
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,640
Foreign girls

164
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,880
is beautiful.

165
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
You're dead.

166
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,720
If you keep talking, I'll break your teeth.

167
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,120
He's not holding the Xuanyuan mirror.

168
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,840
It's the bone-reflecting mirror.

169
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,080
Where is the real Xuanyuan mirror?

170
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,040
Her heart is missing.

171
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,880
Could she be eaten by a demon?

172
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,560
No.

173
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,360
There are traces of suturing.

174
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,280
The technique is brilliant.

175
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,560
