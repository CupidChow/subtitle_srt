1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,520
It's yours. It's mine. It's mine. It's mine. It's mine. It's mine. It's mine. It's mine. It's mine. It's mine.

2
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,380
It's yours, isn't it? It's yours.

3
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,160
No.

4
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,280
What's wrong? What's wrong?

5
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,340
You can't admit it?

6
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,160
This is the finger set from the body in the box.

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,730
This finger set.

8
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,010
Miss Xu also has one.

9
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,820
It should be customized by the Xu family.

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,039
To prove

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,680
that the body was Miss Xu.

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,039
put her finger set

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,300
on the female body.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,400
But your fingers are strong.

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,600
It's easy to fall off with a female body.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,400
That's why I picked it up.

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,800
As long as this finger set

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,440
matches your finger,

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,840
it can prove

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,800
that body is not Miss Xu.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,920
Xu Xu.

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,560
Do you dare to wear it?

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,200
Wu Ming.

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,160
You're too smart.

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,930
But I don't understand.

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,280
why you and Miss Xu

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,600
have gone through so much trouble to pretend to die?

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,840
To deceive us.

29
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,840
If I'm right,

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,440
they have been

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,820
have been collecting corpses for Granny Qiu

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,690
and making puppets.

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,440
Miss Xu.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,760
I'm here

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,280
to thank you,

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,320
I have another question.

37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,360
I dare not.

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm just a waiter.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
I'll tell you everything I know.

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,240
Miss Liu.

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
How did Miss Xu

42
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,880
the wound on the body?

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,000
Look.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,880
The stitches of the skin are different from female workers.

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,800
When the body is not stiff, use a small needle.

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,840
Or use a big needle

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,000
to stitch a big piece of meat.

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
The thin thread is used to stitch a small piece of meat

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,000
The threads are used to stitch the face.

50
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,200
And this gold thread

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,360
is used to connect bones.

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,920
to get a good meaning.

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,960
In the next life,

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,079
in the next life.

55
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,880
Miss Xu.

56
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,520
Do you know

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,280
how to make puppets?

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
What puppet?

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,460
I've never heard of it.

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,080
Sister.

61
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,690
There's a corpse in the execution ground.

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,840
A guest is here.

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,640
We accidentally saw it again.

64
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,370
where the puppets were stored.

65
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,520
They were afraid of being exposed,

66
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
they could only pretend to die

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,460
to escape our investigation.

68
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,000
Look.

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,920
Miss Liu.

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,720
Why is her body here?

71
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,440
Yes.

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,440
Didn't we bury Lady Liu?

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,170
Could it be a zombie?

74
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,360
Nameless.

75
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,280
It's...

76
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,079
This...

77
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,440
I believe the secret room

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,680
is the entrance to the secret room.

79
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't think you need someone

80
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
to admit it.

81
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:52,720
You...

82
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,280
Let go.

83
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,160
All right.

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,440
Don't bother.

85
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,120
You're right.

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,960
Can you tell us

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,520
who you are helping?

88
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,880
Making puppets.

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,720
Where is Miss Xu now?

90
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,160
No!

91
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,800
No!

92
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,320
I work for Granny Qiu.

93
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,840
Father.

94
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,240
Father!

95
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,200
Why? Why?

96
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,400
I created you.

97
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,840
Why did you drag us into this?

98
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,360
Xu Yan, go!

99
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,530
Are you okay?

100
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,200
I'm fine.

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,000
Miss Yu.

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,010
We don't live together.

103
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,560
It's not bad to die together.

104
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
Cut the crap.

105
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,040
Who wants to die with you?

106
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,640
What time is it now?

107
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,280
Stop talking.

108
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,080
Come and help!

109
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,360
These puppets won't stop until they die!

110
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,200
It's not going to work.

111
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,880
They're afraid of sunlight.

112
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,440
My father...

113
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,320
Your father is dead. Go!

114
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,040
Father, go!

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,480
Look at him.

116
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,360
become a puppet too?

117
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,920
Can you say something auspicious?

118
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,240
No.

119
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,600
Look at him.

120
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,760
How can I say auspicious words?

121
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,159
I wish him the bliss soon.

122
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,530
It's corpse poison.

123
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,050
My disciple.

124
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,400
Chang'an will have a big change.

125
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,800
It's to save the people.

126
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,240
There will be changes in Chang'an.

127
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,040
You're indeed a deity.

128
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,080
You can even predict a big change in Chang'an.

129
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,920
I hope

130
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
is safe and sound.

131
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,880
As you can see,

132
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,760
In order to achieve their goal,

133
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,240
to achieve their goal.

134
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,050
and disregard human lives.

135
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,680
Do you know

136
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,200
you and Miss Xu

137
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,880
are helping the evil.

138
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,840
If you don't get lost,

139
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,440
the gate is over there.

140
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,570
Leave immediately.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,260
I will never report it to the government.

142
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,480
Even if you don't want to save the people of Tang,

143
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,880
you should think about your sister.

144
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,880
When her puppet production is done,

145
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,450
she won't end up much better than your father.

146
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,010
What do you want to know?

147
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,960
I'll tell you everything I know.

148
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,400
I'll tell you everything.

149
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,000
Please save my sister.

150
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't let her follow my father's footsteps.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,480
Okay.

152
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,040
I promise you.

153
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,200
Tell me.

154
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,720
What does Granny Qiu want you to do?

155
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,320
