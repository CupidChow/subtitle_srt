1
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,180
Thank you for your help today.

2
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,980
Forgive my poor hospitality.

3
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,410
Please take your leave now.

4
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,540
Brother Xu.

5
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,800
I know you're in unbearable grief right now.

6
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,530
But I have something to ask you.

7
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,980
My family has suffered a tragedy.

8
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,340
Forgive me for not seeing you out.

9
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,370
Then I'll take my leave.

10
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,200
Little boy sitting on the bench.

11
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,240
Crying and shouting for a wife.

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,840
Where's the coffin?

13
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,400
Little boy sitting on the bench.

14
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,400
Crying and shouting for a wife.

15
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,479
Little boy.

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,210
Where's the stone path?

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,800
How did they all disappear?

18
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,840
Were our eyes deceived by ghosts this afternoon?

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,880
That's impossible.

20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,539
All three of us clearly saw it.

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,840
Why haven't you left yet?

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,640
Hey, Xu.

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,280
Didn't you have a coffin in your courtyard?

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,009
With a stone passage inside it?

25
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,479
I sold the coffin.

26
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,890
What stone passage?

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,490
What are you talking about?

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,000
Mr. Xu.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,520
This afternoon, we found a stone passage in the coffin

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,680
leading to a secret chamber.

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,920
The chamber contained more than a dozen puppets.

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,050
Uncle Xu was with us.

33
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,009
He saw it too.

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,740
Father.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,520
Did you really

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,700
see any secret chamber with them?

38
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,560
Little boy sitting on a stool,

39
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,240
crying and begging for a wife.

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,000
Little boy.

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,840
Sitting on a stool.

42
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,800
Little boy sitting on a stool.

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,160
This place is heavy with yin energy.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,640
We must have been deceived by ghosts.

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,940
In broad daylight,

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,320
how could there be any ghosts?

47
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,120
Now that Miss Xu has unexpectedly passed away,

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,200
our leads have gone cold.

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,400
What should we do now?

50
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,490
We had just found Miss Xu

51
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
when she unexpectedly died.

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
How could such a coincidence exist?

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,640
How was the scene cleaned up so quickly?

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
I'll go up and take a look.

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,450
There's only one strangulation mark.

56
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,980
Where is everyone?

57
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,600
How did you get up here?

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
We took the stairs.

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,530
Why would we fly?

60
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Thread marks.

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,840
Ice silkworm thread.

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,120
Strange.

63
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,170
Where did this ice silkworm thread come from?

64
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,920
I suspect Miss Xu's death

65
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,090
was not an accident.

66
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,770
Then tomorrow we can go ask the craftsmen.

67
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,770
If it's true,

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,600
the killer has probably already fled the city.

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,810
Isn't that obvious?

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,880
Those boxes containing rubble and debris,

71
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,760
where are they?

72
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240
If they're items that caused someone's death,

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,200
they'll be kept at the county office for seven days.

74
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,400
Let's go to the county office tomorrow.

75
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,120
Get out!

76
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,000
We just want to take a look at the boxes.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,460
Get out!

78
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,920
Mere legal clerks from Bingzhou Prefecture

79
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,050
dare to trespass in the county office.

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,420
Get out!

81
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,220
Is that box really important?

82
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,079
If we want to find out the cause of Miss Xu's death,

83
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,140
that box is the key.

84
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,330
I'll figure something out.

85
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,840
Yu Jianying of the Imperial Guard,

86
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,570
reporting back to the capital.

87
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
I gave you 10 days to find the Xuanyuan Mirror.

88
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,840
Why are you two days late?

89
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
I await your reprimand, Father.

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,480
So you know you deserve punishment.

91
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,960
I sent you to find the divine mirror,

92
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,400
you've been gone for over a month,

93
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
have you found it?

94
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,440
Not yet,

95
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,920
but I've found a lead on the thief.

96
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
They're in Wannian County.

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,980
Before you left, I told you

98
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
to only find the mirror.

99
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,240
The tomb robber and mirror thief are not your concern.

100
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,370
Have you forgotten?

101
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,370
As expected,

102
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,010
women cannot handle important tasks.

103
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,760
Please don't be angry, Father.

104
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,600
Once we confirm the thief's identity

105
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,560
and capture them,

106
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,040
the location of the Xuanyuan Mirror

107
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,640
will naturally be revealed.

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,080
Then tell me,

109
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,400
who is this mirror thief?

110
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,000
The phantom thief Minglang,

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,530
Li Chong.

112
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,240
Absurd!

113
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,740
The palace guarded by the Imperial Guard

114
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,400
cannot be so easily infiltrated

115
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,520
by some rural bandit.

116
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,159
Not so.

117
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,440
This person has another identity.

118
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,960
The legitimate grandson of the former crown prince.

119
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,680
Really?

120
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,000
This

121
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,690
is from the General for you.

122
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,360
With this token in hand,

123
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,240
you can freely enter and exit Wannian County.

124
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,760
Please convey my thanks to the General.

125
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,800
Are you certain Li Chong

126
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,440
will definitely accompany you to the county office?

127
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:52,880
Yes.

128
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,120
Just focus on your part.

129
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,800
I'll take care of the rest.

130
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,409
Understood.

131
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,000
Why are there silk threads on the rope?

132
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,300
This rope shows no signs of breaking or being cut by a blade.

133
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,120
So Miss Xu's death

134
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,980
was truly no accident.

135
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,400
What?

136
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Is something wrong?

137
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,360
This smell...

138
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
I understand now.

139
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,040
Li Chong, remnant of the former dynasty,

140
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,480
by order of the Commander of the Imperial Guard,

141
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
you are under arrest.

142
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Unauthorized personnel

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,540
will be stopped

144
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,620
with deadly force.

145
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,400
Master.

146
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,240
Why are you

147
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,280
so anxious

148
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,890
yet saying nothing?

149
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,460
I fear causing offense

150
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,100
and dare not speak rashly.

151
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,640
You have doubts

152
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,200
about me.

153
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,810
I wouldn't dare.

154
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,650
It's just...

155
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,880
The fact that Li Chong is the direct grandson of the former crown prince...

156
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,480
Only you, me

157
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,000
and Miss Yu know about it.

158
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,960
And since I serve as an official in court...

159
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,040
Li Chong's arrest

160
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,960
naturally makes me

161
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,360
the prime suspect for informing the court.

162
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,200
It's just that

163
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,890
I don't understand.

164
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,720
Why are you so...

165
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,920
My mind is restless

166
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,880
and my thoughts clouded.

167
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,480
Since you have these doubts,

168
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,960
whatever I say

169
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,440
will be useless.

170
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,120
I can only tell you

171
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,640
the informant had no choice.

172
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,760
It was also to help you investigate the case.

173
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,160
The current solution...

174
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,490
If there's a breakthrough in the case,

175
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,500
then Li Chong's danger

176
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
will resolve itself.

177
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
Are you here to confront me?

178
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,650
I wouldn't dare.

179
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,560
It's just that my foster father promised

180
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
that once I find evidence of Li Chong stealing the mirror,

181
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,120
it wouldn't be too late to pass judgment.

182
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,400
Remnants of the previous dynasty

183
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,640
plotting to overthrow the throne

184
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,880
do we still need evidence?

185
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,840
Under torture,

186
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,880
he will surely confess.

187
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,140
If we do as you suggest,

188
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,090
what if we alert him and he escapes?

189
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,120
Can you bear that responsibility?

190
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
I cannot.

191
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,919
But the evidence against Li Chong

192
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,880
still has many questionable points.

193
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,919
Moreover, I've discovered

194
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,440
the mirror thief has other motives.

195
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,900
Enough.

196
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,080
Your only task is to track down the Xuanyuan Mirror.

197
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,480
Don't concern yourself with anything else.

198
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
I don't want to say this a third time.

199
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,080
Now that the mirror thief has been caught,

200
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,520
you'll be credited with the achievement.

201
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,760
Take three days to rest,

202
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,160
then report to the Imperial Guard.

203
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,800
Father.

204
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,400
Yes.
