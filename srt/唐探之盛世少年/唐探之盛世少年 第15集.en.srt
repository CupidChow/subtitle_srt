1
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,560
Li Chong of the previous dynasty

2
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,400
fled to this day.

3
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,380
and refuses to repent.

4
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,840
and rob people.

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,400
and rob a commoner.

6
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,000
It's a heinous crime.

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,160
He will be executed at three quarter past noon.

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,800
Time is up.

9
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,680
Execute him!

10
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,400
Kneel!

11
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,320
Kneel down!

12
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,620
What happened?

13
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,050
Did someone break into the execution ground?

14
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,240
Execute him now!

15
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Why is it so windy?

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,640
Go.

17
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,680
Check him.

18
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,050
Yes, my lord.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,400
The coroner has been identified.

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,600
The criminal is dead.

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Good.

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,560
Come and help me.

23
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,480
It's my fault.

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,960
It's my fault.

25
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,650
It's not your fault.

26
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,900
Don't take it to heart.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,680
Let's go.

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,720
Don't delay the funeral.

29
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,480
What took you so long?

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
If you were a little late,

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,480
I’ll suffocate to death.

32
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,600
How long has it been since you took a shower in prison, Lang?

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
It stinks.

34
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,520
You'll be locked up in prison for a few days.

35
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,200
I do stink.

36
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,530
I smelled quite good in the coffin.

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,320
I thought it was my body scent.

38
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,300
Stop laughing.

39
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,760
I was almost scared to death.

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,000
Li Chong.

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,210
Why are you suddenly apologizing?

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,640
I'm fine.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,560
But

45
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,560
I should've told you in advance.

46
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,880
If you do,

47
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,040
your head

48
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,760
will be landed.

49
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,840
Time is up.

50
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,560
Execute!

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,840
Kneel!

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,280
Kneel!

53
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,620
What happened?

54
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,010
Did someone break into the execution ground?

55
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,320
Execute immediately!

56
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,360
Nameless.

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,280
Miss Yu.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,480
You two saved my life.

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,480
Although I am a noble,

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
I know how to repay

61
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,000
I understand.

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,700
From now on,

63
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,280
I'll be by your side.

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,520
There's always a way.

65
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
We'll cover it up.

66
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
I'm willing to serve you.

67
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
I won’t regret it.

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,720
Lang.

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,290
When did you become so serious?

70
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm not used to it.

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,760
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,220
I've always been serious.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,840
Just leave.

74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
I don't want the government to know.

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
there's a dead wanted criminal in my house.

76
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,760
Xu,

77
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,250
Thank you for your help.

78
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
Thanks to you today,

79
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,720
thanks to you.

80
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,020
No need to thank me.

81
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,360
If Nameless hadn't threatened me

82
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,220
to threaten me,

83
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,920
I won't help you.

84
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,560
What?

85
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,290
You killed your sister.

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,400
Xu,

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,640
Stop acting.

88
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Actually, Miss Xu

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,260
is not dead.

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,240
You...

91
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,690
What are you talking about?

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
Didn't you carve out

93
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,240
of my murder?

94
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:32,840
I...

95
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,000
I admit that I killed someone.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,530
You don't have to protect me

97
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,860
just because I helped you.

98
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,040
It's rare that you want the murderer's name.

99
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,490
I asked Brother Xu to help me

100
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,440
to verify my deduction.

101
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:52,880
What?

102
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,409
Something's wrong.

103
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:55,960
This smell...

104
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,120
I see.

105
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,200
There was a strange smell

106
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,600
a strange smell.

107
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,100
It's the same as

108
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,640
we smelled the same scent

109
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,680
I smelled the same smell.

110
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,720
This body...

111
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,640
looks familiar.

112
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,330
It's that demon.

113
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,320
Why is he dead here?

114
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,840
I knew it.

115
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,920
How could someone be invincible?

116
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,880
This is the same smell

117
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,410
to replace Li Chong's body.

118
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
What does it mean?

119
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,159
The taste is the same.

120
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,700
How can you prove that Miss Xu is still alive?

121
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,840
These corpses

122
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,370
have a characteristic.

123
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
It's not rotten for days.

124
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,640
If my deduction is right,

125
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,760
the smell

126
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,560
is a unique preservative

127
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,010
unique preservatives.

128
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,130
can slow down the decay of the body.

129
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,600
It really doesn't smell like a corpse.

130
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,060
but a light smell of herbs.

131
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,440
So what?

132
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
As a second-leather craftsman,

133
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
we have our own preservative drugs.

134
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
That's right.

135
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,760
It's just that there's something else. It's just that there's something else. It's not that. It's not like that.

136
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,680
But why

137
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,440
hit Miss Xu's box?

138
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,760
on Miss Xu's box.

139
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,640
That means

140
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,320
that box

141
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,360
There was a body

142
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,440
and damaged face.

143
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,840
You mean

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,880
the dead one

145
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,760
was the body hidden in the box.

146
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
not Miss Xu.

147
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,240
That's right.

148
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,120
Miss Xu

149
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,040
When the box hits herself,

150
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,409
and hide in the crew.

151
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,880

Do you have proof?

157
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Is it because something is missing?

No.
