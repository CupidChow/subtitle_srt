1
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,000
Who is he? He's a guy. He's a kid. He's a kid. He's a kid.

2
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,240
Who are you talking about?

3
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,160
The one who eats.

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,800
Sanfen looks like a human, 70% like a ghost.

5
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,200
Yes.

6
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,200
That one is obviously not a good pastry.

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,920
He looks cunning.

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,180
Yes.

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,800
You're defaming others behind their backs.

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,600
It's not good.

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,600
Tell me.

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,000
Didn't you two go your separate ways?

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,120
Why are you following me?

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,320
Who's following you?

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,560
We're... We're...

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,200
It's...

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
How do you explain it, Miss Yu?

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,920
Miss Liu saved our lives.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,039
You can save her.

20
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:18,840
We can save him too.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,240
Right.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,410
Miss Yu is right.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
This is the duty of the law.

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,200
But with your help,

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm very happy.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,860
Waiter.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,740
Thank you, sir.

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,400
Why is this village so shabby?

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,240
It is said that there is a fairy spring in this village.

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,000
The spring can prolong your life.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,920
That's why it's known as Quan Village.

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,080
The villagers are strong.

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,210
and rarely get sick.

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,680
Did you get it wrong?

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,600
This place is completely different

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,660
from what you said.

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,700
It's getting late.

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,900
It's going to rain.

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's find a place to sleep. Okay.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,330
Okay.

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,600
The formation of the Big Dipper

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,840
is here?

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,760
Tell him to find some firewood.

44
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,960
What took you so long?

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,880
Li Chong.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
Why did you cut so many firewood?

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,370
Just in case.

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,680
Just in case?

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,760
I think you're too strong

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,920
to spend.

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,690
If there's no firewood,

52
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,170
I don't have to pick up firewood alone.

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,680
Alright, let's get down to business.

54
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,280
Since they tried to kill you,

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:26,920
Ta...

56
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,200
Why don't you use me as the bait?

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,600
No.

58
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,040
No.

59
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,480
Miss Liu will be in danger after a long time.

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,010
There is no better plan now.

61
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,940
How about this?

62
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,800
Lang and I

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,480
helped you secretly.

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,140
The place where the fairy aura was floating,

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,100
Now that you've become like this,

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,400
there must be something behind it.

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,660
Bah.

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,480
It's blowing, right?

69
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,850
What Quan Xian Village?

70
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,209
and prolonged life.

71
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,240
It's all a lie.

72
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,640
Oh no!

73
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,520
Grandma!

74
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,280
Are you okay?

75
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,740
Something must have happened to Miss Yu.

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,409
Let's go.

77
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you doing?

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,760
Let go of me!

79
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,400
Don't touch my eyes!

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,880
My eyes!

81
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,240
Hello?

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,680
Bastard!

83
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,290
I told you to protect him in secret.

84
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,600
Where is he at the critical moment?

85
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,360
Nameless.

86
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,560
Li Chong.

87
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
Come and save me!

88
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,159
I'll kill you all!

89
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,640
Who is it?

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,040
Who?

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,160
What?

92
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,160
Eyes.

93
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,920
You...

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,680
Yes.

95
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,480
It's us.

96
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,040
Who else

97
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,090
who else can protect you in secret?

98
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Get lost!

99
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,240
Hush!

100
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Lower your voice.

101
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,330
This is not the time to yell.

102
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,480
Keep your eyes.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,040
Watch your mouth.

104
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
Anyway, both of you

105
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,200
between you two.

106
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,880
The world is filled with hatred.

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,160
How could you say that about us?

108
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,200
We are so good to you.

109
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,320
I don't mind him.

110
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,120
I...

111
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,680
I'm passionate towards you.

112
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,720
and sincere.

113
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,680
How could you say that?

114
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,210
Get lost!

115
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,080
You too.

116
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,040
Remember this.

117
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,580
I won't let you two off.

118
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,220
If it weren't for the sake of Miss Liu,

119
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,440
you...

120
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,800
And you.

121
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,320
You're all dead.

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,040
Here's the thing.

123
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,090
What is this?

124
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,000
sleeping potion.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,130
Something really happened to Miss Yu.

126
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,860
We don't have Miss Yu's tracking skills,

127
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,280
but we have a way.

128
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,280
By the way,

129
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
the sachet you gave Miss Yu.

130
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,560
If I'm right,

131
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,760
it should be a couple.

132
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,000
How did you know?

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,730
Give it to me.

134
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,120
Why do you want it?

135
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,720
Do you still want to save her?

136
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,210
Is this a dog's nose?

137
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,420
Miss Yu.

138
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,540
Miss Yu!

139
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,040
She's unconscious.

140
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,440
She won't wake up so soon.

141
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,680
This is a memorial for the mountain spirit.

142
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,410
It seems to be Miss Liu kidnapped by these people.

143
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:14,880
Lang.

144
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,400
To save Miss Liu,

145
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
to save Miss Liu.

146
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,360
What do you mean?

147
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,840
Get some lamb blood from the sacrifice

148
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,000
and hide them in the organs.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Cut some onions.

150
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,160
I'll tell you the details later.

151
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,680
Okay.

152
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,000
Let go of me!

153
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,760
Don't touch my eyes.

154
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,840
Don't touch my eyes.

155
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,600
My eyes.

156
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Scallion.

157
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,240
Sheep blood.

158
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,680
You are so cruel.

159
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,210
It's better to be prepared.

160
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,650
Hush.

161
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,100
Someone is coming.

162
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:11,920
