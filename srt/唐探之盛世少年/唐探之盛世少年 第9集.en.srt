1
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,130
It is said that there are four magical mirrors

2
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,520
The Xuanyuan mirror can prolong your life.

3
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,680
Prince Qin's bone mirror

4
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,920
can reflect the bone and meridians of human body.

5
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,640
The Liunose Mirror knows the cause and effect.

6
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,570
The Wujie Mirror can cure the pain.

7
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,400
It is said that there is a fairy spring in this village.

8
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,120
The spring can prolong your life.

9
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,180
That's why I'm known as Izumi Samura.

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,600
He's alive!

11
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,410
You're so tough.

12
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,560
Thank you for saving me.

13
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,240
May I ask

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,560
a man and a woman?

15
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,759
I don't know.

16
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,520
There are a lot of bodies.

17
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,040
Give me a hand.

18
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,680
I'll take you to your friend.

19
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,440
Okay.

20
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,040
Let’s go. Let’s go.

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,370
Look at you. Look at you.

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,079
Wu Ming.

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,120
I'm glad you're okay. I'm glad you're okay.

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,840
Great.

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,500
Now we can dig one less pit.

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
Are you hurt?

27
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,160
No.

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,240
You're so lucky.

29
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
We both got hurt.

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,290
My arms are swollen.

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,079
Are you okay?

32
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,560
Of course I'm tough.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,480
Let's not talk about this.

34
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Where is Miss Liu?

35
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,980
Where is Miss Liu's wound?

36
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,480
I want to thank this lady.

37
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,040
She's a skin craftsman from Chang'an.

38
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,100
She made a corpse makeup for Miss Liu.

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
May I ask your name?

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,920
Where do you live?

41
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,640
I will visit you to thank you in the future.

42
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,100
Xu Qiniang from Chang'an.

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,960
You don't have to come and thank me.

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,560
I took money from the villagers

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,690
to get their bodies.

46
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,640
and save you.

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,520
I just

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,160
for this lady.

49
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,240
for this lady.

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,640
Consider it a good deed.

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,360
Ha Kiyoko.

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:26,960
Yes.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
I don't know what happened to that river.

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,300
corpses often appear.

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,160
As time goes by, the Yin energy is too strong.

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,120
It's easy for water ghosts to gather.

57
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,720
The river is under the cliff.

58
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,079
It's a good place for those people to dump their bodies after the murder.

59
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,360
You were lucky

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,660
You were not replaced by the water ghost.

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,480
A substitute?

62
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,520
There are no ghosts in this world.

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,579
There are many people who hurt people in ghost clothes.

64
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,480
How do you know there are no ghosts in the world?

65
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,960
If ghosts punish evil,

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,480
why do we need the law?

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,880
You don't have to believe me.

68
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
Please bury these bodies.

69
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,000
You disrespect ghosts and gods.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
What's the use of saving him?

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,380
Let's go! Let's go!

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,480
Give me a hand.

73
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,210
Hurry up.

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,760
Miss Liu.

75
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,480
Take care.

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
Have a good life soon.

77
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,730
Don't suffer like this.

78
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,340
I'll take that as a yes.

79
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,120
Thank you.

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,370
Doctor, you're not going to let her go?

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
Your eyes are about to fall on someone else.

82
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,360
How are

83
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,320
How are you?

84
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,520
It's just a minor injury.

85
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,360
is nothing

86
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm fine.

87
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,480
I'll be fine after a few days. Okay.

88
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,360
This time,

89
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,200
not only did you two get hurt,

90
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,800
but also failed to save Miss Liu.

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,360
In the prosperity of Tang,

92
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,040
how could there be such a foolish person who disregards human life?

93
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,920
Be careful.

94
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,840
Tell me.

95
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,600
They dug so many girls' eyes

96
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,880
to worship the mountain spirit?

97
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,960
It seems

98
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,620
is not that simple.

99
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,570
Quan Xian Village is famous for the fairy spring.

100
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,800
Now the fairy spring in Quan Xian Village

101
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,720
is a pile of rotten water.

102
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,720
Perhaps that's why

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
the villagers of Izusei Village

104
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,040
believed the demons

105
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,940
and killed girls for them.

106
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,640
The village was destroyed

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,600
is due to

108
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,920
to buy girls for demons.

109
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,800
by demons.

110
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,760
So,

111
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,480
the mastermind

112
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,220
were those two murderers.

113
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Are those villagers that stupid?

114
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,490
Those two demons...

115
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
They kill as they are told.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
I told them to dig their eyes.

117
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,920
That's right.

118
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Get a new one.

119
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,400
It seems that the two of them have tainted the fairy spring

120
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,600
which led to the corruption of the spring.

121
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,920
So the demons used it to seduce the villagers

122
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,040
to make use of them.

123
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,480
Unfortunately, I didn't kill those two demons.

124
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,540
to avenge Miss Liu.

125
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,520
When I recover,

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll use my Tracking Jutsu

127
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,080
to find the whereabouts of the two demons

128
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,320
and bring them to justice.

129
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,760
and avenge Miss Liu.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
Your tracking skills

131
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
is indeed superb.

132
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,080
But we need to leave a few hours behind.

133
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,120
We delayed for a few days.

134
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,320
It'll be hard

135
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,560
to track them.

136
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:57,840
Besides,

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,840
those villagers were deeply bewitched.

138
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,320
If we show up again,

139
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,320
they will attack us together.

140
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,050
We can't just sit and do nothing

141
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,810
and let Miss Liu die in vain?

142
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,400
Of course not.

143
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,600
The most important thing in this case

144
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,120
to find out

145
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,800
dig people's eyes

146
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,880
with blood?

147
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,240
Are they making

148
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,620
immortality pill?

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,360
But I've never heard of

150
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,480
to use this sorcery to cultivate alchemy.

151
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,120
Yes.

152
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,280
They put Miss Liu's eyes

153
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,680
into her blood.

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,920
There's no need

155
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,380
to such a remote mountain.

156
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,640
The most important thing

157
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,040
the most important thing

158
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,200
is the spring.

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,520
Look.

160
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,000
But I still don't understand.

161
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,880
what this ancient mirror

162
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
What does this ancient mirror mean?

163
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,600
The reason why the immortal spring can remove blood

164
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,440
and healthy.

165
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,420
It's because of this ancient mirror.

166
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,480
This mirror

167
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,880
is the Wujie Mirror that Miss Yu has been looking for.

168
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,920
I think so too.

169
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,780
We both fell off the cliff,

170
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
I was in a coma in the water for a long time.

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,200
Not only did I not die,

172
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,640
but his body is intact.

173
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
I'm alive.

174
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,040
