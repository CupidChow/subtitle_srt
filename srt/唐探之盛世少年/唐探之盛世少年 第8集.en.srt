1
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Here. Here. Here.

2
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,920
Come on. Come on.

3
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,360
You're too cruel.

4
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,880
Be prepared.

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,980
Let's go! Let's go!

6
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,090
Someone's here.

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,440
Miss Yu.

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,620
Iâ€™ll have to wait a little longer.

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,160
No.

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,360
What now?

11
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,160
You're looking for Miss Liu.

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,090
can't be wasted.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's go. Let's go.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,120
Let's play it by ear.

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,560
Yes.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,780
Come on.

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,640
Let's go.

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,920
So this is the eye of the Spring of Fairy.

19
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,520
It was intercepted by these two

20
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,450
the spring in the village dried up.

21
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,640
The clouds were too weak.

22
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,400
At the beginning of the catastrophe,

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,320
[When you meet someone,]

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,960
or sinking or floating.

25
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,400
or floating.

26
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,000
A little

27
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,360
to play the cave seal.

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,120
The second book.

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,079
It's obvious.

30
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
It's written in the air.

31
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
Bow to the ground.

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,200
Three kowtows to pray for the soul.

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
The other one.

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,680
What's that?

35
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,079
These girls

36
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,120
are the closest to what the King needs.

37
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,520
The blood pearl is still not transmuted.

38
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,440
Give me your eyes.

39
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,320
Blood pearl.

40
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,380
Your eyes are still there.

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Of course.

42
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,279
Tell me.

43
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,370
What's going on?

44
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,800
Come out.

45
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,880
Miss Yu, don't be afraid.

46
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,010
You're coming at me.

47
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,320
Kill them!

48
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,240
Lang.

49
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,640
How much did you eat these days?

50
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,560
So heavy.

51
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,560
You are weak.

52
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,820
I...

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,460
I'm covered with muscles.

54
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,800
Try to stall him.

55
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
I'll save him!

56
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,920
Don't underestimate me.

57
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,120
The thief, Nether Wolf, has never lost.

58
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:16,970
Let's go.

59
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,800
Miss Yu.

60
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,760
Miss Yu.

61
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,340
You're finally awake.

62
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,520
Nameless.

63
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,840
You made me rush into the battle.

64
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,400
You're flirting with girls.

65
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,200
When I get out,

66
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360
when I get out.

67
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
I'll go help Li Chong.

68
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,880
Miss Liu.

69
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,000
Miss Liu!

70
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,560
Miss Liu!

71
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,680
No!

72
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,140
It's me.

73
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,850
I'm the Jade Sword Boat.

74
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,130
Don't be afraid.

75
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm here.

76
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,600
Please.

77
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,800
please save the girls.

78
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,680
Miss Liu!

79
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,120
You old hag!

80
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,560
I'm going to kill you today.

81
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,020
I'll dig out your eyes too.

82
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Don't.

83
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,560
Miss, I'm controlled by others.

84
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,320
I have to do this.

85
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,480
Please let me go.

86
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,080
You are a good person.

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,720
Please be generous.

88
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,920
Please let me go.

89
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,160
It's done!

90
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,120
The blood pearl has become...

91
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,460
Don't get involved with them.

92
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,320
Are you okay?

93
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,850
I'm fine.

94
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,690
Go after him!

95
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
Your name is Jade Sword Boat, right?

96
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,440
I'll remember you.

97
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,600
If you can survive,

98
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,860
I will come back to you.

99
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,360
The smoke is poisonous.

100
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,420
There's no way out.

101
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,760
We have to jump from the waterfall.

102
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,400
So high.

103
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,600
I'll drown even if I don't fall.

104
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,720
There's still a chance of survival.

105
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,040
We'll die if we stay here.

106
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,600
Wait.

107
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,420
Take Miss Liu with you.

108
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,960
She's already very pitiful.

109
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,290
I don't want her to die without a full body.

110
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,970
You go first.

111
