1
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,600
Say it! Say it!

2
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,720
Say it.

3
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,040
Have you eaten?

4
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,200
Push harder.

5
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,320
My body is itchy.

6
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,000
Why do you have to endure it?

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,760
As long as you tell me where the Xuanyuan mirror is,

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,420
you won't have to suffer this.

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,720
Not to mention

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,180
I don’t know the Xuanyuan mirror.

11
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,240
If I really knew,

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,640
I wouldn't tell you.

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,600
How dare you!

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,840
Sir.

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,160
Did you find the location of the camera? No.

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,680
No.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
He's very tough.

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,620
Don't say it. Don't say it.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,800
Don't bother.

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,760
Notify the Ministry of Justice

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,840
to be executed in three days.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,680
What about the Xuanyuan mirror?

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,140
Aren't you looking for it?

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,800
Don't worry. Let's go. Let's go.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,920
I have my own plan.

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,620
Miss Yu.

27
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,490
You're back.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,840
Come on, help me.

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,740
Hold this head.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,720
No.

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,560
Then how did you get the mark?

32
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,210
What are you talking about, Nameless?

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,560
The stitches of the skin are different from female workers.

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,480
When the body is not stiff, use a small needle.

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,520
Or use a big needle

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,640
to stitch a big piece of meat.

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,280
The thin thread is used to stitch a small piece of meat.

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,320
The threads are used to sew the face.

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,040
I see.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,060
Miss Yu.

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,850
Let's go.

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,860
Time to eat.

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,900
Where is he?

44
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,380
Father was kidnapped.

45
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,040
Father.

46
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,140
Brother Xu.

47
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,610
Long time no see.

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,480
Nameless!

49
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,860
What are you doing?

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,210
I have something

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,040
to ask you.

52
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,760
If you want to learn, ask.

53
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,240
Why did you kidnap my father

54
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,300
and didn't do this?

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm afraid you'll refuse.

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,280
Nameless.

57
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
I apologize.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,060
What are you doing?

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,130
Why don't you

60
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,960
Why should we hide ourselves?

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,520
Xu,

62
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,290
I don't think Miss Xu is the only one

63
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,959
in the Xu family for many years.

64
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,200
She's not as diligent as you,

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,240
but I've learned

66
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,370
my family heirloom skills.

67
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,080
That's it.

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,440
Did you

69
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,640
last month?

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,400
How do you know

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,040
You took away

72
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,680
You took it and sewed it up, right?

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,360
At first,

74
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,159
that Miss Xu did it.

75
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,720
But Granduo

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,460
was murdered in Pingzhou.

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,820
According to the time,

78
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,220
Miss Xu should be collecting corpses in Quan Xian Village.

79
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,040
I didn’t figure it out.

80
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,680
until

81
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,890
your appearance

82
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,520
The Xu family is a two-leather craftsman.

83
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,650
I was asked to sew the body with a heart.

84
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,280
What's the problem?

85
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,940
No problem.

86
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,680
It proves that

87
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,320
Miss Xu's death

88
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
was not an accident.

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,080
but you did it on purpose.

90
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,680
You...

91
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,810
I did a calculation.

92
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,740
I can't hit you.

93
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,520
You...

94
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,130
What do you mean?

95
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,680
I just engraved

96
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,240
the way you killed Miss Xu

97
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,040
to make it look like an accident.

98
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,680
Actually, you were at the side of the road

99
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,740
waiting for Miss Xu

100
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,360
to the trap you set.

101
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,690
Be careful, Miss Xu.

102
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,840
Take the silk thread back

103
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,400
when we save people.

104
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,240
If you want to disguise this murder plan as an accident,

105
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,900
the Xu family can only have it.

106
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,400
is as thin as hair,

107
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,400
but as strong as iron, the ice silk thread can do it.

108
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
Besides Miss Xu,

109
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,770
you're the only one.

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,280
Nonsense!

111
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,440
Do you have evidence?

112
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,400
I tested it.

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,200
A normal rope

114
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
can't leave such traces on a stick.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,960
Only the ice silk thread of your Xu family

116
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,560
can do it.

117
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,360
If you don't admit it,

118
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,560
I'll hand Lin Kun

119
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,560
to the County Government.

120
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
and demonstrate it in this way.

121
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,880
Tell me.

122
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,720
If the county magistrate

123
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,780
trust you or me?

124
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
or me?

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Fine.

126
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,720
Even if I did it,

127
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,480
why didn't you report it to the government?

128
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,010
Why did you kidnap my father

129
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,980
to lure me here?

130
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,440
How is it, uncle?

131
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,840
I told you to sit down and watch.

132
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,720
Isn't it fun?

133
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,400
Yes.

134
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,960
This big rock

135
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,400
It fell off

136
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,320
You scared me.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,120
As long as you promise Nameless one thing,

138
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
I won't report it to the government.

139
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,140
The remnants of the previous dynasty, Li Chong,

140
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,720
fled to this day.

is a heinous crime.

145

He will be executed at three quarter past noon.
