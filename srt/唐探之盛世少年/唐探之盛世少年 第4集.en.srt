1
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:51,960
Get out

2
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,560
Scream outside

3
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,170
Don't be crazy here.

4
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,600
Did you bully her?

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,930
It's not what you think.

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,360
I was healing her.

7
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,840
Heal her?

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How is your wound?

9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,080
I'm fine.

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,610
I'll get you some water.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:11,880
Wait.

12
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,280
What I saw just now...

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,520
if you dare to tell anyone,

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,650
I won't forgive you.

15
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,160
You're fine?

16
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,400
That's what you call

17
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,370
what you're talking about.

18
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,560
It's been three days since we found the mirror.

19
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,200
but I still couldn't find anything.

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,079
Now he brought me here.

21
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,640
About the bone-reflecting mirror,

22
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,280
I'll ask him later.

23
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,210
Don't worry.

24
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,840
I won't be as weak as him.

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,880
Sir.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,040
Let's go. It's your first time here, right?

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,200
Would you like to come in for a drink?

28
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,080
You're so handsome.

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,780
Let's go in.

30
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,440
Yes.

31
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
Find a girl to accompany you.

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,120
What are you looking at?

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,360
Sir.

34
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,400
Baby, don't run.

35
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,920
Baby.

36
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,560
Who is it?

37
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,280
How dare you hit me?

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,920
Stinky man!

39
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,320
Help! Kill him!

40
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,280
Stop! Stop!

41
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,920
It's us.

42
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,760
This is great.

43
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,820
The secret investigation has become clear.

44
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
You didn't tell me why you came here.

45
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,680
I thought you were looking for your lover.

46
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,520
He's looking for a lover.

47
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,780
Why are you so excited?

48
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,840
No.

49
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,900
What did you two do last night?

50
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
Where can I find you in the Land of Bliss?

51
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,440
and live a carefree life.

52
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,320
When others come to my place,

53
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,920
in my house.

54
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
but you're here to play with swords.

55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,480
I wonder

56
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,650
What do you mean?

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,760
Who is this?

58
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,200
He even recited a poem.

59
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,440
to monopolize the merchants.

60
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,000
brothel, gambling house,

61
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,920
Killer.

62
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
The underground emperor of the lower class.

63
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,800
Wang Ji.

64
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,840
I don't think the emperor

65
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,120
like him.

66
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,920
The power behind him cannot be underestimated.

67
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,000
I've been in the governor's office for more than a year.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,680
Every time I find his property,

69
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,360
Lord Fang would ask me to avoid it.

70
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,680
I think the power behind him

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,160
can't even offend Lord Fang.

72
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
Disgusting.

73
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,640
There's someone in the fat.

74
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,500
I've reported it to the governor.

75
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,760
The soldiers are probably on their way.

76
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,930
I advise you to tell us earlier.

77
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,800
If you want to make a living on my land,

78
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,520
Kneel.

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,840
Kowtow to me.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Maybe I won't mind your wreck,

81
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,680
and spare your life.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,280
Qingyue,

83
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,620
If you report us to the police,

84
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,560
I'm afraid when the soldiers arrive,

85
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,360
I have to

86
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,920
on the spot.

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,920
You're just a law officer.

88
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Tell me.

89
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,720
What did I do wrong?

90
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,800
The Land of Bliss

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,560
looks like a brothel.

92
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,560
but secretly,

93
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,560
behind my back?

94
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,760
Do I need to tell you?

95
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,920
The Land of Bliss

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,800
is the place of courtesans.

97
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,920
to pay taxes.

98
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,000
to admire the moon.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,760
Tell me

100
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
in private?

101
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,280
As you said,

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
it's fine.

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,640
I only have one question.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,200
Do you have

105
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,940
have a business contract?

106
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,760
As soon as I came in, I found that women in the manor look different.

107
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,280
They are not the people of Tang.

108
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
Most of them are women from the Western Region.

109
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,760
Since the opening of the court,

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,360
after the Emperor went to Goguryeo,

111
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,490
there will be no war.

112
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,360
Where did you get so many slaves?

113
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,159
Not to mention you didn't get permission from the government,

114
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,200
for colluding with merchants.

115
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,520
As I expected.

116
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,880
These slaves

117
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,120
must be you who colluded with the foreign realms.

118
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,200
If you stir up disputes between the two countries,

119
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,360
and start another war,

120
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,560
That's a capital offence to the nine clans.

121
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,800
How dare you!

122
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
How dare you do this in my territory!

123
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,160
I'll be rude.

124
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,180
What can you do?

125
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
As I expected,

126
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,920
You still want to take advantage of me now?

127
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,440
What?

128
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,280
Did he take advantage of you?

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,680
Did he?

130
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,520
Sir.

131
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,159
Please spare my life.

132
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,560
You want money?

133
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,400
I'll take you to the secret drawer to get it.

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,600
Who wants your money?

135
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,880
Let me ask you.

136
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,640
These girls are obedient to you.

137
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,560
Did you feed them

138
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,040
made from thorn apple?

139
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,200
thorn apple?

140
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,400
I don't know.

141
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,640
Young hero.

142
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,440
Be gentle.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
These girls must have been drugged.

144
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,659
Tell me.

145
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
Where did you get this drug?

146
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,120
I...

147
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,920
I bought it.

148
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,840
Where did you buy it

149
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,920
Over there.

150
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Blood Vine again.

151
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,800
The blood vine always appears at the critical moment.

152
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
You said it wasn't the cat demon.

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,160
What happened?

154
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,760
Lord Cao killed Mr. Wang Ji with the blood vine.

155
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,600
It's Nameless again.

156
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
Attention!

157
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,120
Arrest Nameless immediately.

158
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,360
If you resist,

159
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,360
Kill them all!

160
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

161
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,480
Search carefully.

162
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,900
Why does Fang Daming always come in time?

163
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,100
There's no way out.

164
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,200
Get your weapons and fight them!

165
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,160
All you know is fighting.

166
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,360
When to use your brain

167
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,940
This way, hurry up.

168
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,680
You fainted

169
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,160
and saving us.

170
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,080
What are you up to?

171
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,540
This is not a place to talk.

172
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Please follow me.

173
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,000
Forget it.

174
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,120
I have to go to hell.

175
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,800
It's better than staying here as a scapegoat.

176
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,330
