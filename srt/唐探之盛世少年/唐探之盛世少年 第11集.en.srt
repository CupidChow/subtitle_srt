1
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,480
What do you mean, Master?

2
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,980
The demon refined the blood pearl

3
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,360
to complete this formation.

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,200
However,

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,530
to build this formation

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,240
the one and only

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,519
the one and only.

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,240
Her heart is gone.

9
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,640
Her heart is missing.

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Her heart is gone?

11
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,240
Did he get eaten by a demon?

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,920
No.

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,760
There are traces of suturing.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
The technique is brilliant.

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,920
Without Prince Qin’s bone-reflection mirror,

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,380
we wouldn’t have found it.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,600
the blood pearl

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
the Blood Pearl

19
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,320
It's done!

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,479
It's a blood pearl!

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,560
and

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,570
a heavenly man's body as a carrier.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
a puppet.

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,240
combined into one.

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,759
This formation can form

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,880
to take someone's fate.

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,400
You don't need to

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,080
Just use hair or nails

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,240
through the puppet

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,080
through the puppet.

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,530
and transfer it into someone else's body.

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,480
That means...

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,880
Grando.

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,360
The lost heart

35
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,560
is the heart of the seven senses.

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,800
she has found her heart.

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,400
I think so.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,329
I couldn't find the motive for her murder.

39
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,160
was that heart.

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,240
If so,

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
this formation

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,680
only the body of the Chosen One

43
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,480
of the Chosen One.

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,720
Master.

45
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,600
Who is the one

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,520
Who is it?

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,520
The Immortal Sects know this sorcery.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,760
I think

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,440
only my senior sister

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,040
Granny Qiu.

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,079
Your name is Yu Jian Qiu, right?

52
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,160
I'll remember you.

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,420
If you can survive,

54
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,760
I will come back to you.

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,860
Master.

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,050
Where is she?

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,640
find Granny Qiu?

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,840
Senior is not like me.

59
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,040
as an official.

60
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,800
and wandered around all year long.

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,840
The dragon is unpredictable.

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,960
We must stop Granny Qiu from completing this formation.

63
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,200
Otherwise, more innocent people

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,400
You'll be hurt! You'll be hurt! You'll be killed! You'll be killed!

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,040
But...

66
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,800
how can I find the Chosen One

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,760
before she does?

68
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,480
Destiny?

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,040
It's a rare opportunity.

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,680
However,

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,360
if you want to stop her,

72
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,160
there's another way.

73
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,220
I can make puppets.

74
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,880
There's only one family in Tang.

75
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,920
is...

76
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,480
the second-leather craftsman in Chang'an.

77
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,320
The Xu family?

78
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,960
The Xu family?

79
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,040
What about Miss Liu's wound?

80
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,360
I want to thank this lady.

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,840
She's a skin craftsman from Chang'an.

82
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,900
She made a corpse makeup for Miss Liu.

83
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
May I ask your name?

84
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,800
Where do you live?

85
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,520
I will visit you to thank you in the future.

86
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,980
Xu Qiniang from Chang'an.

87
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,280
Xu Qiniang.

88
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,640
It's her.

89
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,280
State Preceptor, Tian Gang,

90
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,040
Greetings, Crown Prince's legitimate grandson.

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,100
Please forgive me.

92
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,960
Please forgive me.

93
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,080
The legitimate grandson of the Crown Prince of the previous dynasty.

94
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Please get up.

95
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,440
Please get up.

96
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,680
Master.

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,940
Did you miscalculate?

98
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,290
I'm not the legitimate grandson of the Crown Prince.

99
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,000
I understand.

100
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,080
Back then, His Majesty rebelled

101
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,960
and destroyed the previous dynasty.

102
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,040
causing the descendants of the previous dynasty to be killed.

103
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,520
If his identity is exposed,

104
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,200
the prison will be in danger.

105
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,520
Don't worry, Your Highness.

106
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,000
As the State Preceptor,

107
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,960
I'm protecting the prosperity of Tang.

108
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,280
I won't interfere with state affairs.

109
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,600
As a prince,

110
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,680
I will keep my mouth shut.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,840
No.

112
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,280
How is that possible?

113
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,370
According to Master Tian Gang,

114
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,200
he must be the mirror thief.

115
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,440
I just found him and arrived at the Governor's Office.

116
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,900
he was chased by Nameless.

117
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,880
The motive.

118
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
The time of the crime.

119
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,400
Plus his footwork,

120
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,280
I can't be wrong.

121
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,360
Why do I

122
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,080
more and more like Nameless.

123
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,960
Miss Yu.

124
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,000
I want to make you my consort.

125
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,120
However,

126
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,520
this fool doesn't look like a mirror thief.

127
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,040
Did I think too much?

128
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,890
Li Chong.

129
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,360
He's so asleep.

130
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,200
Why is the window open?

131
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,220
Are you sure it's here?

132
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,920
This is the address Master Tian Gang mentioned.

133
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,240
I grew up in Chang'an.

134
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,740
It shouldn't be wrong.

135
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,090
Let's go inside.

136
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,280
Hello?

137
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,280
No wonder there's a black hole outside.

138
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,210
What do you mean?

139
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,610
It doesn't have any Yang energy at all.

140
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,600
Legend has it that umbrellas in the mansion

141
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,860
It shows that the dead in the Netherworld

142
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,840
This place is haunted.

143
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,400
and you have so many umbrellas in the house.

144
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,000
This is a meeting for ghosts.

145
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,240
Look.

146
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,320
These paper men have no eyes.

147
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,240
Paper people don't draw eyes.

148
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,500
I didn't light my eyes.

149
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,720
to make them

150
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,820
not to linger on the mortal world.

151
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,159
The mortal world?

152
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,770
Isn't he a paper man?

153
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,560
How can you linger on the mortal world?

154
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,960
The paper is so precious,

155
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,280
is used as a funeral.

156
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,200
to replace the death.

157
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,159
Before the paper man was buried,

158
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,280
before the burial.

159
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,680
Look.

160
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,770
Isn't this the incense?

161
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,740
Two short and one long.

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,690
Looks like someone died in a foreign land.

163
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,280
These ignorant paper men

164
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,540
reminds me of Miss Liu.

165
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,060
Is it related to the incident in Izusei Village?

166
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
is still unknown.

167
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,930
If only these paper figures

168
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,560
can tell us the answer.

169
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,040
Don't say it.

170
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,600
These paper figures

171
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,320
are really made.

172
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,360
Paper man is alive

173
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,960
Clap Clap Clap Clap

174
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,840
Falling on a horse

175
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,660
He's got clapping disease

176
