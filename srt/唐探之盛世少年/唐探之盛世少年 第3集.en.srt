1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,720
It's...

2
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
It's impossible!

3
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,160
Blood Vine!

4
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,220
It comes out from the stomach.

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,599
from the abdomen.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,120
Could it be a demon?

7
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,000
There are no demons in this world.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,800
I think someone is playing tricks.

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,000
to cover up the truth.

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,039
to cover up the truth.

11
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,880
and absorb human blood.

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,840
If it's not a demon, then what is it?

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,680
If you're a demon,

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,800
why didn't you eat the whole person?

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,730
and leave a body?

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,170
who doesn't eat humans.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,200
I heard that a demon is called Jinhua Cat.

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,920
It turns into a girl.

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,980
Let's go! Let's go!

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,120
Look at this. Look at this.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,850
Ridiculous!

22
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,360
How did she die?

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,840
There's a red mark on her ankle.

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,940
It's obvious that he has been wearing shackles for a long time.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,880
A bracelet?

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
So you mean

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,440
she was forced to be a tribute?

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,960
Go.

29
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
Let me kiss you.

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
The world is hard.

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,220
It's even harder to be a woman.

32
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,520
Who's willing to be a gift to go far away?

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
Let me ask you again.

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
Never obey

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,570
I won't. I won't.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,000
Eat it.

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,720
She killed herself by whipping?

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,120
Such a long whip.

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,960
Try it.

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,680
It's better than your cat demon.

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,010
It must be the cat demon.

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,960
You say it.

43
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,160
She's a dancer from the Western Region.

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,120
Her daily life

45
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,400
and daily life.

46
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,320
It's not easy to kill her.

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,640
Miss Granduo.

48
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,480
Please eat.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,690
It's not poisonous.

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,600
The maids from Granduo.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,360
There are so many maids in the delegation.

52
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,960
We don't know which one it is.

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,760
Besides,

54
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,800
we can't get in the Governor's Office.

55
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,160
It depends on

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,040
how he can climb over walls.

57
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:51,840
Miss.

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,960
Does this count as fate?

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,280
I'll burn more paper money for you.

60
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,200
Don't come to me for your life.

61
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,040
No.

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,640
Ersa!

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,680
Why did you hurt me?

64
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,880
Elisa!

65
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,240
Why did you hurt me?

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,959
I'm here.

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,120
Why did you hurt me?

68
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,610
It wasn't me.

69
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,600
It was him.

70
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,560
He ordered me.

71
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,360
It's him.

72
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,960
He fainted.

73
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,080
I'm so scared.

74
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,000
Am I right?

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,200
It must be her.

76
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,240
Who am I?

77
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,680
Thief!

78
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,409
Cut the crap.

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,260
Get to work.

80
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
Tell me.

81
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,040
What does

82
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,240
has nothing to do with you.

83
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,040
Who are you?

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,490
Why did you tie me up?

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm with the envoy.

86
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,280
If anything happens to me,

87
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,880
the envoy will not let you go.

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,040
Your life is in our hands now.

89
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,680
You'd better behave.

90
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,330
Don't be afraid.

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,800
As long as you tell the truth,

92
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
we'll keep you safe.

93
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
You coward.

94
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,930
You're soft-hearted when you see a woman.

95
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,040
How dare you hit me?

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
If we fail,

97
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,840
we'll all die here.

98
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,600
Fine.

99
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,450
I'm not married yet.

100
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,880
Good.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,080
find a woman.

102
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,290
and have a companion in the afterlife.

103
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll tell you.

104
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
So vulgar.

105
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,960
Yes.

106
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,120
I killed Grando.

107
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,409
Why did you kill her?

108
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,159
Do you have any grudge against her?

109
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,960
Or

110
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,400
someone is behind you?

111
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,460
I have no grudge against Miss Grando.

112
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,120
Yes.

113
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,520
Run!

114
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,000
The soldiers are coming.

115
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,540
Move! Move!

116
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,080
You didn't kill my dancer enough.

117
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,320
Not even a maid.

118
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,280
Do you really think my blade in the prairie is bad?

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,880
Nameless.

120
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,200
What are you doing?

121
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,730
General.

122
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,440
Let me explain.

123
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,600
What's there to explain?

124
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Soldiers,

125
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,570
Arrest the suspect!

126
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,360
Kill them!

127
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:43,880
Run!

128
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,000
Go!

129
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,840
Get him!

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,760
Am I dead?

131
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,360
I saw the Buddha.

132
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,040
What are you doing?

133
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
You pervert!

134
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,720
Why did you hit me?

135
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
Hit you.

136
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,280
I'm going to kill you.

137
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,120
You'd better stay still.

138
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,320
You'll get emotional.

139
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,680
You pervert!

140
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
You took advantage of me and died badly.

141
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
I want to kill her!

142
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,640
Miss Yu.

143
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,600
Sorry.

144
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,000
Such a face.

145
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,970
It's a pity to wear noodles.

146
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,930
Why don't you keep it

147
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,640
to serve Tang.

148
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,400
Yes.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,800
You...

150
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,360

Lang.

153

Go get some water.

154
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,120
and wash Miss Yu.

155
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,160
Wash up?

156
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,160
Look at you.

157
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,980
Your hair is messed up.

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Wash up later.
