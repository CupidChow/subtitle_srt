1
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,080
That's the secret symbol of the Tian Gang Sect.

2
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,720
It's a spell from that old lady.

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,160
It's similar. It's similar. It's similar. It's similar.

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,080
It's the first time. It's the first time I've seen it. It's the first time I've seen it. It's the first time I've seen it.

5
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,000
Master Tian Gang.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,440
It's a mirror. It's a mirror. It's a mirror. It's a mirror.

7
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,360
Is this ancient mirror

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,600
is the Wujie Mirror

9
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,519
and the ritual she performed

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,280
is related to the Slaughter Sect.

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,080
We can only rely on the master of the Big Dipper in Chang'an

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,039
to solve our confusion.

13
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:11,520
The High Priest is the State Preceptor of Tang.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,840
He lives in Chang'an.

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,210
We commoners can't see him just like that.

16
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:19,640
Nameless.

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,000
The bone-reflecting mirror of Prince Qin

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,120
from?

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,880
You got it right.

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,240
In fact,

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,690
Master Tian Gang

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,720
It's my master.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,720
The bone-reflecting mirror of Prince Qin

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,180
was passed down by Master.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,080
It's a place where all countries meet.

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,600
It's a place of the empire.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,660
is indeed extraordinary.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,400
What's with the wind today?

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,330
You two look like a perfect couple.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,440
You're so sweet.

31
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,009
Say more.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,320
I like it.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,360
Li Chong

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,320
Do you smell sour?

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,120
Sour?

36
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,560
No.

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,009
Are you jealous?

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,080
You're crazy.

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,720
What's that smell?

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,440
Tell me.

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,920
It's karma.

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,120
The divination is abnormal.

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,880
Gong.

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,640
Life has changed.

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm Nameless.

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,960
I'm Nameless.

47
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,079
and my best friend Li Chong

48
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,840
Jade Sword Boat.

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,970
Greetings, Master.

50
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,840
Greetings, Master Tian Gang.

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,960
I've been an official for two years.

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Are you back

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,160
for the matter of Quan Xian Village?

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,600
Iâ€™m here

55
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,760
Are you really Master's disciple?

56
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,480
He doesn't seem to want to talk to you.

57
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,410
What do you know?

58
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,480
My master is calculating the heavenly secret.

59
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,080
in front of the master.

60
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,140
Can you be serious?

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,600
State Preceptor, Tian Gang,

62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,240
Greetings, Crown Prince's legitimate grandson.

63
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,300
Please forgive me.

64
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,160
Please forgive me.

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,400
The legitimate grandson of the Crown Prince of the previous dynasty.

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Please get up.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
Please get up.

68
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,120
Master.

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,620
Did you miscalculate?

70
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,770
I'm not the legitimate grandson of the Crown Prince.

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,440
I understand.

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,480
Back then, His Majesty rebelled

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,360
and destroyed the previous dynasty.

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,440
causing the descendants of the previous dynasty to be killed.

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,960
If his identity is exposed,

76
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,600
the prison will be in danger.

77
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,040
Don't worry, Your Highness.

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,400
As the State Preceptor,

79
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
I'm protecting the prosperity of Tang.

80
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
I won't interfere with state affairs.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
As a prince,

82
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,080
I'll keep my mouth shut.

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,159
Your Highness.

84
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:58,720
Master.

85
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,360
Are you sure?

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
You've been together for a long time.

87
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,840
You don't know who the prince is.

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,320
Looks like your two years of experience

89
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,240
in the past two years.

90
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,160
I...

91
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,760
This is...

92
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,600
He's so silly.

93
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
How could he be the Crown Prince's legitimate grandson?

94
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,320
Don't be rude.

95
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,520
Lang.

96
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,480
Canâ€™t you tell?

97
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,000
You're hiding quite well.

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,840
If you're not here to bring the prince to see me,

99
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,240
why did you come back

100
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,760
this time?

101
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Here's the thing.

102
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,640
Master.

103
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,890
Do you recognize me?

104
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
You're right.

105
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,920
This Yunji

106
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,360
is indeed a secret seal of our sect.

107
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,320
But the ritual in the cave you mentioned...

108
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,160
Talk later.

109
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,570
As for this ancient mirror,

110
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,900
It's the Wujie Mirror.

111
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,720
and my Six Nose Mirror.

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,280
The bone-reflecting mirror I gave you

113
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,880
and the Xuanyuan Mirror of His Majesty.

114
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,240
It's also known as the Four Great Mirror.

115
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,000
Miss Yu.

116
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,760
Your father is finally saved.

117
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,920
You don't have to wander around anymore.

118
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,360
If you don't need to hide your identity,

119
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
tell them what I really want is the Xuanyuan mirror.

120
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,980
Tomorrow is the last time.

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,600
What should I do?

122
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,840
Great.

123
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,140
My father can be saved.

124
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,960
I...

125
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,220
Master's messenger is in secret.

126
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,240
I'll wait for you at the pavilion house.

127
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,820
Master.

128
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,320
Why did you

129
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,940
in the middle of the night?

130
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,120
Sit.

131
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,760
Nameless.

132
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,840
You're still so smart.

133
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,480
You're indeed a literature star.

134
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,680
Wenqu Star descends to the mortal world.

135
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,480
I summoned you here late at night

136
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,560
to avoid you.

137
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,880
Those two friends

138
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,560
tell you

139
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,040
in the cave.

140
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,320
Please enlighten me.

141
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,240
In the world,

142
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,200
Fate has been destined.

143
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,370
If you want to change your fate,

144
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,560
you need to pay

145
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
equals to the price of your destiny.

146
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,340
In the Slaughter Sect,

147
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,159
in our sect.

148
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,440
to Big Dipper.

149
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Wushan Transportation Technique.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,159
Puppet Style of the lower sect.

151
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,880
The two upper and middle schools are not important for now.

152
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Only this puppet

153
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,840
is the strongest.

154
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,800
Not only can it take away people's fortune,

155
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,560
lifespan,

156
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,440
even

157
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,760
the fate of the emperor.

158
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,120
It's because of its strong function.

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,520
To use this spell,

160
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,700
we need to build

161
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,500
Puppet Transport Formation.

162
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,480
The requirements for building this formation

163
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,840
is extremely strict.

164
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,800
and evil.

165
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,960
In the Slaughter Sect,

166
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,720
has long been banned.

167
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,480
Master, you mean...

168
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,140
The demon refined the blood pearl

169
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,520
to complete this formation.

170
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,360
However,

171
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,720
To build this formation,

172
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,400
the one and only

173
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,679
with one in a million.

174
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,400
