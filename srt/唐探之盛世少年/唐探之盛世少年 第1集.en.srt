3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,800
Here.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,080
the fate of the emperor.

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,840
May the power of stars bless Tang

6
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,040
and pray for God's grace.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,440
Grant His Majesty a long life.

8
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,800
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

9
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,039
Your Majesty!

10
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,039
Your Majesty!

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,680
Your Majesty!

12
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
Your Majesty.

13
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,039
Your Majesty!

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,840
Your Majesty.

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,600
You...

16
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,720
You...

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,680
You...

18
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,039
The demon consort harmed the country.

19
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,480
and cut her hair to the cold palace.

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,000
Order the Imperial Guards

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,360
to investigate the evil demons.

22
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,480
Fall in! Fall in!

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,600
Hurry up.

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,130
The Xuanyuan mirror theft case

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,960
The deadline is ten days.

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,200
The purpose of this mission

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,320
and the identity of the Imperial Guard

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,720
and the Imperial Guards.

29
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,000
If we find the Xuanyuan mirror,

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,360
and return to the capital immediately.

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,160
Don't fight.

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,320
If you can't find the Xuanyuan mirror,

33
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,960
You all will be beheaded.

34
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,570
Yes. Yes.

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,440
Go!

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,650
Jade Sword Boat.

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,200

38
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,200

39
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,680
Go ahead, Godfather.

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,800
In the court,

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,920
in the Imperial Court.

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,520
If you succeed this time,

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,010
you'll surely be able to shut everyone up.

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,280
Don't let me down.

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,320
And among the Imperial Guards,

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,040
you are a top expert in tracking the murderer.

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm counting on you this time.

48
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,079
I won't let you down.

49
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,520

50
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,600
Go over there.

51
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,160
Yes, sir!

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,880
The traces of the mirror thief

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,080
He disappeared at the entrance of the governor's office.

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,120
Did the governor do it?

55
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,250
A business trip?

56
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,920
Why is the mansion so lively?

57
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,640
The governor is holding a banquet in the mansion today

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,040
to entertain the ambassador of the Western Region.

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,500
No one is allowed to enter.

60
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,480
This is the Governor's Office.

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,640
I couldn't find it.

62
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,620
My invitation.

63
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,680
Please check the business trip.

64
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,080
You are an important guest.

65
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,880

67

Thank you.

70
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,960
I was on my way these days and didn't eat properly.

71
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,560
I'm here to improve the food.

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,170
Commander Fang,

73
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,360
I want to propose a toast to you.

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,600
You've caused a lot of trouble

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,930
to entertain our envoy.

76
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,880
Thank you very much.

77
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,920
Here's to you.

78
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Don't mention it.

79
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:12,810
Here.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,560
Let's have a drink today.

81
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,440
Cheers.

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,100
Cheers.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,860
Come on. Again.

84
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,880
I heard that the ambassador presented His Majesty's dance entertainer

85
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,480
is beautiful and beautiful.

86
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
and skilled in dancing.

87
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,880
We have never seen the beautiful beauty of the Western Region.

88
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,640
May I meet you?

89
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,570
It's not difficult.

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,080
It's Commander Fang's request.

91
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,400
I dare not refuse.

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,159
Guards!

93
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,500
Bring her here.

94
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,760
Go.

95
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,040
Yes.

96
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,970
We'll be there soon.

97
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,280
Look!

98
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,120
It's so light.

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,920
Yes.

100
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,640
This figure

101
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,840
is really different.

102
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,480
Wonderful.

103
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,440
Look.

104
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,880
Look at his body and hands.

105
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
This move.

106
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,960
Great.

107
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,240
Okay.

108
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,360
Stop!

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,680
How dare you! Drop your weapon!

110
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,360
If there is a way in the sky, why don't you go?

111
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,200
There's no door to hell but you barged in.

112
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,400
Why can't you escape?

113
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Run to Shangzhou.

114
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,440
You can't escape today.

115
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
How much money

116
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
How much is your monthly salary?

117
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,740
What are you doing?

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
You chased me for three days and nights.

119
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,330
I just stole five taels and four taels.

120
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,360
Are you serious?

121
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,960
Nameless.

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,770
How dare you!

123
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,810
I'm having a banquet with a VIP.

124
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,210
You caught the thief in my mansion.

125
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,240
Commander,

126
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,000
He is a major criminal of the imperial court.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
The thief, Ming Lang.

128
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
I've been tracking him down for half a year.

129
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Please forgive me

130
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,020
please forgive me.

131
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,330
Don't be surprised.

132
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,880
He's Wu Ming from the Governor's Office.

133
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,159
He is very talented.

134
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,400
Last year, in Quizhou,

135
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,860
has solved many old cases.

136
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,960
The thief, Nether Wolf.

137
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,880
If you don't want to add another charge,

138
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,960
let the dancer go.

139
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,400
Please give the order to let me go.

140
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,740
I'll let her go.

141

146
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,840

148
