1
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,962
It was physically so large

2
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:34,166
and I had so much to think about so

3
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,004
I actually didn't have much time to
feel nervous

4
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,740
That did make me feel a bit anxious and

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,776
it felt like the preparation period was
exceptionally short as if someone said,

6
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:47,079
"Your concert starts tomorrow"

7
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,849
Because I was actually sweating and
out of breath

8
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,518
However, it wasn't just me

9
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,154
Everyone preparing for the show

10
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:58,891
must have felt it unusually hard compared
to my former concerts

11
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,095
This is so tough

12
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:07,066
So exhausting

13
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,938
But I'm not even halfway there yet

14
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:13,205
This is insane

15
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:18,844
Wow, I hope I can do this

16
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,795
Yes, the intro

17
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:57,216
It's the first time I've ever sung a live
version of the original song

18
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,219
There will definitely be audiences
who want that

19
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:03,923
The piano line is so amazing but

20
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:11,464
I think people would want the refreshing
vibe of the original version

21
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,265
So that's why the ballad section in

22
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:16,068
the first verse is long

23
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,571
The piano will play a big role

24
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,307
OK, with no music

25
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,009
We have 10 practices left

26
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,146
Do you have 10 times left now?

27
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:28,447
- 9 times?
- We have 9 more practices

28
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:31,951
We can say we still have 10 practices
including the final rehearsal

29
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,019
Yes

30
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,087
I feel like a rich person

31
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,422
I feel like a rich person

32
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:38,991
Impact of the first song

33
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,726
Giving impact was more important

34
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:44,664
We weren't continuing the ballad version to

35
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,599
make people who want the original version

36
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,068
to feel sad

37
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,505
We were taking on the vibe from the
original song right away so

38
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,676
I guess I wasn't too concerned about that

39
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:02,381
I didn't think that people will be sad that

40
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:05,651
I'm starting the intro from the chorus
with no music

41
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:07,586
Until "We dance together"?

42
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,828
You have to do "Wow!" for me

43
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:21,434
Like this?

44
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:26,072
I don't think I should sing it too hard

45
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,141
Won't it be better to make it sound pretty?

46
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,876
Keep in mind that the audience will not be
screaming like us so

47
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:33,846
you will not have to deal with the awkward
atmosphere you're expecting and

48
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,282
it's going to be very cool

49
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:38,984
To be honest, I thought it was 'wrong'

50
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,756
after one line

51
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:44,557
Really?

52
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:45,891
Because you didn't hear "Wow!"?

53
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:48,494
I figured out what was going on with
the "Wow!"

54
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:50,596
The audiences are being

55
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,765
too cautious

56
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:59,205
I realized that 'They got shocked'

57
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,574
'by suddenly hearing her voice'

58
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,376
I feel like... the audiences aren't

59
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:10,382
enjoying it at all

60
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:12,918
I could feel it from where we are as well

61
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:19,391
However, if you go check the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
well, the 1st floor?

62
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:24,163
You can feel an enormous shout and energy
coming towards the stage but

63
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,931
it's just not conveyed to the stage

64
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,934
People are so shy right now

65
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,269
It's been too long

66
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,473
They're not sure if they should be shouting
or not

67
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:39,411
Anyway, the picture we wanted at first was

68
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,914
the gap getting filled up with

69
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:46,085
unbelievably loud cheers

70
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,788
We really did get flummoxed

71
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,123
"Is this really happening?"

72
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,193
People were breath taken as soon as they
heard IU's voice and

73
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:57,429
they were focused on that only

74
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:59,965
Since they're wearing masks as well
"Is this really happening?"

75
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:48,047
Actually, I really didn't hear anyone cheer
both on the first day and the second day

76
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:51,483
Since the first song was starting with
no music,

77
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,119
I had in-ear mics in both ears

78
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:57,456
I was also making my entrance from a very
high and far location

79
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:02,261
I really couldn't hear the audience in
the main stadium at that time so

80
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,631
it took so long to warm myself up

81
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,232
Right

82
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,933
If I'm close to them,

83
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,569
I can figure out if the atmosphere is
going 'this way or that way' but

84
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,072
I can't figure out anything

85
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,341
until the concert is about half over
People are wearing masks so

86
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,109
I can't see their faces

87
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:21,480
I'm just going on after warming up myself
thinking

88
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:25,117
'They must be enjoying it, right?'

89
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:30,356
The first day and the second day were not
very different for me

90
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,325
Where are we having the final rehearsal?

91
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,595
We set up a studio in Gimpo

92
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:37,563
How big is it?

93
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,033
Remember the normal music video sets?

94
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,368
I think it's bigger than that

95
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,202
Really?

96
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,939
Is it as big as Nodeulseom?
Is it smaller than that?

97
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:49,642
- It's way larger than Nodeulseom
- 3 times larger than Nodeulseom

98
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:50,809
- Really?
- 3 or 4 times larger

99
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,512
We're going to practice flying and all

100
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:54,280
Really?

101
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,315
We'll have all the stage sets there---

102
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,283
Balloon

103
00:06:59,385 --> 00:06:59,885
Drone

104
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,487
He seems very regretful

105
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,489
- I didn't get any notice
- What about firecrackers?

106
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:04,823
Firecracker

107
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,960
What are we going to have there

108
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,230
Stop teasing director Hyunwoo today

109
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,532
He's had enough today

110
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,367
The band cue incident for years...

111
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:18,270
The band cue incident... I bet we'll be
talking about that after 10 years

112
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:44,897
I'm so beat

113
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,999
But you look less exhausting than yesterday

114
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:47,499
Really?

115
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:49,601
- Wipe your sweat
- Oh, thanks

116
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,237
You speak well today

117
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:53,472
I still have the power to speak

118
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,074
She prepared her lines

119
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,343
- I haven't yet
- You haven't?

120
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,980
I will work on my lines during Chuseok

121
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,748
- We'll try the 3 high notes now
- Let's try the 3 high notes now

122
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:05,918
That's the one comment I came up with

123
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:06,986
I think that's good

124
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:08,787
Which song do you want to hear?

125
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,290
Who wants to listen to 'Through the Night'?
Me!

126
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,124
You'll have to wait a bit

127
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,726
Who wants to listen to 'Drama'?

128
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:14,626
Wait for it

129
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,962
Who wants to listen to the 3 high notes in
'Good Day'? Me!

130
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:17,696
I'll sing it for you now

131
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,631
That's good

132
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,436
- You've become quite a jokester
- It's the only comment I've prepared

133
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,537
Great

134
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:27,039
What do you think about 'LILAC'?

135
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,607
After I go out? Is it cool?

136
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,742
It's totally cool

137
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:33,979
I have two opinions about the dancing
section at the moment

138
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,383
I told you from the beginning,
there are too many dancers in 'dlwlrma'

139
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,517
You think so?

140
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:41,353
The sound won't be that loud

141
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,088
- In the front and back
- But we'll have firecrackers and all

142
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,723
But we'll have firecrackers and all

143
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:49,661
You see, speaking of scales,

144
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:53,432
it's cool if it switches from 40 to 10 than
back to 40 but

145
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,468
if it's 40, 40, 40 continuously...

146
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,170
- Not impressive?
- It's not impressive

147
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,673
First of all, the sound of the song
'dlwlrma' itself does not have

148
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:04,476
a large sound when other songs are so

149
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:10,816
having 40 dancers doing a cute dance to
a not-so-large sound

150
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,018
Anyways

151
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,186
And?

152
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,289
I'm not sure if you should walk out in
the end of 'LILAC'

153
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:19,858
Walking out to the thrust stage?

154
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,127
I thought we should introduce the band

155
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:23,629
We talked about introducing the band last
time

156
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:28,033
It's about where to focus the attention

157
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:34,807
Also, I think it's alright till the 2nd one
among the 4 spins

158
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,776
However, you're doing your

159
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:41,113
butt dance routine in the end

160
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:46,852
From the fans' point of view, they would
be moved (in their hearts) when you do it

161
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,489
They wouldn't want to see the dancers do it

162
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,591
If I were a fan

163
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,526
Then what would be better for that part?

164
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:58,430
I'd rather just have you stay on the
main stage or

165
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,434
keep the focus on the dancers till the
2nd part and then leave

166
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,037
- Focus on the band
- Yes, attract attention to the band

167
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:07,639
Going out after the second part...

168
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,142
I guess that's about it

169
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,579
I do like the rest, the choreography & all

170
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,317
If the screen is showing the band,

171
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:22,087
won't it be less boring for the audiences

172
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:23,856
- You think so?
- If we go out to the thrust stage?

173
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,391
We'll get to have limits in the formation

174
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:29,294
because the postlude is too long if we
keep dancing on the main stage

175
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,997
I guess that's why we chose to go out

176
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:36,201
How about doing this there instead of this?

177
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,736
Yeah, do that instead

178
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:40,072
What are we doing on the thrust stage?

179
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:42,641
We'll do this on the thrust stage

180
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:46,578
We'll split once and then line up again

181
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:50,082
We'll spread out in the middle of the road

182
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:53,886
This is the first part

183
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,488
This is what we do when we're spread out
on the road

184
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,992
I see, one time for each

185
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,380
I thought, "Oh?" when I first heard it and

186
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,116
I thought the audience would feel the same
way

187
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,853
It was very unfamiliar for us at first and

188
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:29,821
we used the machine to

189
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:33,559
raise the pitch for my chorus as well

190
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,694
That's why I was concerned thinking,
"Will this be alright?"

191
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:39,598
"Wouldn't it be too experimental?” but

192
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,869
it created a very exciting mood to listen
to it on the stage with

193
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,806
the dancers dancing

194
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:52,244
When I said "I'm a bit concerned”

195
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:53,712
director Jonghoon said

196
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:57,115
"This is absolutely great”
He said it'll work no matter what

197
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:58,917
So I trusted him

198
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,285
- It was very exciting
- Yeah

199
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,522
'LILAC' was

200
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:09,027
the middle section of the show

201
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:09,528
That's right

202
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:15,000
We thought this part has to be the most
extravagant to keep it going till the end

203
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:19,104
We were determined 'LILAC' has to be
as long as it can be, new and

204
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:23,175
we also wanted the dancers to do something
extravagant but

205
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:27,312
it seems that all of that has been taken
away by other songs

206
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:30,249
To be honest, no one around me

207
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:32,484
talked about 'LILAC' as I expected

208
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:34,119
I guess that's true

209
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:38,590
Most of the parts were highlighted

210
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,258
Yeah

211
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,994
It's a little bit sad that people don't
mention 'LILAC' so much

212
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:47,699
'LILAC' didn't get much attention since
other songs were so impressive

213
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:48,900
- Were they?
- Yeah

214
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:51,870
I thought it was amazing

215
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,006
Then I'm happy

216
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:56,775
That's the only thing I can remember

217
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,346
However, director Hyunwoo did mention it
continuously

218
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,415
At meetings and all

219
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:07,519
"I hope we can do what we did 4 years ago"

220
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,222
"for Blueming at LILAC this time"

221
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:16,928
"presentation-wise and performance-wise"

222
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:19,931
Director Hyunwoo was serious about it

223
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,267
I wanted the whole main stadium to be

224
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,304
- colored with flowers
- colored with flowers

225
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,373
You shouldn't have put up 'strawberry moon'
on the sky if you wanted that

226
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,510
We put 'strawberry moon' up before that,

227
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:35,580
announced that I will graduate 'Good Day'
and then perform 'My sea'

228
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:37,282
I tried all my might to be twinkle toes

229
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,018
for 'LILAC

230
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,055
I was clenching my teeth while dancing

231
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,557
'LILAC' after 'Good Day'

232
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:46,758
I mean, it was crazy, to be honest

233
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,627
I know, you had to for 'LILAC

234
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,562
I had no choice but to clench my teeth

235
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:54,032
That's why part 2 was

236
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,735
so exhausting

237
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,572
'strawberry moon', 'Hold My Hand'

238
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:02,908
'Blueming', 'Last night story', 'Good Day'

239
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,912
I know I planned the whole set list but

240
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:09,815
I did regret it big time

241
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:13,885
I said to myself,
'Why am I doing this after I planned it'?

242
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:17,522
'Why am I punishing myself so much?'

243
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:22,260
I wanted to discuss this with you

244
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,728
Yes?

245
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,196
If I should change the sequence

246
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,164
There's no empty slot though

247
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,668
To put this at the back of the list,

248
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,937
- it's too late...
- Yeah, it'll break the sequence

249
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,175
- 'Good day'
- 'Because of Good Day'

250
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:42,447
'Good day' was most necessary

251
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:44,783
It'll be very strange
if I don't sing the 3 high notes, right?

252
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,518
Very strange

253
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:50,122
Many songs are tough this time

254
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,492
We always had them on the set list

255
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:55,227
I know

256
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,833
I have one, two, three, four new songs
added

257
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,938
It was getting more and more tricky to
decide where to include 'Good Day' so

258
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:10,041
I thought, "Should I exclude it this time?"

259
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,211
I can't exclude 'Good Day' from this show

260
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,280
When all of my hits are included in this
concert, it'll make no sense to

261
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,115
leave out 'Good Day'

262
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:20,385
Why don't we open it to the audience

263
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:26,057
I got to try different genres over time and

264
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:30,162
the musical style changed from what I did
when I was a teenager so

265
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:34,166
it gets harder to include 'Good Day' in
the set list

266
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:39,037
This will be the last time 'Good Day' will
be included in the official set list

267
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:43,975
I could sing it during encore or
encore of encore so

268
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,212
I decided to, 'Open it to the audience' and
that's why

269
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:51,383
that section became more special
in this concert

270
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:57,989
'Good Day' is always in the climax of
my concert so

271
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:02,627
it's difficult to make alternations in
my set list

272
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,996
If this song comes in the middle or

273
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:07,299
the middle of part 1,

274
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:10,502
I realized that the latter part gets
to lack the vibe

275
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,473
I always struggled with this when I
planned the set list so

276
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,909
I decided to graduate 'Good Day'

277
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:22,914
Absolutely unacceptable?

278
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,850
No

279
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,088
We planned to do so and planned the set list

280
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,793
People don't like 'Good Day' as before

281
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,461
When I perform,

282
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:40,665
I know I must perform that song but

283
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:47,439
I knew that the concert will be more
colorful if decide to

284
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:51,076
include another song instead of

285
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,012
'Good Day' considering the concept of this
concert but

286
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,214
I always do have to perform 'Good Day'

287
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,717
But, the audience wants to listen to

288
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,720
other songs more like they used to listen
to this song more before

289
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:04,956
Maybe B-side tracks that weren't included
before

290
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:07,292
Maybe something a bit maniac

291
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:11,663
So the position of 'Good Day' got uncertain

292
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:15,800
Let's just be bold and exclude it from the
official set list

293
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:17,969
It was always included so

294
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:22,908
we made the tough decision
'Let's exclude it for a while'

295
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,177
- Maybe at a reasonable time in the future
- Yeah

296
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,381
'Good Day' is an incredible song

297
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,950
I didn't ask to exclude it

298
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,920
Director Hyunwoo didn't ask to exclude it

299
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:39,724
Come to think of it, director Hyunwoo
never really was that passionate about

300
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:42,727
the stage management for 'Good Day'

301
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:45,463
- I guess the dynamics from
- You're right, I wasn't

302
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,732
the 3 high notes could've been the reason

303
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,702
I was more passionate about creating

304
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:55,907
the stage for the new songs in each album

305
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,411
I'm sorry but I thought 'Good Day' is

306
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:02,948
a song that's enough with

307
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,483
the musical power it has

308
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:07,152
That's a good thing

309
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:08,286
Yes, that's good

310
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,955
You did a good job of distributing

311
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,892
It's "One, two, I'm in my dream”

312
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:17,162
However, "One, two, three, four"

313
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,398
I'm going to trick them by doing,
"One, two, I'm in my dream”

314
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,673
What if it gets modulated?

315
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:37,215
Yikes

316
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:40,318
One, two, three, four, one

317
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:43,622
It's the same without modulation

318
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,190
That's good

319
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:46,658
It's even better

320
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,696
I think I forgot more and more to use
half falsetto

321
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,833
Most of my recent songs ranged

322
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,836
at not-so-high pitches while

323
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,839
I mainly use my natural voice

324
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,508
I either go with falsetto or just use my
natural voice so

325
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:08,146
I didn't have songs such as 'Good Day',
'YOUS&I', 'Every End of the Day'

326
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:11,916
- to use half falsetto as before
- Yeah

327
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,020
I realize that 'I can still do it'

328
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,658
by singing old songs from time to time

329
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,028
while we Producing the songs

330
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:27,132
I guess I don't get the opportunity
to use it more and more

331
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:30,602
Half falsetto was a distinctive part of

332
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,705
IU's vocal style in the past but

333
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,909
now my vocal range has gotten more diverse

334
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,281
I guess that's why I got to forget how to
use half falsetto by time

335
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,752
Tell me to use it from time to time

336
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:50,689
You do need it, right?

337
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:53,058
It's good to have a diverse vocal range

338
00:19:56,394 --> 00:20:00,932
So I got to have

339
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:07,172
a lowered, more stable overtone than before

340
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,807
which is great for performing

341
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:09,474
Yes

342
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,508
It's great for performing

343
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,977
Because if you use your natural voice in
the part where

344
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,514
you used half falsetto before,

345
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,050
it sounds way more invigorating and clearer

346
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,419
That's so much better for a concert

347
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,755
- When I'm recording
- For recording

348
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:28,460
there are many registers that I can handle
way more delicately if I use half falsetto

349
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:32,430
But I really didn't have a lot of songs to
use half falsetto recently

350
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,270
I'm not sure which side it is

351
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:40,572
Isn't it written on it?

352
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,779
It's not... I did learn about both sides
The red one is

353
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:50,815
this side

354
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,052
Good, it fits well

355
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,122
So your in-ear mics are both pink

356
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:57,822
How pretty

357
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,390
This is a new one

358
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,861
Left side is red

359
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:12,904
Silver chrome is the only way to make it
work like a mirror

360
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,673
That's about it

361
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,144
This?

362
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:22,013
- Voice recognition?
- I can use my voice?

363
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,249
Stop, stop, stop

364
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:28,887
This one is orange, take a look

365
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:30,455
Stop

366
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,424
What are you doing

367
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:37,028
This is not so easy

368
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,165
- It gets shadowy if you stop it
- I see

369
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:42,333
- It's better to watch the whole clip
- Alright

370
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,337
Orange

371
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:49,107
Can't we have Matt orange?

372
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,775
I'm sure they can make Matt colors

373
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:52,377
If it's Matt...

374
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,678
It'll feel like that

375
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:57,115
It'll be like the paint we used
when you performed "Blueming'

376
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:59,884
I guess I'll just choose white

377
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:01,419
- White?
- Yeah, it's clean

378
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:02,620
With gloss?

379
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,422
With gloss

380
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:05,290
This one is the white one

381
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,124
This one, what's this one?

382
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,425
A bit of gray

383
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,295
This one looks like a gray one

384
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:12,797
This one is silver

385
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:15,466
I think this is the same but it looks
different because of the light

386
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,168
This is orange

387
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,136
That's not bad

388
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,572
Shall I try chrome? Silver?

389
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:22,640
To match this one?
Okay, let's do that

390
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:26,377
UAENA's logo, IUAENA

391
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:28,479
- Just the logo..
- Only the logo

392
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,080
Only the logo?

393
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,114
Where?

394
00:22:30,114 --> 00:22:31,816
In the center part here

395
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,585
Won't you be holding that part with
your hands?

396
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:36,387
Right, then up in this part

397
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,226
To celebrate turning 30 years old,
I ordered a custom mic

398
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,294
Colorless

399
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,331
I didn't really add any color

400
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:49,033
Should I say chrome?

401
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,703
Chrome material? That's how I ordered it

402
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:55,907
Shall I choose orange? Since the theme is
focused on orange this time

403
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:59,544
Shall I choose orange? What about pink?

404
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,281
"Just get rid of color”
so I chose to go with chrome

405
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:06,985
The one demand I made was to put UAENA's
logo on it without any details

406
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,187
The mic itself has incredible performance
quality

407
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,256
The mic ate me up

408
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:16,060
to the extent that I have to be careful
not to be dragged around

409
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:18,496
The performance quality is exceptional
and it's beautiful

410
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,299
- Is that the new mic?
- Yes

411
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,135
- Silver hair tail?
- Do you think it's good?

412
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:25,470
- Is it cool?
- It's cool

413
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:28,273
How do you like it?

414
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,541
Did my vocal sound good?

415
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:39,183
That's because each type of microphone has
a different sensitivity

416
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,354
Some mics have a softer sound and

417
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,056
some mics have very sensitive sounds
with clear accuracy

418
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,892
So it depends on the mic

419
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:50,194
I can't say which is better

420
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,231
It depends on your taste so for the singer

421
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,935
It depends on the listener's taste

422
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,238
However, objectively,

423
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:03,007
there is a more accurate mic and

424
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,076
a mic that is more subtle

425
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:09,013
Judging based on the band sound

426
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:12,317
when I was performing upbeat songs
such as 'Blueming' or 'Hold My Hand'

427
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,886
the new mic was perfect

428
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:19,023
When I was singing ballad songs, my old
custom mics were way softer and

429
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:23,328
captured the subtle nuances of my voice

430
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,998
However, since this is a very sensitive
and small difference,

431
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:31,736
I get misunderstood by people who say
"It's all in your head"

432
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,872
This time, it was uniquely obvious

433
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:37,141
- Especially when I sang "My sea'
- Yes

434
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,577
I changed the mic when we were rehearsing
it in Gimpo and

435
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:42,447
sang it 3 times, 4 times in a row, right?

436
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,949
- Since the new one was too sensitive
- Yeah

437
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:50,888
So we decided to sing it using the
rose-gold mic I ordered in the past

438
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:53,524
The difference was obvious

439
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:56,294
- for others to listen
- Totally different

440
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:58,096
To the extent for them to ask,
"Why does it sound so different?"

441
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,699
"Why does it sound so different when the
same person is singing?"

442
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,303
So I tried it using different mics and

443
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,172
searched for the right sound for each song
We did a good job

444
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:11,409
It was so tiring and tough when we did that

445
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:15,680
but I was glad that I did at the concert

446
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,485
- I'm glad we used different band rooms too
- Yeah, I'm really glad we did

447
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,321
What should I do

448
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:26,357
I'll sing "Blueming' with a different mic

449
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,427
Will it be better if I use this to listen
for Papa(director Jonghoon)?

450
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,496
Papa(director Jonghoon)...
is JM listening?

451
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,497
Yes, he's listening

452
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,699
I can make time tomorrow

453
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:37,635
This mic is lighter

454
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,539
Okay

455
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:44,008
What did you just use?

456
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,843
- The gold one, rose gold one
- Gold

457
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:47,979
That one, I see

458
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:53,818
This is the same balance, right?

459
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:54,786
Yes

460
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,857
This one makes my voice clearer but

461
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,096
I won't be able to sing for a long time
with this mic condition

462
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,965
When I sing with this one

463
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:13,171
it strains my voice a lot so

464
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:17,975
I think you'll have to open the mic sound
more when I hit high notes

465
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:22,146
Will the directors be able to take care of
that on their own?

466
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:27,985
The gold mic is better for me to sing

467
00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:31,022
I guess I could switch them while I sing

468
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,025
I'll use that for ballad songs, I'll use
the gold mic for part 1 and

469
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:36,094
I'll use the silver one for part 2

470
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:38,996
- What should I do?
- Shall we start?

471
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,499
- Huh?
- Shall we start?

472
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,601
- From the intro?
- Yes

473
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,838
- We don't have much time
- No, you're right

474
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,174
- Shall I use this for the opening?
- Yes

475
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:54,212
- I prefer this one way more
- This is very much like that

476
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,614
The blue mic we used for Love, Poem concert

477
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:00,251
But I never used that again after that

478
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,954
- The resonance was
- Where was that?

479
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,323
Love, Poem concert in Seoul when I sang
'Blueming'

480
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,026
I only used it for 'Blueming' and never
used it again

481
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:11,963
It feels just like that one
You can hear the resonance very clear

482
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,599
in a large concert hall but

483
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:17,902
my voice gets shot too quickly if I use
it to sing

484
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,071
So I'm not so sure how it'll be

485
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:44,762
Why didn't you get any sleep?

486
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,498
I had a lot of nightmares

487
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,369
Why is this part swollen?

488
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,606
As if I got mumps

489
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,475
Who knows why it hurts?

490
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,144
I wonder why?

491
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:05,016
It hurts just to do this with my tongue

492
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:10,121
Did I move around too much wearing

493
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,858
in-ear mics that don't fit?

494
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,664
This part in here hurts

495
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:27,271
I wore new in-ear mics for the first time

496
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:29,340
and they were made a bit bigger so

497
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,643
my ears hurt so much as if they're
going to get torn

498
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:34,579
The in-ear mics...

499
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,783
People who are watching
may not be aware of it

500
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,953
You put liquid silicone in your ears and

501
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,921
make a mold of my ear

502
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:47,358
They create an in-ear monitor that looks
exactly like my ear so

503
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,194
it provides a perfect seal

504
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:55,199
However, the new in-ear mic was a bit
bigger and stiff so

505
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:58,569
it kept hurting my ears, they got red

506
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:03,207
I even got an ear disorder on the 2nd day

507
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,711
I guess that in-ear mic took a part in that

508
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:10,248
It's so big and it irritates my ears more

509
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:14,452
when I open my mouth since they're
connected

510
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,687
so the next day...

511
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:20,224
my skin got swollen all the way down to
my neck and I was in pain

512
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:24,161
My ears got redder and swollen, and I
couldn't put my new in-ears in

513
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:26,397
So I asked to switch them on the second
day and

514
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,132
use the old in-ear mic

515
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,869
I was in so much pain so I said,
"It hurts too much" but

516
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,439
the staff in the front said,
"Hang in there"

517
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,607
"Okay"

518
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:40,945
"I'll endure it" and I actually did

519
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:44,548
The main stadium

520
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,384
These in-ears?

521
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,452
I can hear clearly

522
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:49,820
Your singing is great

523
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:52,390
Yeah?

524
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:57,695
Hold it even if your neck hurts

525
00:29:57,995 --> 00:29:59,163
My neck hurts so much

526
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:03,901
I don't think I'll be able to use my voice
tomorrow

527
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:04,935
Hold it

528
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,272
You realized you can hold it back today,
right?

529
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:09,507
Hold it

530
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:11,542
It was the first time in 16 years

531
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,978
When you all told me to hold it when I said
I'm pain

532
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:15,046
Hold it

533
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:18,215
- Read the room
- How dare you

534
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:20,017
So what if you're in pain

535
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:21,819
Hold it

536
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:25,289
I did endure it, it was like I did

537
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,126
- an entire concert
- Yeah

538
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:31,696
It's the main stadium

539
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:35,099
I can't hear you if I speak quietly, so
please speak loudly

540
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,768
I can't hear anything, speak loudly

541
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:38,769
It's the main stadium

542
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:40,438
The main stadium is perfect

543
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,774
- I can't hear anything at the moment
- They say the main stadium is the perfect choice

544
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:45,876
Grandma

545
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:48,245
The main stadium is perfect

546
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:52,016
I know, I guess it was tough for us because

547
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:54,985
we were rehearsing in small theaters

548
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:57,254
It's much better to

549
00:30:58,222 --> 00:30:59,056
rehearse in a large concert hall

550
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:05,296
Was I made for large concert halls?

551
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,198
Made for large concert halls?

552
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,034
Made for the main stadium?

553
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,629
I had an issue with my in-ears at that time

554
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:41,766
The concert hall was too large

555
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:44,301
It happens now and then

556
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:46,837
when the reception is cut off for a moment

557
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,206
So from the rehearsal that day

558
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:51,108
I think it was the Sunday concert

559
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,477
When I was performing 'Hold My Hand'

560
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,112
I started from the side of the stage and

561
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,748
I kept losing reception so

562
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:02,520
I did talk about it with the sound director

563
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,556
I worked with the sound director for a long
time and

564
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:08,392
he's very meticulous so

565
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:11,729
he doesn't carry one until he gets
everything in control but

566
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,497
he told me this at that time

567
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:17,802
You'll have to take it into consideration
since this is the main stadium

568
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,304
Understand if there are some cut-offs

569
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,343
Will it be different from this tomorrow?

570
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,247
On the day of the concert?

571
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,287
Seriously, it's not a matter of adaptation

572
00:32:39,356 --> 00:32:44,228
I really can't hear anything

573
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:49,266
I can't hear anything when I get out here

574
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:52,803
I can't raise my head or try to be flirty

575
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:55,105
because I can't hear anything

576
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,875
- Seriously, other artists
- They say it happens all the time

577
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,211
perform on this spot?

578
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,112
The dancers are the issue

579
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:04,381
Dancers will wear in-ears too, right?

580
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,286
I don't think we'll ever be able to check
our teamwork

581
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:15,059
There is a time gap bet between the music
she's hearing and the music the dancers are hearing

582
00:33:17,394 --> 00:33:18,095
Yes

583
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:19,530
- Since they're out on the thrust?
- Yes

584
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,466
If I'm listening to it here and take it off

585
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,602
They're hearing it belatedly and

586
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,037
the dancers are dancing to that

587
00:33:27,037 --> 00:33:30,074
Two on the stage with Yohan

588
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:33,143
-ZZURU
- Yes

589
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,280
I'd rather put in-ears on the main dancers

590
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,349
- and the rest should follow them
- Yeah

591
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,584
- That's the best
- I think we should do that

592
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,319
Put in-ears on the leaders

593
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:44,255
It's not possible here

594
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,390
That's the only way we can find

595
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:05,442
IU is so lovely

596
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,246
Hey, so what did you decide to do with
the dancers?

597
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,414
What do you mean?

598
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:13,484
The issue they can't hear music out there
because it resonates too much

599
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:15,486
For now, when we were rehearsing

600
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,888
you didn't sing and we just played music

601
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:20,958
The delay wasn't too bad when we did that

602
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:23,294
so we didn't notice and carried on

603
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:26,664
We'll have to check the songs with a lot of
delay

604
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,900
They won't be able to hear
"Last Night Story' at all

605
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,202
Yeah, we can't hear 'Last Night Story'

606
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:35,005
We finished 'Last Night Story' on
the thrust, remember?

607
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:36,707
- We changed that
- How?

608
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:41,745
Audience can't see you at all if you
do that, the people on the side can't

609
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:46,383
we changed the plan to have the dancers
to split and dance on the road as well

610
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:48,719
Can I get some rest now?

611
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:50,588
I should ride the moon

612
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,923
Shouldn't we practice 'Ah puh'?

613
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,726
- Right, we have to practice 'Ah puh"
- We should

614
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:57,294
Only that one

615
00:34:57,861 --> 00:35:00,397
During 'above the time'

616
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,335
the guys have to run past you but they
can't if you are

617
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,170
standing too in the front

618
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,606
So how about this far? By this strawberry

619
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,374
This sand glass, strawberry?

620
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:12,476
Stand on the sand glass

621
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:34,098
We haven't been to the main stadium yet so

622
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:38,035
we weren't sure how many laps we should do

623
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:41,805
to get people excited

624
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:46,644
We weren't sure how many laps the dancers
should do to liven up the mood

625
00:35:47,611 --> 00:35:48,612
So we

626
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,717
did way more laps than the first plan

627
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:56,854
Yeah, 3 times more than the first plan

628
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,457
It just won't get easily exciting

629
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:03,260
'Let's do a lot if we're going to do it

630
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,762
We did a lot of laps

631
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:09,500
When the captain said,
"There's nothing more we can do"

632
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,039
From the 16 beats where IU was going up
in the air,

633
00:36:15,305 --> 00:36:18,042
"We'll raise it to the sky when IU starts
rising"

634
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:20,811
so we set off firecrackers at that moment

635
00:36:20,844 --> 00:36:23,847
We had firecrackers

636
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:26,717
Let's wrap up the show in a festive mood

637
00:36:27,584 --> 00:36:29,720
- Let's set them all
- Yeah, all

638
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,455
I went the whole hog

639
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,892
How are the low-pitched notes?

640
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,828
How about we emphasize your low notes
more?

641
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,931
- Then the high notes
- Your high notes are fine

642
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,666
- It's not diminished like the low note
- No?

643
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,034
We are getting lumps...

644
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:46,804
- Let's work on the low notes tomorrow
- Let's slightly work on the low notes

645
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,872
I think it would be much better if it was
only in the verse

646
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:50,340
How about when you're out on the thrust?

647
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:52,509
- Because of the cut-off
- Other than the cut-off

648
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:53,844
It's okay now

649
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,212
It's better to push it like that, right?

650
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,648
- It's because you added the rhythm
- I added more rhythm

651
00:36:58,415 --> 00:36:59,917
Then it'll be less resonating

652
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,919
with the audience there

653
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:03,821
- It'll eliminate resonance
- Eliminated

654
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,457
Instead, you'll hear the audience more

655
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,493
You should feel happy about that sound

656
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,595
Those directors said that

657
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:13,797
Director Dusoo and Jiho said that

658
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,866
"If they say so"

659
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,569
"I should endure it" so

660
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,105
I was going to keep going but

661
00:37:21,438 --> 00:37:23,674
I don't know if it was due to the condition
of my ear or something

662
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:28,078
on that day, Sunday, but

663
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,081
I just couldn't monitor

664
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,516
It can be tough

665
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,984
So I changed the in-ears

666
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:37,955
Everyone, can you give me a moment?

667
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:39,490
Yes

668
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,691
It's nothing but

669
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,495
my in-ear mics have been troubling so

670
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,497
- Sound team, quickly get in
- I'll have to change the in-ears

671
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,032
- Sound team, hurry
- Can you please give me a moment?

672
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,034
Yes

673
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:52,569
I'm sorry, please give me a moment

674
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:54,838
Please have a chat and wait for me

675
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,308
Isn't she wearing Ultimate Ears
in-ear monitors?

676
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,676
She's wearing Westone

677
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:02,646
Please take a break

678
00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:04,114
- Don't mind me
- She's wearing Westone?

679
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,616
Westone to UE

680
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,484
I thought she was wearing UE

681
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,257
It's okay, this is fine

682
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:32,075
It's good

683
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:42,753
My ears hurt so much due to the size so

684
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,288
I switched to my old in-ears and

685
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:48,258
it was not the size that can accommodate
the size of the stadium

686
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,260
My old in-ears weren't

687
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,130
It was my first time performing at the
main stadium

688
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,299
I never experienced that scale so

689
00:38:56,066 --> 00:38:58,268
we had some trials and errors

690
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:01,471
This is not easy

691
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:08,212
I should be more relaxed on the second
day but

692
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:14,885
I think I'm strangely more anxious
than yesterday

693
00:39:15,552 --> 00:39:16,887
However, things are going well

694
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,159
In-ears are just like mics

695
00:39:22,392 --> 00:39:26,964
Some in-ears are good to capture delicate
sounds and

696
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:32,169
some in-ears are good to capture every
nuance so

697
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:35,172
you use different in-ears depending on
the size of the concert hall

698
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,075
But the main stadium was too sensitive

699
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,377
It was different on the thrust, the side
and the main stage

700
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,548
It was different everywhere so I was so
stressed thinking about where to

701
00:39:44,948 --> 00:39:47,251
set as the default

702
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,852
More than I was in other concert halls

703
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:50,587
I couldn't lose the in-ears

704
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,390
Anyway, you proved that you can do it

705
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,625
Yeah

706
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:56,960
- I think that's important
- Yes

707
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:58,962
You always push me to the limit and say

708
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:03,967
- "Hold it"
- No, not "Hold it"

709
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,702
- It's proven
- It's proven

710
00:40:05,702 --> 00:40:08,538
It was proven that I can do it

711
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,109
Perfect, I love it

712
00:40:12,776 --> 00:40:13,777
I love it

713
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:14,945
One hundred points

714
00:40:15,178 --> 00:40:16,647
Awesome, she's the best

715
00:40:18,348 --> 00:40:20,417
She is singing way better than yesterday

716
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:21,919
Incomparably better

717
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:23,954
- Is it fully relaxed?
- Huh?

718
00:40:24,187 --> 00:40:26,990
- Is her voice warmed up?
- No, her anxiety

719
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,426
She seems very confident
when she's commenting

720
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:32,329
She loosened up so much

721
00:40:33,797 --> 00:40:34,498
I love it

722
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:39,569
This time, in particular, I really can't
read the audience's reaction

723
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,373
I asked them to tell me everything because

724
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:47,110
my ears were way less sensitive than usual
due to the main stadium and

725
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:50,347
I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong

726
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,215
I didn't ask for praise

727
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,019
I asked them to give me a score whenever
I finish a song

728
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,555
So I could roughly figure it out and

729
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:01,291
control the level up and down

730
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,360
They usually find it very bothersome but

731
00:41:04,928 --> 00:41:07,064
they did that for me for the two days

732
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:09,967
It's been a long time since we worked
together now so

733
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,402
it can't be fun and exciting

734
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,404
in every concert

735
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:16,974
You might have enjoyed the second day but

736
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,811
they were trying to encourage me
I also do that too

737
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:23,080
When I'm really sensitive,

738
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,049
Why does your voice sound like that when
you're complimenting me

739
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,417
Why does it sound negative?

740
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:29,720
When he says "You're doing great”

741
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,655
I suddenly realize that

742
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:37,928
Jonghoon is trying to encourage me
I didn't do well

743
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:42,833
I realize it's fake so I ask him to be
very objective when giving opinions and

744
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,801
tell me if I did bad if I did bad

745
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,137
I ask him to tell me even when I'm singing

746
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:50,040
though it might ruin my concentration

747
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,775
Tell me everything after the 1st verse

748
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,777
Tell me if the pitch is dropping after the
1st verse is over

749
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,580
How my emotions are and all

750
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,450
If you're going to kudo me because it was
actually good,

751
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,885
say it in a bright tone

752
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:04,154
I even ask for that

753
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:08,191
On days I don't feel good,

754
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,029
I ask him to shout in my ears and

755
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,132
lighten up the mood

756
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:16,967
He performs those faithfully

757
00:42:17,734 --> 00:42:19,302
At concerts,

758
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,272
it's not about doing good or bad...

759
00:42:22,272 --> 00:42:24,408
Unless her pitch actually drops

760
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,677
She's good at most times so it's not about
doing good or bad

761
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:29,546
It's about giving her bright energy

762
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,748
We really do give her scores when we
work with the band

763
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,183
86 points

764
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:34,985
- For real
- Like that

765
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:39,556
How is there such a drastic difference
between songs you practiced or not

766
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:41,892
The verse was slightly high pitched

767
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,393
It happens all the time

768
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:48,999
The verse will be breathtaking if you can
manage that a bit more

769
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:51,168
When you see me playing with the band,

770
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:55,505
I look at Jonghoon after the 1st verse

771
00:42:55,672 --> 00:42:58,708
I look at him like this after the 1st verse
and he tells me to do this

772
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,444
or raise or lower it

773
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:04,981
He works as my ears throughout the concert

774
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:07,451
His opinion matters a lot to me

775
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:25,435
I'm the only person who doesn't get to see
the hot-air balloon

776
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,705
So I just trusted other's opinions

777
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:31,908
I once asked the director not to do it

778
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,744
Director Hyunwoo isn't usually like that
but he sounded very stubborn when he said

779
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:39,282
"I think we should”

780
00:43:39,616 --> 00:43:43,286
I explained that it'll be so scary to be up
high in the air

781
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:46,289
I won't have smooth reception up there

782
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:49,292
The wind suddenly blows above it and

783
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:51,061
it feels like it's not moving forward

784
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:55,365
I'm so concerned about leaving it solely
on the wind

785
00:43:55,765 --> 00:43:58,835
"There are several reasons why we should
call it quits”

786
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,738
"Why don't we just call it quits?”

787
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:03,874
"I think we should" was his reply

788
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:05,375
Okay, I'll do it then

789
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:06,409
You have no choice but to do it

790
00:44:06,409 --> 00:44:10,147
I should do it if the director tells me to

791
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,115
It's important not to make a request often

792
00:44:12,582 --> 00:44:15,986
That's right, it's important to make
a straight face

793
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:17,654
- in a critical, desperate situation
- Yes

794
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:21,958
I would've said "I can't do it" if he was
always so stubborn but

795
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:25,862
I've been working with director Hyunwoo
for many years & he never pushed me

796
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:29,866
"IU, is it making you uncomfortable?
Let's not do it then"

797
00:44:29,866 --> 00:44:32,035
This is how he usually is and

798
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:33,637
he said "I think we should” so

799
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,205
I said, "Okay"

800
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:36,273
I wanted to try it

801
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:40,844
No artist in Korea made a lap around the

802
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:44,214
the main stadium while singing before

803
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:49,553
To be honest, I did think that it might be
'impossible' but

804
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:51,955
I believed in you

805
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,291
I do it if you tell me to

806
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:57,594
You were very excited and dying to

807
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,564
work on this concert

808
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,599
It has been a long time since he directed
my concert so

809
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,169
he had so many ideas this time and

810
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,337
he made that all happen

811
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,071
He did

812
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:12,609
Without a single part reasonably compromised

813
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:13,777
He made everything happen

814
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,946
Everything he planned came true

815
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,581
My wishes were realized

816
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,284
I don't have a fear of heights or anything

817
00:45:21,284 --> 00:45:23,153
But the problem wasn't about going up

818
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,591
It was keep moving irregularly like

819
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,594
a pirate ship ride due to the wind so

820
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,429
that was scary

821
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:34,397
I ordered that on purpose

822
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:37,067
- To ride the waves
- I figured

823
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,437
I figured

824
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:42,138
Director

825
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,975
'strawberry moon' is

826
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:48,144
very unstable up there

827
00:45:48,144 --> 00:45:50,847
I'm not sure how it looked down here,
how was it?

828
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:52,182
For us?

829
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:54,884
It was good on the 2nd floor

830
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,553
To be honest, it is beautiful

831
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,091
but you can't hide your anxiety

832
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:01,925
No?

833
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,428
It's crashing

834
00:46:05,962 --> 00:46:07,264
I thought it was going to crash

835
00:46:07,597 --> 00:46:09,966
You didn't plan that, right?

836
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,370
Did I land on the proper landing spot?

837
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,773
- No
- The music is over

838
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,843
We were originally planning to set it up
on the stage but

839
00:46:20,076 --> 00:46:22,679
they said it's safe to land on the ground
when it's windy

840
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:28,184
It's raining, the floor is slippery

841
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:30,186
So the engineers were usually on time but

842
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:33,890
it didn't work like that this time so the
aeronaut made a decision

843
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:39,396
We were back on time when we did a full run
in the afternoon without you

844
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,967
However, there can always be variables

845
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,036
It'll be safe to think that you'll land

846
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:51,541
safely on the ground to plan your routes

847
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:56,880
I'm not sure if I'll look good on screen

848
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,348
You were fine on the screen

849
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:03,320
I'll be deadly pale, I'm not sure if that
would be alright

850
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:06,656
I'm not sure if I can act like I'm not
tomorrow

851
00:47:06,923 --> 00:47:10,660
It was shaking so hard that

852
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,962
I thought the balloon we rode in Buyeo was

853
00:47:12,962 --> 00:47:13,963
meaningless

854
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:15,332
Because it was windswept

855
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,968
It was wind-swept and I could feel

856
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,605
the balloon meeting air resistance

857
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,008
It made my body go this way

858
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:27,310
Come on

859
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:31,748
I was almost dangling on it in the end

860
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,416
I was keep looking at the screen and

861
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:36,119
my face looked so bad on it

862
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,220
It really did at first

863
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:42,425
With the fact that singing
my heart out like this itself is hard

864
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,162
I was going to ask if this is alright

865
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,432
It won't be so wind-swept tomorrow if
it doesn't rain, right?

866
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:51,801
We never know

867
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:55,171
I don't listen to 'strawberry moon' after
that

868
00:47:57,273 --> 00:47:58,007
You got sick of it already

869
00:47:58,007 --> 00:48:01,778
We performed 'strawberry moon' for about
15 minutes that day, right?

870
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:02,779
Right

871
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:06,082
'strawberry moon' that doesn't end until
you die

872
00:48:07,283 --> 00:48:10,320
I never listened to 'strawberry moon'
after that

873
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:15,759
We could say that the band and the singer
almost died

874
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,628
Yes but

875
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:19,462
it's not like I can

876
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:20,897
grab my mic and say

877
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:23,299
"Please make the band go one more lap”

878
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,468
I had to rely on my senses

879
00:48:25,468 --> 00:48:26,369
By reading the room

880
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,106
We had to take care of it ourselves

881
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,409
I felt how good our teamwork is there

882
00:48:33,643 --> 00:48:36,312
I realized,
'This is the power of experience'

883
00:48:36,946 --> 00:48:38,348
I've been very greedy

884
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,684
I was so thankful though

885
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:50,393
People who have been through all
circumstances dealt with it

886
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,263
We were trained by 'Hey'

887
00:48:53,663 --> 00:48:55,565
During other concerts,

888
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:58,301
they take care of the concert when I can't
jump in during 'Hey'

889
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:01,037
Our experience trained by 'Hey' was

890
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,506
manifested at 'strawberry moon'

891
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:05,775
I wonder how you felt when

892
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:09,112
you walked out to the thrust for 'My sea'

893
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:12,348
In fact, I had no time to feel anything

894
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,585
The audiences feel it

895
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,886
I have no idea

896
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,723
I'm the only person who didn't get to
watch it

897
00:49:20,723 --> 00:49:21,958
I didn't get to watch the laser show

898
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:24,461
'I guess it's going this way?’

899
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,663
'Is it looking fabulous?'

900
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:30,166
I just walk down thinking that because
I didn't get to watch it at all

901
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,769
People said the lasers were just fantastic

902
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:35,805
- from the seats that could see it
- Yeah?

903
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:39,075
1st-floor seats couldn't see the laser
clearly

904
00:49:40,376 --> 00:49:43,947
They could only see you walking down
from the fog

905
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:48,985
People on the left side could see all the
blue laser effects and

906
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:51,120
they said it was amazing

907
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,057
It's different in each seat

908
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,058
That's right

909
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:57,961
Let's wrap up after one song...

910
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,362
- OK
- Great

911
00:50:00,129 --> 00:50:02,165
- Let's do 'My sea'
- Yes, let's do 'My sea'

912
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:05,969
We have to do 'My sea'

913
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:08,304
We should, we can't postpone it forever

914
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,008
We're doing 'My sea" every single day

915
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:14,043
We must do 'My sea' every single day

916
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:17,580
Postludes of 'YOU&I' and 'My sea' seem

917
00:50:18,481 --> 00:50:19,782
- similar
- short in length

918
00:50:19,782 --> 00:50:22,151
Oh, the gap is short

919
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:28,558
They listen to 'Love poem' after the play,

920
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,830
then listen to your comments for a short
while and listen to the play again

921
00:50:34,163 --> 00:50:37,834
Why don't we just make an end to it
like the finish

922
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:38,935
I like that idea

923
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,069
Maybe we should

924
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:44,574
I guess it's not a bad idea for

925
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:47,544
you to wrap it up after a while from
"I won't"

926
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:51,481
I think it'll be okay to not make a fuss

927
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:55,385
Or turn off the lights after "I won't"

928
00:50:56,886 --> 00:50:58,087
Every light in the stadium

929
00:50:58,087 --> 00:50:59,689
That will have an impact

930
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:02,125
- It'll be totally impactful
- Turn off the glow sticks too

931
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,694
- What's going to happen next?
- I think IU will

932
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,329
wrap up on the thrust

933
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:08,665
She'll finish 'My sea' on the thrust

934
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,037
Everything will be like waves at that time

935
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,471
We're going to capture that moment

936
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:19,742
I think it'll be great if you walk down
the road and enter the sand glass

937
00:51:20,276 --> 00:51:23,780
rather than going out from the thrust

938
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:27,216
Though the postlude is playing after
"I won't"

939
00:51:27,216 --> 00:51:29,652
-I'm gone
- You should be gone, right?

940
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:36,025
I think turning off the lights after
"I won't" is a great idea

941
00:51:36,392 --> 00:51:38,061
Make the whole stadium blackout

942
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:44,000
Turn on small lights when they start
applauding

943
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:47,971
I think they will continue applauding if
I walk out from that moment

944
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:51,941
I think we should add the blackout

945
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:55,311
It's going to be extremely thrilling

946
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,113
if I perform great vocal skills but

947
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,316
people will be rumbling if I end up
messing up 'My sea'

948
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,485
"What just... is this alright?"

949
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,520
What music is playing while walking?

950
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,489
- No music, only waves
- Only wave sounds

951
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,562
She has a point

952
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,964
- After singing this part, right?
- Yes, up to this part

953
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,065
That'll be perfect then

954
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:19,435
The part where I walk down at the end of
'My sea' on the second day of the concert

955
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,671
- I walked with all my might
- Why?

956
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:23,339
- Because I was exhausted
- Because you were exhausted

957
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,011
I was exhausted and my outfit was very
heavy

958
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:31,014
It was a custom dress and it was very heavy

959
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:34,384
I think it weighed about 3kg

960
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:38,955
It had gold beads all over so

961
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,457
it was so heavy and I was tired

962
00:52:41,457 --> 00:52:43,860
I've lost weight since the opening

963
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,029
I finished the hardest song

964
00:52:46,262 --> 00:52:50,466
The concert is over if I walk down this
road

965
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:54,103
But it was longer than I expected

966
00:52:55,004 --> 00:52:55,938
I was also feeling awkward

967
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,442
It wasn't a cheerful mood

968
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,277
People were watching with bated breath

969
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,782
I'm thinking 'It'll be fascinating at the
moment' but

970
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,216
I don't get to see if it actually is so

971
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:11,020
I'm feeling awkward and at the same time
walking with all my might

972
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:13,656
'It's over if I get there'

973
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,459
I heard the drones were dope

974
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:19,062
- The drones were incredible
- The drones killed it

975
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:20,396
Really?

976
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:21,664
We were flabbergasted

977
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:25,334
It was the only thing that wasn't leaked

978
00:53:25,968 --> 00:53:29,706
This part or this part

979
00:53:30,306 --> 00:53:31,307
One of the two

980
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:34,744
First of all, during the outro of
'Through the Night'

981
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:38,147
after the artist on the thrust walks out,

982
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,450
another drone will fly on the other side

983
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:42,719
It will fly across the stage,

984
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:45,321
disappear into the LED in the center,

985
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,925
we will play a video on it

986
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,094
When the audience goes up in the video

987
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:53,629
the drones that were on stand-by in the air
will spread out and

988
00:53:53,996 --> 00:53:55,364
stop right here

989
00:54:05,808 --> 00:54:07,577
Will they know it's my song?

990
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:09,278
Your real fans will know

991
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:14,450
Maybe only 4,000 out of 40,000 will know

992
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,219
- Not even 4,000 people will know
- Really?

993
00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:18,254
IU's silhouette will appear

994
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,422
Really?

995
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,990
Aren't you using 16 drones?

996
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,694
What can we do with 16 drones

997
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:25,695
- How many? 300 drones?
- 300 drones

998
00:54:25,728 --> 00:54:27,497
Why did I think it was 167?

999
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:28,898
16 drones...

1000
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,668
I don't know if someone told me a joke and
said we will use 16 drones but

1001
00:54:32,668 --> 00:54:34,604
I really thought we had 16 drones

1002
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:37,607
I asked, "Aren't we flying 16 drones?”

1003
00:54:38,107 --> 00:54:40,443
"What do you mean”

1004
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,480
I thought it can be amazing with 16 drones

1005
00:54:45,381 --> 00:54:46,315
16 drones

1006
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:50,353
"This section is a bit long."

1007
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,288
"Rather than playing music only”

1008
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:54,290
"Why don't we play my song?"

1009
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,759
One of the staff came up with an idea

1010
00:54:56,759 --> 00:54:57,960
Let's play 'Last Fantasy'

1011
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:00,096
I think it was a joke at first

1012
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:02,632
But it actually came true

1013
00:55:04,433 --> 00:55:06,102
The orchestra members played it

1014
00:55:40,803 --> 00:55:42,305
I had a dream a while ago

1015
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,106
It was the day of the concert in my dream

1016
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,209
We were all sitting in the audience seat

1017
00:55:46,442 --> 00:55:48,778
IU was waiting on the stage on her own

1018
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,914
Hanteo was explaining it to the fans in
all of a sudden

1019
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:55,251
"Our engineer driver left behind the
hard disk..."

1020
00:55:56,185 --> 00:55:57,320
I left this

1021
00:55:57,553 --> 00:55:59,589
- "We can't have the concert"
- "I forgot to bring my laptop"

1022
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,490
"She can't sing"

1023
00:56:03,392 --> 00:56:04,927
It wasn't even due to the rain

1024
00:56:05,127 --> 00:56:06,696
Not due to all that

1025
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,297
Just because you forgot your laptop

1026
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:12,368
This is funny as a story but

1027
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:14,737
- it's horrible if you dream about it
- Of course

1028
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,006
It's dizzying just to imagine it

1029
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,375
Among all the equipment, I forgot a laptop

1030
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:20,943
and we can't have the concert

1031
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,814
Hayeon must've thought you were

1032
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:27,416
- so unreliable
- So unreliable

1033
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,519
She must've unconsciously thought,
'If we make a mistake, it's due to him'

1034
00:56:32,221 --> 00:56:34,657
- She dreamed about it
- Were you talking behind me?

1035
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:37,960
I'm the only one in this state

1036
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:41,397
My hair and makeup aren't done and I don't
know my routes on the stage but

1037
00:56:41,764 --> 00:56:42,732
the concert started

1038
00:56:42,765 --> 00:56:44,800
I've been dreaming about it every day
since a month ago

1039
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,701
I still dream about it these days

1040
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:47,436
Singers dream about that for a month

1041
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:51,507
In my case, I had to learn the song but
I didn't

1042
00:56:52,141 --> 00:56:53,009
Are you a composer?

1043
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,244
- I didn't learn it
- Are you a guitarist?

1044
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,113
He had to learn it but he didn't

1045
00:56:58,247 --> 00:56:59,415
It's terrifying

1046
00:56:59,448 --> 00:57:00,716
Of course, it's terrifying

1047
00:57:01,817 --> 00:57:04,954
What's wrong with EDAM staffs

1048
00:57:04,987 --> 00:57:07,323
getting told off by me due to

1049
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:12,461
mistakes caused by system errors such as

1050
00:57:13,095 --> 00:57:15,164
the audience having issues while entering

1051
00:57:16,098 --> 00:57:18,701
They all dream about making mistakes in
their sections

1052
00:57:19,101 --> 00:57:20,569
I dream about being unable to have
a full audience

1053
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:22,138
I didn't have a dream

1054
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:26,976
We had to stay up the night before due to
the memory

1055
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,778
We couldn't have a rehearsal

1056
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:30,012
You've been up all night

1057
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:33,616
I was working on the memory looking at
the rain thinking

1058
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,819
"I'm in trouble”
This was a dream itself

1059
00:57:37,753 --> 00:57:39,989
I guess I was so fazed

1060
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:53,903
Please give the guitar section more vinyl

1061
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,398
We had a little bit of trust

1062
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,767
that there won't be any issue on the day
of the concert

1063
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,869
I just believed in it like a superstition

1064
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:28,170
What if I don't believe it

1065
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,406
Nothing will change even if I don't believe
it so

1066
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:32,274
all of us believed it like a superstition

1067
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,378
"It's not going to rain that day"
"Nothing will go wrong that day"

1068
00:58:36,078 --> 00:58:39,882
We were brainwashing ourselves

1069
00:58:39,882 --> 00:58:43,219
We didn't have that serious matters

1070
00:58:43,986 --> 00:58:46,288
on the concert day, right?

1071
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,457
"It's not going to rain tomorrow"

1072
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,059
We just believed that

1073
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:55,965
I wasn't concerned about whether it will
rain or not on the first day but

1074
00:58:56,932 --> 00:58:58,334
not getting to run the tech rehearsal?

1075
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:01,070
We didn't get to check any technical
components

1076
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,305
We couldn't check the routes and

1077
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:06,876
we actually had to start the concert
without a final rehearsal

1078
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:07,943
It was the first time

1079
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:08,944
So I think

1080
00:59:10,112 --> 00:59:13,916
- it's a miracle the concert was successful
- I think the same

1081
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:15,918
To be honest,

1082
00:59:16,485 --> 00:59:17,820
I'm sorry to say this but

1083
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,555
there wasn't a single time where we
didn't make mistakes

1084
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:22,258
on the first day of the concert before

1085
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:23,192
Something always came up

1086
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,461
It could've been the video

1087
00:59:25,494 --> 00:59:27,329
- Technically?
- Yes, technically

1088
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:28,564
Yes, in history

1089
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:31,033
The players are all skilled but

1090
00:59:32,034 --> 00:59:35,604
based on the first day of the concert,
something always came up

1091
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:38,574
All the time

1092
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,676
- An error we never even imagined of
- Yeah

1093
00:59:40,676 --> 00:59:42,778
The video is suddenly not in sync

1094
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:45,514
- The chair goes up in a strange moment
- It happened in 2017

1095
00:59:45,781 --> 00:59:49,085
Something that should've blown up didn't
blow up, things like that happened

1096
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:52,955
We could say we didn't have any errors

1097
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:54,090
It really was a miracle

1098
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:54,723
It was a miracle

1099
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:57,193
We didn't get to do the final rehearsal

1100
00:59:57,326 --> 00:59:59,028
We had so many issues before

1101
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:02,598
Lasers, hot-air balloons and all

1102
01:00:02,598 --> 01:00:05,768
The fact everything went smoothly was

1103
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:07,336
a miracle

1104
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:14,176
I have to wait about an hour, right?

1105
01:00:14,176 --> 01:00:15,377
No, 10 minutes

1106
01:00:15,377 --> 01:00:16,512
10 minutes? Okay

1107
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:22,618
You can't try on your outfits because
we're not ready for quick change yet

1108
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:26,055
OK, let's save the outfits

1109
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,225
Save your stamina

1110
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,460
On the stage,

1111
01:00:32,995 --> 01:00:37,233
in the center of the road from the stage

1112
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:40,269
Center of the spot you're standing to
the road

1113
01:00:40,669 --> 01:00:43,639
A puddle will be made there if it rains
this much

1114
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:48,310
A puddle is made

1115
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:52,882
All the rain gathered above falls there

1116
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:56,185
I got flabbergasted too

1117
01:00:56,685 --> 01:00:57,686
Do not panic

1118
01:00:58,587 --> 01:01:00,623
You mean there will be a puddle, right?

1119
01:01:00,656 --> 01:01:03,726
We scrubbed it off now but

1120
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:06,362
if a ridiculous incident happens where it
suddenly starts raining during the concert

1121
01:01:06,395 --> 01:01:08,664
tomorrow, the rain will gather there

1122
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:11,767
It'll be totally dumbfounding

1123
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:12,768
It won't rain tomorrow

1124
01:01:12,768 --> 01:01:13,402
It won't

1125
01:01:15,704 --> 01:01:19,975
After IU left, everyone stayed behind
We gathered with the designers and

1126
01:01:20,442 --> 01:01:22,111
had a 30-minute-long emergency meeting

1127
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:26,215
We got hungry, ordered fried chicken,

1128
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:29,818
watched it rain thinking about what we
should do

1129
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:33,289
"Let's design it again one by one"
"Let's make modifications"

1130
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:37,026
The rain on the lights, the lasers looked

1131
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,395
more beautiful

1132
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:41,497
'This is also beautiful but'

1133
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,666
'I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow'

1134
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:44,900
'It won't rain'

1135
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,036
- That's what happened
- Super positive

1136
01:01:47,102 --> 01:01:48,470
It was beautiful though

1137
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,839
I knew it won't rain the next day so

1138
01:01:53,275 --> 01:01:54,510
it looked beautiful

1139
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,614
It was very aesthetic

1140
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:03,352
Rehearsing in the rain was nice too

1141
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:04,887
I liked the sentimental vibe

1142
01:02:06,288 --> 01:02:08,557
Now that I think about it,

1143
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,294
- I think it was very fun
- Yes, it's a good memory

1144
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,830
I don't think I'll get to experience that
ever again

1145
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:19,602
Are you beat?

1146
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:22,004
Yes, I am beat

1147
01:02:22,404 --> 01:02:24,640
If it outbreaks in the beginning,

1148
01:02:25,207 --> 01:02:26,208
I will be lost

1149
01:02:27,309 --> 01:02:30,279
I have no answer prepared for that

1150
01:02:33,882 --> 01:02:35,985
It'll be severe if it outbreaks in
the beginning

1151
01:02:36,885 --> 01:02:38,587
Will it matter to have a rehearsal?

1152
01:02:38,954 --> 01:02:40,456
So let's skip rehearsal tomorrow

1153
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,157
We don't have to do it

1154
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:47,429
I mean, if my ear disorder outbreaks after
a short while since the opening

1155
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:51,500
What should I do then?
I think that's the most crucial matter

1156
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:01,644
I don't think there's a way not to sweat

1157
01:03:03,445 --> 01:03:04,446
Should we shorten the route more?

1158
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:07,683
What about not walking out to the thrust
stage at all

1159
01:03:07,883 --> 01:03:10,719
- No rehearsal when it's the hottest
- No

1160
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:14,056
Your pores will stay open if it opens there

1161
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,258
It might be better if you come up stage

1162
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:23,232
in the evening when it's cool so we can
keep the pores from opening early

1163
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:26,268
Just relax your voice here

1164
01:03:28,203 --> 01:03:30,072
My voice is not the issue now

1165
01:03:30,205 --> 01:03:31,640
- Not anymore
- Even if

1166
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:34,977
my voice is totally shot,

1167
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,080
I'll be able to manage it because it's
the last day but

1168
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:40,416
I won't be able to do anything if my ears
start malfunctioning

1169
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,084
What should I do

1170
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,853
This is really unexpected

1171
01:03:45,187 --> 01:03:46,188
I'm having a mental breakdown

1172
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:47,856
I never thought I'll be sweating so much

1173
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:51,994
since I was born

1174
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:56,065
My stylists were worried it might be cold

1175
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,837
Will the audience be less shy tomorrow?

1176
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:06,542
I can totally feel that they're shy

1177
01:04:06,575 --> 01:04:07,576
- Yeah?
- Yes

1178
01:04:07,876 --> 01:04:10,813
I thought they were a bit fanatical when
they sang along 'Through the Night'

1179
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:14,350
- I could feel the madness
- I know

1180
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,944
If we have that event tomorrow,

1181
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:43,879
we'll have to

1182
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:46,415
- keep going till the end
- Yeah

1183
01:04:46,448 --> 01:04:48,183
Wasn't it so nice?

1184
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:50,886
- The audience singing along?
- Yes, that was very nice

1185
01:04:51,453 --> 01:04:53,555
- I loved it
- Let's keep that

1186
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:56,358
I just thought they were 'So amazing'

1187
01:04:56,992 --> 01:04:58,694
I think it's the first time I thought so

1188
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:01,463
It was not about getting touched or so

1189
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:03,399
'How amazing'

1190
01:05:03,665 --> 01:05:06,535
'How can 40,000 people sing together?'

1191
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:09,171
We sometimes don't click when

1192
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:11,540
we play together in the ensemble room

1193
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,675
They must've met each other for the first
time that day

1194
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:16,378
I'm sure 40,000 people didn't act at
the same time

1195
01:05:16,378 --> 01:05:19,314
However, 40,000 and a few thousand
people were

1196
01:05:19,948 --> 01:05:21,417
singing together with one voice

1197
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:23,886
- How did they figure out the key
- Yeah

1198
01:05:24,219 --> 01:05:27,656
How did they figure out the beat?
They finished the song

1199
01:05:27,856 --> 01:05:30,726
I really thought they were 'So amazing'

1200
01:05:31,293 --> 01:05:32,161
'Phenomenal'

1201
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:36,899
- The two songs were very tricky
- I know, but they chose them

1202
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,437
- They did it
- I know, they did it

1203
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:44,039
I really thought they were 'So amazing'

1204
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:47,643
We also enjoyed that moment

1205
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:51,180
IU was getting ready and we were listening
to the music

1206
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,515
We were listening to UAENA sing and

1207
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,885
felt very relieved

1208
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:58,353
'How nice"

1209
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,789
That's just phenomenal

1210
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,492
It's not easy even if you train for
a few days

1211
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:04,226
No, it's not

1212
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,162
I mentioned this a lot at that time but

1213
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,531
you should consider making a debut

1214
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:13,569
It was just so amazing

1215
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:19,241
Who started this?

1216
01:06:19,908 --> 01:06:23,145
One person must've come up with it at first

1217
01:06:23,445 --> 01:06:24,780
and led others to join, right?

1218
01:06:25,714 --> 01:06:28,350
Everyone, how did you do that

1219
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:32,154
'Love poem' is such a tough song to
sing live

1220
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:35,924
I was biting my tongue and holding it back

1221
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:38,427
Seriously

1222
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:46,268
You were incredible singers

1223
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:50,172
You have no idea how spectacular you look
from here

1224
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,342
I will never forget it

1225
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:55,878
Thank you for creating an unforgettable
moment

1226
01:06:56,512 --> 01:07:00,349
in a person's life

1227
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:02,251
I don't know what I did to deserve this

1228
01:07:03,585 --> 01:07:07,789
You came all this way and waited from
early morning,

1229
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,425
memorized the lyrics, sang me a song,

1230
01:07:10,425 --> 01:07:12,361
cheered for me until this hour

1231
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:15,030
What did I do to deserve this

1232
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:17,466
What a strange life

1233
01:07:21,136 --> 01:07:22,671
I hope I can be

1234
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:28,010
someone meaningful to you at least about
a quarter of

1235
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:31,647
what I am feeling at the moment

1236
01:07:33,248 --> 01:07:37,119
I will never forget this day and

1237
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,255
try to have a better life

1238
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:48,897
What will I do in my next concert?

1239
01:07:49,064 --> 01:07:54,236
Do you have other plans that are surreal

1240
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,838
that we haven't tried before?

1241
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:57,639
Talk show?

1242
01:07:57,639 --> 01:07:58,440
Talk show?

1243
01:07:58,740 --> 01:07:59,741
Talk concert?

1244
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:04,880
Can anything be more dynamic and shocking
direct-wise?

1245
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,714
I don't think so

1246
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,249
Really? You can't say that

1247
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:09,151
People won't come now then

1248
01:08:09,184 --> 01:08:10,519
You should say you have more

1249
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:13,322
Do you think you have more?

1250
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:14,389
I heard that we do

1251
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,627
Really? What more can we do?

1252
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:19,328
Yeah

1253
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,495
What about this?

1254
01:08:20,762 --> 01:08:22,731
IU suddenly disappears in the air

1255
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,167
You mentioned this once

1256
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,269
Appearing on a plane...

1257
01:08:27,769 --> 01:08:29,438
On a plane...
we can't do that due to the noise

1258
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,440
We can't do that due to the monitor

1259
01:08:31,873 --> 01:08:34,776
IU is in the air, then suddenly,

1260
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,380
'Bang" and she disappears with feathers
shattering

1261
01:08:39,848 --> 01:08:41,450
With some magic tricks

1262
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,152
I think you should learn some magic tricks

1263
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,322
- I think I should
- To create more dynamic concerts

1264
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,158
People will want more intensed contents

1265
01:08:50,592 --> 01:08:52,461
They won't be satisfied with hot-air
balloons anymore

1266
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:53,962
Drones won't be able to satisfy them

1267
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:54,997
I see

1268
01:08:56,331 --> 01:08:58,033
Hyunwoo, you have more ideas, right?

1269
01:08:58,033 --> 01:08:59,034
Of course, I do

1270
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,203
This wasn't Hyunwoo's last concert, right?

1271
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:05,807
I think this is a good thing though

1272
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:07,809
Taking things to the maximum and

1273
01:09:08,243 --> 01:09:09,711
then emptying it away

1274
01:09:10,078 --> 01:09:11,279
It's nice to do that from time to time

1275
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,582
I think that's very important because

1276
01:09:13,815 --> 01:09:16,284
this concert was

1277
01:09:17,452 --> 01:09:21,223
the maximum of maximum

1278
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,959
I think we should focus on the artist more

1279
01:09:23,992 --> 01:09:28,063
than on the concert from now on

1280
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:31,166
Baby steps toward that

1281
01:09:31,566 --> 01:09:32,801
- That's important
- I think that'll be better

1282
01:09:33,301 --> 01:09:33,802
I agree

1283
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:38,540
I did think it'd be better if we tone it
down a bit

1284
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:43,612
It's nice to go beyond limits of course but

1285
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:47,182
I think it'll be great if we can talk about

1286
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:50,118
things with more focus on them

1287
01:09:50,118 --> 01:09:51,586
No, please show me more extravagant things

1288
01:09:51,586 --> 01:09:52,587
- Is that what you want?
- Yes

1289
01:09:54,589 --> 01:09:57,693
Let's do that a while later

1290
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:58,493
A while later

1291
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,462
Until the next concert,

1292
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,030
I hope you can show it to us

1293
01:10:02,564 --> 01:10:04,332
'Wow, it can go the extra mile?

1294
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,701
Wowzers

1295
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,703
Wowzers

1296
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:08,904
I'll visit Las Vegas

1297
01:10:09,404 --> 01:10:10,405
Please tell us with confidence

1298
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:11,973
Excuse me?

1299
01:10:11,973 --> 01:10:13,175
Please tell us with confidence

1300
01:10:15,677 --> 01:10:16,578
About the next concert?

1301
01:10:16,678 --> 01:10:18,013
Yes, there are fiercer elements,

1302
01:10:18,246 --> 01:10:20,615
new ideas for the next concert

1303
01:10:20,615 --> 01:10:22,617
I'm not sure it'll be realizable but

1304
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:25,320
I did have such imagination

1305
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:32,961
The only thing left is IU getting
disintegrated in the air, right?

1306
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:34,429
Disintegration in the air...

1307
01:10:36,364 --> 01:10:38,967
We also didn't try cloning before

1308
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:42,070
Disintegration in the air, teleportation

1309
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:44,139
Yes

1310
01:10:44,606 --> 01:10:45,407
Dark magic

1311
01:10:48,443 --> 01:10:50,912
That's the direction we should pursue
You should visit Hogwarts once

1312
01:10:50,912 --> 01:10:51,780
I will

1313
01:10:52,247 --> 01:10:53,482
Flying on a broomstick

1314
01:10:54,616 --> 01:10:58,987
It has to be realizable and fun as well

1315
01:10:59,654 --> 01:11:03,759
I'll look for unrealistic things rather
than realistic things

1316
01:11:04,626 --> 01:11:06,461
I love unrealistic things

1317
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:10,599
I'll think of something that can trigger
your imagination

1318
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:11,533
That's great

1319
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:16,204
Anyway, I have more to show you

1320
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:17,906
I'm still thirsty

1321
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:19,674
Yes

1322
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:22,644
I think he's actually thirsty

1323
01:11:24,946 --> 01:11:26,515
I think he's actually parched with thirst

1324
01:11:27,415 --> 01:11:28,583
I'll look forward to it

1325
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,986
I am also very excited about it
