00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:42,808
<eight>

2
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:36,208
<Celebrity>

3
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,394
Hello

4
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,901
The seats down here are full for real

5
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,943
First of all, it's been too long

6
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:33,445
Let me officially

7
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,047
say hello

8
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,516
This is TU

9
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:40,619
back with you,
audiences, at a concert hall

10
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:43,422
after 3 years, nice to meet you

11
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:53,665
Wow

12
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,337
Let me have some water

13
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,517
Yes, I remember how you used to cheer
whenever I drink water

14
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:16,155
It's been such a long time

15
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:18,557
I forgot about that too

16
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,627
You guys were doing fine, right?

17
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,796
Yes

18
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,130
Wasn't it too hot?

19
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:29,134
It was hot, to be honest

20
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,005
Me and my team also sweated so much

21
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:35,007
during rehearsal and

22
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,877
it was tough yesterday because it rained

23
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,014
I was so concerned about the audiences
today

24
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:45,784
Nobody got affected by the heat or

25
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,654
get ill and doing fine

26
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,422
at your seats, right?

27
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,058
Yes

28
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:55,594
Today I will be

29
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,597
performing for, well...

30
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:00,899
I'm sure some of you already know but

31
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,436
the concert is going to be shorter than
my former concerts

32
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:05,704
SO

33
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,140
the concert will get interrupted

34
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:10,409
if I talk too much

35
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,610
They might just

36
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,679
shut it down so

37
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,481
you guys have to stop me

38
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,883
if I start talking too much

39
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,152
Otherwise, the song will stop, alright?

40
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,020
Yes

41
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,724
I don't think I can control myself to not
talk too much to be honest

42
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:28,026
I hope you can do that for me

43
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,163
That's why I won't be talking long

44
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,066
2nd and 3rd floor, can you see me clearly?

45
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,002
Yes

46
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,304
2nd and 3rd floor, how are you so loud?

47
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:47,412
You see, I had to wear in-ear mics

48
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:52,050
in both my ears for this concert so

49
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:54,052
I can't hear you very well

50
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:56,288
Also, you are all wearing masks so

51
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,323
I can't really tell

52
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:00,325
what kind of faces you're making

53
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,030
Please smile a lot over the mask like this

54
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:08,267
I really don't know how your faces are

55
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,002
You are singing along, right?

56
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,204
Yes

57
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:13,605
OK

58
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:15,841
Since we have a long way to go

59
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,609
let me proceed

60
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:18,777
I'll just have one more sip of water

61
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,290
Do I look pretty on the screen?

62
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,559
Yes

63
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,096
The two opening songs were my new songs

64
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,132
So

65
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:41,767
the next song will be

66
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,971
a song that can bring back nostalgia to you

67
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:49,808
so you can think,
'This is how IU's concert was'

68
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:51,543
that are quite familiar to you

69
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:57,549
<dlwlrma>

70
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:35,667
<Every End of the Day>

71
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:22,027
That's too much

72
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:07,038
Thank you

73
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,611
Was it like IU's concert now?

74
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,780
Yes

75
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,584
I am going to sing songs that will

76
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,420
make it feel more like IU's concert

77
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,323
and are more familiar to you

78
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,027
The true value of the audience will be

79
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:30,729
revealed in this part

80
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:33,364
This song is like an indicator to find out

81
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,568
the propensity of the audiences

82
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,537
I can also check the gender ratio of
today's audiences

83
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,906
with this song and the two songs
that follow it and

84
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:46,444
how much you are willing to participate

85
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,214
in the performance as well

86
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,952
Do I look pretty on the screen?

87
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,854
Yes

88
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,956
I used a lot of hair spray today

89
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,226
Please let me know if my hair starts
looking too flat

90
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,027
OK

91
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:06,664
The next song is

92
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,834
What's up?

93
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,105
You have to tell me why you're laughing

94
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:17,942
Because I'm pretty?

95
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,615
You're laughing because I'm pretty?

96
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:26,484
Thank you

97
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:28,419
I feel like I'm getting spoiled by you

98
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,156
since the opening, I love it

99
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,323
Also,

100
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,160
I think some of you may not know but

101
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,395
today is the 14th anniversary of my debut

102
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:43,868
How could I be so lucky to choose the
perfect Sunday to have a concert and

103
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:47,305
celebrate my debut anniversary as well

104
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:50,275
I guess I'm extremely lucky

105
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,313
That's why you were nice to me today

106
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,049
I get it now

107
00:21:58,449 --> 00:21:59,017
OK

108
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:01,019
The next song is

109
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:03,555
Thank you in advance, everyone

110
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:06,791
You'll know what to do as soon as you
hear the intro

111
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:14,299
<Meaning of you>

112
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:35,520
It's my turn in this part

113
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,403
Now it's your turn

114
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:29,974
One, two, three, four

115
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,452
You're so good

116
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:19,417
One more time

117
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:05,229
<Friday>

118
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,227
And

119
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,933
You're so good

120
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:48,833
Once more

121
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,121
Thank you

122
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,861
You're so cooperative today

123
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,501
Didn't you think it was so amazing?
You kept doing a good job, right?

124
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:08,072
I saw you taking the initiative there

125
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:13,311
As soon as you heard 'Friday',

126
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:15,146
you went "Yeaahh" so

127
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:19,050
I walked to that side as if I was possessed

128
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:23,654
The timing was perfect

129
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,758
Thank you so much

130
00:30:28,025 --> 00:30:29,860
I'm sweating a lot again

131
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:32,530
Do I look alright?

132
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,465
Yes

133
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:35,733
Do I look dry and soft?

134
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,501
Yes

135
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:41,539
I heard that you could see my sweat
rolling off on the screen yesterday so

136
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:45,509
the people watching me felt concerned

137
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:47,978
Everyone, it's very hot at the moment,
right?

138
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:51,916
It's okay, you can be honest

139
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:52,850
It's hot, right?

140
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,785
Yes

141
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:58,055
I thought it'd be pleasantly cool

142
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,857
by September 18

143
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:03,094
I didn't expect it to be this hot

144
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,664
I need more water...

145
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:21,345
Thank you

146
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,385
It's definitely hotter today than yesterday

147
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:29,687
Let's stay strong till the end

148
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,355
Yes

149
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:32,590
Don't push yourself too hard

150
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,293
The next song is

151
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,132
Yesterday

152
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,270
I told Saturday's audiences in advance but

153
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,774
it's the graduation of

154
00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:51,275
a song I dearly love

155
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,347
Some of you may have heard about it but

156
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:00,084
I wrote and composed this song

157
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:03,587
when I was 25 years old and

158
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,959
cherished it very much as I performed it

159
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:10,428
but now

160
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,732
I entered my 30s this year

161
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:19,236
I decided to leave this song

162
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:22,473
to 25-year-old IU now

163
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:30,214
The time when I performed this song was

164
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,184
the prime of my life, when I was 25

165
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:37,421
But somehow I turned 30 and

166
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:40,491
I'm welcoming moments

167
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,560
as good as that time these days

168
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:46,330
I guess... it's a good thing

169
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:49,433
I felt like I shouldn't have to

170
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:53,170
hold on to this song anymore so

171
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:55,840
this concert will be

172
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,575
the last time to

173
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:00,578
find this song on the official set list

174
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:04,448
My fans loved this song very much

175
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:09,053
I didn't feel so sad until yesterday but

176
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,126
I am feeling a bit sad today

177
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:22,566
Please sing along if you know the song

178
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:27,404
For one last time, like a 25-year-old,

179
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:30,074
I will sing more earnestly than ever

180
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:31,909
The song is called 'Palette'

181
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:42,520
<Palette>

182
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:52,029
A child lived in a sea that never dries up

183
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,601
A sea that is so silent as if time stopped

184
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:00,671
and all you could hear were
the sound of waves

185
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:06,777
The waves warmly wrap the child's feet and

186
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:11,648
the wind washed off the dust on
the child's body

187
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:18,989
The child loved hearing the stories of
the world told by the waves

188
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:21,391
The wave told the child,

189
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,895
"Someday, when you become a wave like me"

190
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:30,200
"You will meet those worlds yourself”

191
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,938
The child waited for that day to come and

192
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:36,874
wrote down the stories told by the wave

193
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:39,643
in her journal every single day

194
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:46,049
The child suddenly wondered what love was

195
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:52,189
She approached the wave and asked what
love is

196
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:53,991
The wave answered,

197
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:57,761
"What colors your world red”

198
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:01,131
"That's what love is"

199
00:40:06,536 --> 00:40:10,107
The child held out her favorite things
to the wave to

200
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:13,243
make sure if those were love but

201
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,150
somehow the wave didn't answer the child

202
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,230
One day, the moon appeared over the
child's sea

203
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:37,834
A big moon popped up on a blue sky

204
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:44,408
No matter how much the child looked at it,
the moon did not even wiggle

205
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,477
It neither sank nor rose

206
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:49,980
I was just there in its spot

207
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:56,253
The child suddenly felt her heart pounding

208
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,691
"Wave, is that moon love?"

209
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:05,862
"But that moon has no color"

210
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:11,835
The wave was lost in thought for a moment

211
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:24,281
It handed something to the disappointed
child and said,

212
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:28,318
"Look carefully”

213
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:33,490
"When a moment is precious enough to make
you want to stop time from passing by"

214
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:38,462
"At last, your world will turn red”

215
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,937
Have you ever witnessed magic
before your eyes?

216
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:50,574
Or

217
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:56,747
have you ever had a magical love?

218
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:45,622
<strawberry moon>

219
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:00,817
Everyone

220
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:46,129
One more time

221
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,482
Are you still singing?

222
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:27,871
Please keep singing

223
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,884
We're almost there

224
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:20,323
Keep singing everyone

225
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,894
Don't push yourself too hard though

226
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:50,753
Louder

227
00:50:20,383 --> 00:50:21,150
That was long

228
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,399
<Hold My Hand>

229
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:38,301
Do you think you can do this as well?

230
00:50:38,768 --> 00:50:39,469
Do you?

231
00:50:41,404 --> 00:50:42,138
Do you?

232
00:51:02,525 --> 00:51:03,126
Louder

233
00:51:06,262 --> 00:51:07,130
You're so good

234
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:54,203
Who?

235
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:33,676
One last time

236
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:05,942
Thank you

237
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:12,849
That was incredible

238
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:18,821
Please let me wipe the sweat for a second

239
00:54:23,826 --> 00:54:25,695
Everyone, on the 2nd and 3rd floor

240
00:54:26,395 --> 00:54:27,864
Were you able to see me clearly?

241
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:30,099
Was it alright?

242
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:32,301
Yes

243
00:54:32,635 --> 00:54:33,870
(Voices are) so loud

244
00:54:34,937 --> 00:54:38,040
2nd and 3rd floors are very loud today

245
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,948
I wanted to get closer to

246
00:54:46,382 --> 00:54:48,718
the audiences on 2nd and 3rd floor

247
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:49,886
SO

248
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:54,590
I put a moon over Jamsil

249
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,560
Well... was it splendid?

250
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,029
Yes

251
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:04,333
I put up that moon for the first time
yesterday

252
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:06,869
I can say this because this is the final
concert but

253
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:11,007
it's been exactly 10 years this year

254
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:14,410
since I started doing concerts

255
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,312
For the first time in 10 years

256
00:55:18,414 --> 00:55:21,684
I couldn't do a run-through before
the concert because

257
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:24,554
rehearsal was planned on Friday and

258
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:27,190
it poured that day

259
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:31,260
I started my first concert yesterday
without rehearsing with the technical team

260
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,798
So I rode the moon in the wind and rain

261
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,701
It was terrifying

262
00:55:40,736 --> 00:55:43,105
I was terrified and I thought,

263
00:55:43,439 --> 00:55:47,210
'Should I not do this?' but

264
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:52,048
I'm glad I went with it today

265
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:55,685
Let me quench my thirst

266
00:56:06,095 --> 00:56:06,996
This is not easy

267
00:56:08,397 --> 00:56:11,467
Usually, I should be more relaxed

268
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,769
at the second concert but

269
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:20,509
it seems like I'm strangely more anxious
about things than yesterday

270
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,545
However, things are going fine

271
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:34,156
I performed 'strawberry moon' and

272
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,492
'Hold My Hand' in a row

273
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:40,463
During the 3 years I couldn't have concerts

274
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:42,798
I released 'strawberry moon' and

275
00:56:42,865 --> 00:56:46,135
'Hold My Hand' suddenly climbed up
the chart in 10 years

276
00:56:47,436 --> 00:56:50,640
I thought a lot of you would want to hear
it so

277
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:55,278
I performed it in the important part

278
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:59,615
It was the first time in history that
you sang along to "You're feeling it"

279
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:02,518
I was flustered because

280
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:07,189
of my ear but

281
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,625
I still got very surprised

282
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:11,861
I got goosebumps
"You're feeling it" is very high pitched

283
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:16,766
and you sang along to that part

284
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,101
Thank you anyways

285
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,637
I will continue to communicate with you

286
00:57:21,904 --> 00:57:24,840
like this through part 2 so

287
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:29,879
don't push yourself too hard and try
to save some strength

288
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,781
It's okay to take it slow, okay?

289
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:33,516
Yes

290
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:35,251
However, not for the next song

291
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,787
Not for this part everyone

292
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:39,522
You see

293
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:44,026
the live clip of this song got popular

294
00:57:44,593 --> 00:57:47,663
during the 3 years I couldn't have concerts

295
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:52,435
and it recorded a lot of view counts

296
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:56,172
I'm sure there are many people who came
today to listen to this song

297
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,040
Thank you in advance

298
00:57:58,941 --> 00:58:00,710
Yes

299
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:08,150
<Blueming>

300
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:35,524
One more time

301
01:01:52,908 --> 01:01:53,709
One more time

302
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:11,760
Last one

303
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:41,190
<lLast night story>

304
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:45,467
Thank you

305
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,440
Thank you so much for this

306
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:52,808
Seriously

307
01:06:56,845 --> 01:06:58,113
Let me have some more water

308
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:11,760
Do I look

309
01:07:13,228 --> 01:07:14,396
pretty on the screen?

310
01:07:14,596 --> 01:07:15,864
Yes

311
01:07:16,398 --> 01:07:18,066
Since this is the last concert,

312
01:07:19,501 --> 01:07:21,537
my hair and makeup staffs

313
01:07:22,037 --> 01:07:25,440
put their hearts and souls into it

314
01:07:26,074 --> 01:07:31,547
They also put sparkles on this part if you
look closer

315
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,115
They don't put it on me every time

316
01:07:36,785 --> 01:07:37,719
Everyone, are you tired?

317
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,492
Your response is amazing today

318
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:50,365
I wish I could walk around more

319
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:53,669
I wish I could perform

320
01:07:55,804 --> 01:07:59,942
walking back and forth all along today

321
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,010
It's such a shame that

322
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,646
I can't have two bodies today

323
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,482
I love the response from here so

324
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:14,156
I'll keep talking as I walk back

325
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:15,257
I'll be back everyone

326
01:08:15,757 --> 01:08:16,525
Thank you

327
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,369
You're tired, I'm so sorry

328
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:30,872
You keep screaming when I look at you

329
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:32,608
I shouldn't look at anyone

330
01:08:37,112 --> 01:08:37,746
Everyone

331
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:43,385
I'm worried you might pass out

332
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:47,389
I do love it but

333
01:08:50,225 --> 01:08:51,560
I really do love it

334
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:54,830
I am

335
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:03,071
here

336
01:09:09,811 --> 01:09:10,646
The next song is

337
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:12,681
yesterday

338
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:18,053
I started without being able to explain
the song thoroughly

339
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:19,821
Please let me wipe my sweat for a second

340
01:09:23,525 --> 01:09:25,060
Coming to help me

341
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:36,238
Who on earth knew it'd be so hot

342
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:38,974
on September 18, right?

343
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:42,344
Everyone, it's too hot, right?

344
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,984
Dear me, you've been waiting since morning

345
01:09:49,484 --> 01:09:52,754
Today is even hotter, I'm so sorry

346
01:09:56,224 --> 01:09:59,795
How hard is it for you with masks on

347
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,503
The next song is

348
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:13,375
widely known as my signature song

349
01:10:14,943 --> 01:10:18,080
This song will also graduate in this show

350
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:21,049
as a set with 'Palette" from earlier

351
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:25,520
Some of you may have heard the news but

352
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:31,626
it's my biggest hit

353
01:10:32,527 --> 01:10:35,197
It's the song that made me famous

354
01:10:35,964 --> 01:10:39,735
I performed it a lot and have a lot of
memories with it

355
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:41,970
On the anniversary of my debut,

356
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:43,672
that's meaningful as well

357
01:10:44,706 --> 01:10:48,877
I'm afraid it'll be hard to find this song

358
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:52,114
on the official set list for a while

359
01:10:53,448 --> 01:10:54,916
People who came to hear this song

360
01:10:57,619 --> 01:10:58,620
I'm sorry too

361
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,526
I'm having a lot of thoughts in my mind

362
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:07,829
I remember the numerous stages
I performed this song

363
01:11:09,097 --> 01:11:13,401
I'll do my best to sing it today

364
01:11:16,838 --> 01:11:20,242
You always did the fan chant called

365
01:11:21,943 --> 01:11:23,111
'Real thing IU'

366
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:25,614
I still laugh every time I hear it

367
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:33,555
Please do it for me until today

368
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:38,860
Let's cheer up and get going

369
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:41,596
It's 'Good Day'

370
01:11:44,766 --> 01:11:49,771
<Good Day>

371
01:15:29,824 --> 01:15:30,992
Did you like it for the last time?

372
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,428
Yes

373
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,263
Shall we do this part together?

374
01:15:59,487 --> 01:16:00,288
Thank you

375
01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:07,429
The last concert is beyond expectations

376
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:15,336
I honestly did not doubt

377
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:17,806
this part for even a second

378
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:20,175
I almost cried

379
01:16:23,978 --> 01:16:28,083
I have so many memories of this song

380
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:31,486
Some of you might think,

381
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:33,521
'Then why don't you keep singing it'

382
01:16:36,157 --> 01:16:39,627
'Good Day' is a very dramatic song and

383
01:16:39,627 --> 01:16:42,564
I always do the 3 step high notes and

384
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,032
leave the hall

385
01:16:44,265 --> 01:16:46,034
This was like a fixed plan

386
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,136
So when I plan the set list,

387
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:53,007
'Good Day' always had to be placed in
the obvious part so

388
01:16:53,174 --> 01:16:56,277
it was hard to create a new set list

389
01:16:56,444 --> 01:16:58,379
It became similar every time

390
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,448
It was always a shame and

391
01:17:00,982 --> 01:17:03,318
as I told you earlier,

392
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:06,221
I became a new me, I entered my 30s

393
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:09,057
I was 18 years old when I did this song

394
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:13,394
A long time has passed, right?

395
01:17:17,932 --> 01:17:19,934
It goes, "I like you oppa"” but

396
01:17:24,005 --> 01:17:26,241
I don't think there are that many oppas
anymore to start with

397
01:17:27,775 --> 01:17:31,012
There were a lot of fans in elementary
school yesterday

398
01:17:31,379 --> 01:17:33,715
Those fans in elementary school and

399
01:17:33,748 --> 01:17:35,416
young fans were

400
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:38,286
born when I sang 'Good Day'

401
01:17:38,686 --> 01:17:41,623
So, they are not familiar with 'Good Day'

402
01:17:41,956 --> 01:17:44,259
as IU's signature song

403
01:17:44,692 --> 01:17:46,561
How amazing is that, right?

404
01:17:47,395 --> 01:17:51,933
Therefore, for the set list and a new
concert routine

405
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:55,303
To be honest, it's also a bummer and
pressure for me to

406
01:17:56,237 --> 01:17:58,106
not have 'Good Day' on the list

407
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:01,843
However, I thought it was a necessary
challenge for me

408
01:18:01,976 --> 01:18:03,778
to create a more interesting concert

409
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,681
That's why I made the decision

410
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:07,282
You know what,

411
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:12,487
it was the last time singing 'Good Day' but

412
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:16,891
I felt like I became the trend again,
the 'Real thing' again

413
01:18:18,426 --> 01:18:22,197
I felt like I was 18 again, seriously

414
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,098
Thank you

415
01:18:24,532 --> 01:18:25,867
This feels so weird

416
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,936
I never imagined it

417
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:36,578
Anyhow,

418
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:39,981
I usually leave the stage but I didn't
because

419
01:18:41,382 --> 01:18:44,485
I still have one more song to perform
before part 2 is done

420
01:18:46,287 --> 01:18:47,021
I need you to buckle down

421
01:18:49,457 --> 01:18:50,925
for this song again

422
01:18:50,925 --> 01:18:52,560
I keep asking you to do that today

423
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:57,732
We announced the fan chant beforehand

424
01:18:58,132 --> 01:19:01,202
I know the fan chant isn't easy

425
01:19:01,202 --> 01:19:02,737
I tried it too

426
01:19:02,737 --> 01:19:06,874
It was more difficult than ever

427
01:19:06,941 --> 01:19:11,179
But yesterday, Saturday's audiences really
busted their buns for it

428
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:13,014
Today is the final concert so

429
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:13,848
Wow it's cool

430
01:19:16,417 --> 01:19:18,953
Everyone, enjoy the wind for a while

431
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,288
The wind is blowing

432
01:19:22,223 --> 01:19:22,957
Thank you

433
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,496
This is the opening I wanted

434
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:31,666
I guess the wind will blow now

435
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:32,533
Thank god

436
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:35,403
Hope you can enjoy the wind too

437
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,474
As a fan of IU

438
01:19:40,608 --> 01:19:43,811
there must have been many shining moments
for you as well

439
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:47,115
From 'Good Day' with me and

440
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:49,350
'Nagging' to

441
01:19:50,084 --> 01:19:53,721
'Through the Night", 'Blueming' recently

442
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:56,658
Later on

443
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:00,361
when you remember me

444
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:04,065
I hope you can reminisce about this

445
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:07,769
as the brightest moment

446
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:15,443
Please let me shine

447
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,246
Yes

448
01:20:19,747 --> 01:20:20,548
Thank you in advance

449
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:31,225
