1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,505
There was a day when I remembered
a forgotten memory

2
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:14,013
I got back home late at night that day

3
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,516
It feels like

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,853
I'm going to an opposite world
when that happens

5
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:25,424
I wonder, 'Is this the right place?

6
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:46,612
I couldn't fall asleep easily on those days

7
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,783
Rather than emptiness

8
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,452
I guess I was just anxious

9
00:00:57,256 --> 00:01:00,359
It felt like I shouldn't fall asleep then

10
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,430
I felt like I had to do something

11
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,256
When I was young, I kept a diary
quite regularly

12
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,260
What happened that day, the dream I had

13
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:37,863
Even the fairy tales I read

14
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,771
I suddenly remembered it and read it again
that day

15
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,275
I didn't even notice the dawn breaking

16
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,183
Clearly, there were moments
precious enough

17
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:00,019
to hope for time to stop

18
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,797
As if the time that went back to then

19
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,934
had stopped there

20
00:02:55,808 --> 00:03:00,813
<Knees>

21
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,995
<Winter Sleep>

22
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:44,763
Thank you

23
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,338
Part 3 has started everyone

24
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,046
You gave me
such a big round of applause

25
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:04,716
for 'Knees'

26
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,787
We have this planned

27
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:12,824
We have it planned to start 'Winter Sleep'

28
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,627
right after 'Knees' without saying a word

29
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:17,562
but I wanted to hear the applause for
a long time to

30
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,498
want to break that plan

31
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:27,706
Thank you

32
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:34,646
I prepared soft ballad songs for part 3

33
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,017
This part is shorter than other concerts so

34
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:42,387
'Which song should I do to have no regrets'

35
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,357
This is the part I was very worried about
as well

36
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,425
However

37
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,331
I'm not sure if you all think so but

38
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,934
I consider 'Knees' as the song that's

39
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:02,007
close to the identity of the artist I am

40
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:06,712
I know you prefer the 3 high notes

41
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:11,917
Though it's not a widely known song,

42
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,287
I wanted to sing 'Knees' on stage and

43
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,790
the song called 'Winter Sleep' after it is

44
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:22,027
a song I wrote

45
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:26,598
I tried to go back to the sentiments I had

46
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:31,937
when I wrote 'Knees' when I wrote it

47
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,573
I think it's the first time I'm telling you
this story

48
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,842
I consider

49
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:41,146
'Knees' and 'Winter Sleep'
a set in my mind

50
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:45,951
They're also in the same key and

51
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:48,353
the emotional basis is similar when I sing
them so

52
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:53,392
I wanted to have time to sing the two
songs in a row for the audiences

53
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,729
Before moving on to the next song,

54
00:14:57,996 --> 00:14:59,931
they are my trusted confidants and

55
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:05,137
extremely valuable people for the concert

56
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,306
Please give a round of applause for
the orchestra members

57
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,215
Wazn't that so cool?

58
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,586
I was trying to say "Wasn't that so cool?"
and "That was so cool"”

59
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:23,155
at the same time so

60
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:26,825
I got to say "Wazn't that so cool?" like
I'm trying to be cute, it was involuntary

61
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,226
They were incredibly cool, right?

62
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:29,761
Yes

63
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,098
They will keep on doing their amazing
work for the rest of the time

64
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,434
Please keep your eye on the orchestra

65
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,204
Don't just look at me only

66
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:44,543
The next song is also a ballad

67
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,979
This song is also a song I sang

68
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,416
as a teenager, when I was about 19

69
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,852
Conveying my emotions,

70
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:56,822
the song is called 'Only I didn't know'

71
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:04,663
<Only I didn't Know>

72
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,112
Thank you

73
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,154
The reason why
I love this time is because

74
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:26,424
this is the only time I can enjoy

75
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,294
during this concert

76
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,665
The time to listen to master Sojin's
performance in the postlude

77
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,936
for about 30 seconds is

78
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,973
the only time for me to take a breath and

79
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:45,243
appreciate it as a part of the audience

80
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,912
The performance was wonderful as usual,
right?

81
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,048
Yes

82
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:51,950
Please give a big round of applause

83
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:08,833
The band is working so hard

84
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,970
I was so busy leaving after 'LILAC' to

85
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:16,040
go fix my hair and makeup,
get changed and all

86
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,175
How do you like my outfit?

87
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,247
To be honest, this is my favorite outfit

88
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,083
during this concert

89
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:31,623
There are many more sparkling, more
dazzling, prettier outfits but

90
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:34,159
for the ballad part

91
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:38,696
I guess I'm quite dressed up to say
it's humble

92
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,767
It makes me feel more sincere to

93
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,270
dress up neat and tidy like this to sing

94
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,340
It doesn't mean that I'm not sincere

95
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,142
when I'm singing in a sparkly dress

96
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:54,245
This helps me more to focus on the song

97
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,381
It's more convenient to wear pants too

98
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:58,149
It's my favorite outfit

99
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:02,754
The next song is

100
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:07,025
As mentioned earlier, elementary school
students

101
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:10,695
Even elementary school students know
this song

102
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:14,365
A lot of them know this song even though
they don't know 'Good Day'

103
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,535
My fans in elementary school

104
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,605
I sincerely appreciate you

105
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,808
You are the future now

106
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,079
Promise to come to my concert after
10 years

107
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,551
Fans in elementary school, will you scream
for me?

108
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,822
I'll know if adults scream acting like
they're elementary school students

109
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:41,626
Only my fans
in elementary school, scream

110
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,496
I only have a few fans
in elementary school today

111
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,666
Lesser than yesterday

112
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,870
Anyways, my fans in elementary school
are the future

113
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,340
Please sing along if you know this song

114
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:03,982
Not sure if I should distinguish it into
mid-phase or later-phase but

115
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,351
this is the signature of signature songs of

116
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,455
IU's later-phase

117
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:13,758
I'm so excited to hear

118
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,327
more than 40 thousand people

119
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,931
singing along to this song on Sunday

120
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:22,567
Please give it up for 'Through the Night'

121
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:33,311
<Through the Night>

122
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:52,690
You're really good

123
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:47,271
<above the time>

124
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:35,185
Thank you

125
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:38,956
Everyone

126
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,258
Did you like the drones?

127
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:43,327
Yes

128
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,362
I'm the only one who didn't get to see
the drone show

129
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,900
I'm the only one at this concert who
didn't get to see it

130
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:54,104
All the staff and audience got to see it

131
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,541
I read the review of the drone show only
I didn't get to see and

132
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:00,043
they said it was magnificent

133
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,913
They could see it from Ttukseom

134
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:09,019
They might be watching it at the moment

135
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,988
Everyone, did you enjoy it?

136
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:12,756
Yes

137
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,460
My parents were here yesterday

138
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:20,264
Of course they're here today as well

139
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,501
They were here yesterday and

140
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:28,005
my mom was deeply impressed

141
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,275
"You were amazing and did great"

142
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:33,710
I asked what dad said and she told me

143
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:37,080
dad asked,
"How much did the drones cost"

144
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,384
"Please find out about it"

145
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,453
I heard that my dad asked that

146
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:45,889
My dad doesn't get surprised easily so

147
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,125
I was glad it was that impressive for him
because that means

148
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:52,496
the audience must have been satisfied
as well

149
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:54,398
I was relieved to learn about that

150
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,401
Of course, it's not the only thing he said

151
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,304
I think I'm ruining my dad's image

152
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:02,673
I love my dad very much

153
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,978
So after that,
at about 2 in the morning,

154
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,847
he gave me a call and told me

155
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:12,015
that he cried

156
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:17,187
I'm not sure how to put this but

157
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:19,890
my dad"s the strong, silent type

158
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,025
though he's not like that on the inside

159
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,065
"It was this and that, I liked it?"

160
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,002
"Do you think you can do a better
performance?”

161
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:35,572
"Just do it until this year"
He was telling me these and I was trying

162
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,375
to hang up like "OK, I'm going to bed now"
but then he went,

163
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:42,212
"I teared up a lot this time"

164
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:43,814
He told me that

165
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:48,485
'If the concert made my dad tear up'

166
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,787
'I did it
'It was worth'

167
00:39:51,054 --> 00:39:54,558
'putting so much effort to prepare it'
That's what I thought

168
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:55,993
Anyways

169
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:01,431
I'm glad you like it

170
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,767
The next song is the final song

171
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,605
Time passed by unusually fast today, right?

172
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,210
The final song of the last concert

173
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,749
I talked too much earlier so they're
rushing me to sing

174
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,120
Actually, it's not the final song

175
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,755
I'm going to sing
'YOUS&I' as the final song

176
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:36,066
<YOU&I>

177
00:46:02,158 --> 00:46:03,426
Prepare to scream

178
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:25,448
Please give it up for the dancers one
more time

179
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,440
Goodbye

180
00:52:36,285 --> 00:52:41,290
<Love poem>

181
00:57:40,756 --> 00:57:41,590
Thank you

182
00:57:47,196 --> 00:57:49,832
You tried every means possible

183
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:54,337
to make me cry

184
00:58:00,943 --> 00:58:02,178
Let me wipe my sweat

185
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,718
What does it say?

186
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:13,456
Why aren't you holding it up

187
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:18,694
Only you two aren't holding it up

188
00:58:19,595 --> 00:58:20,363
You didn't get one?

189
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:21,564
You didn't get one?

190
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:22,331
Oh my gosh

191
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,968
You must feel sadder, right?

192
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:28,971
I'll be with you

193
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,240
every step of the way

194
00:58:32,074 --> 00:58:34,944
Because we were perfect besties
for 14 years

195
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:42,118
You're trying hard to make me cry

196
00:58:43,919 --> 00:58:46,789
In such an important moment

197
00:58:47,723 --> 00:58:48,524
How could you

198
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,627
How could you do this to me

199
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,167
But I am wiping my sweat

200
00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:02,038
I have to make it clear

201
00:59:07,109 --> 00:59:10,613
How did you think about singing along
'Love poem'?

202
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,649
You even skipped
the interlude on your own

203
00:59:16,685 --> 00:59:17,319
Also

204
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:23,692
I noticed you changed to falsetto to
sing "Long night" in the climax

205
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,828
You have to use your modal voice there

206
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,766
I noticed you cracking up after that

207
00:59:33,969 --> 00:59:36,238
You thought I'd miss it because I'm busy
singing, right?

208
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:39,108
I was paying attention to you

209
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:43,345
First words of 'Love poem'

210
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:44,180
What's wrong?

211
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:51,087
As I heard the first words of 'Love poem'

212
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:54,623
I realized you're deadly determined

213
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,893
You knew the next song is 'Love poem'

214
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:00,696
How could you use such a cheat code

215
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:04,200
I'm so grateful

216
01:00:09,004 --> 01:00:12,942
Why didn't you sing along 'Love poem' all
this time when you can sing so well?

217
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,813
It was so grand

218
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:19,315
Probably

219
01:00:24,753 --> 01:00:26,021
Please tell me, what is it?

220
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:29,525
Do I have something on somewhere?

221
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:32,661
This one?

222
01:00:34,563 --> 01:00:35,364
This?

223
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,070
Is this why you went
"Not a single moment"

224
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:45,474
"You can't be disheveled like that"?
Oh my goodness

225
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:46,876
Am I good now?

226
01:00:47,376 --> 01:00:48,744
Yes

227
01:00:49,411 --> 01:00:54,950
I hate to ask this
in such a touching mood

228
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,186
but do I have something on my face?

229
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,889
Do I not have something around this area?

230
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,457
No?

231
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:03,592
I do?

232
01:01:04,493 --> 01:01:05,261
I don't?

233
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:06,529
OK

234
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:09,265
I was singing my heart out for 'Love poem'

235
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,535
and I felt a very big bug
flying toward me

236
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:14,336
and sitting here

237
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:16,372
I saw it and our eyes met

238
01:01:17,072 --> 01:01:19,208
It's not on me at the moment, right?

239
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:20,342
Yes

240
01:01:20,609 --> 01:01:23,846
Alright, but if I see something like a mole
around here after the concert

241
01:01:27,816 --> 01:01:29,818
Do I have hair next to my nose?

242
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:33,722
It's gone now, right?

243
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:40,329
I do have hair there
Please give me a moment

244
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,498
Someone's coming to help me get rid of it

245
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,867
Because this next song is the final song

246
01:01:53,909 --> 01:01:55,811
Perfect, I'm perfect now

247
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,347
I can be confident again

248
01:02:00,015 --> 01:02:00,849
This is the final song now

249
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:04,253
The real final song of the last concert

250
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:08,390
We managed to get here guys

251
01:02:08,757 --> 01:02:10,926
I thought this moment wouldn't come

252
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,296
'Somehow, something will happen'

253
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,131
'Eventually'

254
01:02:17,132 --> 01:02:20,603
'I might not get to do it, right?'
I spent almost 2 months shivering

255
01:02:21,136 --> 01:02:23,072
with anxiety from those thoughts

256
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,642
It's unbelievable that this time has

257
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,144
really come and did I really

258
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,247
have this concert?

259
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,616
Yes

260
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:37,920
I feel strange again

261
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,255
I'm trying to feel strange

262
01:02:40,422 --> 01:02:42,124
To be honest,

263
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:44,893
today's concert was

264
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,429
a bit difficult for me

265
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:52,134
Usually, the first concert is way harder

266
01:02:52,701 --> 01:02:57,373
I know how things go, learn the ways,

267
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,676
loosen up a bit though my voice is shot
on the second day so

268
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:04,346
it's done in a way
more comfortable mood

269
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:07,916
Actually

270
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:12,054
I have a bit of a problem with my ear so

271
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:16,859
I felt jittery preparing for this concert

272
01:03:19,461 --> 01:03:21,196
It's not something serious but

273
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:26,702
I couldn't control my ear

274
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,171
since about a year ago so I was concerned
about the concert thinking,

275
01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:32,508
'I'm the only one
who needs to do well

276
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:35,744
'I just need my ear to work on the day'

277
01:03:35,944 --> 01:03:39,014
'TI can grind myself
and manage somehow'

278
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:42,384
'though my voice is shot'
I know that I can

279
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:45,688
Fortunately, my voice was working fine

280
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:50,125
during yesterday's
and today's concert but

281
01:03:50,592 --> 01:03:52,728
since the end of yesterday's concert,

282
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,098
my ear started getting worse

283
01:03:56,632 --> 01:04:01,070
Last night's and today's rehearsals were

284
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:03,639
terrible as hell for me

285
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:06,475
A day from yesterday to today

286
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:09,611
I came up the stage
as the 1st song started

287
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:13,315
thinking, 'I'm not sure what's going
to happen'

288
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:18,954
I always say this and

289
01:04:19,254 --> 01:04:21,290
I always mean it

290
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:26,462
'You did everything for today's concert'

291
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:28,797
I really do think so

292
01:04:29,264 --> 01:04:31,533
You did everything for me today

293
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:32,901
Thank you so much for having my back

294
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,414
You're wearing masks and

295
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:48,517
the music is very loud here so

296
01:04:49,017 --> 01:04:51,620
it could've been hard to reach but

297
01:04:52,354 --> 01:04:57,126
you sincerely cheered for me and

298
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:02,598
I could really feel that

299
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:07,202
you came here thinking
"Congratulations on becoming an artist'

300
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,171
'who can celebrate your 14th anniversary
and have this large-scale concert'

301
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,039
Truly,

302
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,276
the smiles I made,
the words I said today

303
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:19,114
I meant every single thing I said

304
01:05:19,581 --> 01:05:22,184
Every consonant, every vowel

305
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:25,320
Thank you is not enough to

306
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:29,391
express how grateful I am

307
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,661
"I love you" and "Thank you"
are not enough

308
01:05:33,295 --> 01:05:34,863
"I'm sorry” is not enough as well

309
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,934
I felt that indescribable feeling

310
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:44,506
at this last concert today

311
01:05:44,506 --> 01:05:47,376
You're very far away

312
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:49,111
You would think so but

313
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:53,449
it doesn't feel far to me

314
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:58,620
I can feel that the person
in the end over there loves me

315
01:06:00,088 --> 01:06:00,956
Truly

316
01:06:03,692 --> 01:06:05,294
'This is possible'

317
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:08,330
'This is possible'

318
01:06:09,264 --> 01:06:12,968
I spent three hours today amazed by it

319
01:06:15,003 --> 01:06:15,871
Also

320
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,175
through today's performance

321
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:25,080
I think I will be singing

322
01:06:25,747 --> 01:06:27,516
with a much humble heart in the future

323
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,253
I said this yesterday too but I thought

324
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,923
'This stage might be the final destination'

325
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,727
'of the path I've been challenging and'

326
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:44,366
'grinding towards since my teens' a lot

327
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:47,369
I never dreamed of such a large concert
in the first place

328
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:49,338
I honestly did not

329
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:50,739
Since I was a trainee

330
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,308
But somehow

331
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:57,646
my ancestors helped me
to reach this point

332
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,148
So here I am

333
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,452
I will not get arrogant with

334
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,323
the memory from this day and

335
01:07:08,857 --> 01:07:10,792
keep a more humble attitude

336
01:07:12,494 --> 01:07:14,196
I will always keep in mind

337
01:07:14,796 --> 01:07:19,034
your hearts to cheer for me
on stage from today

338
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:21,970
It's been 14 years

339
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,106
Let me go 14 more years

340
01:07:28,777 --> 01:07:31,446
The final song is like a challenge itself

341
01:07:32,447 --> 01:07:35,083
I'm in a very different condition from
yesterday so

342
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:37,686
I'll focus very hard to sing it

343
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:40,522
Many people told me that this song was
a consolation for them so

344
01:07:40,822 --> 01:07:44,826
I really want to sing it well

345
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:49,464
Let me sing
'My sea' for the final song and

346
01:07:50,265 --> 01:07:51,166
say goodbye to you

347
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:52,968
I promise it won't take too long for us

348
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:56,471
to get back together again and I will not
make you wait 3 long years like before

349
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:03,579
<My sea>

350
01:15:34,195 --> 01:15:34,929
Excuse me

351
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,568
What were you thinking about so deeply?

352
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:43,471
I'm sorry

353
01:15:44,272 --> 01:15:46,775
This reminded me of my childhood...

354
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:49,911
You must've had a dream
like that before

355
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:50,945
Well...

356
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,148
something like that?

357
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,321
The sand in here is

358
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:02,457
every moment of your time, right?

359
01:16:08,763 --> 01:16:09,898
Yes, that's right

360
01:16:16,771 --> 01:16:17,372
Oh

361
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:21,576
The child in the fairy tale,

362
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:23,812
did she become a wave in the end?

363
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:28,296
<Ah puh>

364
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:17,725
Good job

365
01:23:19,293 --> 01:23:21,362
Please give a big round of applause

366
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,397
for the dancers once again

367
01:23:23,397 --> 01:23:25,566
Today's heroes

368
01:23:30,838 --> 01:23:31,639
Thank you

369
01:23:36,377 --> 01:23:39,080
I wanted to sing 'Ah puh' for you

370
01:23:40,147 --> 01:23:41,949
Some of you may know it but

371
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:46,153
CHANHYUK and HOSHI of SEVENTEEN

372
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:48,556
helped create the choreography

373
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:55,129
I wanted to use
the choreography they made

374
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:56,898
in the last VCR

375
01:23:57,331 --> 01:24:00,568
to answer the question,
"Did the child become a wave in the end?"

376
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:05,206
By becoming a wave myself

377
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:07,842
Also, in the album called 'LILAC'

378
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:11,412
the next track of 'My sea' is 'Ah puh'

379
01:24:11,779 --> 01:24:15,750
I hope you can go back home feeling
lighthearted with this song so

380
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:20,288
I placed 'Ah puh' for the post encore

381
01:24:21,055 --> 01:24:22,623
Since I'm running out of time

382
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,127
What should I sing first, 'Heart'?

383
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:30,598
'Heart'?

384
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:32,533
'Drama'?

385
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:36,304
'Heart' it is,
let me sing 'Heart' for you

386
01:24:39,006 --> 01:24:44,011
<Heart>

387
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:24,952
One, two, three

388
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:34,855
Two, two, three

389
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:18,766
I beg your pardon?

390
01:27:37,818 --> 01:27:38,919
That was just perfect

391
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,992
I wrote 'Heart'
when I was 23 years old

392
01:27:45,626 --> 01:27:46,827
It got completed today

393
01:27:50,831 --> 01:27:51,532
Seriously

394
01:27:52,466 --> 01:27:54,101
How will I forget this

395
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:56,804
What time is it?

396
01:28:01,642 --> 01:28:02,343
7 o'clock?

397
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:14,421
Let's continue till then

398
01:28:18,959 --> 01:28:22,897
I don't think many elementary school
students are here today but

399
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:26,600
I heard elementary school students love

400
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:29,503
the song called 'Drama' so

401
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:34,775
I wanted to sing it at this concert

402
01:28:39,046 --> 01:28:40,548
For my fans in elementary school

403
01:28:42,316 --> 01:28:43,617
Let me sing it nicely for you

404
01:28:44,285 --> 01:28:46,187
Please sing along if you know the lyrics

405
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:53,761
<Drama>

406
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,187
Jeon Sohyun on the recorder

407
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:09,703
Good job

408
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:05,059
Your singing skills are insane

409
01:31:07,328 --> 01:31:09,830
You're really, seriously, so good

410
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:13,000
It's not like
"Thank you for singing along”

411
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:16,303
You're great singers, how come?

412
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:22,509
I'm so proud of you

413
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:25,913
You're such great singers

414
01:31:31,585 --> 01:31:36,657
I'm not going to lie

415
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:42,796
I feel good enough to sing
about an hour and a half longer

416
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:49,837
But this is really the final song

417
01:31:51,438 --> 01:31:52,940
It's really the final song

418
01:31:54,808 --> 01:31:56,043
You have to go home and go to bed

419
01:32:11,191 --> 01:32:13,427
Why does that figure look so sad?

420
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,769
I don't like this a lot but

421
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:24,438
shall I enjoy it

422
01:32:25,105 --> 01:32:26,340
just for the day?

423
01:32:41,288 --> 01:32:42,856
No candles?

424
01:32:44,324 --> 01:32:46,927
Don't you usually blow out candles
when you do this

425
01:32:46,927 --> 01:32:47,861
What does it matter

426
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:48,662
Yeah, that's right

427
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:52,266
ZZURU, please say something
on behalf of the dancers

428
01:32:52,332 --> 01:32:53,067
Me?

429
01:32:57,905 --> 01:32:58,605
Make it short

430
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:03,310
Thank you so much everyone
for loving us for 14 years

431
01:33:04,578 --> 01:33:06,880
Until the 15th anniversary,
the 20th anniversary

432
01:33:07,881 --> 01:33:10,084
It might be difficult to keep going until
the 100th anniversary but

433
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:13,720
I hope we can be together for many
anniversaries for a long time

434
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:16,957
ZZURU, will you be able to keep yourself
in good shape till then and be

435
01:33:16,957 --> 01:33:19,226
the main dancer of
'Every End of the Day'?

436
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:20,861
I'll devote my life to it

437
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:25,599
Thank you so much, I had no idea

438
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:30,037
Please give a big round of applause
for the dancers

439
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:33,107
I appreciate it, thank you so much

440
01:33:35,442 --> 01:33:36,343
Thank you

441
01:33:37,644 --> 01:33:40,347
Dancers, you can go home

442
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:42,916
Thank you for your hard work

443
01:33:44,585 --> 01:33:47,521
They truly are the best dancers

444
01:33:52,025 --> 01:33:52,860
Goodbye

445
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:01,802
They prepared this for me

446
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:05,205
I'm shy

447
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:12,079
Why does it look so misty-eyed?

448
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:17,551
Why does it look like it's going 'Mmm'?

449
01:34:18,485 --> 01:34:20,854
Anyhow, I will keep her by my side,

450
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:23,590
sing the final song and

451
01:34:24,892 --> 01:34:29,029
promise to get together again next time

452
01:34:29,496 --> 01:34:35,435
This song is like a letter
I want to write you

453
01:34:35,903 --> 01:34:38,472
I wrote the lyrics with

454
01:34:39,072 --> 01:34:41,375
the words I want to tell my fans

455
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:48,048
I hope you can understand how I feel
after you listen to the song

456
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:53,086
Please be careful and be happy on your
way back home

457
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:57,457
I sincerely thank every staff,

458
01:34:58,058 --> 01:35:00,661
every band member for

459
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:05,999
taking charge to make
this concert happen

460
01:35:06,133 --> 01:35:09,036
With the memory of today, I, IU,

461
01:35:09,937 --> 01:35:13,640
promise to stay humble and
sing as long as my body allows me

462
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:18,178
I want to say something cool

463
01:35:20,914 --> 01:35:21,748
but this is all I got

464
01:35:24,017 --> 01:35:25,385
I can't think of anything else

465
01:35:26,386 --> 01:35:28,355
Be happy, thank you

466
01:35:33,927 --> 01:35:38,932
<Epilogue>
