1
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,240
Director.

2
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,650
- Ahjussi!
- What? What? What?!

3
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,110
I want to go to the restroom.

4
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,230
Then go. Go!

5
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,360
I'm scared...

6
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,780
Please...

7
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,380
I was having a good dream...

8
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,090
Please...

9
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,850
Are you okay?

10
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,120
Of course not.

11
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,410
I'm not your secretary.
What am I doing in the middle of the night like this?

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,090
Thank you.

13
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,320
Hurry and go.

14
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,790
Can you walk a little faster? Hurry!

15
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,340
Ouch! Fine!

16
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,880
- You have to wait for me here.
- Okay.

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,970
It looks like it's filled with bugs!

18
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,550
It looks like there is a ghost.

19
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,350
A ghost?

20
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,350
Um... Can you come in with me?

21
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,290
Are you nuts?

22
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,240
Then can you at least sing for me?

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,690
What?

24
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,130
Sing loudly and don't stop until I come out.

25
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,280
- What kind of—
- You got it? Loudly.

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,370
I'll be back soon.

27
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,580
I'll come out quickly.

28
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,150
There was a moment someone willingly sang for me.

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,730
Miss Go Bok Sil, when is your most memorable moment?

30
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,280
Right now, this moment.

31
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,930
There also was a moment overflowing with feelings when someone cherished me, when I had nothing.

32
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,650
Honey, I found Louis.

33
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,840
And someone

34
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,390
I found Louis!

35
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,950
said that she felt the proudest in her life the moment she found me.

36
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,450
That kind of moment was about to happen to my grandma, Chairwoman Choi Il Soon, as well.

37
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,370
Episode 13
This is the moment

38
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,790
Hello?

39
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,060
Ahjusshi.

40
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,340
- Who is on the phone?
- Right.

41
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,410
Hello? Who is this?

42
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,160
I'm Secretary Goo.

43
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,580
Secretary Goo?

44
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,920
Hello? Hello?

45
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,090
Did he call a wrong number? He just hung up.

46
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,850
It must've been a prank call.

47
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,000
I guess so.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,290
What are you doing here at this time?

49
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,710
Yeah...

50
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,100
I was passing by and stopped in to see Mother.

51
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,480
Oh... She's asleep right now.

52
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,070
Is that so? I must have came too late.

53
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,680
By the way, did Butler Kim and Butler Heo go somewhere?

54
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,370
Yes. It's their day off, today.

55
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,500
Is that so? Then,

56
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,840
I'll come back some other time.

57
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,430
Ahjusshi.

58
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,120
Do you want to have some ramyun before you leave?

59
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,650
Huh...?

60
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,160
You're really good at making ramyun.

61
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,420
I learned from Bok Sil.

62
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,310
So, did you get over Go Bok Sil?

63
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,590
You were so stubborn about going back to France,

64
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,220
and you surprised me by coming back in a few days.

65
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,920
You haven't heard?

66
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,810
About what?

67
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,360
All my memories are back.

68
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,240
What?

69
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,880
I found Bok Sil's brother, too.

70
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,590
I did well, right?

71
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,380
Right,

72
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,030
why did you lie to me?

73
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,530
What lie?

74
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,760
You said I was really close with Ma Ri, we were best friends, that's a lie.

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,250
I remembered that Ma Ri bullied me when we were little.

76
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,620
Oh... that?

77
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,850
I thought you two got along pretty well.

78
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,260
Anyway, why are you sweating so much?

79
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,380
As you age, it's normal to sweat when you eat.

80
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,210
Let's finish up.

81
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,430
Wow, that's interesting...

82
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,190
You sweat a lot when you age.

83
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,990
President Baek!

84
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,960
Are you nuts? What do you mean by coming here?

85
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,130
Get in, now.

86
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,190
Get in the car, now!

87
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,320
Prepare me some escape funds.

88
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,360
Since the police know my face,

89
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,190
I will stay abroad until everything settles down a bit.

90
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,770
You entered the country illegally. How are you going to get out?

91
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,630
I will take care of it.

92
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,120
So, hurry and get the money ready.

93
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,030
How much would do?

94
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,680
One billion won. (1,000,000 USD)

95
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,260
In cash.

96
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,890
I have your voice recording in here.

97
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,390
You dared to make recordings?

98
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,510
You don't think I just did your bidding without something sturdy to fall back on.

99
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,200
One little wrong move and what might happen...

100
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,170
I think you learned plenty today.

101
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,690
Chestnuts!

102
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,860
Oh my!

103
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,620
They look plump and delicious!

104
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,860
What?

105
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,150
What kind of dream is this?

106
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,000
Could it possibly be... a dream about a new baby?

107
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,860
Bok Nam, there will be plenty of rice for your lunch here. Just scoop up some.

108
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,460
Don't worry. You think I'm a kid?

109
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,940
Yes, you're a kid. You think you're an adult?

110
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,660
Aigoo.

111
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,840
Good morning, Go family!

112
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,390
Oppa, Ahjumma!

113
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,780
Hey, Narrow-Mouthed Toad.

114
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,680
Did you sleep well?

115
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,570
Yes, I slept well for once.

116
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,390
So why did you run off, asking for trouble?

117
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,750
- What did you bring again?
- Oh, this? Louis--

118
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,040
I made too much. How many times have I told you I was called Sympathetic Lady Geum Ja when I was young?

119
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,360
How sympathetic? What about you is sympathetic?
(Parody from Movie The Wailing)

120
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,480
- Just go and put these in the fridge.
- Should I?

121
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,620
You have to eat and go to work.

122
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,180
I'll take you to work. Louis told me to be your chauffeur in the morning.

123
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,570
Such devotion! Is Bok Sil all Louis has in his mind?

124
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,130
Let's go.

125
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,560
Thank you for the food!

126
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,030
Yes, Hyung.

127
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,920
Director? President Go Bok Sil arrived at work.

128
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,120
Okay.

129
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,490
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

130
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,160
Congratulations on finding Bok Nam.

131
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,320
It still feels like a dream that Bok Nam is alive.

132
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,010
It makes me happy to see you happy.

133
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,740
Is it because I'm your daddy long legs?

134
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,730
What are you going to do about Bok Nam's school?

135
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,070
He's fallen behind in his studies, so

136
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,920
I'm going to send him to an academy first and then make him transfer.

137
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,240
Is he too far behind to transfer as a high school junior?

138
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,110
Yes, a little.

139
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,950
I guess he's a lot different than you, huh?

140
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,430
You should study in your free time and apply to college after you pass your GED.

141
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,130
If you study a bit more systematically, you'll make it big.

142
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,850
I can tell just by looking at you.

143
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,400
Don't look at me like that.

144
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,920
It makes my heart soften.

145
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,970
Why is your heart getting soft?

146
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,110
Louis!

147
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,570
Why did you come here, instead of going to work?!

148
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,280
I asked you why your heart is softening toward Bok Sil?!

149
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,180
I seriously... It's my heart! It's mine!

150
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,680
Seriously, jeez...

151
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,200
Daddy Long Legs Cha Joong Won

152
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,990
What is that?

153
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,480
What is this? It says Daddy Long Legs!

154
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,290
Wait, why is Cha Joong Won your daddy long legs?

155
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,290
Cha Joong Won is the director. Hurry up and change it, so it says Director.

156
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,530
No, it was one of the director's demands.

157
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,210
What?

158
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,540
Then change mine too, to Oppa Long Legs.

159
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,950
You're jealous of such silly things. So silly!

160
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,450
This rascal...

161
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,000
Hey, aren't you going to work?

162
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,040
I start next week.

163
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,660
Right now, I'm drawing out a big picture in my head.

164
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,940
What big picture?

165
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,370
My goodness! It's a secret!

166
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,700
But don't you eat lunch? I'm hungry. You're not eating?

167
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,960
That beggar in your stomach is still the same, even if your memory came back.

168
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,690
What do you want to eat?

169
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,760
Ah, right. Why isn't Jo In Seong eating?

170
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,270
He said he would take care of it himself.

171
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,400
He's more introverted than you'd think.

172
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,910
You'd never guess it from how he looks.

173
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,880
Order me another bowl.

174
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,360
Hey! You have so much money, but people will think you're starving to death.

175
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,470
Grandma and Butler Kim won't let me have any junk food.

176
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,040
I have to eat a ton like this while I have the chance.

177
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,160
I'll eat another bowl too.

178
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,000
I've gotten my appetite back.

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,920
Go Bok Sil, you can eat more,

180
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,700
since you couldn't eat right all that time because of Bok Nam.

181
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,040
I couldn't eat right either, you know.

182
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,760
This is the Chinese restaurant, right? This is Singsingline. Bring us two bowls of black bean noodles with the sauce on the side, please.

183
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,070
We ordered before and we are ordering more, you must ask for dumplings as a freebie!

184
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,410
Think outside the box, seriously!

185
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,300
Please give us a side of dumplings for free, as well.

186
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,830
Oh yeah, Bok Sil. You should hurry up and finish work today.

187
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,200
Why? Is something going on?

188
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,620
Eat dinner with me too.

189
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,500
Stop talking about eating already! Go Bok Sil has tons of work to do today!

190
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,190
She's going to be working overtime!

191
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,850
She can't. My grandmother is waiting for her.

192
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,360
The chairwoman? Why?

193
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,220
Grandma invited Bok Sil to come eat dinner together.

194
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,920
Grandma did?

195
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,540
Yeah.

196
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,800
The item?

197
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,060
You don't have other copies somewhere, right?

198
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,070
Of course not.

199
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,310
I brought all the money I have on hand.

200
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,920
Thank you.

201
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,620
How are you going to get out of here?

202
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,810
There's a ship coming in a week that I'll stow away on.

203
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,180
What? It'll take a week?

204
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,510
Hurry up and leave as soon as you can. Even one day sooner is not soon enough.

205
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,270
Hurry up and disappear, so no one can find you!

206
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,520
Don't worry.

207
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,250
I've got all this money. I'll be hiding well and disappear like wind.

208
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,780
From this point on, we're strangers who've never even met before. Understand?

209
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,960
Why ask the obvious?

210
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,320
President Go, let's go.

211
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,330
I'll treat you to dessert out.

212
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,230
It's okay. I don't need to eat dessert. Give it to me.

213
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,400
Why? I ordered 100 bowls of patbingsu (red bean ice cream) for you.

214
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,570
Hey! Are you trying to make all of Bok Sil's teeth fall out?

215
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,300
How can a person eat 100 bowls of patbingsu all at once?

216
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,810
I promised her that I would buy her 100 bowls!

217
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,790
Then shouldn't you divide it up into one bowl at a time and order them until you reach 100?!

218
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,360
Is that how you do it? I got it.

219
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,050
Let's go, Bok Sil.

220
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,910
I'll be back tomorrow.

221
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,570
Director, I'll see you tomorrow!

222
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,840
He's coming tomorrow, too?

223
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,750
It's going to be so loud and chaotic.

224
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,700
I liked it when it was just me and Bok Sil together.

225
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,560
Bok Sil, is it good?

226
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,210
Yeah.

227
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,240
I'll buy it for you for the rest of your life, so eat it slowly.

228
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,290
The rest of my life?

229
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,850
Of course.

230
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,240
Just trust Oppa.

231
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,720
When did I not trust you?

232
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,120
Let's hurry up and eat and go see Detective.

233
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,790
Okay.

234
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,350
So you were driving from the airport because President Baek gave you the key,

235
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,670
and halfway there you met a motorcycle gang and got into an altercation with them, correct?

236
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,820
Yes.

237
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,620
Bok Nam, lest Louis might get beaten up, you took his clothes before Kim Dae Sik could,

238
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,460
- and you took your clothes off and gave them to Louis since he didn't have any.
- Yes.

239
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,720
You believed that you would get the car back in an hour, so you waited for him,

240
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,920
but since the car didn't come back, you just ended up walking.

241
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,200
And as I was walking, I fell and hit my head on a fire hydrant, causing amnesia.

242
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,480
Bok Nam, you gave the car to Kim Dae Sik,

243
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,620
but did you actually witness him getting into an accident while driving it?

244
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,240
No. I heard the sound of an explosion and ran over to the accident site,

245
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,490
but the car was already on fire then.

246
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,240
So you didn't witness the actual occurrence of the accident?

247
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,570
Because I was so scared, I ran away without even realizing it.

248
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,080
I am really sorry.

249
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,420
Well, that's understandable.

250
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:54,060
However, you should apologize to Louis, since he wasn't able to return to his family soon because of you.

251
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,380
Hyung, I'm sorry.

252
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,430
No, no, no. No, it's okay. Don't worry.

253
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,350
Team Leader Ma Ri!

254
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,260
Hello!

255
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,260
Did you eat?

256
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,570
If you haven't, do you want to eat with me?

257
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,660
I know of a really good restaurant somewhere else.

258
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,810
Seriously, why are you doing this?

259
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,130
Where are you touching?!

260
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,970
I-I'm sorry, I didn't do it on purpose...

261
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,710
Oh, seriously! Oh, my god!

262
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,190
Stop moving!!!

263
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,840
- Mom!
- Mom?

264
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,750
Whose son do you have the nerve to put your hands on?

265
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,440
You! That's right, you're that rude wench who tried to settle by paying three bucks that day!

266
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,060
I got the feel right away.

267
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,600
Back then, you hit someone's beautiful child with your car,

268
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,930
and this time you're throwing slaps at someone else's precious son?

269
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,750
- No!
- No, that's not it—

270
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,120
Omo, why are you acting like this toward someone else's daughter?

271
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,280
- Oh, Mom!
- M-M-Mom?

272
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,550
Hello, Mom.

273
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,900
- Who are you?
- Who are you calling mom?!

274
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,250
Are you this woman's mom?

275
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,320
Yes, I am.

276
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,500
Hurry up and apologize for slapping someone else's precious son in broad daylight.

277
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,810
Mom, I'm okay.

278
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,970
I'm not okay!

279
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,810
No, he touched my butt, and so—

280
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,370
- What?!
- What?!!

281
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,430
No! No! That's not it.

282
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,100
I was trying to catch Ma Ri while she was falling over, and accidentally touched her here—

283
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,470
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

284
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,620
- So you're saying you touched my daughter's behind?!
- Yes. Wait, no!

285
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,220
Yes. Wait, no!

286
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,540
No, he said that he touched it out of necessity! Why are you selectively hearing what he said?

287
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,030
Oh my word!

288
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,540
Anyway, he's admitting that he touched it!

289
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,200
- Ma Ri. Ma Ri, are you okay?
- No.

290
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,840
No, these people, seriously!

291
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,540
You two have lost your sense of innocence!

292
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,050
To someone who's saved you while drowning, do you now raise angry eyebrows and accuse him of stealing your bag?

293
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:57,130
He rescued you from a big fall, which certainly would have cracked your skull, and you not only begrudge him a thank you,

294
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,830
but also slap him!

295
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,600
And now you dare to brand this Hwang Geum Ja's son as a lustful perverted molester?

296
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,750
Do you two want to dig your graves here?

297
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,250
Why are you doing this, seriously?!

298
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,450
You were really shocked, weren't you? I'm sorry.

299
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,530
Even though Mom speaks roughly,

300
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,460
she doesn't hit people or things like that.

301
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,020
Hi... Hit?

302
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,000
No! It's not that she hits... Oh, what am I saying? Anyway, I'm sorry.

303
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,460
What are you sorry for? Why are you apologizing?

304
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,100
This little bastard! Who told you to apologize freely? Do you want to cross the Jordan River (die) first?!

305
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,980
Aigoo, then what am I supposed to do? Do you want to see me die? Huh?

306
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,090
This little bastard. You little bastard! What's the matter with you?

307
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,600
- Why? Why?
- Vivien, where are you? Please come quickly.

308
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,860
I'm really scared!

309
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,710
Audrey!

310
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,840
You're here! I'm here!

311
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,300
No, who's doing what to my Audrey?!

312
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,700
Look here—

313
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,900
Bok Sil's mother?

314
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,980
You're Bok Sil's mother-in... I mean,

315
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,900
- Director Cha's mother? Oh, hello.
- Hello.

316
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:17,730
This scarf... Is it possibly from... Shalala Stylist Talk Talk?
♬  You are my destiny.  ♬

317
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,220
♬ You are what you are to me  ♬

318
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,620
Oh my, it is!

319
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:32,270
Shala- what?

320
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,140
They're all wearing the same scarf.

321
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,670
Louis gifted that scarf to you?

322
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,490
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

323
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:51,580
Oh. Then, is Louis the stylist for Shalala Stylist Talk Talk?

324
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,470
Oh my goodness. I knew he had an extraordinary fashion sense.

325
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:02,160
But what is with the strange Audrey and Vivien names from earlier?

326
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,590
Those are our nicknames.

327
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,570
Ah! We should make a nickname for you too while you hang out with us.

328
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,570
Uh then I'll be...

329
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,340
Cleopatra!

330
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,650
My son calls me Cleopatra. At home, I'm always

331
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,280
lying sideways like this.

332
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,370
Okay. Cleopatra. What do you think, Audrey?

333
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,720
I like it, Vivien.

334
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,860
We welcome you, Cleopatra! Cheers!

335
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,640
Grandma! We're here!

336
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,320
Aigoo, I see.

337
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,380
Hello.

338
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,410
Welcome, Bok Sil.

339
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,060
Thank you for inviting me.

340
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,030
Butler Heo, you set the table. Butler Kim, you get the welcome juice ready.

341
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,350
- Yes.
- Come on in.

342
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,910
Sit here.

343
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,270
Grandma. This is Bok Sil's gift.

344
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,150
Thank you.

345
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,930
Naju Yim Shin Jung (The pear farmer's name sounds like "pregnant" in Korean) Pear.

346
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,610
Our Singsingline just entered into a contract with this farmer producing the highest quality pears.

347
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,510
Mr. Yim Shin Jung ("pregnant") from Naju personally grew these organic pears.

348
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,560
The taste and texture are all top-notch as well.

349
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,580
Aigoo, I see. How can each and every one of them be so amazing?

350
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,810
You are great at picking out products.

351
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,400
- I'll enjoy them.
- Yes.

352
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,730
Have this.

353
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,770
Um... Please excuse me.

354
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,210
Bathroom.

355
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,090
It's over there.

356
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,190
Butler Kim, don't you think this is a sign of good news?

357
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,980
No way.

358
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,900
Bok Sil, are you okay?

359
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,790
Yeah.

360
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,640
I think two bowls of jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) and a bowl of patbingsu was too much.

361
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,390
Should we have eaten the patbingsu another time?

362
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,580
No it's fine. I was really enjoying myself earlier.

363
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,420
Let's go.

364
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:35,550
Pregnant

365
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,850
Grandma, can Bok Sil eat next time? She has indigestion.

366
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,800
What?

367
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,510
Of course! Let's definitely eat next time!

368
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,680
I'm completely fine! Seriously!

369
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,140
Let's invite In Seong and his mother next time, too,

370
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,370
and have an official meal.

371
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,840
Our grandma is the best.

372
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:12,710
You don't know that I and your mother went to Bok Sil's house, right?

373
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,580
What? Why are you doing that stuff without telling me?

374
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,750
You should know how your mom is.

375
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,820
She's Hell-Bent Ms. Young Ae.

376
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,530
Who can stop mom's energy?

377
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:32,930
But at that place we heard the talk about the Gold Group grandson.

378
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,030
We heard that the grandson and Bok Sil are deeply involved with each other.

379
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,900
I really liked Bok Sil.

380
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,060
That's a shame.

381
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,340
Should I tell you a fact that you don't know?

382
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,090
What is it?

383
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,190
The fact is, the person who met Go Bok Sil first was me.

384
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,150
Before I met her a second time,

385
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:02,750
a stronger opponent appeared and decided the fate, should we say?

386
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,290
- We're back!
- You're back?

387
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,670
- Hyung!
- Ajumma, I'll do it!

388
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,160
No, it's okay. I'm almost done, so I'll do the rest. You can just relax.

389
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,020
- Ajumma, is there any Sprite here?
- What do you need Sprite for?

390
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,010
Bok Sil says she's nauseous.

391
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,840
What? How are you nauseous?

392
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,480
I ate too much all day.

393
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,950
Really?

394
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,510
Hyung, if you have Sprite at home, bring some over. Okay.

395
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,810
Louis. I don't think a carbonated drink will be good.

396
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,510
Why not?

397
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,850
It's nothing. You rascal.

398
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,250
Hm?

399
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,380
Bok Nam.

400
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,730
The practice test book is completely blank. You couldn't solve anything all day?

401
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,070
I'll help you. Let me see.

402
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,310
To find the maximum value of a cubic function, you need to know calculus.

403
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,440
Bok Nam, you don't know calculus?

404
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,650
You don't know? You don't know calculus?!

405
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,630
Then you can't solve a quadratic equation to get the maximum value, either?

406
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:31,290
Ah, Bok Nam... You're so ignorant. What should we do?

407
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,820
I don't think someone who can't spell should be saying that.

408
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,100
That's not true. I'm perfect at spelling. I mastered it while I was away from Bok Sil.

409
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,550
Aigoo, so you did? You learn how to spell at the age of 25 and have the gall to brag about it.

410
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,760
This won't do. I'll get you the best tutor.

411
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,220
He's tutored me since I was young. His skills are no joke.

412
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,310
It's really alright....

413
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:56,380
What do you mean, it's alright? I told you to just trust me.

414
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,690
Even when his memory returned, his repertoire about trusting him is unchanging.

415
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,470
Hey, did you get the money back that Bok Sil got scammed out of? You told her to just trust you.

416
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,880
Fine! I'll get it back to her! Why are you bombarding me with your nags the moment you lay eyes on me?

417
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,400
This bastard. You... Where does this brat come off?

418
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,370
You've grown a lot.

419
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,710
- This bastard...
- Wait!

420
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,600
Are you preparing a proposal?

421
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,250
Of course. I'm collecting and analyzing materials from various dramas, movies and books.

422
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,150
Stop analyzing such things! What good is analyzing dating and marriage?

423
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,170
You are so busy analyzing in theory that you suck in practice!

424
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,720
What are you saying I suck at?

425
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:54,700
It's okay. Butler Kim, you should be dating too.

426
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,560
You're his first love.

427
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,260
Young Master...

428
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:05,020
If there's something you don't know, just ask me, since I'm your sunbae (at dating).

429
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,740
Young Master, you seriously...

430
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:14,490
Butler Heo. I have a favor to ask you.

431
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,870
So, those bad girls that have flowers coming out of their mouths (curse),

432
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,850
took Bok Sil's money twice, and looked down on you

433
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,230
and ignored your call. That's what you're saying, right?

434
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,360
They're formidable kids.

435
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,800
You f!@#$%^ b!@#$%^!

436
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,490
You f!@#$%&& son of !@#$%^&!

437
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,230
You might not be able to handle them.

438
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,120
Will you really be okay?

439
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,200
What do you take me, Heo Jeong Ran the Double Axe of Busan, for?

440
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,820
You know their phone number, right?

441
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,730
Yeah, Halibut, do me a favor.

442
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,810
It's nothing. I just need to track a phone number.

443
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,780
Boss, they're over there.

444
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,760
Hello, excuse me...

445
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:16,110
- What the heck?
- Who the heck are you, f!@#$?

446
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,940
Can I see you girls for a minute?

447
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,570
Hey!!!

448
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,200
RAWRRR!

449
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,570
These little wenches!

450
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,860
But who are you?

451
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,510
Me?

452
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,700
Ow, sh!@#! I'm tearing up.

453
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,340
No cursing, no slang in this household.

454
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,380
Yeah right, you @#$#%#. What the heck?!

455
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,730
Please add 10 kilograms every time they curse.

456
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,570
It's me, that Dog Fur (means "penniless") Donjo ("geeve me money") guy with amnesia.

457
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,490
I'm a man with amnesia.

458
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,130
Guys, I don't even have a penny. I won't get beat up.

459
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,690
This bastard is really a Dog Fur.

460
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,200
- Geeve (misspelled) me money.
- Who the heck is pulling this prank?

461
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,980
Giev (misspelled) me money, giev me money, giev me money.

462
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,960
Since you took all of Bok Sil's money, peel those until it's all paid back.

463
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,840
You make $30 for 20 kilograms, so if you three peel 60 kilograms a day, you'd make $90 a day.

464
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,440
Since you took $1000 as reward money and robbed $180 the first time we met, all together it's $1180.

465
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Let's just peel them for 13 days. I'll give you a $10 discount.

466
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,240
No way... Did you get your memory back?

467
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,030
Amazeballs! Are you really a chaebol?

468
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,230
What kind of f*&#%&* connection is this?

469
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,020
- Ah, she cursed! Please add 10 kilograms.
- Okay.

470
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,760
Hyun So Ri, adding 10 kilograms.

471
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,980
Work hard. I learned to be human while peeling these, you can too.

472
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,790
Give them something good to eat.

473
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,030
Yes, sir.

474
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,050
Good luck!

475
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,230
Wow. He's freaking cool.

476
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,540
Song Yeon Ah, another 10 kilograms. "Freaking cool."

477
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,120
Song Yeon Ah, $30.

478
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,780
Alright.

479
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,230
Choi Eun Jeong, $30. Hyun So Ri, $30.

480
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,050
Oh, Miss Hyun So Ri.

481
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,330
You worked hard.

482
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,690
Miss Choi Eun Jeong, good work..

483
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,280
Miss Song Yeon Ah, good work.

484
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,390
Big news! Big news! Big news!

485
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,150
Bok Sil became a company president!

486
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,150
Hurry up and look up singsingline.com.

487
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,890
Singsingline.com.

488
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,530
Oh, Bok Sil became a CEO!

489
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,670
Omg, it's a site that sells farm produce!

490
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,830
Name farm products after the grower and distribute...

491
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,340
When did she make all this?

492
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,340
- Do you know what the bigger news is? It's a humongous piece of news!
- What is it? What?

493
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,550
Her company's director is Headquarters Director Cha!

494
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,070
- Awesome!
- What?!

495
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:39,540
No way! I mean, why did he quit being the Goldline headquarters director and go there?

496
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,910
Manager Lee, what do you think?

497
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,250
Why would he go? It's so he could follow Bok Sil.

498
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,900
Stop saying stuff that makes no sense and get to work.

499
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:00,220
A question won't solve itself just because you're staring at it.

500
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,900
Yes.

501
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:09,320
The more I think about it, I think it's best that you start from factorization.

502
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,820
You know what factorization is, right?

503
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,530
I've heard of it.

504
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,670
It's a relief... that at least you've heard of it.

505
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:29,210
I'll prepare new text books for you tomorrow, so let's stop here for today.

506
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,730
Yes, sir!

507
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,770
I felt deja vu when I first saw Miss Bok Sil,

508
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,070
and that sense of deja vu has gotten more distinct now that I look at you.

509
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:50,470
Have you possibly... ever met me before?

510
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,000
No.

511
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,840
Goodbye!

512
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,070
I've definitely seen him somewhere, though...

513
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,500
The product is pretty good.

514
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,380
Does the quantity match?

515
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,960
Yes.

516
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,900
Bok Sil!

517
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,750
You're here?

518
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,530
Hey! You stop coming! Why do you keep coming here?!

519
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,080
I came for business today, for your information.

520
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,200
What business?

521
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,760
Sit down, President Go.

522
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,650
Daddy Long Legs Cha Joong Won

523
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,210
Director Daddy Long Legs, too.

524
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,850
Let Singsingline make a contract with Goldline.

525
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,310
What?

526
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,170
It's not because of you, Bok Sil. It's not like that!

527
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,990
In the big picture that I'm currently drawing to reinvent Goldline,

528
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:52,630
there is a place for a direct farm produce and fishery marketing site like Singsingline. That's why I'm making this proposal.

529
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,910
We'll put different kinds of products under different branches, with a representative overseeing each,

530
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,270
and we plan to open the merchandising directors' notes on the site.

531
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:04,350
You at Singsingline can just continue with your existing company concept as it is.

532
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,900
Why are you not answering?

533
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,290
I'll think about it.

534
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:24,510
Heol! Bok Sil... Are you rejecting my proposal right now?

535
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,900
My Singsingline is a company that I'm growing with my own efforts and the investment of Director Cha Joong Won.

536
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,370
At this juncture when it is gradually getting established, with a good reputation,

537
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:38,120
it's hard to decide whether a merger with a company like Goldline is the right path.

538
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,680
Ohhh...

539
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,930
Then, as the investor, I'll ask you a few questions.

540
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,690
What are the contract conditions?

541
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:54,410
After taking out the distribution costs going to Goldline Delivery, we will split net profits 2 to 8.

542
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,620
They're not bad conditions.

543
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,530
Actually, if we merge with Goldline, another middleman is added in the distribution chain.

544
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,760
We will have to add the costs to the product prices.

545
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,690
But if their products get promoted on Goldline's website,

546
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,070
your producers might earn greater profits.

547
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:16,790
President Go, in my opinion, Director Lou's proposal is pretty good,

548
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,810
so what do you think of joining hands with Goldline?

549
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,010
In exchange, we'll keep the existing pricing standards, and price products,

550
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,290
and not pass the incurred costs onto the consumers.

551
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,620
Ha ha ha!

552
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,940
Then, we're joining hands (working together).

553
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,550
Yes!

554
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,540
Bok Sil!

555
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,430
Stop it! Stop now.

556
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,230
Director, you come with us too.

557
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,790
Forget it.

558
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,430
This was a sabbatical year I gave myself anyway.

559
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,190
If you're going to support Go Bok Sil, then I'm going to rest at home.

560
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:08,130
Why? You can just rest at Goldline.

561
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:12,600
How can I rest at the company? Do you think that'll be possible with my personality?

562
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,730
I'll give you my office.

563
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,900
It's the biggest office at Goldline,

564
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,490
and there're blinds, so you can close them and sleep if you want to.

565
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,580
Of course, the food and beverages at the employee lounge are free. Free!

566
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,530
My house is 58 pyeong wide (about 2100 sq. ft) with three bedrooms!

567
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,330
I'll give you one of the bedrooms and a personal bathroom!

568
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,590
Of course, the food in the refrigerator is all free!

569
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,360
Are you making fun of me right now?

570
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,560
Why are you doing this? Won't you let go? Let me go!

571
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,270
It's because I like you, Director.

572
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,570
You're someone who makes me feel secure just by existing.

573
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,800
Would you believe me if I say this?

574
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,610
Get away from me.

575
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,250
Then, I'll take it as we're going together.

576
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,070
Good morning, everyone!

577
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,440
Headquarters Director! Headquarters Director!

578
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,850
Hello!

579
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:28,260
Oh, Headquarters Director!

580
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,310
I heard that you were going to be in Paris for a long time.

581
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,470
You're surprised I came back much quicker than you expected, aren't you?

582
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,940
No, we're really happy.

583
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,860
Stop it.

584
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,230
Thank you for being happy to see me. Let's start over and have fun working together in the future.

585
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,470
- Yes, sir!
- Fighting!

586
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,420
Ah, we've got new family members on our team.

587
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,630
They're coming.

588
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,180
Oh!

589
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,110
Cha Joong Won, why are you...

590
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,960
This is President Go Bok Sil and Director Cha Joong Won, who will run the Singsingline branch of Goldline.

591
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,160
Please take care of us in the future!

592
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,490
Were you all well? Rascals.

593
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,440
Yes.

594
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,920
Yes.

595
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,810
Singsingline can use that conference room over there, as an office.

596
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:21,180
And Director Cha Joong Won can use his former office.

597
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,980
Where will you sit, Director Louis?

598
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,990
I will... Oh! It's coming.

599
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,240
Over here. Please place it there.

600
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,760
Oh.

601
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,730
I will use this.

602
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,010
Is he Bok Sil's security guard or what?

603
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,340
He seems like her secretary too.

604
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,680
He's a romantic.

605
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,350
Then shall we talk in the conference room?

606
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,000
Yes.

607
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,090
Anyway, he's not normal.

608
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,920
Young Master Bok Nam.

609
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,560
I don't expect you to not be familiar with multiplication, are you?

610
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,670
Of course I'm not.

611
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,030
Oppa Bok Nam is comfortably studying, but what are we doing?

612
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,650
Shut up. Peeling garlic is more comfortable.

613
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,240
- I agree.
- Then you do all of it.

614
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,520
- I don't want to.
- Do it all.

615
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,290
Work harder! You rule breakers!

616
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:52,070
- Wow, the house is nice.
- Noona!

617
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,440
The house is classic.

618
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,280
Why are you like this Mom, like a country hick?

619
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,500
Welcome, Geum Ja.

620
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,110
Hello.

621
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,810
Thank you for inviting us over.

622
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:05,570
I should have come to see you earlier. I'm late in doing so.

623
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,660
Is it hard? Should I help?

624
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,330
Yes, please.

625
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,450
I'll sing you a song, so work hard.

626
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,130
- What is that?
- Is he mocking us?

627
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,700
Is he the grasshopper? (from The Ant and The Grasshopper)

628
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,390
Louis is back and the house is loud again.

629
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,160
If it's too loud, I won't let anyone in.

630
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,620
No, no. It seems like a house full of people. I like it.

631
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,160
Spending my whole life in solitude in this big house,

632
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,740
I don't know why I lived like that.

633
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,170
I even sent away

634
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,620
our precious Ji Sung.

635
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:12,630
I don't think Louis would live the way I lived.

636
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:18,110
That's because he learned how to live among people during the time he lost his memory.

637
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,780
I think that way too.

638
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,050
But what about that thing I told you to look into?

639
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:30,280
- Yes. I don't think there is any possibility of a second generation of Young Master.
- Huh?

640
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,290
That's weird. It was definitely a conception dream.

641
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,450
I guess I'm just old and shameless.

642
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,200
But what happened to Louis's treasure chest?

643
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,970
He has finally remembered.

644
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,770
Is that so? Where is it?

645
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:57,850
He said it's at the house in Imrang, Busan. I will hurry myself there.

646
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,660
Hurry and go get it.

647
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,350
I understand.

648
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,420
Ah. Jeong Ran.

649
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,270
Why? Is something the matter?

650
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,500
Perhaps, are you pregnant?

651
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,620
Be quiet! How long has it been since we came back from Busan that you're saying something like that?!

652
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:27,860
No, Chairwoman said she had a conception dream, and her dreams usually come true.

653
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:32,320
Be quiet, be quiet, please! Go away!

654
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,810
Is it really okay if Bok Nam stays at Grandmother's house? I'm worried it might be too troublesome.

655
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:46,990
Of course. I told you to leave Bok Nam to me.

656
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:53,260
And Butler Kim said even if he kills himself giving Bok Nam a Spartan-style education day and night,

657
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,980
he's not sure if he'll be able to raise his grades.

658
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,610
What? It's that bad?

659
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,670
Yes.

660
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,030
Oh, what to do.

661
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,260
You're cold, right?

662
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,700
No, I'm okay.

663
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,120
I don't think so. You're cold.

664
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,760
What?

665
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:21,320
♬ It's Dark I Can't See You ♬

666
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,780
♬ Fading one by one ♬

667
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:33,450
♬ My step that was hesitant ♬

668
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,360
Who set the table?

669
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,280
I asked Hyung In Seong to make something because I wanted a snack.

670
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,980
What are we eating again?

671
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,930
There's a beggar in my stomach, remember? Open it.

672
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,410
What kind of food is it?

673
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:04,190
It looks fake sitting on the table like that, doesn't it? But it's real.

674
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:08,600
Bvlgari Beyond two-band white gold diamond.

675
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,980
It looks too fake.

676
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,750
And you have the money to buy this?

677
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,890
How much is it?

678
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,840
Thirty-thousand won. ($30 USD)

679
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,220
I can't slip a fake ring on Bok Sil's hand.

680
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:27,510
♬ Even if that star loses its shine someday ♬

681
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:35,460
♬ I'll look for you who's losing the shine and I will shine my light on you ♬

682
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,890
♬ With Shiny Light of Mine  ♬

683
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,060
This is my sincere heart.

684
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,590
To be honest, back then,

685
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,090
I would have bought that ring for you if I only had had 30,000 won in my pocket.

686
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:02,450
♬ Where The Place I Round Around ♬

687
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:09,640
Thank you, Louis.

688
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,490
♬ Rising one by one ♬

689
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:22,750
♬ Your star, shining so bright ♬

690
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:30,300
♬ I call you again ♬

691
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:36,450
♬ Hey You Hey You Hey You ♬

692
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:42,650
Hey, Louis. Isn't it hot in here?

693
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:46,200
It's almost summer and it's already so hot.

694
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,730
Should we go outside and have a cup of coffee?

695
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:02,790
Shall we?

696
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:06,250
Let's not go outside, I will make it for you.

697
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,860
What's going on with you, Mr. Kang Ji Sung?

698
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,250
I can't have you get your hands wet while wearing the ring.

699
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,620
Just wait a minute.

700
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:28,560
Louis! How did you know that thing was there?

701
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,670
I moved it when you weren't here.

702
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,810
Actually...

703
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,620
I came here every day.

704
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:50,520
I came every day and cleaned up the room. I made coffee too.
♬ Before I knew it even if you said anything  ♬

705
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,600
I've put coins in the piggy bank.
♬ I'm fine with it.  ♬

706
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,600
It feels like it keeps getting heavier.

707
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,540
It's already time for Bok Sil to come home.
♬ were together today  ♬

708
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:12,400
Then when it was time for you to come home I would disappear.
♬ feels a little too long.  ♬

709
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,460
Even when you were going to work by bus.
♬ I hope you won't say that.  ♬

710
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:21,480
Even when you were turning off the lights.

711
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,420
Also today, sleep well, Bok Sil.

712
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,320
I kept an eye on you.
♬ Now as if you're being a little sorry  ♬

713
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,860
I'm sorry for doing it without telling you.
♬ because there's no need to be  ♬

714
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:45,580
♬ This time like ♬

715
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:55,360
♬ the last meeting feels a little too easy  ♬

716
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,090
Thank you, Louis.
♬ Would you be okay with that?  ♬

717
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:08,460
♬ And I’m So Fine  ♬

724
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,850
♬ My hand is trembling.  ♬

725
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:49,390
♬ Won't you hold me back? Should I just hold you pretending I'm crazy? ♬

726
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:55,030
♬ Would You Be Fine?  ♬

727
00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:03,620
♬ The moment when one looks back like this is the end.  ♬

728
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:07,820
♬ I’m Not So Fine  ♬

729
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:13,480
♬ Can't I look back?  ♬

730
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,140
Let's not separate again.
♬ My heart is breaking too late  ♬

731
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:27,210
♬ I'm looking back  ♬

732
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:33,680
♬ more than your eyes did at the end.  ♬

733
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:40,660
♬ For words of gratitude So Fine  ♬

734
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:46,780
♬ Like this we are Fine  ♬

735
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,210
I remembered. I remembered where the treasure chest is.

736
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,870
Where is it?

737
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:58,760
In the attic at the house in Busan.

738
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,130
I've already looked there dozens of times.

739
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,460
It's under the floor.

740
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,610
Chairwoman, the box isn't here.

741
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:32,760
I think he remembered wrongly.

742
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,040
I see... Okay.

743
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:43,160
Where did you hide it, Ji Sung?

744
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:58,420
Louis, do you remember this?

745
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,800
Oh! Of course.

746
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,670
Can I have one?

747
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,490
Sure!

748
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,440
Ji Sung!

749
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,240
Ahjumma Audrey.

750
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:36,920
Who made our pretty prince cry again?

751
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:40,130
Here, try one of these.

752
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:43,490
If Grandma or Butler Kim finds out, I'll be in trouble. Hurry!

753
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,230
- Quick, eat it.
- Wow, it's chocolate.

754
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,050
It's delicious.

755
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,770
- Is it good?
- Yes!

756
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,120
Take your time.

757
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,850
Okay.

758
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,720
Madam, did you just feed Young Master some weird food again?

759
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,550
No, I didn't.

760
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,390
Is it good?

761
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,070
Yes.

762
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,800
It's the same taste as back then.

763
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,760
Now, don't hide it and eat as many as you want.

764
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,600
Grandmother and Butler Kim were kind of particular, weren't they?

765
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,520
Yes.

766
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,800
Since you came back Mother has brightened up a lot more,

767
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,430
and the mood in the house is so lively. I really like it.

768
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,320
I like it as well.

769
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,600
You should come over and hang out at my bookstore often from now on too.

770
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,370
Yes.

771
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,600
Welcome!

772
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,940
Is there a certain book that you're looking for?

773
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,670
We talked on the phone some time ago, remember?

774
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:11,460
I am Secretary Goo.

775
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,190
Ah, you work with my husband?

776
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,710
Secretary Goo?

777
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,020
Who is it?

778
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,190
I'm Secretary Goo.

779
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,110
Secretary Goo?
