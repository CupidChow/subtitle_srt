1
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,910
On that day, I drove recklessly for the first time in my life.

2
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,490
It's already this late. Why isn't he here?

3
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,060
Mother!

4
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,550
Has Louis arrived?

5
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,050
Huh? What do you mean?

6
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,210
You're the one who went to pick him up.

7
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,770
Yes, but...

8
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,260
Louis took the car and left by himself.

9
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,430
What?

10
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,590
And that day, I, Shopping King Louis,

11
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,410
disappeared in an accident.

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,740
Episode 2
A Whole New World

13
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,580
I need water. Give me water.

14
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,360
Ah I'm thirsty, thirsty!

15
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,230
Were you talking to me?

16
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,780
Aish!

17
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,440
This crazy... Dirty? Dirty?

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,340
Do you need to get beaten to death to come to your senses?

19
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,510
Why am I dirty? Why? Aren't you dirty?

20
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,580
Aish! Aish!

21
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,130
Hey! How am I dirty?

22
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,430
Ah, so annoying. Why is that dork bothering me this morning?

23
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,660
Hey! Let's go!

24
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,360
Okay.

25
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,380
Ouch, that hurts.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,490
What is this?

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,570
- He's so good looking.
- Right?

28
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,160
- He's a flower boy.
- What flower boy? You mean a flower beggar? Let's hurry and go.

29
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,990
Where am I?

30
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,690
Who am I?

31
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,400
Bok Nam!

32
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,240
- Bok Nam.
- You scared me.

33
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,700
Am I Bok Nam?

34
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,870
You, who are you?

35
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,660
Am I not Bok Nam?

36
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,710
Oh, what's wrong?

37
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,450
Hey! Hey!

38
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,050
She's crazy.

39
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,180
Stand up!

40
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,940
Stand up!

41
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,560
Look! I'm sure this is Bok Nam's!

42
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,260
- You! Where did you get this?
- I don't know.

43
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,440
How do you not know? Why aren't you telling me?

44
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,180
You, where did you get this?

45
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,230
I really don't know!

46
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,070
What are you saying? Where did you get this tracksuit?

47
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,880
Where did I get it?

48
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,340
Who am I?

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,520
Do you know me?

50
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,240
Huh?

51
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,090
You can't verify his fingerprints?

52
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,380
I think he is an unregistered person.

53
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,490
He says he really doesn't remember anything?

54
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,110
He doesn't know why he was even sitting there. Of course, he doesn't remember his name.

55
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,990
But I'm sure those clothes are Bok Nam's.

56
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,020
Oh my...

57
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,990
That's the national tracksuit.

58
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,230
Probably all guys have one.

59
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,710
That's not it! The sewing I did is exactly the same!

60
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,870
- I am sure!
- Is that so?

61
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,900
Then that means he has met Bok Nam before.

62
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,780
Have you shown him Bok Nam's picture?

63
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,720
Yes. But he said he's never seen him before.

64
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,770
He must have developed a memory problem after he met him.

65
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,560
I'll question people around the station area when I have some time. So, come by again tomorrow.

66
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,500
You're going to come every day to ask about Bok Nam anyway.

67
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,730
Okay.

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,820
What should we do with that person?

69
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,580
For now, I'll send him to a facility.

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,830
What? What did he say?

71
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,990
Detective.

72
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,990
Can someone like that get his memory back?

73
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,630
I'm not sure. I'm not a doctor, so I don't know.

74
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,290
Bok Sil,

75
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,330
I heard you're still living at the sauna.

76
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,060
In your circumstances, taking in that person into your care is not as easy as you think.

77
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,480
But what if he is the only answer to finding Bok Nam?

78
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,860
He might not be the answer, but may become a burden instead.

79
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,060
If he gets taken care of and feels safe, he might get his memories back.

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,290
Hey.

81
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,900
Truth is, I'm not well off enough to take responsibility for you.

82
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm going to take you in only until your memory comes back and I find Bok Nam.

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,190
Just letting you know.

84
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,800
Are you from North Korea?

85
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,070
The way you speak seems North Korean.

86
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,190
Then are you a foreigner? You keep using weird foreign languages.

87
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,960
Right. Come to think of it, I'm used to speaking English.

88
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,440
What? What? Do you remember something?

89
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,930
Hey! How about a guy who looks like this?

90
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,700
Did I...

91
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,060
live out of the country? Huh?

92
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,930
The police said no one reported me missing?

93
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,240
Yes.

94
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,940
What happened? Was there an accident?

95
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,640
Oh my god.

96
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,390
The car is completely burnt. The person must have died.

97
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,410
Hey, that's scary. Let's go.

98
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,170
Okay.

99
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,120
Wait for me.

100
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,200
You bought this for his 20th birthday!

101
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,420
It's a limited edition Patek Philippe watch.

102
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,330
Louis.

103
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,010
Louis!

104
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,650
My poor baby...

105
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,660
Ji Seong!

106
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,190
Because of me! All because of me!

107
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,000
- Mother!
- Chairwoman!

108
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,150
Where are you going?

109
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,800
I need to go to work, but I'm late because of you!

110
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,550
What about food?

111
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,090
I told you earlier that I'm hungry.

112
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,250
Wait until dinner. I'll buy you something delicious.

113
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,360
What?!

114
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,750
This is lunch time. How do I wait until dinner? I haven't even eaten breakfast, I'll die.

115
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,060
Look, I'm not the type who eats three meals a day.

116
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,670
She's a devil. She's mean.

117
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,060
Why? Do you want one?

118
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,990
Hey!

119
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,960
Do you have money?

120
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,660
Then why are you eating this?

121
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,830
Toast 2000 won

122
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,660
Here you go.

123
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,000
- Thank you.
- Yes.

124
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,340
Aish.

125
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,400
It's tasty.

126
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,010
Totally my style.

127
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,490
How can you be this late?

128
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,760
I didn't think you were like this, but you're undisciplined.

129
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,510
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,150
That man, is he your boyfriend?

131
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,160
Huh? No way.

132
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,470
His mind is kind of back and forth.

133
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,460
I'm caring for him because of a circumstance.

134
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,700
Oh my!

135
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,360
Hey! How did you end up caring for something like that?

136
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,530
Whatever your circumstance, you should separate public from private matters.

137
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,570
Yes, I'm sorry.

138
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm letting you off easy today because something big is going on at work today.

139
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,350
Why? Did something happen?

140
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,700
The Chairwoman's grandson passed away.

141
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,990
What?!

142
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,080
I thought you were doing something incredible.

143
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,060
You were a cleaner?

144
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,540
- Isn't it better than being a beggar?
- Beggar?

145
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,370
The thing you did on the street is begging. What else would it be?

146
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,780
This is ridiculous. I'm a beggar?

147
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,680
I'll go and work, so you go sit over there and wait.

148
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,360
I don't want to.

149
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,760
Let's go together.

150
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,840
You're going to abandon me, aren't you?

151
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,170
Why would I? Maybe you're feeling guilty about something?

152
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:08,460
I told you earlier. I'm going to keep you with me until your memory comes back, to find Bok Nam.

153
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,410
That's the truth, right?

154
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,620
Move over. I need to work.

155
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,300
And clean yourself up.

156
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,200
This is shocking, isn't it?

157
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,340
How could her grandson die in a car accident as soon as he got to Korea?

158
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,050
But you told be before about how the chairwoman's fate is rough or something.

159
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,000
Back then, I was just half listening.

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,390
But maybe that fortune talk is really true?

161
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,130
I want to drink it so badly. I want to drink it so badly that I'm going crazy.

162
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,490
But I feel sorry for her.

163
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:01,200
What can you do when you have money, power in this huge company when you don't have family?

164
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Aigoo. That's what I mean.

165
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,310
- What's this smell?
- What is this salty smell?

166
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,990
Omo!

167
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,620
- Ow that stings.
- Are you a beggar? Who are you?

168
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,840
Security! Security! Over here!

169
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,190
No!

170
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,390
Are you allowed to let just anyone into the building?

171
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,050
He's a beggar and a pervert!

172
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,550
No that's not it. This is a misunderstanding. I'm not that kind of person. Never! I'm not!

173
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,570
- I'm not!
- Come out.
- I only smelled it!

174
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,870
- I only smelled that!
- I said come out quickly!

175
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,700
I'm supposed to wait.

176
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,100
What a pervert!

177
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,850
I'm really not that kind of person.

178
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,510
I'm not like a beggar or a pervert.

179
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,110
I was waiting for an employee.

180
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,550
Who? What is the employee's name?

181
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,230
What is the name of the person you were waiting for.

182
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,140
- Oh! Bok Nam's older sister!
- Please leave.

183
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,840
Bok Nam's older sister— Oh, that scared me.

184
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,220
Bok Nam's sister...

185
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,550
Please leave.

186
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,420
Ah, what was her name?

187
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,370
Bok...Bok...Bok...Ja.

188
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,190
Bok Gi, Bok Soo,

189
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,110
I'm Bok Sil. Go Bok Sil.

190
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,030
I know. I know just by hearing your voice.

191
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,310
You still didn't buy a phone?

192
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,390
No. Phones are too expensive.

193
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,130
Then when are you going to buy one?

194
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,880
When I receive money from you.

195
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,240
Do you still have the wild ginseng?

196
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,050
It's in the refrigerator. Why?

197
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,430
Go to the herbal medicine market and ask. Then, they'll tell you right away if it's real or fake.

198
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,550
I'm busy so I have no time to go, so just keep calling.

199
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,030
What? Please.

200
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,530
Please hurry up, I am asking you.

201
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,880
I can't talk to you for that long...

202
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,790
Now you're hanging up without saying good-bye.

203
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,460
Here. Thank you.

204
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,850
I didn't say anything because I'm shy, but do you know how expensive the phone bill is?

205
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,670
I'm letting you borrow it because I'm like that.

206
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,240
Yes! Thank you, Supervisor!

207
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,480
Wow. That's so cool!

208
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,260
Why are you here?

209
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,570
I was waiting for you for a while.

210
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,420
What is it?

211
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,710
It's nothing.

212
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,270
I told you to wait inside. You really don't listen.

213
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,660
People thought I was a beggar and kicked me out.

214
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,190
I guess people have eyes! Just know that it's because it's me that I'm keeping you.

215
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,800
- What's your name?
- Go Bok Sil.

216
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,860
Why are you laughing? Is my name funny?

217
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,830
What kind of name is Bok Sil?

218
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,990
You don't even remember your own name. Do you have a right to laugh?

219
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,960
- Bok Shil!
- What?!

220
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,400
- I want coffee.
- Coffee, what?

221
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,150
Just one cup.

222
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,470
Wow.

223
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,480
It's the Panama Geisha you used to enjoy.

224
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:02,160
Please enjoy it on your final journey out.

225
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,730
Ji Sung! Ji Sung, No!

226
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Ji Sung!

227
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,940
I guess President Baek's daughter and the chairwoman's grandson were very close?

228
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,650
They grew up together, I heard.

229
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:43,620
They've hung out since they were young. She must be traumatized.

230
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,120
Wow. Everyone is wearing the same clothes.

231
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,410
Is it the first time coming to this kind of place?

232
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,180
Yeah.

233
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,630
You should go wash up.

234
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,300
Okay.

235
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,550
Bok Sil.

253
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,690
Hey, separation of men and women. Why so close?

254
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,730
Go over there.

255
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,180
It's because I'm worried that you'll run away.

256
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,270
Why are you such a scaredy-cat?

257
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,510
Because it's scary to be alone.

258
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,920
You look old enough, but you're a baby.

259
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,410
I'm scared of people hitting me.

260
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,060
And I'm scared of them looking down on me and chasing me away.

261
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,720
It's a feeling I never felt before.

262
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,260
Weren't you scared when you ate the toast with no money?

263
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,580
I spent too much money today.

264
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,120
I have been saving it all this time.

265
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,170
It's all your fault.

266
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,060
Thank you.

267
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,740
You're staying with me until I get my memory back. Okay?

268
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,480
Promise.

269
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:28,390
♬  You've been looking for me all day  ♬

270
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,300
Because we need you to get your memory back to find Bok Nam.

271
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,790
♬  Where should I go  ♬

272

278
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,380
Stop crying, Ma Ri.

279
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,490
I'm so pitiful, Mom.

280
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,530
I was going to marry Louis.

281
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,800
It's all messed up now.

282
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,880
You know Mom liked Louis too, right?

283
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,900
Another great guy like Louis will show up again.

284
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,460
No. Louis is the only heir to Gold Group.

285
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,200
I need to marry him to be Gold Group's madame.

286
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,780
Ma Ri?

287
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,600
Wait, Mom. If there's no Louis,

288
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,430
will Gold Group come to Dad?

289
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,260
Probably.

290
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,370
Then, in the end...

291
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,400
I'll inherit Gold Group.

292
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,680
Take me with you.

293
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,290
You just stay here. If you go out and come back, you need to pay again.

294
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,960
You know how expensive the admission is? Just enjoy the sauna.

295
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,410
What do I eat for lunch then?

296
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,000
Buy an egg and some rice punch.

297
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,720
That's not enough. Can you give me more?

298
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,880
Forget it. You figure it out.

299
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,460
How...

300
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,750
Here.

301
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:16,020
Don't waste it. Bye.

302
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,390
Wait a moment.

303
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,340
Hello, Headquarters' Director.

304
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,600
Are you alright, Ma Ri?

305
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,950
What?

306
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,090
You cried a lot. I heard you and the chairwoman's grandson were very close.

307
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,400
Oh. Yes.

308
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,280
I got along with him well since we were kids.

309
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,540
So last night I couldn't sleep at all either.

310
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,690
By the way, Director, the fact that my dad's the president

311
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,440
and I and the chairwoman's grandson were close because of that, you can keep that a secret, right?

312
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,300
Yup.

313
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,220
I'd feel uncomfortable if people knew.

314
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,890
I just want to be ordinary and be evaluated the same as others.

315
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,290
That's what I'm doing already.

316
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,500
I can't read him.

317
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,810
Coffee please.

318
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,700
What type shall I give you?

319
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,690
Cheapest one.

320
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,880
One dollar.

321
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,930
This is coffee?

322
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,730
Maxim Gold. You don't know it?

323
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,310
♬ a whole new world, a whole new world ♬

324
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,270
Wow, it's totally my style.

325
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,450
♬ A thrilling chase. A wondrous place for you and me ♬

326
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,610
♬ A wondrous place ♬

327
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,290
♬ For you and me. ♬

328
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:01,950
Hey, watch where you're going!

329
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,610
This is no joke.

330
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,540
There are only scary people in this world with the exception of Bok Sil.

331
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:03,650
Seon Gu, you take over the company.

332
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,060
Mother, why are you being so weak?

333
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,350
You have to get better soon and get back to managing the company.

334
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:18,360
I'm going to go to Busan.

335
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,910
I'll go to Busan where I used to live with my Louis and...

336
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,380
I want to live out the rest of my life.

337
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,360
Mother...

338
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,320
It's extremely unfortunate that Ji Sung passed away like that, but

339
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,790
you're the one who made Gold Group into what it is today.

340
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:51,610
You deserve to be in your position. Don't feel too bad.

341
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,680
I'll prepare your installation ceremony.

342
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,760
Rimon's sales number has come close to our number this month.

343
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,050
At this rate, they may overtake us next month.

344
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,980
They've been doing aggressive marketing since last month.

345
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,480
There are many advantages when the social commerce site sells patent-competition-winning products.

346
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,910
That's right. From the consumers' perspective, it's much more convenient to buy products that have been curated already.

347
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,200
On top of that, they're much faster at distribution.

348
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,040
We're not so bad in the area of distribution either.

349
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,350
- Did everyone check the mobile UI that the acquisition team developed?
- Yes.

350
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:26,590
Starting this month, we'll match that up and strengthen the social commerce portion.

351
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,050
Then, we'll have to add more manpower.

352
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,450
For social commerce, choosing products, managing partners

353
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,680
and designing webpages. There's a lot of work involved even to make one deal happen.

354
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,230
- Manager Lee.
- Yes?

355
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:48,420
You have an ability to detect first and foremost when the workload is increased.

356
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,660
That's a very precious skill.

357
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,820
Director, your throat must hurt because of me. Please enjoy a warm cup of coffee.

358
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,240
I'm fine.

359
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,040
010-138-2111

360
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,640
But please accept my gesture and have some.

361
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,630
Seriously!

362
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,470
The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep...

363
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,880
This has never happened...

364
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,200
There's only one bar left! Have you ever been hit with a cell phone?

365
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,180
How many times has it been today alone?

366
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,320
He's not answering the phone on purpose.

367
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,860
Can I make one more call please?

368
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:31,260
- How dense. You've been scammed!
- What?

369
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,150
Hey, what do you think is the reason when the person who owes you money ignores your call?

370
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,060
That means he won't give your money back.

371
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:42,930
So, what made you give someone ginseng worth $5000 for $100? Aigoo...

372
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,750
$5000... how many months' salary is that? You must have so much money, really...

373
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:53,000
No. He would never do that.

374
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,990
- Hey, you thief!
- It's not me.

375
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,430
I thought you were suspicious when you bumped into me earlier.

376
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,850
You did that on purpose, right? You stole my money, right? Give it.

377
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:08,110
Give it! Give me back my money! Give me back my money!

378
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,480
Ajumma, let go of this!

379
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,090
Who the heck are you?

380
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,600
I'm... his guardian.

381
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,630
Guardian? Then you give me my money.

382
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,940
How much? How much?

383
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,920
$100.

384
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,420
No, that's not true. I found $50 on the floor.

385
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,720
That mouth of yours! So noisy!

386
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,860
I really just found it.

387
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,350
Here.

388
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,980
I've heard about kids going around saunas and pickpocketing lately.

389
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,270
Are you those people by any chance?

390
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,790
- No way!
- You are!

391
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,850
We aren't! We aren't!

392
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,400
Let's go.

393
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,990
Wow, that was so unfair.

394
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:15,610
I found some money and bought food with it. I'm telling the truth, Bok Sil.

395
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:22,870
I know. From now on, if you find money, don't use it but just hold on to it.

396
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,410
You never know what will happen.

397
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,870
It's already nighttime. Where do I sleep tonight?

398
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,100
We can just go to your house.

399
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,850
I don't have a home!

400
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,930
Where would there be anyone in the world without a home?

401
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,690
Hey, do you have a home?

402
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,060
Why don't you have a home?

403
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,260
It hasn't been long since I came to Seoul.

404
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,290
I'm going to get a room when I save money.

405
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,150
Where did you originally live?

406
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,870
The mountains in Gangwondo.

407
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,870
The mountains in Gangwondo... mountains... Where is that?

408
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,860
In Gangwon Province.

409
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,690
Don't you know?

410
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,340
There are so many things you don't know about.

411
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,670
Hot!

412
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,480
This is amazing!

413
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:58,670
Totally my style.

414
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,890
It's strange.

415
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,950
What?

416
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:10,110
This is so delicious, but it's a new taste for me. What have I been eating all this time?

417
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,670
- Do you want another one?
- Yeah.

418
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,950
I'm going crazy because of your mom.

419
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,270
Why? Did she feed you something weird again?

420
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:23,670
She even put this in ramen.

421
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,150
This stupid plum extract, it'll take me a year to finish this.

422
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,330
Tell her the truth that it tastes bad and don't eat it.

423
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,580
You know I'm not good at saying stuff like that.

424
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,520
Then just eat it.

425
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,190
I have to go to work early. I'll skip your story.

426
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,160
Joong Won!

427
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,010
Even a son is useless.

428
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,830
What's this?

429
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,980
Is this real?

430
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,360
Is this place open 24/7 too?

431
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,790
Are we sleeping here tonight then?

432
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:18,400
If you have eyes, look! Where can we sleep?

433
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,190
My stomach is bursting!

434
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,940
Oh?

435
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,300
Please buy me a bottle of water.

436
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,770
Huh? That grandma!

437
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,560
Bok Sil.

438
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,020
- Grandma!
- Who are you?

439
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,600
Who is it?

440
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,770
The bag thief! Go and catch her!

441
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,190
Get her, get her!

442
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,970
Hey, are you okay?

443
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,300
Wait a minute here! Don't move!

444
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,030
How are you going to come back?

445
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,180
Next to the spicy rice cake stand and convenience store! I'll be back!

446
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:26,170
Don't leave me! You have to come back! Bok Sil!

447
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,590
Grandma!

448
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,510
Grandma!

449
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,430
Grandma!

450
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,070
Grandma!

451
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,370
Grandma! Grandma!

452
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,630
Heyyyy!

453
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,930
Aigoo, persistent girl.

454
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,450
Heyyyy!

455
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,570
Grandma!

456
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,900
Oh my!

457
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,190
Give me my money.

458
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,700
Bitch... you're so tenacious.

459
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:24,360
- Mister, can't you stay?
- I'm closed for today.

460
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,400
I don't think Bok Sil can find me if this truck is gone.

461
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,590
Just a moment. Only for a bit...

462
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,200
Strange people these days.

463
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:56,090
You say you're the Flying Squirrel from Mountain Odae?

464
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,090
I'm the Black Weasel from Mount Seorak.

465
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,380
Sorry about the money.

466
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,450
Actually, I came to Seoul to find my grandson.

467
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,550
I haven't been able to reach that punk ever since he left home.

468
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:21,150
So I took the train out of worry, but I didn't have money.

469
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,980
I must have lost it momentarily.

470
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,390
If you're going to the police, let's get going.

471
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,930
Well, this old lady who's not acting her age... just put me in jail.

472
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:36,290
Grandma. Never mind.

473
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,280
Just give me those clothes.

474
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,820
Oh. Did he go somewhere?

475
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,460
Is this it?

476
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,830
Welcome.

477
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,340
When are you coming, Bok Sil?

478
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,760
- Oppa, are you an idol?
- Or an actor-trainee?

479
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,880
He is so handsome!

480
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,830
To celebrate your handsomeness, buy us some food.

481
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,460
Food?

482
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,080
I have no money, couldn't you just buy your own food?

483
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:00,860
You have good looks but you don't understand anything.

484
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,160
What's the matter?

485
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,650
Help me! Help Me!

486
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,820
Oppa, why are you getting mad?

487
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,330
We just fought a little bit.

488
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,420
Hye Mi, let's go together!

489
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,720
What am I going to do? I am so confused.

490
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,700
He's not here as well?

491
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,670
If we find anything you'll get hit once

492
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,460
for every dime we find. Frisk him.

493
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,870
Kids, I don't even have a dime. I guess I won't get hit.

494
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,180
What? He is a beggar for real.

495
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,100
- What is this? Damn...
- What is it?

496
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,910
Why are you pretending to be sick? You look perfectly fine, a**hole.

497
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,900
Hey, are you a beggar?

498
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,740
Hey! What are you guys doing?!

499
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:31,830
Bok Sil...

500
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,070
Bok Shil? Goes perfectly together with Dog Fur (Bok Shil is a common name for dogs and dog fur means penniless).

501
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:39,270
Hey, lend us some money.

502
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:41,630
Are you crazy? Why should I lend you guys money?

503
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:47,040
Geez, is she deaf? Why can't you understand what I'm saying?

504
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,860
This @!#?#@!!!

505
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:59,700
- Hey! Hey!
- These girls are scary.

506
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:09,170
♬ My heart is burning white hot white hot, like a fire ♬

507
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:15,490
♬ As if to melt passionately my love, heart is a time bomb ♬

508
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:21,410
♬  Come again, come again, catch me like fire  ♬

509
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:27,700
♬ The wait is over ♬

510
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,010
Don't cry, Bok Sil.

511
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:55,270
Why did I have to faint just then?

512
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,610
They took away all my money...

513
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:09,200
Wow, daebak. Hey, she was dressed all tacky, but she's got some money.

514
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:11,890
Let's eat some meat and find a nice place to sleep.

515
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:14,640
Hey, but the clothes that the dog fur guy was wearing,

516
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,000
Didn't it look similar to Oppa Bok Nam's?

517
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,940
With the frigging tacky style, the design was the same...

518
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:25,070
I haven't seen Bok Nam these days. Is he in hiding?

519
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,500
Bok Sil...

520
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:36,680
Thank you.

521
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,820
For not leaving me and coming to look for me.

522
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,480
I was so scared.

523
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,830
I know it too.

524
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,870
Having nowhere to go, no money...

525
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:15,790
You don't know anybody, like you are in pitch dark.

526
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:20,920
In addition, you can't remember anything so it must be even darker.

527
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:32,150
From now on, you must take me with you, okay?

528
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,850
Aigoo, you're like a baby (spoken in Gangwon dialect).

529
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,840
What is "Aga"?

530
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,630
This is money, right?

531
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,700
Please, pick up the phone. Please, pick it up.

532
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,510
He's not answering?

533
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:41,820
Be strong, Bok Sil. I'll find you Bok Nam and also your ginseng thief.

534
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,830
You can count on me.

535
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:48,730
Eh? Why are you laughing?

536
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,240
Because you inspire so much trust.

537
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,510
Where do we go now?

538
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,910
You are so reassuring.

539
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,520
Follow me.

540
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:22,260
♬  But I can fly, I passed by so many stars  ♬

541
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:26,610
♬  In the space where my memory fell asleep  ♬

542
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,930
Bok Sil, are we still far away?

543
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,850
Just a little bit more.

544
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,610
♬ Lost the way.  ♬

545
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,850
Soon, it's time to start working. I will come back after work so wait.

546
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,500
Take me with you.

547
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:23,110
Bok Sil, I am thirsty.

548
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:31,050
- This is totally my style.
- Where is the water cooler?

549
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:33,260
Wow, so stylish.

550
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,340
- I'll drink this.
- What are you doing? Just drink water and let's go.

551
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,220
There's nobody here, I will drink it quickly.

552
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:54,970
Wow it's so tasty!

553
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:58,280
That is coffee for you. Delicious, right?

554
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,400
Oh... my legs hurt.

555
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,370
- Are you okay?
- Not a dent on me.

556
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:11,900
Do you know who I am? I'm Go Bok Shil, the Flying Squirrel of Mountain Odae.

557
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,130
Wow, the owner of this company must be filthy rich, huh?

558
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,750
Of course. Why ask?

559
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,090
Should we live hidden here from now on?

560
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,240
What is that dress?

561
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,120
My mom used to wear it. I cried so much when I lost it.

562
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:45,080
Oh... Bok Sil, your mom is not here anymore?

563
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,660
I don't even remember her face.

564
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,090
Did you lose your memory, too?

565
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,570
She died when I was really young. My father died as well.

566
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:58,450
I see...

567
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,950
Bok Sil, I am sleepy.

568
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:13,870
Eh? Hey, you can't.

569
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,980
They're closing...

570
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,570
Are you telling me to sleep here?

571
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,410
This is the safest place.

572
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:30,310
I'll come back after work so stay here and don't stir. Go in, go in!

573
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,990
I'm going.

574
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:36,150
Bok Sil!

575
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,910
What? Aish...

576
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,000
Wait.

577
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,830
You! Which department do you work in?

578
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:19,120
Which department?

579
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,040
Aish!

580
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,780
This guy...

581
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,890
Hey, Counterfeit! Stop!

582
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,330
Counterfeit, you stop right there!

583
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,560
Hey!

584
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,660
Stings.

585
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,420
That beggar pervert from yesterday, isn't it?

586
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,020
What?

587
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,450
Omo. It is. The homeless man from the lobby. How did he get in here?

588
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:21,070
Report him.

589
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,810
Excuse me, wait a second!

590
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,640
Wait.

591
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,800
Hey, you there!

592
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,300
Hey, you! Why? Why?

593
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,500
What?

594
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,300
What?

595
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,500
Is he here?

596
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,150
Excuse me!

597
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:04,080
Excuse me, did you see a beggar-looking guy?

598
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,070
Oh... here is so dirty.

599
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,290
Th-That way.

600
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,830
There?

601
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,230
Hey.

602
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:24,720
I told you not to move. Why are you running around? So bad.

603
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,220
Why you hit me? I didn't do it on purpose.

604
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,600
Oh! I got scared!

605
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,210
I won't lend you my phone.

606
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:36,120
It's not that favor I'm asking today.

607
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,450
Then what?

608
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:41,730
Is there a room that costs very little money?

609
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:52,890
It's thanks to me that you're getting a place.

610
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,250
Thank you so much.

611
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,110
Are we there yet?

612
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:00,820
I am dying.

613
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,770
Are you going to live with that young guy?

614
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,360
Yes.

615
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,290
- He is upset-style.
- Pardon?

616
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:12,210
He is the type that makes people upset.

617
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,700
There is no oxygen, no oxygen.

618
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,600
I am out of breath.

619
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:27,480
It's here!

620
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,520
Wow! Nice.

621
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,430
You can clean up these things.

622
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:35,370
Yes.

623
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:40,590
Oh my God. We have to live here?

624
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,990
Come in.

625
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,230
So spacious, right?

626
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,960
Yes.

627
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,380
Supervisor! It's great!

628
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,130
Really?

629
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:02,510
What? It has just one room.

630
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,270
For you, there is the big wooden bench outside.

631
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:08,050
Hey, you hit the jackpot for $400 a month and no security deposit.

632
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,050
Exactly, thank you.

633
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,770
By the way, what is this smell?

634
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:31,900
Just bleach smell. You smell that everyday and still do not know? The owner cleaned the place.

635
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,340
I see. Must be a nice person.

636
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,310
Ah... sure.

637
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:40,300
But something is weird.

638
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,990
What is weird? I'll leave first.

639
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:46,710
Sure, see you!

640
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,540
What is weird?

641
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:57,920
There's nothing. No TV, no bed, no refrigerator. How can we live in a place like this?

642
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:01,270
Why do I feel a chill all over?

643
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,490
There's only one bathroom.

644
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,350
Thank you for taking care of it.

645
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,660
Give me something if you're grateful.

646
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,430
Cut my rent by 100K won.

647
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:20,280
100,000 won?

648
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,120
I mean, a place where not just one but three died.

649
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,300
Ah! Be quiet! I got it.

650
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,140
You can still smell rotting corpses...

651
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,620
I said I got it!

652
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:35,210
I switched out the main motherboard, so the data was wiped out.

653
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:38,640
Then I lost all the call records as well?

654
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,250
Yes, client.

655
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,310
I'll call you every day.

656
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:51,320
You have to find out if it's real or not and give me the balance right away.

657
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:56,710
Why hasn't Go Bok Sil called yet? Giving me this unfinished business feel...

658
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,340
Joong Won!

659
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,170
- Leave it there.
- Yes, yes.

660
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,550
Why herbal medicine, all of a sudden?

661
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:12,800
- Where did you find such precious ginseng?
- What?

662
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,050
I took the ginseng in the fridge and

663
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,290
I went to the market with Mom.

664
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:20,200
Aigoo.

665
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,980
Why did you take it without my permission and...

666
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,510
I got $5000!

667
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:32,880
The herbalists were drooling all over it saying it was shaped so nicely.

668
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:38,460
You and Dad don't react well to it. So, I sold it right away. I got some other herbal medicine for you with it.

669
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,930
I can use the rest of the money as my spending money, right?

670
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,190
Here.

671
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,020
I can't sleep.

672
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:55,340
Talk to me about Louis.

673
00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:00,570
My precious Louis... how was his sleeping habit?

674
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:05,140
He had sensitive skin, so...

675
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:09,560
He liked to sleep under blankets made of MicroModal which is environmentally friendly natural fabric.

676
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,530
It was light and soft like silk.

677
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:16,230
He said he couldn't sleep unless he had that blanket.

678
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:19,820
He always slept with his feet tucked in snugly.

679
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:23,950
He liked feeling the soft texture of the blanket on his feet.

680
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,980
On rainy nights,

681
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,080
he kept opening the window wanting to see the rain come down.

682
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,840
I had to watch him at all times.

683
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,290
I'm sure he's resting in peace at a very nice place.
