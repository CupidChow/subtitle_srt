1
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,900
Bok Sil, don't be sick.

8
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,610
Grandma, I'm scared.

9
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,930
It'll be okay.

10
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,470
Bok Sil's grandmother! Bok Sil's grandmother!

11
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,870
Bok Sil's grandmother!

12
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,190
Sang Gi!

13
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,980
Bok Sil's dad! Aigoo, my son!

♬  Hello ♬

22
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,050
On the night that I was so afraid,

23
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,540
Louis protected me.

24
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:07,880
Episode 5
Starry, Starry Night

25
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,550
♬  Hello ♬

26
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,220
Go Bok Sil, are you sick?

27
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,100
Don't be bothersome and faint like last time. Just go home and rest if you're sick.

28
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,760
I took medicine, so I'm okay.

29
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,860
Are you really sick?

30
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,990
Go home right now! Don't get on my nerves! Quickly!

31
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,800
The person who died in the accident is not Louis.

32
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,340
What?

33
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,290
Hello.

34
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,950
You're the president, right?

35
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,310
Hey.

36
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,170
Bok Sil!

37
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,360
Why did you come to work when you're sick?

38
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,840
- Who is she?
- A country hen bumpkin.

39
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,180
That janitor Headquarters Director Cha scouted for the Product Planning Department?

40
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,170
Come here. Let me introduce you to someone.

41
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,590
Please treat our Bok Sil well.

42
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,120
I am so sorry. He's not very quick on the uptake...
Hey!

43
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,270
What are you doing to the highest ranking person in our company?

44
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,080
I know that. I saw him on TV. He's going to become the Chairman.

45
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,370
I am so sorry. Then, Goodbye.

46
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,160
Goodbye, President!

47
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,430
Please take care of Bok Sil!

48
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,220
What?!

49
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,070
I need to meet you right away.

50
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,460
Why did you come all the way here?

51
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,840
I was going to bring you porridge. But why did you leave so early?

52
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,340
The headquarters director must not like seeing sick people. He told me to leave right away.

53
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,970
Wow. He's such a meanie.

54
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,370
Let's hurry and go home together. Come.

55
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,370
Bok Sil?

56
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,670
Oh, Sunbaenim.

57
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,610
Who?

58
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,460
Oh, ummm...

59
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,180
I'm her guardian.

60
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,510
Let's go.

61
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,390
Wow...

62
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,290
Big news! Big news! Big news!

63
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,920
- Big news! Big news!
- Why?

64
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,890
Go Bok Sil!

65
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,350
She must be dating.

66
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,500
I saw with my own two eyes that she was holding hands with a man at the company cafe.

67
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,030
And the man is super handsome.

68
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,170
Omo, see?!

69
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,630
I told you there is always time to date, even when you're busy.

70
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,690
Bok Sil is more capable than I thought.

71
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,300
But, where on earth was Bok Sil going to and not working?

72
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,480
She left early because she was sick.

73
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,730
I guess she has strength to date even when she's sick.

74
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,120
He must have come to pick her up because she was sick. By chance, do they live together?

75
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,180
Louis, that bastard, appeared before me.

76
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,290
But he was a little weird. He didn't seem to recognize me at all.

77
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,840
What?

78
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,300
She has a connection with Louis, so quietly keep a watch on her.

79
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,880
After Louis's funeral, Cha Joong Won hired that woman

80
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,950
to be part of the Goldline Product Planning Department.

81
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,570
I am hiring her temporarily for one month.

82
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,390
There was a reason why he placed in that position a strange girl

83
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,000
without any qualifications.

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,250
Find out the detailed connections and report to me.

85
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,750
Okay.

86
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,160
Go Bok Sil...

87
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,090
Is it tiring?

88
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,070
No.

89
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,730
Get on my back.

90
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,150
Are you crazy? Get up.

91
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,060
Hurry.

92
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,760
I'm heavy, right?

93
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,750
- Of course.
- Hey,

94
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,380
- Put me down.
- I don't want to.

95
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,800
It feels strangely nice. I've never had this feeling before.

96
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,730
What are you talking about?

97
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,810
My body feels heavy and tired, but my heart feels warm.

98
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,020
Hey.

99
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,330
Do you see how messy this is?

100
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,490
I wanted to go to you right away, so I forgot to clean up the room.

101
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,100
Let's eat this for now.

102
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,420
- Let's clean first.
- Let's eat this first!

103
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,100
- Let's clean first!
- Eat first, then clean. Come here.

104
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,140
- Let's eat after we clean.
- Let's eat first!

105
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,510
Let's eat after we clean. After we clean.

106
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,460
Eat then clean. Eat then clean.

107
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,820
- Hey! What should we do?
- Hot!

108
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,850
What should we do?

109
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,380
What should we do?

110
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,630
You bast...

111
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,210
Why is she kicking me out...

112
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,060
Did someone come?

113
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,240
That scary guy. The headquarters director.

114
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,740
That ginseng benefactor, that headquarters director? Mom, do you know him by any chance?

115
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,350
He's the one that paid for Bok Sil's hospital fee when she fainted, even for the VIP room.

116
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,980
Bok Sil fainted?!

117
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,580
You didn't even know about that?

118
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,640
Of course, you're too self-absorbed to know how you're sucking the marrow out of Bok Sil's life.

119
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,580
But why did that person come all the way here?

120
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,770
Perhaps... Did he come to visit Bok Sil because she's sick?

121
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,920
Cha Joong Won just went into the house Louis and Go Bok Sil live in.

122
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,510
Just as you said, the three of them definitely have a connection.

123
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,140
Cha Joong Won, what are you up to?

124
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,790
Sit down. I was really sick, so I couldn't clean up.

125
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,230
But what brings you to my house?

126
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,980
Who is that guy? Just now he had his pants off...

127
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,540
and was only wearing his underwear. Who is that bastard?

128
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,840
Are you guys living together, by any chance??

129
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,260
Yes.

130
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,350
Don't you think the director likes Bok Sil?

131
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,640
Now that I think about it, the high medical bill...

132
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,920
- Ginseng price...
- And coming to visit her when she's sick?

133
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,050
Hey! There's definitely something!

134
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,000
No! What do you mean there's something? She's just getting scolded by him all the time.

135
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,350
Who cares? He's giving her money and looking after Bok Sil.

136
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,350
He's way better than you, Louis.

137
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,120
Right.

138
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,960
Maybe she'll be able to upgrade her lifestyle.

139
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,920
- Hey.
- You!

140
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,560
What are you doing to my son?

141
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,660
So that bastard was a homeless person who lost his memory,

142
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,500
but he was wearing the clothes of your brother who ran away, so you brought him here?

143
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,710
Go Bok Sil, are you crazy?

144
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,220
Look at how you are living! Bringing that guy and keeping him here in your situation

145
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,460
is going way overboard!

146
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,340
Then, should I leave him on the street when he has nowhere else to go?

147
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,790
You can't do that as a human being.

148
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,090
Until when are you going to keep him?

149
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,580
- Until I find my Bok Nam.
- What if you can't find your younger brother?

150
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,740
Why are you saying such a scary thing?

151
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,860
No, what I'm trying to say is, when you don't even know when you're going to find him,

152
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,360
it doesn't make sense that a man and a woman over twenty years of age are living together in the same room.

153
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,110
Why doesn't it make sense?

154
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,190
It's the same as two rooms if we close the curtains like this.

155
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,300
How is this two?!

156
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,930
He's not a bad guy. He's actually nice.

157
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,810
I don't know how he got into that situation, but he's a pitiful kid.

158
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,260
Pitiful? You're not Buddha so why pity him?

159
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,830
Ah, that's so refreshing. Buy me another cup.

160
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,530
I'll buy it after we're finished talking first.

161
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:29,300
You... Live with me.

162
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,510
- What?
- Move into my house right away.

163
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,780
I don't want to. I'm going to live with Bok Sil.

164
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,640
Ajussi, do you like me by any chance?

165
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,460
I'm sorry, but you're not my style.

166
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,340
- It's not like that!
- If it's not like that, just leave now.

167
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,950
I couldn't sleep at all, so I'm dead tired.

168
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,410
What was he doing instead of sleeping?

169
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,510
Goodbye.

170
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,980
Wait!

171
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,030
I didn't want to go to this extent,

172
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,200
but my house is 58 pyong (Korean area measurement; approx. 2100 sq ft) and has 3 bedrooms.

173
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,100
I will give you a room with a separate bathroom.

174
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,520
Of course, the food inside the refrigerator is all free.

175
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,330
Are you showing off right now that you have a nice house?

176
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,460
You're the worst.

177
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,550
Th-That.

178
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,150
He seems strangely familiar. Where else

179
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,580
have I seen him other than work?

180
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,560
My precious, did you sleep well?

181
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,310
Should I change the frame to gold?

182
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,920
This doesn't seem to do justice to our Louis's beauty, right?

183
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,090
I will find out about the best quality gold frame right away.

184
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,370
Isn't that too old fashioned?

185
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,660
I think white gold with finely studded diamonds would suit the young master's face more.

186
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,400
Right. For our white jade-like Louis,

187
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,520
diamonds are perfect.

188
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,760
Butler Kim,

189
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,950
how about taking a walk along the beach with me?

190
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,320
I-I-I'm fine.

191
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,360
I told you to not interfere.

192
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,590
Y-You said not to meddle with the chairwoman's meals only—

193
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,530
You're driving me crazy.

194
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,850
If I tell you one thing, can't you understand the general idea?

195
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,200
You're extremely stupid!

196
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,120
I'm a man who graduated from Seoul National University.

197
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,440
Are you looking down on me for not having enough education?

198
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,740
N-No that's not it. Not at all.

199
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,450
If that's not it...

200
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,540
Then, you're showing off for having studied a lot.

201
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,090
A-Ah, that's not it!

202
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,820
Just hit me. Whatever I say, you're still going to hit me anyway.

203
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,150
♬  There's a nail in the door and there's glass on the lawn.  ♬

204
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,990
♬  Tacks on the floor and the TV is on.  ♬

205
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,430
♬  And I always sleep with my guns when you are gone.  ♬

206
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,680
He offered to live with you?

207
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,010
That's what he said. Does he like me that much?

208
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,890
Crazy... I've never seen another guy with such an innocent brain.

209
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,550
Think of what his true intentions are.

210
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,800
How can you think you're the center of the world every single time?

211
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,130
Do you want me to give you a different interpretation of the headquarters director's offer to live with you?

212
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,260
He's telling you to get out of Bok Sil's room immediately.

213
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,020
- What?
- The director likes Bok Sil 100%.

214
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,170
- What did you say?
- If the girl one likes

215
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,220
is living with another man, who wouldn't he be concerned?

216
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,910
He would rather have you live with him and cut your relations with her, you idiot.

217
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,730
I'm not going to separate from Bok Sil though.

218
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,910
What kind of sin has Bok Sil committed in her past life?

219
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,200
Her fate is just...

220
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,730
Oppa will come and get you one of these days, so just wait a little bit.

221
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,900
Come quickly. I think I'm going to be sold soon.

222
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,990
No, you need to come to me. You got it?

223
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,430
- Is that thing talking to you again?
- Yeah.

224
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,790
- Isn't it pretty?
- Then, introduce me to it.

225
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,540
You're not in your right mind.

226
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,760
Bye!

227
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,910
Aigoo, what kind of human threw away their cigarette butts here? Just wait until I catch you,

228
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,020
I'll just... Look at this and this.

229
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,480
- Ma'am, would you like to subscribe to a newspaper?
- I don't want to.

230
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,220
I saw that a new person moved in to the rooftop room.

231
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,840
Please introduce them to me. I'll just give this to you.

232
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,510
I don't like newspapers.

233
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,860
Don't be like that and introduce them to me.

234
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,530
What is this?

235
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,480
- Amnesia?
- Around the time of the funeral,

236
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,750
Go Bok Sil moved into the rooftop room with Louis.

237
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,230
And Cha Joong Won

238
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,400
hired her into the product planning department.

239
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,570
And he has been in and out of the house the two live in.

240
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,050
Then whose body was found at the accident?

241
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,340
Should I investigate?

242
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,310
No, it's fine. Don't poke around and make things more complicated for no reason.

243
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,300
What should we do with Louis? His memory could come back

244
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,420
and Cha Joong Won might do something.

245
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,520
- How is this?
- It's pretty.

246
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,680
How can you say all of them are pretty? Pick one out for me.

247
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,330
Should I ask at the Shalala Stylist Talk Talk for Madams?

248
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,000
- What's that?
- The most popular discussion website about hot issues among madams these days.

249
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,130
Forget it. How could you mention ahjumma style clothes?

250
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,650
Don't look down on it! An amazing stylist just came in a while ago.

251
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,920
I'll have to wear this then.

252
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,470
Are you going on a business trip to Busan or going for a fashion show?

253
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,750
I'm going with the headquarters director.

254
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,200
The two of you?

255
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,710
He'll have to fall for me.

256
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,100
Bok Sil, your headquarters director said

257
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,770
I should go live with him.

258
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,140
What?!

259
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:34,860
According to Hyung In Seong, it's because the director likes you. Do you think it's true?

260
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,630
What kind of nonsense is that?

261
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,040
Even though he likes you, you can't like him back.

262
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,090
Why not?

263
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,670
Then I think I'll be sad.

264
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,670
Well, I can't make the person who protected me sad.

265
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,430
You protected me last night.

266
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:13,420
The scariest thing in this world for me is thunder and lightning.

267
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,820
On the day of thunder, lightning and rain,

268
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,790
there was a landslide that killed my parents...

269
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,390
in front of my eyes.

270
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,220
Is that when it started?

271
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:35,010
On days of thunder and lightning, I'm so scared, I can't sleep.

272
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,460
I get sick for no reason.

273
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,350
Don't get sick, Bok Sil.

274
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,660
I'm all better now. Don't worry.

275
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,860
Bok Nam is the only family who is left to me and you're the chance I have to find him.

276
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,390
That's right. I will definitely find Bok Nam for you. Just trust me.

277
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,220
When we save up some money, let's visit the hospital.

278
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,610
And get some "Chong Myeong Tang" (herbal medicine that makes you smarter).

279
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,390
Go to sleep!

280
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,500
♬ Find The Way I want to know, let me know ♬

281
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:30,720
♬ These tears like paint spreading ♬

282
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:36,430
♬ Is there an end Perhaps ♬

283
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:59,970
A woman and man over 20 years of age in one room...

284
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,700
They can't do that. What should I do?

285
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,830
Good morning!

286
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,320
Are you here? You are so pretty!

287
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Hello!

288
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,540
Bok Sil, who was that man from yesterday?

289
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,550
He's hot. Is he your boyfriend?

290
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,960
No he's not.

291
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,780
What do you mean he's not? You guys were holding hands!

292
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,720
Hands!

293
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,680
Go Bok Sil.

294
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,810
The business trip to Busan... You're going too.

295
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,410
What?

296
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,350
I will help the small lost one (practicing English)

297
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,480
Bok Sil: I'm going on a business trip to Busan.

298
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,480
I won't be able to go home today, so buy and eat kimbap.

299
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,040
With whom?

300
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,350
The headquarters director and team leader.

301
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,760
Hyung! Hyung In Seong,

302
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,650
Bok Sil says she's going on an overnight business trip to Busan with the headquarters director.

303
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,460
Hey, isn't that a date on the pretext of going on a business trip?

304
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,160
What?

305
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,320
Let's go to Busan.

306
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,670
N-No, but it's really far.

307
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,410
Louis.

308
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,680
- Did you get train tickets?
- What? No.

309
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,120
You have to get tickets.

310
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,350
I don't know. Let's just go for now.

311
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,450
No, no, you can't. Busan is too far away.

312
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,270
Ah, I don't know, just come with me!

313
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,760
What?

314
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,420
I got it.

315
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,220
Ma Ri is going on a business trip to Busan tomorrow with Headquarters Director Cha.

316
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,680
No way. Are they going to meet Mother?

317
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,150
It's so cool!

318
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,520
Is this the first time you're seeing the sea?

319
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,260
Yes.

320
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,650
Then enjoy the view.

321
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:16,420
Go Bok Sil, there's a sea park right in front of this place. Look around and wait for us over there.

322
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,840
Yes!

323
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,160
She can't participate anyway. Why did you bring her?

324
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,740
Don't worry about me.

325
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,020
I need to buy a bigger one.

326
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,890
So why did you fall down on your own?

327
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:07,530
♬ There's a nail in the door and there's glass on the lawn ♬

328
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:12,150
♬  Tacks on the floor and the TV is on.  ♬

329
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,500
♬  I always sleep with my guns...  ♬

330
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,440
Thank you.

331
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,930
Also, I don't hit people anymore.

332
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,170
Why are you overreacting and embarrassing me?

333
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,470
I'll be escorting the chairwoman on a walk.

334
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,650
Wow!

335
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,760
Where are you?

336
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,690
- It's the ocean!
- I'm at the ocean!

337
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,390
The ocean?

338
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,370
But the ocean is so big! Where near the ocean?

339
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,020
Um, Grandmother,

340
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,540
where is this place?

341
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,540
- It's Dongbaek (Camellia) Island.
- This is Dongbaek Island.

342
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,790
I'll be there soon, so wait for me right there.

343
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,890
Where is she?

344
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,440
She's at some island.

345
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,560
What is this? Does that mean he came to Busan?

346
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,170
A friend must have come to visit you.

347
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,380
Yes, it's a kid possessed by a money-spending ghost.

348
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,070
It seems your friend really likes shopping.

349
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,670
I told him to peel garlic, but he teared up so he bought goggles,

350
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,070
and his shoulders hurt so he bought a massager. He is a hopeless kid.

351
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,740
Even so, he didn't run away because he didn't want to peel them,

352
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,010
but made purchases that reflected his efforts to accomplish the job given to him somehow.

353
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:52,080
My grandson was a child whose only friend was shopping.

354
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,400
I miss my precious.

355
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,850
Did your grandson go somewhere?

356
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,970
I sent him far away so he may live a long, happy life.

357
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,710
But he actually went off to a far away place.

358
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,630
This is just the young master's style.

359
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,550
This is just my style.

360
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,530
I want to buy it ten thousand times, but I'll refrain from it. - Shopping King Louis.

361
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,410
Shopping King Louis again?

362
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,870
I want to buy it ten thousand times, but ...

363
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,400
Ten thousand times?

364
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,630
You told me at least ten thousand times...
You told me at least ten thousand times...

365
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,170
It could really be the young master!

366
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,590
President Baek Seon Gu

367
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,550
Did Mother go somewhere? She's not answering the phone.

368
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,340
Butler Heo escorted her on a walk toward Eastern Hotel.

369
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,940
I got it.

370
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:09,840
Ma Ri is going on a business trip to Busan tomorrow. With Headquarters Director Cha.

371
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,550
Where in Busan?

372
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,130
I think she said it was the Eastern Hotel.

373
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,370
Go to the Eastern Hotel.

374
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,170
The audio frequency of his voice was different from his usual one.

375
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,920
Shopping King Louis...

376
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,670
I think I'm going to barf.

377
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,790
This place is weirdly familiar.

378
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:42,350
Really? We should have dragged the "thinking chair" here.

379
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,450
Is there anything you remember?

380
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,630
Are we still far away?

381
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,850
All we have to do is go up here.

382
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,300
I shouldn't have come.

383
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,100
Mother!

384
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,180
And who is this?

385
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,440
What are you doing here at this time?

386
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,520
That's because I wanted to see you, Mother.

387
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,040
Hello.

388
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,510
Mother, do you know this lady?

389
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,250
Thank you for having a conversation with me.

390
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,290
Have a good time with that money-spending ghost friend of yours.

391
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,050
Okay.

392
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,390
Mother.

393
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:41,600
- Bok Sil!
- Louis?

394
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,190
No, do you miss Louis again?

395
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,250
No, wait a moment.

396
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,840
Mother. Do you know that Ma Ri and Headquarters Director Cha are here?

397
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,940
Oh, Ma Ri is here?

398
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,370
Yes. Let's eat together.

399
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,290
No way! Did you chase me here so I could make you food?

400
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,250
No, I came because I was worried.

401
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:07,970
Worry about yourself. What money did you have to come all the way down here?

402
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,930
I lent the money to him.

403
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,430
I heard you were with the director. How could I not come?

404
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,770
- I won't stand for it if you make food for another man.
- What?

405
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,150
Hey. Is that a confession or an oppression?

406
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,170
Ah, I'm hungry! Give me food.

407
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,950
Geez, that beggar bastard. Let's go.

408
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,780
Aigoo.

409
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,470
- By any chance... Shalala Stylist Talk Talk?
- By any chance... Shalala Stylist Talk Talk?

410
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,560
I guess you two are very close.

411
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,340
We met for the first time today.

412
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:08,570
How did you get to know about Shalala Stylist Talk Talk for Madams?

413
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,950
My son recommended it to me.

414
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:17,320
Our son has a lot of fashion sense.

415
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,690
Meeting like this seems a kind of fate too. Should we become chatting friends?

416
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,600
Should we?

417
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,140
Location Sponsored by Sooyoung-gu, Busan

418
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,140
Where are you?

419
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,460
I'm playing around after eating, so don't worry.

420
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,810
Is there an urgent matter?

421
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,500
No.

422
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,980
It's been a while since you saw Director Cha as well, right, Mother?

423
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,390
It's the first time since Louis's funeral.

424
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,340
Have you been well?

425
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,880
Yes, Chairwoman.

426
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,800
Here. Accept a shot from me.

427
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,690
Drink up. You're going to sleep here tonight and then go back up to Seoul anyway.

428
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,960
Yes.

429
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,720
That's right. Finish it and give me one too.

430
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,410
Yes.

431
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,000
Mother, Sunnyland will open soon.

432
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,620
Is it that time already?

433
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,720
If our Louis were here, he would have loved the place.

434
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:47,010
I didn't say it before, but it was actually my Louis's idea.

435
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,860
Headquarters Director Cha.

436
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,890
Huh? Aigoo, I guess he has low alcohol tolerance.

437
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,420
After telling Headquarters Director Cha to keep this a secret,

438
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,480
I guess I'm the one spilling it in the end.

439
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,400
Aigoo, let's eat before this senior's words get even longer.

440
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,200
Chairwoman.

441
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,550
Aigoo, Butler Kim. Why are you here all of a sudden?

442
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,600
I have found "Shopping King Louis" on the internet.

443
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,640
What? Shopping King Louis? Isn't that Ji Sung?

444
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,990
From the comments, I can definitely smell the young master.

445
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,760
- Perhaps--
- Do you think Louis might be alive?

446
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,670
Don't speak nonsense. Do you have to bring out the topic of the late Louis in front of the chairwoman, who is having a hard time already?

447
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,330
I was just saying that there was a chance—

448
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,990
There was already talk about Shopping King Louis in our team.

449
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:43,400
Someone by the ID of Shopping King Louis continues to leave comments that are akin to acts of terrorism,

450
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,270
so we are about to take measures soon.

451
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,480
But out of all names—

452
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,140
Mother. The food is getting cold. You should eat now.

453
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,450
I like you a lot, Butler Heo.

454
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:14,340
After dedicating 15 years to the chairwoman, you're the right hand woman of Choi Il Soon.

455
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,550
It's nothing.

456
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,840
The biggest problem right now is the returned Butler Kim.

457
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,270
You saw earlier.

458
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:27,500
He made chairwoman upset again by bringing up Louis, who passed away.

459
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,770
It makes me concerned that such a person is lingering around the chairwoman.

460
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,900
To be honest, I was also a bit—

461
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:39,680
Right? See how similarly people think?

462
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,610
So I'm saying...

463
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,390
Why did Dad have to give a drink to the director?

464
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,250
Go Bok Sil

465
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,310
Yes, hello?

466
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,400
Isn't this Director Cha Joong Won's phone?

467
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,630
Bok Sil? This is Baek Ma Ri.

468
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,470
Team Leader! Has the director gone somewhere?

469
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,000
He's working.

470
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,200
Still? Should I come over there?

471
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,550
No. Don't come.

472
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,810
What help would you be, Bok Sil?

473
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,640
Just go back to Seoul.

474
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,240
Why did he bring Go Bok Sil?

475
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,660
Director.

476
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,530
Director. Please try waking up.

477
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,130
Ah, really.

478
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,770
Why are they sleeping here instead of their rooms?

479
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,660
Wow.

480
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,500
Omo.

481
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,240
Wow!

482
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,440
- Bok Sil, buy me one of these.
- Can we have three, please?

483
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,690
Ah, this is just my style.

484
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,890
Isn't this cute?

485
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,120
Oh! Carp! Carp!

486
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,600
- Wow.
- Woah.

487
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,070
The prawns resemble tigers.

488
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,410
Right? So they are called lion shrimp.

489
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,050
Tiger (in Korean) is tiger (in English).

490
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,610
Idiot.

491
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,800
Hey, Louis. You don't know what this is, do you?

492
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,590
It's a baby octopus.

493
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:58,730
♬ And I Need a Navigation Takes Me Where  ♬

494
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,210
Wow, it's really pretty!
♬ And I Need a Navigation Takes Me Where  ♬

495
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:05,010
- Hey, as a souvenir, let's take a picture.
- Okay.

496
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,580
One, two, three. One two, three.

497
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,620
- You two, take one together.
- Okay.

498
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,380
Hey, what are you doing, looking so awkward? Get closer together.

499
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,370
Hurry! Just a little more.

500
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:21,070
That's right, affectionately!

501
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,940
One, two, three. One, two, three.

502
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,140
That bridge is quite pretty.

503
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,340
How can it be so long and sparkly?

504
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,480
That is the Great Gwangan Bridge.

505
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,970
How come you don't even know these kinds of things, Bok Sil?

506
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,280
Oh, that's what it was.

507
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,480
Louis, have you ever seen the sea before?

508
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,510
♬ Starry, starry night  ♬

509
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,600
Oh, sorry. You don't remember, right?

510
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,390
♬ Out on a summer's day  ♬

511
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,290
Of course I've seen it before.

512
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:11,850
This place especially feels familiar to me.

513
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,020
♬ Sketch the trees and the daffodils  ♬

514
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,700
Don't you think you've lived here before? (in Busan dialect)

515
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,770
I lived in Busan?  (in Busan dialect)

516
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,750
But then why was I sprawled out sleeping on the streets of Seoul?  (in Busan dialect)

517
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:30,340
This fella, from what's popping out of your snout, it's really suspicious! (in Busan dialect)

518
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,040
What are you two doing?

519
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,440
- Maybe he really lived in Busan?!
- Huh?

520
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,860
Hey, pull out that memory notebook!

521
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,950
- Write it down quickly.
- Oh, okay.

522
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,440
Wow.

523
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,490
♬ I have tried to set them free  ♬

524
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:48,780
Busan
♬ They would never say they did not know how ♬

525
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,660
Hey, following Bok Sil all the way here, we gained at least one thing, right?

526
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,480
Yeah.

527
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,320
Oh, so you've seen the sea before.

528
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,150
This is the first time I've seen it.

529
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,470
I love sitting here and feeling the wind.

530
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:10,310
The wind smells like the sea. Salty too.

531
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:14,990
♬  Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue  ♬

532
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:18,840
Then should we sleep here today? So Bok Sil can keep looking at the ocean?

533
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,180
You sleep here. I don't want to get a crooked mouth from the chill.

534
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,780
I'm going to go to the rest room. So don't move an inch and stay here until I come back.

535
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,970
Okay!

536
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,600
He's so mean.

537
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,100
Ji Sung!

538
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,530
One, two, three!

539
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,910
Louis!

540
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,010
Louis!

541
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,960
Louis!

542
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:13,810
Throw, catch!
Gobosi, Gobosi!

543
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,500
Louis!

544
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,300
I'm scared. So scared.

545
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,960
Louis! Wake up!

546
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,480
Are you okay? Get up!

547
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,630
Louis!

548
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,120
Louis...

549
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,210
Are you okay?

550
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,040
Are you okay?

551
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,920
You got sand all over your face.

552
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:18,210
♬ One sunny day it's fine day ♬

553
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,980
What's wrong with you? You scared me.

554
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,010
♬  Where am I  ♬

555
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,770
You're okay.

556
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:38,950
♬  It's dark, I can't see you  ♬

557
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:45,880
Bok Sil lit up my dark and scary night.

558
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:53,390
♬  When I was hesitant instead  ♬

559
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,440
Let me see you.

560
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,090
♬ I call you. ♬

561
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:06,560
♬ Hey you, hey you, hey you. ♬

562
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,910
What's going on from early in the morning, Bok Sil?

563
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,300
If you have something to say, hurry and say it. We're busy.

564
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,870
I will give my presentation that I couldn't give the last time.

565
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:43,580
Busan at night, that I saw for the first time, was very beautiful.

566
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:49,790
The sparkling city and the night ocean were just mesmerizing.

567
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:55,510
I was deeply moved and I've come to plan a tour product themed around those feelings.

568
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,090
Starry Starry Busan

569
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:02,250
This is an all-nighter product that includes round trip KTX tickets and a night-scape tour bus ride,

570
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,530
which I recommend not only to lovers, friends, and families

571
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:09,940
but also to any customers who just want to go see the night ocean alone.

572
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:15,650
When you're depressed or feeling frustrated, I think you'll feel energized if you look out to the cool, night ocean.

573
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,240
Haven't you checked other competing sites?

574
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,960
There is a Busan Nightscape tour product at Wimon, already.

575
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,350
Team Leader Baek is right.

576
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,820
Wimon has already been selling a similar product since last year.

577
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,130
But Go Bok Sil's approach to the plan is different.

578
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,380
It is based on a story and sensibility.

579
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:45,440
Rather than trying to pass on as much information as possible to buyers,

580
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,990
she went a step further and mulled over what kind of sensibility would appeal to them.

581
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:53,130
She's recommending night-scape tours of the ocean to heal the depression and frustrations of people living in this era.

582
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,440
I'm sure she didn't plan this product with that in mind,

583
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,100
but I give high points for her latent talent to come up with that idea.

584
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:06,870
She's got today's trend right that is based on sensibility and that seeks out good stories and healing power.

585
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,870
Go Bok Sil, good job.

586
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,750
Oh, yeah...

587
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:24,800
I've decided to extend her temporary employment from one month to a year.

588
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,170
Director!

589
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,660
An extension of her contract over a mere proposal like this?

590
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,200
Aren't you being too rash?

591
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,210
Go Bok Sil has got that sense that can fill even a water bottle with a story.

592
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:44,840
You know that as well, don't you, Team Leader Baek?

593
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,410
Go Bok Sil...

594
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,010
Go Bok Sil has made it.

595
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,720
She couldn't handle computer or internet and I thought, "What kind of person is this?"

596
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,770
But she got her contract extended within a month. Isn't this unbelievable?

597
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,370
But the director isn't entirely wrong.

598
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,540
Actually, Go Bok Sil's presentation earlier... It was quite good.

599
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,860
- Right?
- Yeah.

600
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:17,620
I guess, from cleaning the office to organizing files, keeping conference logs and running chores, she has done all sorts of miscellaneous jobs for us.

601
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,460
If Go Bok Sil were to be laid off, it would be inconvenient for us, right?

602
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,930
That's what I'm saying.

603
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,500
This is a win-win for everyone. Let's accept it coolly.

604
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,880
- Okay!
- Okay!

605
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,740
Then, is Go Bok Sil becoming the director's protege now?

606
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,710
Director, thank you.

607
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,000
I had no idea my contract would be extended.

608
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,500
No need to thank me. You did it on your own.

609
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,660
Work hard for a year and get hired as a full timer next year.

610
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,270
- Challenge yourself.
- Okay!

611
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,020
Nice style.

612
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:55,390
Thank you. I'll work harder from now on.

613
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,420
Louis!

614
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,980
Louis!

615
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:04,470
- Bok Sil!
- Louis, my contract got extended!

616
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:05,890
What?

617
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,410
My contract got extended.

618
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,400
What?

619
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,140
What did you say?

620
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,300
I didn't get fired. My contract got extended.

621
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,630
Really?

622
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,790
Wow, that's great!

623
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,840
It's been extended for a year!

624
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,830
Those kids, public displays of affection for the whole neighborhood to see!

625
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,310
Hey!

626
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,830
You shouldn't do that! You should maintain your innocence.

627
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,490
Oppa! My contract got extended.

628
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:45,290
Really? Go Bok Sil, you're awesome!

629
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,370
Really congratulations! You're the best!

630
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,160
Bok Sil is the best!

631
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,210
Cheers!

632
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,380
Cheers!

633
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,250
Bok Sil, I'm so proud of you.

634
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,770
How could you get this in one try when I couldn't even after ten years?

635
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:04,440
It's all thanks to you and Louis. Eat a lot.

636
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,180
You don't have to tell me. I'll eat a lot of my own free will. You eat a lot, too.

637
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,170
Is it good?

638
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,400
Oh, hot...

639
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,980
It melts in my mouth.

640
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,280
Bok Sil.

641
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,910
What's wrong?

642
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,630
Oh, nothing.

643
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,830
Here. Eat a lot.

644
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:31,720
It's so good.

645
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,430
Oh, yeah! I got a credit card.

646
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:38,020
We finally have a credit card?

647
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,740
It's not yours. It's Bok Sil's.

648
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,930
Bok Sil, keep this safely.

649
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,770
Okay.

650
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,750
Are you practicing Seoul dialect?

651
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,810
My special tutoring is not cheap.

652
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:51,940
- I'm doing it free especially for you.
- Thank you.

653
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:55,620
Let me test you then. Order more meat.

654
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:03,410
Aunt! Could we have three more servings of meat, two Sprites and some more lettuce, please?

655
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:07,240
That's right! Sil, Sil, Bok Sil!

656
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,790
How can you learn ten things when I teach you one?

657
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,460
There's nothing Bok Sil can't do.

658
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:17,310
Anyway, you should fix your hair. It's too unfashionable.

659
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:20,970
Since you're a contract employee now, you should look like a career woman.

660
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:23,070
Hyung, I should do my hair, too, huh?

661
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,300
You should've done it a long time ago.

662
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,170
Noona!

663
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,880
You have to make their hair stylish.

664
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,510
Hello.

665
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,740
- What's your name?
- Go Bok Sil.

666
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,040
Go Bok Sil?

667
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:42,940
Noona is the only name-matching hair style specialist in Korea.

668
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,040
What's your name?

669
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,970
-Louis.
- L-Louis.

670
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,850
L-LL-Louis, huh?

671
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:52,730
Noona, it's buy two get one free so I'll be the one free.

672
00:49:55,090 --> 00:50:00,340
Whoa.

673
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,530
Noona, does this match my name?

674
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,090
It's perfect for your name!

675
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:07,510
But I'm "Jo In Seong"! (a handsome Korean actor's name)

676
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,080
Louis

677
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,170
Go Bok Sil

678
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,450
Stop right there! Come back!

679
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:18,960
Hey! Pay!

680
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,870
100,000 won! ($100)

681
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,680
Scared me.

682
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,370
It's ice cream. Share with the other cops.

683
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,790
Hey, did something happen to you guys?

684
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:37,360
My contract with Goldline got extended.

685
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:42,090
That's a great thing then.

686
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:45,290
But what's wrong with your hair?

687
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,440
What do you mean? Is it weird?

688
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,970
Yeah, it's really weird.

689
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:53,180
Oh... It's an expensive hairstyle.

690
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,810
Yes, I'm outside.

691
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,670
I'm sorry, but I haven't found him yet.

692
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:04,690
Yes.

693
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,570
Here's the hammer.

694
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:40,160
- You're home?
- Yeah.

695
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:46,490
Hey, what's wrong with your hair!

696
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,690
It looks terrible! Your good looks are totally ruined.

697
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:49,670
Really?

698
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:53,160
But you do look younger.

699
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,380
- Did you hang out with Louis again?
- Yeah.

700
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,040
Stop hanging around him.

701
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,580
You have a perfectly good job. Why hang out with a bum?

702
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,890
I feel sorry for him.

703
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:07,990
He has no memory. He shouldn't be friendless.

704
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:13,580
Oh, Mom. Do you know our company secured a stable client this time and is totally on firm ground now?
 Stable client = Go Bok Sil's extended contract

705
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:14,850
That's great!

706
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,560
That's good news.

707
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:23,460
But you know, you didn't tell them about the rooftop incident, did you?

708
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,090
Geez, you think I'm slow on the uptake like you, Mom?

709
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:31,240
Louis, that guy, is a character who will 100% run away as soon as he hears that story.

710
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Louis.

711
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:35,070
Watch your mouth.

712
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,180
Geez, act your age!

713
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,780
What, what, what?

714
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,800
Bok Sil?

715
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,740
Yes?

716
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:52,300
Did you get your hair done to celebrate your contract extension?

717
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,220
Yes.

718
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,840
Look at her taste...

719
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,520
Anyway, congratulations on becoming a contract employee and surviving.

720
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,090
Thank you.

721
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:06,740
But why are you congratulating me in a place like this?

722
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:11,780
- Bok Sil, you speak your mind more than I thought.
- What?

723
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,590
About Goldline Bottle... Did you tell the director that it was your idea?

724
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:18,230
I never did that.

725
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,300
Then did the bottle go tell him by itself?

726
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:24,740
How could the director know all the behind-the-scene details?

727
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:31,040
The only person I spoke to about the bottle is you.

728
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:36,670
You two have never been alone either?

729
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,290
You have. So, you let him know indirectly while you two were alone, right?

730
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,090
Oh, no...

731
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:52,310
He came over to my house a few days ago, so all we did was have some tea in my room.

732
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,830
What?

733
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,240
The director visited your house?

734
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,980
Yes.

735
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,110
Have you come?

736
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,850
Hello, Director.

737
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:10,780
Hello, Director.

738
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,780
Oppa's here. This one!

739
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,210
Your hairstyle changed today.

740
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,820
Yes, it's Louis 14th's hairstyle.

741
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:48,140
Here you go.

742
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:51,530
Do you want to pay in one lump sum or in installments?

743
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:53,480
What happens if pay by installments?

744
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,820
The amount is spread out and paid over the number of months.

745
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,140
If you want to pay over a 12-month period, you can pay 200,000 won ($200) a month.

746
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:04,950
Wow! There is such a great system?

747
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:07,910
Then, I'll do 24 months.

748
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:11,350
Customer, it's maximum 12 months.

749
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:14,610
Then do 12 months please.

750
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,810
Perfect!

751
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:27,170
12 months payment please. Give me another one of the same pair.

752
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,990
Perfect.

753
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,980
Good.

754
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:39,680
Cute!

755
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,200
This kid will clean up for us while we are jogging. Isn't it just perfect?

756
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,390
I got you a gift for extending your contract.

757
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,730
Perfect.

758
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:53,170
Seems like this bag was born just for you.

759
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:56,360
Do you know how many conversations I carried on with this kid?

760
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:02,110
So... how much?

761
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,190
2,400,000 won ($2,400).

762
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,500
Hey.

763
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:15,980
Are you crazy?!

764
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,530
I mean...

765
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,950
I got a 12-month payment plan. We just have to pay 200,000 won ($200) per month.

766
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:22,920
With what money?

767
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,000
Whether I pay 100,000 ($100)or 1 million won ($1,000)a month, it's money I owe.

768
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,560
How can I pay for a 2,400,000 won bag with my salary?

769
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,490
Take them all back and get a refund.

770
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:37,010
Before you do that, I won't let you in the house. Got it?

771
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,930
Bok Sil. I don't know how to get a refund.

772
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:50,100
I don't know either. You figure it out.

773
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:08,340
You may not understand, but they might have been necessary things for that friend.

774
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,750
People buy things with different values in mind.

775
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:19,940
If you look at what a person buys and the purchase pattern, you can understand that person.

776
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,630
They're all for me.

777
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,840
Who's the one paying for it though?

778
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,070
What a scare!

779
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:22,180
Customer, what brings you here today?

780
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,840
Well...

781
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:29,170
Can I get a refund?

782
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:45,950
My installment ceremony is right around the corner and Mother is going to transfer her company shares soon. Please hurry.

783
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,850
Yes.

784
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:51,080
I'll take care of it quickly.

785
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:55,000
Be wary of Headquarters Director Cha.

786
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:08,030
One, two, three, four. five.

787
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,500
Good job!

788
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,010
I had a really hard time. So praise me a little more.

789
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:20,310
If you hadn't used the card from the get-go, you wouldn't be having a hard time, like now.

790
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:23,840
You can't go around swiping the card like that just because you have it.

791
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,960
I wanted to buy you gifts.

792
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,810
I know.

793
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,320
How do you know?

794
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,780
Some grandma told me.

795
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:37,350
Wow... Whoever she is, I want to give her a piggyback ride.

796
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:42,700
Louis, can you take me to see a movie instead of giving me a gift?

797
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,480
I've never been to one.

798
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,890
I see...

799
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:49,100
I don't think I've ever been to one either.

800
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,630
Huh?

801
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:55,250
I'm from the mountains. Which star are you from?

802
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,010
Should I think about it?

803
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:04,100
Forget it, forget it. Come here. Let's undo your curls.

804
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:09,880
I was self-conscious because people kept laughing at me. Have you been inside my mind?

805
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:13,450
How you feel is how I feel.

806
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,410
I'll straighten your hair for you, Bok Sil.

807
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:18,250
Okay.

808
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,970
There...

809
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,320
Where are you? Hurry up!

810
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,360
We don't have much time left.

811
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,530
Do you miss me that badly?

812
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:46,150
Wait just a moment. I'll be right there.

813
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,260
Okay.

814
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,910
Give me this kind please.

815
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:52,490
Are they for your girlfriend?

816
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,140
A girl I'm living with.

817
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:57,210
Oh, my, you're married. You look so young.

818
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,950
I'm not married.

819
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:01,410
I see.

820
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:04,380
I'll make it pretty with lisianthus and spiraea flowers.

821
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,080
No, just give me one stem.

822
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,050
Oh yeah?

823
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:09,800
Not that one. The one next to it.

824
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,820
- This one?
- No.

825
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:15,430
Here you go.

826
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,650
- Is that right?
- Yes.

827
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:22,820
Goodbye.

828
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:32,290
Oh!
♬ I'm taking ♬

829
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:34,100
Yes! 100 won (10 cents)!
♬ a walk ♬

830
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:40,590
♬ in a calming silence ♬

831
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:46,310
♬ After the day passes ♬

832
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:55,020
♬ tomorrow comes, I can't remember. ♬
