00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,360
♬  One sunny day, it's fine day ♬

2
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,500
Bok Sil. I...

3
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,540
don't think I was the type of person that ate toast on the streets.

4
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,360
I don't think I ever ran while getting rained on before,

5
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,830
or walked while carrying something heavy,

6
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,300
or did the dishes.

7
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,440
Can I get a refund?
Especially, I don't think I was the type of person who would ever request refunds.

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,980
Bok Sil... Where did I come from?
[Episode 6 - I was born to love you]

9
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,800
We'll be leaving first.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,890
Please go home safely!

11
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,070
Bye, bye.

12
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,580
Excuse me, how do I get to CCT Movie Theatre from here?

13
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,160
Try using this map app.

14
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,200
Thank you.

15
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,380
Work hard.

16
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,880
The movies? With whom?

17
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,960
Go Bok Sil... you're really getting on my nerves.

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,650
You are near your destination, CCT Movie Theatre.

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,550
Aigoo, what is this?

20
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,550
Look here! If you hit someone, who should come out and check!

21
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,000
What are you doing in there right now? Come out. Come out quickly!

22
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,510
What is it? Don't we need to call 911?

23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,210
- Is he dead or alive?
- Is he breathing?

24
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,500
What to do...

25
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,400
Someone report this.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,700
Aigoo. Don't touch him.

27
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,480
Ji Sung...

28
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,830
Ji Sung.

29
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,650
Kang Ji Sung.

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,350
- What is this?
- He's alive.

31
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,510
Aigoo, such a relief.

32
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,570
Ah, drive properly.

33
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,260
What is this? What is this?

34
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,860
You have to compensate for the flower. Give me 3,000 Won. ($3 USD)

35
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,130
Don't you know me?

36
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,580
You? Of course, I do.

37
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,700
You're the one who startled me with your car and caused this mess! Ah.

38
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,220
Give me 3,000 Won. Do you know how hard I worked for that money?

39
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,740
I did the dishes, the dishes six times!

40
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,180
I earned that money. Give me 3,000 Won, now. Hurry.

41
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,370
Ah, I was going to give this to Bok Sil.

42
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,910
Here.

43
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,970
Oh, Ahjumma.

44
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,350
In all my 55 years, I've never seen a thieving bitch like you,

45
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,440
trying to pay off the victim with 3,000 Won after hitting him with a car?

46
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,870
A thieving bitch?

47
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,680
You, lie down like before. We need to trace the outline with white chalk. Hurry and lie down.

48
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,670
You're wearing designer clothes and driving an imported car, and yet you give 3,000 Won to someone you hit?

49
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,910
You can't even take an x-ray with 3,000 Won!

50
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,550
And he doesn't even have health insurance, so the cost will be astronomical.

51
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,040
Are you trying to call it a wash with the price of one dish of tteokbokki?

52
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,150
Ahjumma. I gave that person 3,000 Won because he asked for it!

53
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,670
What do you take me for, calling me a thief?

54
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,120
He's a kid missing a few marbles. How can you take what a dummy says at face value?

55
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,770
Don't you understand the situation here?

56
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,980
No! I'm not a dummy.

57
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,450
Be quiet! Lie down!

58
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,060
Usually, kids who lack don't know it themselves.

59
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,090
So, how much would you like?

60
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,050
Here. Take all of this.
₩ 2,003,000 ($2003.00)

61
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,110
Oh yeah!

62
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,470
This is like the lawyer's fees.

63
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,130
It was your lucky day, because I happened to pass by after my cleaning work at the movie theater.

64
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,150
What were you going to do alone?

65
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,930
Thank you.

66
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,860
Hey, but how can there be people walking around with $2000 cash in their wallets?

67
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,950
Well, she did seem rich.

68
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,580
I have a feeling that I, too, carried

69
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,790
that sum of money in my wallet easily before.

70
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,650
Aigoo, what nonsense.

71
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,900
But, is it really okay if you don't go to the hospital?

72
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,260
Yes. She didn't hit me. I was just startled, so I fell down.

73
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,180
What? Is that so? Then what should we do?

74
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,680
Why?

75
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,950
No, it's nothing. It's true that she ran the lights.

76
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,540
That woman won't spam call me, right?

77
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,910
You gave her your phone number?

78
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,060
It's definitely Louis...

79
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,050
It's that beggar from the lobby yesterday.

80
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,870
Bok Sil!

81
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,530
Hey, how can you come now? The movie is almost over.

82
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,500
Sorry.

83
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,890
I got into a car accident earlier, so it got crushed.

84
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,400
What? Are you badly hurt?

85
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,330
I'm okay.

86
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,100
Tada! I made some money.

87
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,710
How can you laugh right now? Let's go to the hospital.

88
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,120
I said I'm okay! I'm not hurt anywhere.

89
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,970
Let's go to the hospital.

90
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,490
- Hey!
- I'm fine!

91
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,790
Come here!

92
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,420
True to your name, Flying Squirrel of Mt. Odae, you're so fast.

93
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,900
Give me the money.

94
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,960
While I'm saying this nicely, give it. Otherwise I'll leave you here.

95
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,140
First, there's nothing wrong from the accident.

96
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,870
There's nothing wrong from the brain CT scan or MRI either.

97
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,880
From the condition of the patient you told us about, there is a high chance that he has retrograde amnesia.

98
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,290
As time progresses, his memory may return.

99
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,710
Are you saying there's a chance his memory might not come back?

100
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,470
Well... yes.

101
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,620
Hey. Why are you grumpy?

102
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,990
There's nothing that changed. Even when we used all the money.

103
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,300
It's not like my memory returned or he gave us a way to treat it. Why did I have to undergo all the tests?

104
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,130
The doctor said they needed them for a diagnosis.

105
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,800
It's weird. Oh, I feel strange.

106
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,770
It feels the same as when I got scammed last time.

107
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,140
Grow up already.

108
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,330
Hello?

109
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,140
I'm the driver from the car accident earlier. Are you okay?

110
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,110
Did you go to the hospital?

111
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,120
I couldn't sleep from all the worry. I'm sorry, but

112
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,190
could we meet tomorrow?

113
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,960
Oh! What is this?

114
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Do you like me? Do you want to see me that badly?

115
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,720
You're free to like me, but I don't like you.

116
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,290
I don't feel too well right now, so please don't call me.

117
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,810
Hey Baek Ma Ri. Do you love me?

118
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,020
Do you like me? You can freely like me,

119
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,350
but I don't like you.

120
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,710
You were aware of this, Dad? Since when?

121
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:10,600
Only some time ago. I thought you didn't need to know about this.

122
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,460
Are you just going to leave Louis there? We have to bring him back.

123
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,530
We don't know when his memory will return.

124
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,310
Let's think about that when the time comes.

125
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,860
If you think of it this way, Ma Ri...

126
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,730
This is an opportunity for me.

127
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,020
The Gold Group that I spilled blood and sweat to grow into what it is today,

128
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,470
actually, is as good as my own company.

129
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,710
Then, Louis—

130
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,050
If I come to own Gold Group,

131
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,150
I will give all of it to you.

132
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:45,120
So, let's just cover up this Louis matter.

133
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,090
Understand?

134
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,350
This person resembles Louis and his name is Shopping King Louis?

135
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,580
But what's up with the misspelling?

136
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,290
Actually, that is one of the things that makes me strongly suspect that he might be the young master.

137
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,860
Does it make sense that my precious is this ignorant?

138
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,860
Louis was a child who could speak ten languages.

139
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,490
On the other hand, his spelling was atrocious.

140
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,490
I didn't tell you, because I thought you would be worried.

141
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,010
If you say that this is the case, we must look into it.

142
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,930
Even if it's like finding a needle in a haystack,

143
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,680
if there's a chance that our Ji Sung is still alive,

144
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,950
of course we should investigate.

145
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,870
Are you okay?

146
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,210
Where are you touching? You better let go.

147
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,490
What are you doing?

148
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,390
I told you that I don't hit people anymore!

149
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,440
What a joke.

150
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,200
The rooftop room where he is residing is a truly horrific place.

151
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,110
Months before, three people were murdered there.

152
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,800
In that neighborhood, there was a similar case six months ago,

153
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,650
so the police are suspecting it to be a serial murder case and are investigating.

154
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,910
I think we can take care of this without raising any suspicion.

155
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,040
I'm going crazy. Why isn't she coming?

156
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,280
I can't use Ahjumma Geum Ja's refrigerator comfortably.

157
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,630
When I lived in the countryside, my wish was to have a refrigerator.

158
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,650
It isn't easy to make it come true even in Seoul.

159
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,340
I'm sure my wish will get granted someday.

160
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,820
Thank you for the meal.

161
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,050
Hey! I'm late, I'm going.

162
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,670
- Eat before you go!
- I'll get in trouble with the director.

163
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,660
Do the dishes. I'm leaving.

164
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,040
The director's such a jerk.

165
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,230
See you later.

166
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,800
Scary kids
Gold Group 30 year anniversary music box

167
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,550
Gobossi Fire hidrant (misspelled)

168
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,210
Please investigate based on these. Item by item.

169
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,060
What's that about?

170
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,640
- What is this?
- Someone asked to investigate.

171
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,360
Hey, the word combination looks like the Da Vinci Code or something.

172
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,170
This is called the Louis's Code, punk.

173
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,260
Give it to me.

174
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,800
Gold Group 30 year anniversary music box?

175
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,210
I've seen it before.

176
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,620
This place is amazing.

177
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,470
Is this store building yours?

178
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,110
It's rented. 30,000,000 ($30,000 USD) security deposit and 2,000,000 ($2,000 USD) monthly.

179
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,140
Can you make 2,000,000 a month by selling these books?

180
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,900
It's been an hour since we came, but there's not even one customer.

181
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,380
There is a way to make ends meet. It's a business secret.

182
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,380
Then did you sell these books

183
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,730
and make the department store VIP status?

184
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,920
There's a way. Do you want to know?

185
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,250
You just need to shop a lot at the department store.

186
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,720
- Mr. Shopping King Louis.
- Buy it in pink.

187
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,130
- Mr. Shopping King Louis.
- When it comes to the price-performance ratio, an SUV is the best.

188
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,340
- Mr. Shopping King Louis.
- Try on clothes before buying them.

189
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,230
- Mr. Shopping King Louis.
- It's a knock-off of Balenciaga.

190
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,630
MBD Broadcast Helicopter LEGO is really a limited edition.

191
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,700
- Mr. Shopping King Louis.
- The suction power of the Mono Robot vacuum cleaner is good! So-so on cleaning corners and edges.

192
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,510
Mr. Shopping King Louis, where do I buy rare French books?

193
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,890
www.hongfranc.com

194
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,020
Pororo Sport, Ahdi G7, Ferry Neocar,

195
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,330
If you have a family, Pororo, If you want a sporty vehicle, Neocar.

196
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,690
Mr. Shopping King Louis, Tilelist or Mirano?

197
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,590
If you're an amateur looking for an easy golfing experience, then Mirano.

198
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,440
Mr. Shopping King Louis.

199
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,510
Read the ingredient list and pick the highest concentration.

200
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,430
- Mr. Shopping King Louis.
- Mr. Shopping King Louis.

201
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,720
The 'Jovanni' from Italy that just launched at the Luxury Goods Mall is not the finest brand from Italy.

202
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,850
It's overpriced for no reason. Goldline is a scam.

203
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,010
Director! Big trouble!

204
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,210
Shopping King Louis caused trouble!

205
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,700
Jovanni...

206
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,260
We just launched the brand after getting the exclusive contract. It will be a big blow.

207
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,960
- People are taking Shopping King Louis's comments as gospel! What do we do?
- Louis?

208
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,900
Manager Lee, send in a request to Customer Management Team and find out who Shopping King Louis is, immediately!

209
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,800
Shopping King Louis is a girl?

210
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,630
Yes, by the name of Go Bok Sil.

211
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,980
Mr. Shopping King Louis, what is your favorite kind of coffee?

212
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,070
Maxim Gold.(An inexpensive instant coffee)

213
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,630
It wasn't Young Master.

214
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,440
The owner of the Shopping King Louis ID is Go Bok Sil.

215
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,580
What?!

216
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,400
But there is one thing that's strange.

217
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,300
Seeing the time the reviews were posted, it would be hard to say Bok Sil did them.

218
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,600
Bok Sil has perfect spelling, too.

219
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,740
I think this may be ID hacking.

220
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,440
You're onto something.

221
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,220
Right? It makes sense, right?

222
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,830
- Keep it a secret from the team members. I'll take care of it.
- Yes, Sir.

223
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,380
- Go on ahead.
- Yes, Sir.

224
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,570
Are you Shopping King Louis?

225
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,330
Jesus, how did you know?

226
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,460
You lost your memory, yet you know your shopping like the back of your hand. What exactly is your identity?!

227
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,250
- Please lower your voice.
- Why is your nickname Shopping King Louis?

228
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,250
My neighbor downstairs nicknamed me Shopping King because I am a good shopper

229
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,890
and I got Louis from what was written on my underwear.

230
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,310
- Why?
- Because it's the same nickname that I used to know.

231
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,900
So what? You came to prevent me from using that nickname?

232
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,510
That's right Because of your random reviews and shopping tip replies,

233
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,780
you're putting Go Bok Sil in an awkward position, so stop it immediately!

234
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,270
You feel like a hero on the internet?

235
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,090
You think you've become somebody because people praise and like your comments?

236
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,160
But a store could close down because of people like you!

237
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,800
Reviews and comments are making a big wave of word of mouth,

238
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,520
which can make the seller succeed or fail!

239
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,110
Honest reviewers like you are necessary,

240
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,740
but only continue doing so when you find out your real name. Don't use Go Bok Sil's ID.

241
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,170
Did something happen to Bok Sil?

242
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,930
She could be fired from the company, because of you!

243
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,660
- Why? What?
- Who is Shopping King Louis?

244
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,230
The director said he would meet him directly and sort it out.

245
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,030
So who is it?

246
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,540
I'm so curious!

247
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,740
Don't you know customer information is confidential?

248
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,640
Geez, so petty...

249
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,770
It can't be Louis, right?

250
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,650
It has to be Louis.

251
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,000
No, that can't happen though...

252
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,140
Mister, how can I prevent Bok Sil from getting fired?

253
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,840
I'll protect Bok Sil if you come live at my house.

254
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,010
You're saying to live apart from Bok Sil?

255
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,230
It's for Bok Sil's sake. What's there to think about?

256
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:25,650
Okay, but buy the latest fridge and laundry machine for her.

257
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,800
What?

258
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,920
Don't want to? Then I'm not moving.

259
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,780
I will

260
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:45,070
no longer act as

261
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,480
Shopping King Louis

262
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,100
at Goldline.

263
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,120
In return, Cha Joong Eon (misspelled) will...

264
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,820
geeve (misspelled) the latest fridge

265
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,430
and laundry machine

266
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,610
to Go Bok Sil.

267
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,440
Sign.
Louis

268
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,160
It's not too late to learn spelling.

269
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,850
What are you doing? Pack your belongings!

270
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,900
Get in.

271
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,560
Stop right there. Am I your driver? Ride shotgun.

272
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,260
Don't call me mister,

273
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,940
and call me director from now on. Got it?

274
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,460
Perhaps, is he sneaking Louis out of this place?

275
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,320
What are you doing? Sit down.

276
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,440
It's familiar, this feeling.

277
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,860
Will you fill up the tub for me?

278
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,750
Strangely, I feel like a bubble bath.

279
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,310
This is my place. Don't act like you own this place, when you're only a freeloader.

280
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,430
What is a freeloader?

281
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,980
It refers to a person like you who mooches off of another person.

282
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,910
To Go Bok Sil, too, you were a freeloader.

283
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,480
That isn't it.

284
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,910
Bok Sil was thankful that I was the only one on her side under the same skies and referred to me like that.

285
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,860
On my side, my ass.

286
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,250
Where is my room?

287
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,500
Use that room and that bathroom.

288
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,840
Breakfast is at seven and you'll get nothing if you're late. Take care of your own lunch and dinner.

289
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,580
Oh, but Bok Sil prepared my meal before going to work.

290
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,680
I hate messiness.

291
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,830
So finish off all cleaning, doing dishes and laundry before I come home, understand?

292
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,640
How about money? Bok Sil gave me 50 cents every time I did dishes.

293
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,680
I feed you, clothe you and put a roof over your head. Do I have to pay you money as well?

294
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,020
Bok Sil never said anything like that to me.

295
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,940
Stop talking back to me!

296
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,270
Wow, how long has it been since you entreated me to live with you? Now, you get annoyed every time I open my mouth.

297
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,970
Be quiet, be quiet.

298
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:08,280
If you open that mouth of yours one more time, I may double stitch it up.

299
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,900
Aish...

300
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,590
Was it two years ago? I went to some bookstore to investigate a case.
(Hong Franc)

301
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,710
Because it was full of French books, I clearly remember it.

302
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,910
In there was that music box.

303
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,170
Hong Franc Closed

304
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,670
Is it closed already?

305
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,480
Fire Hydrant

306
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,460
Fire Hydrant

307
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,670
Fire Hydrant.

308
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,130
I'm in flont (misspelled) of the company.
Let's catch a movie after work.

309
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,000
We didn't got (misspelled) to see it the last time.

310
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,160
Wait for me.
What kind of movie is it?

311
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,730
What should he do?

312
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,370
Hey...

313
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,440
Let's... get out of here.

314
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,930
Yes, please...

315
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,290
Aish, he smiled.

316
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,600
Wow...

317
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,290
It was too scary.

318
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:55,980
When this was the first movie I ever watched... Hey, what the heck?

319
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,060
It was a free ticket. Next time, let's watch one that's not scary.

320
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,850
Yes, not a scary one.

321
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,540
Welcome.

322
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,540
What do you want to eat?

323
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,800
Ten fish cakes.

324
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,420
Aren't you going to eat anything else?

325
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,290
No, the rice cake is too spicy and the color of the blood sausage doesn't look too good.

326
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:26,040
And the fries... the oil is too dark.

327
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,780
Give us ten fish cakes and one serving of rice cake.

328
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,070
Thank you!

329
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,850
- Louis?
- Huh?
- You're not that Shopping King Louis, right?

330
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,640
Thank you.

331
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,950
Because of that person, there was a commotion at work.

332
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
Don't worry.

333
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,690
Shopping King Louis died today.

334
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,880
What?!

335
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,940
Hey, hey, just a second.

336
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,920
Yes, Headquarters Director. I got a new piece of information.

337
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,640
Shopping King Louis supposedly died today.

338
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,530
Louis is next to you right now, right?

339
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,840
Huh? How did you...

340
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,820
Go home right now, right now!

341
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,810
There is nothing that the director does not know.

342
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,840
Where the heck is she wandering around?

343
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,160
Distressing me...

344
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,610
Wow...

345
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,880
Bvlgari two band white gold diamond.

346
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,300
It gives off too much knockoff vibe.

347
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,810
Do you have money to buy even this one?

348
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,080
How much is it?

349
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,000
$30.

350
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,930
An authentic one costs $6,500.

351
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,680
So are you buying or not?

352
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,020
I can't slip a fake one on your finger.

353
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,800
We're not even married. Why wear a ring?

354
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,780
You can wear one, even if we're not married. Watch some TV.

355
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,390
Bok Sil, there are too many things you don't know.

356
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,510
What time do I have to watch TV?

357
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,530
You must be having a rough time cooking meals for me.

358
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,290
Today, I...

359
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,150
left home.

360
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,320
Huh?

361
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,150
Didn't I tell you before, that your headquarters director asked me to live with him?

362
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,740
He bugged me so much about it.

363
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,080
I decided to live with him.

364
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,530
Without consulting me one bit...

365
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,950
Are you worried that you might miss me?

366
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,240
Why would I miss you? I'm so relieved.

367
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:05,640
Still, you... cannot stop contacting me until we find Bok Nam.

368
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,410
Of course not! I'm going to call you every day.

369
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,880
Bok Sil, you've never ridden a boat, right?

370
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,980
- Right.
- On our next date, let's ride that.

371
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,960
♬ Lost The Way ♬

372
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,730
♬ I lost the way ♬

373
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,080
A date?

374
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,380
What we did today was going on a date.

375
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,220
Bok Sil, watch some TV while I am gone.

376
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,070
♬ In the smoky sunlight ♬

377
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,300
♬ I ask again ♬

378
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,820
♬ Where am I going ♬

379
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:55,190
♬ One exhausted step ♬

380
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,570
♬ But I Can Fly  ♬

381
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,390
♬ Past the countless stars ♬

382
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,420
Why didn't he take this eyesore chair?

383
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:11,130
♬ The space where memories fell asleep ♬

384
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:19,980
♬ Can I wake up sometime and fly? ♬

385
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,330
What are these?

386
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,030
Oh, Bok Sil, you're home?

387
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,010
- Oppa!
- Yes?

388
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,800
Who put them here?

389
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,140
Oh, these... Hey, you know Chun Hyang who sold herself

390
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,280
for 300 sacks of rice to pray for the return of her father's eyesight?

391
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,000
You mean Shim Cheong?

392
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,150
That's what I said. With the same resolve, Louis accepted these and went to the headquarters director's house.

393
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:48,060
So nice... Won't someone buy me?

394
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,330
With our cushion compact, you can simultaneously block harmful UV lights and put on makeup.

395
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:59,190
It contains skin boosting ingredients that will transform lackluster skin into bright...

396
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,380
Here, eat.

397
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,440
Oh, I don't eat the seeds.

398
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,000
Remove them please.

399
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,440
I don't like noise, so watch TV when I'm not here.

400
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,450
Just a minute.

401
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,880
- For you?
- No, for Bok Sil.

402
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,210
She doesn't buy things for herself, so I have to buy them for her.

403
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,410
- With whose money?
- With Bok Sil's money, of course.

404
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,050
You really don't remember a thing?

405
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,710
There are a few things, but they are all piecemeal, so I'm not very sure.

406
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,050
Oh, by the way, the pillow was too high. Do you have another one?

407
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,810
Wait here.

408
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,690
Here, try this one.

409
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,170
This is too low.

410
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,700
Here.

411
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,010
I will take this one.

412
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,790
Oh, by the way, you're out of toilet paper. You're going to put up some curtains in my room, right?

413
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,630
And if you don't like me watching TV here, feel free to get a small TV set for my room.

414
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,500
And you're out of coffee capsules.

415
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,010
I like Maxim Gold, so stock up on those.

416
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,910
Enough already, you son-of-a-bitch!

417
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,490
Aish! How can there be someone like that?

418
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,550
Go Bok Sil: Thank you so much for the refrigerator and the washing machine.

419
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,880
They must be expensive.

420
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,950
I will make sure to pay you back later.

421
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,840
Headquarters Director: No need.

422
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,080
Please take care of Louis well.

423
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,690
He's a high-maintenance kid.

424
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,040
Please look after him kindly.

425
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,040
It's fine. Worry about yourself.

426
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,540
Good night.

427
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,440
♬ When Sunny Day It's Fine Day ♬

428
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,460
Would Bok Sil be sleeping well?

429
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,990
♬ Hello, hello  ♬

430
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,820
Is he sleeping well after changing beds?

431
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:36,390
♬ Where am I and are you  ♬

432
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,580
- Louis: Are you sleeping?
- Bok Sil: Are you sleeping?

433
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,540
What are you doing, awake?

434
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,560
Thinking of you.

435
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,510
I feel emty (misspelled) because you're not here.

436
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,740
Are you okey (misspelled)?

437
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,850
It feels refreshing.

438
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,180
Louis.
Headquarters Director is the ginseng benefactor and

439
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,110
he also got me a job.

440
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:04,640
He's someone who bought me a refrigerator and a washing machine. I'm really thankful towards him. You know that, right?

441
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,230
So, you can't cause trouble.

442
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,280
You're only talking about the director.

443
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,020
Is that allh (misspelled) you have to say to me?

444
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:37,500
♬ Hello, hello, hello  ♬

445
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,900
I miss you.

446
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,300
♬ That place is my universe ♬

447
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:50,880
♬ Even if that star lose its shine someday ♬

448
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,570
♬ I'll look for you who's losing the shine ♬

449
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,280
I misse (misspelled) you at least ten thousand times.

450
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,630
♬ With Shiny Light of Mine  ♬

451

452
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,230
♬  Hello, hello ♬

453
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,690
What are you looking at?

454
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:26,120
♬ Where The Place I Round Around ♬

455
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:32,200
♬ It's Warm I Can Feel You ♬

456
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,070
Oh. It's the American style that I like.

457
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,820
Eat.

458
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,160
Wear a different necktie.

459
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,380
It seems you like the refined, dandy style.

460
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,220
Even if you highlight your style by wearing a brighter color, you will more than likely look good.

461
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,800
Just a moment.

462
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,970
Stand up for a second.

463
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,980
What are you doing right now?

464
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,510
The suit fits you well.

465
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,860
Aren't you leaving for work?

466
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,830
Leave first.

467
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,820
Always, "Ahemm."

468
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,970
Wow, it's MicroModal.

469
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,050
Ah, it feels good.

470
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,900
Joong Won!

471
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,750
Leave it there.

472
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,610
Something's strange.

473
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,030
Why?

474
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:45,010
It's a different atmosphere than usual.

475
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,940
Shall I call it a woman's intuition?

476
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,320
Whoa! Woah...

477
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,470
What's the matter?

478
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:33,650
You're living together with our Joong Won?

479
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,550
Yes. Ahjussi entreated me to live with him.

480
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:48,600
I think that Ahjussi has fallen for me.

481
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,450
Oh my.

482
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:59,660
Honey! Come to your senses.

483
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,730
Honey.

484
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,240
Joong Won...

485
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,460
Our Joong Won can't do this to us.

486
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:24,640
Honey, remember what that baby-possessed shaman said to us last time?

487
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,320
I see both a woman and a man.

488
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,830
Was this what he meant?!

489
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,590
What are you talking about right now?

490
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,780
He definitely said that he saw a woman as well!

491
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,750
Right. He did say that.

492
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:51,700
So, was the Shopping King Louis incident resolved well?

493
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,500
Yes, not only at our Goldline but at other online malls including Open Market,

494
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,090
he seems quite a controversial figure, what with his frank product reviews and shopping advice.

495
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,790
I looked into it, too,

496
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:08,420
and the owner of that ID was an employee named Go Bok Sil who was hired based on her connection with you.

497
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,910
It was ID hacking.

498
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,240
I took care of it well, so please don't worry about it.

499
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,780
Headquarters Director Cha, are you hiding something from me?

500
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,950
There must be something to hide in order to hide it.

501
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:25,770
It almost seems as if you want me to hide something from you.

502
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,200
Of course not.

503
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,200
Do we need to print out more fliers?

504
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,540
We distributed so many fliers,

505
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,930
but why is there not even one call?

506
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,370
Hey. What if Bok Nam is dead?

507
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,160
Ah, no, no, no, no, no!

508
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,780
Don't even say that! Bok Sil said that if you think positive, positive things will happen.

509
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,460
Ah, I'm just saying that because I'm frustrated. Sorry.

510
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,980
We shouldn't be doing this. Come here.

511
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,990
How is it? "If anyone has seen this man, please contact me."

512
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,110
Woah! This place is amazing.

513
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:20,860
Wow, Bok Sil's director has so much style. Daebak!

514
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,680
- Do you want something to drink?
- Bring everything.

515
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,670
This is a heaven on earth.

516
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,590
But I'm sorry to Bok Sil for enjoying this only by ourselves.

517
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,270
No!!

518
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,900
Don't worry. Without you, Bok Sil is rolling in the lap of luxury herself.

519
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:40,590
Hey, aren't you hungry? Don't you have any meal-type food besides snacks?

520
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,440
Mine too.

521
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,980
What are you doing right now?

522
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,460
Ah, h-hello. I'm

523
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,710
J-Jo In Seong.

524
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,130
Because we were hungry, Louis and I were boiling some ramen...

525
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:44,800
So, the Searching Bok Nam company that you two are in, is to find Go Bok Sil's younger brother?

526
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,520
Yes.

527
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,160
Who's giving you pay?

528
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,140
Of course, Go Bok Sil. She's the client.

529
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,110
How much?

530
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,680
He and I, together, get 30,000 won a day.

531
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,800
It's for food and transportation. It's just enough to get by.

532
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:04,340
So in the end, you two were living off of Go Bok Sil, huh?

533
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:08,250
Yes. No... no.

534
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,610
I was preparing for the civil service exam, but Louis

535
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,900
didn't know anything about the ways of the world, so I was helping him.

536
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,790
You know how you paid Bok Sil for the ginseng a while ago?

537
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,040
He lost all that money through voice phishing in one go. That's the type of guy he is.

538
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,530
What?!

539
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,880
Oh, you didn't know. Maybe I shouldn't have said anything?

540
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,510
Then I guess you didn't know about him maxing out Bok Sil's card this time, either?

541
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,120
This bastard.

542
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,540
I can't take this any longer!

543
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,180
- What are you doing? Wipe.
- Yes, Sir.

544
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,770
From today on, your job will be loading and unloading boxes for delivery.

545
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,040
Work hard and earn a daily wage.

546
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,960
Hey, come over here.

547
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,770
Loading and unloading delivery boxes?

548
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,950
I've heard that is the North Korean forced labor concentration camp of the part time job world. Break a leg.

549
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,040
Oh, Bok Sil.

550
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,820
Where do you want it?

551
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,620
Over my entire body.

552
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,330
Turn over.

553
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,530
I can't, turn me over, please.

554
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,820
Be gentle, please!

555
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,800
You talk too much.

556
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,850
I'm sorry, please be gentle.

557
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:31,850
Persistent guy. Whether the outcome is porridge or rice, he did it till the end.

558
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,500
Mister, I'm thirsty.

559
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,520
Mister, I'm hungry.

560
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,890
Mister, scratch my leg.

561
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,750
Not that one, my left leg.

562
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,100
I need to go to work!

563
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,250
Then what about me?

564
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,620
How can you become bed-ridden like this after one day of working?

565
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,980
Then, at least get me a visiting nurse.

566
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,280
Visiting nurse my ass. The wages you earned yesterday, you've used it all up for the pain patches.

567
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,090
Then call Bok Sil.

568
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,810
Is Go Bok Sil your maid?

569
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,760
Go Bok Sil will worry, so don't think about calling her.

570
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,720
Keeping your illness a secret from others to prevent them from worrying is being mature.

571
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,370
This bastard is always telling me to come and go.

572
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,670
Am I his servant or something?

573
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,170
I've been too easy on him.

574
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,990
What's this smell?

575
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,890
Hey! What happened to you?

576
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:39,540
Hyung, I need to use the restroom.

577
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,530
So? What do you want me to do?

578
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,420
Hurry up! I feel like dying for real!

579
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:53,280
Hey, on the way here, I think I saw someone strange in the alleyway.

580
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,640
Who?

581
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,680
I got this really eerie vibe.

582
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,540
My mom will kill me if I say this.

583
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,930
What is it?

584
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:12,080
There was a murder three months ago in the rooftop room Bok Sil lives in.

585
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,700
What?

586
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,180
The killer isn't caught yet, so I have these misgivings.

587
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:24,920
Why mention that just now?!

588
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,400
He can walk.

589
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,180
What was I doing then?

590
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,100
♬  I was born to love you ♬

591
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:01,590
♬ With every single beat of my heart  ♬

592
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:09,120

596
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:34,520
♬  With every single beat of my heart ♬

597
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:40,690

598
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,980
♬  Every single day  ♬

599
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:49,060
Patch Guy, Stop right there! Ahjussi with pain relieving patches!

600
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,170
Bok Sil...

601
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:55,460
♬  I was born to love you ♬

602
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,840
♬ Every single day  ♬

00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:10,090

604
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,990
Bok Sil!

605
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:22,730
♬  Of my life ♬

606
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,640

607
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:39,000

608
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:46,120
♬ Every single day  ♬

609
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,520
Hey, what's this smell...

610
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,780
Rushing here to protect you, I forgot to put on clothes.

611
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,800
Let me see.

612
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,680
What happened...

613
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,490
It hurts.

614
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,020
Sorry for breaking the contrect (misspelled).

615
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,040
I'll send back the fridge and laundry machine if you want.

616
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,600
But widout (misspelled) those, it will be inconvenient for Bok Sil. Do as you wish,

617
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,290
Mr. Cha Joong Eon (misspelled).

618
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,310
My blood pressure's rising.

619
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,960
Where did this kind of guy come from and latch onto her?

620
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,100
It's making me concerned.

621
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,990
Was our room always this tiny?

622
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:46,100
What should I wear?

623
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:56,230
You left these here.

624
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,850
I got rid of a dresser to make space.

625
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,470
What a fresh idea.

626
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,750
But... won't it be too crowded for two people to sleep here?

627
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,990
What?

628
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:45,860
Why did you come back all of a sudden?

629
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,540
I came, because I was worried about you.

630
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,320
Bok Sil.

631
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:07,240
This is a really dangerous house.

632
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,910
What?!

633
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,450
Before we moved in, someone died.

634
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,160
There was a reason this place didn't require a security deposit.

635
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:29,300
But we're two so it's okay,

636
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,840
because I will protect you.

637
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,150
Just trust me.

638
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,060
You're so dependable.

639
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,080
I'm sorry.

640
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,920
It's okay.

641
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:55,420
So, I ordered all the tools.

642
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,160
Tools?

643
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,320
Hey! What did you buy again?

644
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,870
Good night.

645
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,360
♬ The time which isn't remembered ♬

646
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:23,870
♬ That familiar scent enters and permeates. ♬

647
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:30,890
♬ The Time in my two eyes ♬

648
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:38,930
♬ The melody which stayed in my ear enters ♬

649
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,400
Ma Ri.

650
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:57,120
It's warm milk.

651
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,910
You haven't been sleeping well for the past few days. What should we do?

652
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:04,060
I have too much to think about.

653
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,100
Is something going on?

654
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,420
Don't tell your mom.

655
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,560
She's not capable of keeping this kind of secret.

656
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,300
You don't have to know.

657
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,640
Is it because of Director Cha?

658
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,920
It's not that! Get out.

659
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,400
Girl...

660
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,970
Drink and sleep.

661
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,000
No matter how much I think about it, it's weird.

662
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,740
Then, who was that person who died with Louis's watch on?

663
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,120
This is really good.

664
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,390
What flavor is it?

665
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,750
Did you make a lot of money?

666
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,290
No, not really.

667
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,810
Have you seen this person?

668
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,340
That's Oppa Bok Nam.

669
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,600
Yeah, that's him!

670
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,980
Is his family looking for him?

671
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,230
I must have run too much yesterday.

672
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:07,140
It feels like one hundred people beat me up.

673
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,480
I can't even turn my neck.

674
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,150
- Louis.
- Huh?

675
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,810
Since the ones on your back—they'll hurt, let's peel these off all at once.

676
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,840
- What?
- I'll count to three.

677
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,950
One!

678
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:27,920
It hurts more than when you peel it one by one.

679
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,890
Hello.

680
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,890
What?

681
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,540
Bok Sil.

682
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,620
Quick! Hurry!

683
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,550
I'm going to go.

684
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:52,080
What? Bok Sil! Jeez..

685
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,300
That's that bitch with Dog Fur (penniless) from before.

686
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,940
What should we do?

687
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:15,070
Excuse me. Are you the person who called me?

688
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,880
Run!

689
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,810
Hey!

690
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:23,060
Hey! Excuse me! Just a sec!

691
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,250
Hey!

692
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,800
Where are you going?

693
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,870
I got her.

694
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,290
Don't shake me.

695
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:48,950
Why did you run away?

696
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:53,140
I was afraid you'd call the police. We hate going to the police station.

697
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,990
Are you Bok Nam's sister, Unni?

698
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,050
What kind of horrible connection is this?

699
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:02,680
Oppa will die of embarrassment if he finds out how you are going around like this.

700
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,270
We used to ride motorcycles together with Oppa Bok Nam.

701
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:10,800
That track suit that Dog Fur was wearing that day was Oppa's, right?

702
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,050
I thought it was weird. Now it makes sense.

703
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,800
When did you meet Oppa Bok Nam, Dog Fur?

704
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,700
I don't know. I am a man with amnesia.

705
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,110
Why are you laughing?

706
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,690
What the heck! He says amnesia!

707
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,560
Then you must be a 2nd generation Chaebol.

708
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,860
Hey, stop it.

709
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:32,110
Where is my Bok Nam? Tell me right now.

710
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:37,350
We'll tell you if you give us the reward money.

711
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:42,170
Things like this always have reward money to thank the person.

712
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:44,260
Just give us 1,000,000 won ($1000 USD).

713
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:51,390
You have to tell me first, then I'll do everything to prepare that money.

714
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,090
You can trust me. I'm telling you the truth.

715
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,860
Let's go.

716
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,410
Call me when you get the money.

717
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:05,050
Hey guys. Guys!

718
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:07,230
Guys. Wait a minute.

719
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,560
Is Bok Nam okay?

720
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,660
Of course.

721
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,870
Bok Sil.

722
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:23,100
Thank you for lunch, Headquarters Director.

723
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,740
By the way, why did Go Bok Sil take the day off?

724
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,230
Is her boyfriend sick?

725
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:33,110
Did that bastard get in trouble again?

726
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,660
Are you okay?

727
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:44,590
I told you to stay home. Why did you tag along uselessly?

728
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:46,830
It's about Bok Nam, how could I not?

729
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:49,350
Let's put some more pain relieving patches on you.

730
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:54,200
I think they're really mean. Why do they want money for finding someone?

731
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,760
We could've given them that money if only I hadn't gone to the hospital.

732
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,650
Don't worry. We'll hear about him when we get the money.

733
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,470
It's like we already found him.

734
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:05,420
Let's go.

735
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,640
Are you okay?

736
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,070
Where is that place? No. 92...

737
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:22,780
So, you took the day off to take care of your beau, huh?

738
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,780
That's Louis!

739
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,220
Let's see...

740
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,730
Why is Louis living with Go Bok Sil?

741
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,780
Here!

742
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:05,720
What brings you to my neighborhood, Team Leader?

743
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,120
I was worried if you were sick.

744
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:15,270
So, it's not you, but the guy you're living with who's sick?

745
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,290
Where did she rush off to without telling me?

746
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,160
What?

747
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,220
It's a eureka moment.

748
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:12,130
That amnesiac guy was wearing your brother's clothes?

749
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:19,890
Was it Go Bok Sil's brother who died instead of Louis?

750
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:25,310
Actually, someone called me after seeing the flier today.

751
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:28,770
I wasn't at work, because I was meeting them.

752
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:31,120
Did you find your brother?

753
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,430
Almost but I didn't find him.

754
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:37,180
I just have to give them the reward money, then they'll tell me.

755
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:43,240
I'm sorry, but that looks like a scam.

756
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:49,010
I hope you find your brother and live well with the amnesiac guy.

757
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,820
I'll take off now.

758
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,870
Please keep it a secret at work.

759
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:58,930
Don't worry. It'll be no good if he's revealed.

760
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:03,820
Oh yeah. I'll lend you the money.

761
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,200
Excuse me? Really?

762
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,390
Thank you. Thank you, Team Leader!

763
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:13,100
Pay me back when you get your paycheck.

764
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,690
Of course.

765
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,370
Let's meet now. I'll give you the reward money.

766
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:31,750
♬ I'm taking a walk ♬

767
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:38,900

♬ After the day passes ♬

769
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:46,880
When is Bok Sil coming?
♬ tomorrow comes ♬

770
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,410
Did something come up?
♬ I can't remember. ♬

771
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:58,740
Dad, I found out who died instead of Louis.
♬ the traces of the path which I am going to look for  ♬

772
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:02,070
♬ on which the light is traveling. Will you try to leave  ♬

773
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:05,160
♬ the fadiing reason behind? My heart is on top of the wind. ♬

774
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,130
Royal Billiard Hall

775
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,580
Go to Royal Billiard Hall after 10.

776
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:12,840
He sleeps there at least 3,4 times a week after playing billiards.

777
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:18,800
♬ The time which I can't remember ♬

778
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:26,350
♬ The untouchable feeling which comes and hurts deeply ♬

779
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:33,380
♬ The Time in my heart then ♬

780
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:40,840
♬ When I close my eyes another wind blows ♬

781
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:45,750
Bok Nam doesn't come here anymore, so don't disturb the business and leave now.

782
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,560
Louis!

783
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,890
Why does he have the door open when it's so cold?

784
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:55,820
Louis! Are you sleeping?

785
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:00,910
Why didn't you even lock the door?

786
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:10,160
I-is he dead?

787
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,330
Blood!

788
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:18,130
Louis! Louis!

789
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,660
♬ It will blow up in few seconds, you can't stop me ♬

790
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:45,580
♬ Broken timer switc running toward zero. ♬

791
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,380
That's my house...

792
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,590
Oh my! A person died at the rooftop room again!

793
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:54,360
On no! Did something happen to that handsome guy?

794
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,160
