1
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,850
I go to meet her every night in my dreams.

2
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,150
Bok Sil, I'm sleepy.

3
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,220
You can't, you can't, you can't!

4
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,180
When my memory comes back, I'll find your little brother for you.

5
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,320
Just trust me.

6
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,810
Sleep well, Louis.

7
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,430
I'll definitely find Bok Nam for you. Just trust me.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,290
But it's okay because we're together. I'll protect you.

9
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,120
So just trust me.

10
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,450
I cry every night, because I miss the woman I see in my dreams,

11
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,070
but I can't go to her anymore.

12
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,850
My time has stopped,

13
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,240
and I can't ever keep the promise that I made with her

14
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,460
to find her little brother.

15
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,460
So I... can't go to her anymore.

16
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,620
Episode 11: The Dream Lover: - You In My Dream

17
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,400
One month later ...

18
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,960
It's Maxim Gold.

19
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,920
Come eat.

20
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,340
Okay.

21
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,520
Let's be strong today too, Bok Sil!

22
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,790
My Precious!

23
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,780
Tell me if there's anything that you want to eat.

24
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,450
Your grandma will find it whatever it is and make it for you.

25
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,580
It's okay, Grandmother.

26
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,470
Louis, shouldn't you start going to the company now?

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,330
Yes ma'am, I understand.

28
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,000
But why did the headquarters director suddenly quit the company?

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,490
Did he get scouted by somewhere?

30
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,850
He was my role model.

31
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,110
I mean, how can he just quit and leave me here?

32
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,920
Right? You should just quit now too.

33
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,200
- I mean, you already copy him from head to toe, so why can't you write your resignation letter like him too?
- That's right.

34
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,650
Is it possible that the director resigned because Bok Sil quit?

35
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,870
Team Leader! Team Leader Baek!

36
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,990
Team Leader, it seems like you know something about it,

37
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,970
so please give us a tip.

38
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,820
I don't know why Headquarters Director Cha quit,

39
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,320
but another director will come here soon.

40
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,090
Who?

41
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,350
- Shopping King Louis the 25th?
- What?!

42
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,540
That Chairwoman's grandson who came back from the dead?

43
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,080
Wa-Wang Louis?!

44
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,960
Yes! Yeah!

45
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,130
Wait, there are so many departments in the company. Why did he have to come here of all places?

46
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,400
- But I still got three stars at that time.
- I got two...

47
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,990
I got five stars! Five stars, five of them! Five stars!

48
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,400
Oh, I'm screwed.

49
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,570
- Hello.
- Oh my goodness...

50
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,330
You're here?

51
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,460
- Welcome.
- Oh?!

52
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,800
It's Manager Lee Gyeong Gook.

53
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,910
- How did you know my name?
- I told you that I'd remember your name, Manager Lee Gyeong Gook.

54
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,820
It's an honor.

55
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,550
Um... Your office is over there, Director. This way, please.

56
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,120
No.

57
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,660
I want to sit here.

58
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,200
Please drink.

59
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,780
As expected, I don't have anyone, but you.

60
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,530
You're the best!

61
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,450
Don't pay any attention to me and work comfortably.

62
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,710
Yes, well...

63
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,420
Work comfortably, comfortably.

64
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,730
Yes.

65
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,850
He definitely isn't normal.

66
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,570
I'm going to go crazy, seriously!

67
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,800
What the heck is he talking about, telling us not to worry about him, when he's sitting right next to us?

68
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,090
It's so burdensome.

69
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,150
Is he trying to keep an eye on us and see whether we're working or not?

70
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,100
Isn't he unexpectedly strict?

71
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,000
Bingo! I knew it from the moment he gave me one star.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,020
He was kind of justified in doing so...

73
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,130
What is this, Darling? Are you taking Director Louie's side and dissing me?

74
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,000
No.

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,380
If Bok Sil were here, I could at least have tried lobbying through her... Ah, I'm screwed, seriously.

76
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,610
Are Director Louis and Bok Sil broken up now?

77
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,910
Probably. The gap between their social classes is way too big.

78
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,110
But I wonder where Bok Sil is right now.

79
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,790
www.singsingline.com
Bean Basket Bean Sprouts

80
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,550
You've got a delivery!

81
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,390
Did the director send it?

82
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,750
So pretty!

83
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,630
It's pretty. Press on.

84
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,090
Thank you.

85
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,690
When are you going to make my name plate?!

86
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,790
Use this at least for now...

87
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,930
Director & Investor Cha Joong Won

88
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,760
What is this?!

89
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,800
It's really lame, isn't it?

90
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,060
- Bring me the permanent marker.
- What?

91
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,900
Quickly!

92
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,980
Why are you laughing?

93
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,180
I mean... What kind of job title is Daddy Long Legs?

94
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,680
It's better than Wild Ginseng Benefactor.

95
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,050
The office, the desk, and the computer all suck, and I get paid peanuts.

96
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,750
I think I need a special job title to at least feel a little better.

97
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,560
When we make a lot of money and get a name plate later, make sure you put this on it, got it?

98
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,990
Yes!

99
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,240
What did you decide on for the site's opening item? Did you secure the producer?

100
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,140
Yes. I've decided on Goo Joon Pyo Cabbage which Mr. Goo Joon Pyo shed blood and sweat to grow. (Joke about the main character in Boys Over Flowers.)

101
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,380
We decided to make the quality top-notch since the product is named after the producer.

102
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,710
For now they have agreed to an exclusive distribution contract with our site.

103
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,060
The distribution industry has no choice but to resort to the direct sales method in the future.

104
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,900
From that perspective, singsingline.com (singsing means fresh in Korean),

105
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,620
which is an online produce direct sales site, has a great growth potential.

106
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,080
Do your best with your discerning eye to secure

107
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,490
high quality farm produce from reliable suppliers.

108
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,800
- Yes, sir!
- Get to work!

109
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,370
Yes, sir.

110
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
You should eat lunch with Oppa In Seong.

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,710
What am I supposed to do when you come to my workplace and ask for food?

112
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,480
Hyung In Seong left first because he was mad.

113
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,130
Wow, this is delicious!

114
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,750
It's totally my style.

115
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,300
- You want to eat one more?
- Yeah!

116
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,560
That's right. Let's eat one more.

117
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,270
Is this it?

118
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,870
Man, why did Joong Won leave a perfectly good company to go back and forth to this kind of place?

119
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,560
He must have a reason. Is Joong Won the type of guy to do something for no reason?

120
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,800
He kicked that pretty Team Leader Baek Ma Ri to the curb, then kicked his position as Goldline director to the curb!

121
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,080
He's kicking everything to the curb these days!

122
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,640
I seriously can't understand why a kid who never caused any trouble, even when he was a teenager, is doing this!

123
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,460
- He may be doing it now, because he didn't do it back then.
- What?!

124
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,870
Well, I'm just saying.

125
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,450
Excuse me.

126
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,810
Oh, yes... Who are you?

127
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:05,060
Um... Do you possibly know someone named Cha Joong Won?

128
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,480
Director, Investor Cha Joong Won

129
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,970
What is that?
[Daddy-Long-Legs]

130
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,020
Isn't this kid seriously insane?!

131
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,630
So... You're saying that you're the president of singsingline.com?

132
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,640
And our Joong Won is the director?

133
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,020
Yes, that's right.

134
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:41,160
It's weird, isn't it? I also don't understand why he's working at a place like this at all.

135
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,870
Young lady! I'll ask you directly.

136
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,500
What is your relationship with our Joong Won?

137
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,380
You really look like a headquarters director wearing clothes like that.

138
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,410
I originally have a good sense of style.

139
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,060
Ahjussi, I told you to look after Bok Sil well, but when did I tell you to quit the company?

140
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,810
I'm asking why you're working at Bok Sil's company?

141
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,630
It's my free will!

142
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:08,610
I'm saying I'm going to live my life the way I want. What does it have to do with you?

143
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,530
You should just look after Bok Sil well.

144
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,470
You can't get any closer to her. Never. You understand, right?

145
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:21,300
I don't want to. I'm going to stay stuck right to Bok Sil's side.

146
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,050
You just try it, seriously!

147
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,690
Make sure you make it nice and strong.

148
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,960
I got it, so stop nagging.

149
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:53,080
But why are you putting three locks on a rooftop room?

150
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,870
Jeez, what's it matter to you if I put three or four locks? It's my villa and my money.

151
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,540
In Seong's mom! What kind of money did you get that you bought this villa?

152
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,770
I won the lotto.

153
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:10,360
Oh my word. What good deeds did you do in your previous life that you hit the jackpot?

154
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,950
Because I'm so introverted,

155
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,760
I can't really tell people something they won't like.

156
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,210
My nickname was Sympathetic Lady Geum Ja when I was young.

157
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,560
My, my. You just do your job well.

158
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,510
- Please get in.
- Okay.

159
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,770
Where shall I take you?

160
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,500
Let's go to the place we always go.

161
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,900
I understand. I will start the car.

162
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,280
Please mind your dignity, Director.

163
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,800
So cringeworthy!

164
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,250
Mom, we're here!

165
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,720
Our Louis came? You look so cool!

166
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,250
Wait, Ms. Geum Ja. Aren't you fawning over Louis too much, when you pushed your own son aside?

167
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,330
Ahjumma, here.

168
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,130
Oh, what is it this time?

169
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,910
I bought yours, too, when I bought Bok Sil's.

170
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,270
Hyung In Seong told me not to buy yours. He said it would be a waste of money.

171
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,690
Seriously, you're no help to my life at all.

172
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,050
There's no way I can't adore you.

173
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,220
You buy several of everything and share it with us.

174
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,870
He's the Shopping King, you know. He's generous.

175
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,100
Did the locks get put on right? Bok Sil can't be in any danger.

176
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,490
Of course! I put three on there, since I thought you might worry.

177
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,220
Make sure you check it. Mom's a good liar.

178
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,560
♬ Lost the Way, I lost the way Far Away  ♬

179
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,290
♬ Far Away, I'm searching for myself again All Day ♬

180
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:32,010
♬ All Day, In the smoky sunlight ♬

181
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,080
♬ I ask again ♬

182
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:44,050
♬ Which way should I go ♬

183
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,960
♬ One exhausted step ♬

184
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,780
♬ But I Can Fly  ♬

185
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:59,350
♬ Past countless stars Fly Away ♬

186
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,410
♬ The space where memories fell asleep ♬

187
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,540
Hey, go over there. When a man and a woman are different, why would you get so close to me?

188
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,940
♬ Will I be able to wake up someday ♬

189
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,060
♬ Lost The Way  ♬

190
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,080
I'm hungry. Give me some food.

191
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,160
♬ Oh Lost My Way  ♬

192
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,970
♬ Find The Way, I want to know. ♬

193
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,190
♬ Let Me Know  ♬

194
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,230
♬  These tears like paint spreading ♬

195
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,130
Hey!

196
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,880
♬ Is there an end, perhaps ♬

197
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,900
It's already time for Bok Sil to come home.

198
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,900
♬ When I opened my eyes again ♬

199
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:14,040
♬ Brilliant sunshine which fills the window streams in ♬

200
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:20,170
♬ Like a dream. Like a Dream ♬

201
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,590
Honey. What's wrong with you these days? Are you worried about something?

202
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,610
If you don't have an appetite, tell me what you want to eat. You'll lose weight if you keep going on like this.

203
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,380
- Everything went okay with Louis going to work?
- Yeah.

204
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,530
- There was nothing strange about him?
- No. Why?

205
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:46,280
Nothing. If he's at the company, then he should come see me.

206
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,630
Making me worry...

207
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,110
Why are you so worried about Louis?

208
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,950
When did I say that I was worried about him?!

209
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,210
You just said that you were worried about him.

210
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,490
Honey!

211
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,190
Seems like Dad gets mad at you all the time.

212
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,420
He followed me around begging to marry him, as if he were going to die if I didn't. So I did.

213
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,780
I feel so wronged.

214
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,770
Mother, did Louis arrive?

215
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,050
But, Seon Gu, you went to pick him up.

216
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,500
Louis took the car and left alone.

217
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,820
You can drive, right?

218
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,640
Exactly how much does he remember?

219
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,380
No one can find out that I made him drive.

220
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,320
Joong Won!

221
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,700
Hey! Where are you?! Get out here this instant!

222
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,560
What happened for you to be yelling so much?

223
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,750
You little rascal! Take this!

224
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,250
Hey, why are you doing this? Dad! Stop Mom!

225
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,460
I'm on Mom's side today.

226
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,060
You are not an eighth-grader, but you quit a respectable director position and what?!

227
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,420
Daddy Long Legs?

228
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,550
I'm giving myself a sabbatical for the next one year.

229
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:24,690
I spent all that time just looking forward and running. I really wanted to rest.

230
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,700
I wanted to put down everything for once and think about

231
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,880
whether I've lived well and how I should live my life from now on.

232
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,930
That Daddy Long Legs position is my side job that I took on to invest in people, while I'm on my sabbatical.

233
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,260
That girl managed to sell wild ginseng to me at midnight in Seoul Station.

234
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,900
To me of all people.

235
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,520
Do I look like someone who would buy something from a sundry peddler?

236
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,020
First! Bring that girl here.

237
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,790
Why?

238
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,240
I'm sooo curious!

239
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,720
It feels like it keeps getting heavier...

240
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,820
Maybe not?

241
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,710
It can't be.

242
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,250
Bok Sil!

243
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,920
Sil Sil Bok Sil!

244
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,540
- Just a sec, Oppa!
- Sil Sil Bok Sil!

245
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,720
- Just a minute!
- Open the door!

246
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,220
Welcome, Oppa.

247
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,050
- Welcome, Ahjumma.
- Bok Sil.

248
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:50,000
I made tons of side dishes so I had leftovers.

249
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,050
You can have these.

250
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,550
I just brought the fruits too because they looked like they'd go bad if not eaten soon.

251
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,230
In Seong, put these in the fridge.

252
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,030
This is bone soup made with 2-for-1 packages of Korean beef.

253
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:04,120
I don't know what I was thinking! I made so much bone soup, I don't have room for it in my fridge.

254
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,720
- Slurp it up with some rice every morning before going to work.
- Okay.

255
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,620
I'm only giving you these because I had too much, so don't feel bad about it.

256
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,940
Ok. Thank you, Ahjumma.

257
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,470
My mom is large-handed.

258
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,520
- I am large-handed.
- She also has a big butt.

259
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,220
Big-butt-- you!

260
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,790
We have so many rooms,

261
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:25,430
yet I have to sleep with Lady Geum Ja with a divider in between. My life is pretty depressing.

262
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,980
Be quiet! You can't live in a different room

263
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,010
when we can't let Bok Sil suspect anything.

264
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,410
We should be grateful he bought this building for us. What more do you want?

265
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,160
I'm just saying.

266
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,720
Why does Louis send such a demanding menu?

267
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,950
For tomorrow he wants braised short ribs, japchae, salad kimchi...

268
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,390
These are all really complicated to make!

269
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,640
This Annoying Style little rascal. I'm only holding back because Bok Sil's the one eating it.

270
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,810
Those are all my favorite dishes.

271
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,670
Did you happen to write this?

272
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,670
I don't think so.

273
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,020
This has perfect spelling, it had to be you.

274
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,640
You! Open this. Open!

275
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,800
It's already this late?

276
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:29,190
Bok Sil, I'm not sleepy at all. Can't I stay up for a little longer?

277
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:37,500
♬ Can it end someday? ♬

278
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,490
Louis, how are you?
♬ The wound of the long long tears ♬

279
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:53,150
♬ I draw you and erase you again gently ♬

280
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,440
Good night, Bok Sil.

281
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:09,070
♬ It hurts to see you from behind like this ♬

282
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:16,820
♬ I can't see you ♬

283
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,160
♬ who are going far away ♬

284
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Good night again, Bok Sil.

285
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,300
♬ I feel empty ♬

286
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,710
Bok Sil!

287
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,790
I brought some more side dishes. Put them in the refrigerator.

288
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,610
♬  Dream lover ♬

00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,810
♬  Thoughts begin to grow bigger  ♬

298
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:08,210
I thought Young Master was just a kid but he's so romantic.

299
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,150
How can he be so constant?

300
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,300
Don't you think he learned from me? I'm that kind of a man.

301
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,050
You should learn from him.

302
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,790
You have a long way to go to get to his level.

303
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,420
Aren't you disappointed that Jo In Seong guy took your chauffeur spot?

304
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,380
I'm getting old so I should start yielding a little.

305
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,260
Instead, I got time to spend with you, Jeong Ran.

306
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,150
How is President Baek Seon Gu? Does he still call you?

307
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:52,700
Yes. He asks me if Young Master Louis's memory has come back, every day.

308
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,680
Is there any reason that his memory shouldn't fully come back?

309
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,360
So, work is doable?

310
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,040
Yes, I get along well with the teammates, and it's my expertise, shopping.

311
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,910
Yes. I knew you would be good. I shouldn't be worried.

312
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,260
Have you been to Sunnyland?

313
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,610
Not yet.

314
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,640
It got popular by word-of-mouth and gets really crowded these days.

315
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,670
Chairwoman said it was your idea. Is that so?

316
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:34,730
Ohhhh... I don't recall.

317
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,080
I told Grandma about Sunnyland?

318
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:47,560
Whoa! Whoa! Ahjussi, I must be a genius!

319
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,320
Whoa!

320
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:56,050
His memory wasn't completely back. It was partial.

321
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,270
Right, Ahjussi!

322
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,100
If I hadn't come back, Grandma's shares would have been all yours.

323
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,810
I hope it didn't upset you to split the shares in half with me.

324
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:17,160
No way. I'm so glad you came back.

325
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,270
I'm really glad you're here, too.

326
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,830
Please take care of me in the future.

327
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,860
When will this No Name get his consciousness back?

328
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,820
I know, right?

329
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,110
Why did he go into someone else's rooftop room and get this rough treatment?

330
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,620
He needs to wake up so we can ask him.

331
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,890
Do we have to say it's a relief since Louis and Bok Sil didn't get hurt thanks to him?

332
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:48,130
He is a complicated character for me to figure out.

333
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,280
Daddy-Long-Legs Cha Joong Won

334
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,830
I still can't figure the director out.

335
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,750
He seems like he's got all the knowledge in the world,

336
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,250
but then he sometimes seems infinitely lacking, like a bottomless pot.

337
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,050
What are you muttering about all by yourself?

338
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,010
You're here?

339
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,540
Ta-da! Do you like it?

340
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,430
Well, it'll do. Good job.

341
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,830
How did your investigation of the schizandra berries in Moon-gyeong go yesterday?

342
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,600
Yes. We entered into a contract with Mr. Choi Go Bong, who owns the biggest farm there.

343
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,320
The quality of the schizandra berries is top-notch.

344
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,080
Did you make sure that his products come with the eco-friendly certification?

345
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Of course.

346
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,110
Come here.

347
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,620
What?

348
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,410
Quickly.

349
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,440
Give me your hand.

350
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,230
- My hand? Why?
- Hurry up.

351
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,140
It got stamped on good.

352
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,850
Why? Did you think I was going to give you a ring or something?

353
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,260
I find these kinds of things amusing these days.

354
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,140
I don't know why I didn't play these kinds of pranks when I was younger.

355
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,390
Director. You're really like a bottomless pot.

356
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,980
What? How dare you call the King of Charisma a bottomless pot?

357
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,170
Wow, this is nice!

358
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,320
Detective!

359
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,820
Hello.

360
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,840
Hello. Detective Nam, why brings you here?

361
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,490
I came to see Bok Sil, of course. I'm late in congratulating you. Congrats on becoming a company president, Bok Sil.

362
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,670
Thank you.

363
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,710
- Hey, where should I put this?
- Please give to me. I'll put it somewhere.

364
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,190
No. It's heavy, so let me do it.

365
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,990
- Then, please put it over there.
- Here?

366
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,260
- You're going to throw this away too, right?
- Yes. You can just put it over here.

367
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,560
Thank you.

368
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,290
Is there anything else you want me to do? If there's something that you need some muscle for, call me. I'll do it anytime.

369
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,920
You just go and catch some criminals! We're busy, so why would you come in and out of here?

370
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,310
Either way, I'm the one doing all the muscles work, so buzz off!

371
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,800
He's kind of weird.

372
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,730
Now that I look at you, it looks like you've caught servant's disease.

373
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:27,950
If we need you, then I'll be the one to call you. Satisfied?

374
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,480
- Servant's Disease?
- He's always been a verbal meanie bottomless pot. So don't worry about him.

375
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,820
Ah, it looks like he has a lot of holes.

376
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,810
- Hey, Go Bok Sil!
- Oh yeah! I also have to separate the garbage, so please help me with that.

377
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,620
Shall I?

378
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,330
Aish, really vexing...

379
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,160
Why are there so many men latching on to Go Bok Sil, harumph...

380
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,150
You worked hard.

381
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,870
- Bok Sil!
- Ahjumma.

382
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,870
Why are you hiding here like some wrongdoer?

383
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,700
No, I just felt comfortable being here like this.

384
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,990
Ah, share these with other janitor ahjummas.

385
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,690
These are dried persimmons that just arrived from Mt. Jiri and I brought them because I thought of you.

386
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,620
Dried persimmons from Mt. Jiri? Wow, the ahjummas will happily stuff themselves. Thank you.

387
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,160
Now, Oppa In Seong works, too, and you should take it easy at home.

388
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,050
Why do you work yourself so hard?

389
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,100
All four limbs of mine are in a perfect condition. I should make use of them.

390
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,370
If a person who's used to physical labor stops all of a sudden, she will actually get sick.

391
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,010
Oh, Ahjumma, really...

392
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,480
Should we dine out the first time in a long while?

393
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,820
I'm sorry. I have a prior engagement today.

394
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,250
Who gave me this?

395
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,690
Did Do Jin give me this?

396
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,160
Team Leader, I love you.
Candidate #1 Byeon Do Jin

397
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,690
But Do Jin is like a knockoff Cha Joong Won.

398
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,460
Manager Lee married with four children?

399
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,820
Team Leader Baek, accept my heart.
Candidate #2 Lee Gyeong Gook

400
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,700
What a grubby idea...

401
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:54,250
- What is this?
- Is it, by any chance...

402
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,690
Louis?

403
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,600
Candidate #3 Louis

404
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,420
After breaking up with Go Bok Sil,

405
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,510
does he now like me?

406
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,120
The reason he's sitting there is also to see me?

407
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,080
Awww, it's so nice...

408
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,970
Ji Sung, would you like to have dinner with me?

409
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,410
There is a good steakhouse nearby.

410
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,630
I'm sorry, but maybe next time.

411
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,620
Today I have a tutoring session.

412
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,950
Tu-tutoring?

413
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,580
Tutoring, don't you know? Don't you know what tutoring is?

414
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,900
How old are you to be receiving tutoring? Hey!

415
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,750
What's the subject, huh?

416
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,830
"Out of options."

417
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,790
Out... of...
(Louis's head band says "Study Hard")

418
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:05,940
options...

419
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,210
"I collided with a chicken."

420
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,580
I...

421
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:19,330
col... lie... did...

422
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,050
Aish, so hard. I'm so confused.

423
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,060
If you keep at it a bit longer, your spelling will become perfect, too.

424
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,440
A man who can speak ten languages while spelling beautifully, too...

425
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,460
isn't he dashing?

426
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,710
I should write Bok Sil a letter when I master spelling.

427
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,850
Of course, I won't actually give it to you, Bok Sil.

428
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,810
Miss Bok Sil, eat a lot.

429
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,410
I did my utmost to prepare these.

430
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,890
Thank you, I will enjoy it.

431
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,900
It's water from brewing Korean hedge nettle.

432
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,110
Do you know Korean hedge nettle?

433
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,530
Of course, it's a good herb for preventing dementia.

434
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,640
You have to cure it well to minimize nutrient loss.

435
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,820
Next time, let me dry it for you.

436
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,010
You put in plum syrup instead of sugar.

437
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,070
Plum syrup?!

438
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:53,220
How did you know I put in plum syrup here?

439
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,890
I just...

440
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:03,700
thought you added plum syrup, because I tasted plum syrup in the spicy bellflower root side dish.

441
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,680
But if you question me why I said you used plum syrup...

442
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,550
Go Jang Geum
Ten Red Hearts

443
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,640
I said I'd take you home, but you won't have it.

444
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:23,800
I am more comfortable riding buses. Thank you so much for the dinner invitation.

445
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,760
I will take my leave. Good night.

446
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,930
Okay, when you get home, you must call me and let me know that you've arrived safely.

447
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,950
- Yes, I understand.
- Go Bok Sil,

448
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,990
you are too stubborn.

449
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,160
I will get going.

450
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,590
Honey, I will make

451
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,300
- that girl into a Jang Geum.
- What?

452
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,490
I can make her my daughter-in-law after making her an oriental medicine doctor.

453
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,560
A daughter-in-law who is a traditional M.D., there is not much to it, after all.

454
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,070
♬ Onara onara aju ona ♬
(Means "Come, come, are you coming for good?" From Jewel in the Palace OST)

455
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,720
My daughter-in-law is Jang Geum!

456
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,090
Yes, this is Nam Joon Hyeok.

457
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,460
Ah, yes, I will come right now.

458
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,760
- It's all finished.
- Thank you every time.

459
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,190
Don't mention it. My pleasure.

460
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,220
If there is nothing more, I will be on my way.

461
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:59,720
Ah! Umm, this chair! Would you move it here?

462
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,590
Oh, the chair...

463
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,820
And this table, please turn it this way over here.

464
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,730
And, umm, would you put this chair at the end?

465
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,200
Ahh! Would you move this ladder toward the center?

466
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,700
Oh... the ladder...

467
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,770
- Omo, omo, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

468
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:33,970
But, isn't this a bit odd?

469
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,880
Oh, yes... it's very odd.

470
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,830
My heart...

471
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,370
is very odd, Mr. Joon Hyeok.

472
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,580
- Then, should I put them back to the original places?
- No.

473
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:01,620
I should... just let them be as they are.

474
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,370
There was no news of rain.

475
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,690
- You don't have an umbrella, right?
- No.

476
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,170
Then, I will take you home.

477
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,690
Since the weather turned cold, you will catch a cold if you get rained on.

478
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,400
Wh-Wh-Why are you crying?

479
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,670
Did I perhaps do something wrong?

480
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,820
How long has it been...

481
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,660
since I heard such warm words?

482
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,480
Thank you so much

483
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,320
for being so kind to me.

484
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,680
Bok Sil!

485
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:40,790
♬ In a few seconds I am exploding. You can't stop me ♬
♬ Broken Timer Switch ♬

486
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:44,690
Why isn't Go Bok Sil calling me to tell me that she arrived home safely?

487
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,050
It's even pouring rain. It's making me worried.

488
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:52,390
♬ The day I fought the piercing showers ♬

489
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,640
♬ Trapped in the cold air  ♬

490
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,340
♬ what made me soar above was your warm eyes ♬

491
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:07,980
♬ All right, all right, It's not a sudden impulse ♬

492
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,960
♬ Allow Allow ♬

493
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,970
Hello?

494
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,250
Go Bok Sil. Why aren't you calling?

495
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,800
Do you have to make me worry unnecessarily?
♬ My heart is burning white hot white hot ♬

496
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,610
I'm sorry.
♬ Like A Fire ♬

497
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,640
Hello? Hello? Go Bok Sil?
♬ As if to melt passionately my love ♬

498
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,800
Are you sick?
♬ Heart Is A Time Bomb ♬

499
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,620
♬ Dark red, dark red sky is like a fire ♬

500
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,640
The scariest thing in this world for me is thunder and lightning.

501
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,930
Bok Sil will be scared.
♬ The wait is over ♬

502
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:46,830
On days of thunder and lightning, I'm so scared, I can't sleep.
♬ Don't stare too long ♬

503
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,790
I get sick without any reason.

504
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:53,840
♬ My wings are shabby. ♬

505

♬ Yes I am Tiger Moth. Yes I am Tiger Moth ♬

506
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:06,560
♬ I'll live like a flame. ♬

507
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:34,190
♬ I want to go to be with you, who are sad ♬

508
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:44,590
♬ Even if your heart is nothing but scars, I want to have it ♬

509
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:52,800
♬ Love Is Blind, Love Is Crying, Love Is Blue ♬

510
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:02,420
♬ Though you may not know ♬
♬ Love Is Pain, Love Is Lie, Love Is Cold ♬

511
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,500
♬ I want to ♬

512
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,580
Bok Sil. My heart hurts so much.

513
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,570
It hurts so much, I think I'm going to die.

514
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,540
♬ I want to know your heart ♬

515
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,570
♬ I want  ♬

516
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:33,580
I think I had the premonition that a person's heart could hurt this much

517
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:38,040
because of another person.

518
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,370
Even if that person likes you, you can't like him.

519
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,060
Why not?

520
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,040
Because then, I think I'll become sad.

521
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,270
Back then, I already knew.

522
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:57,530
♬ Come closer in my heart ♬

523
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,340
- Grandma.
- Yes?

524
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:13,350
I want to go back to Chateau Bourron-Marlotte.

525
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,620
What? You can't.

526
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,070
I will not let you go to that faraway place ever again.

527
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:25,320
Those times I sent you far away and lived alone, because of needless concern and worry...

528
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,600
I really regret them, and they hurt my heart.

529
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,120
It was all senseless talk.

530
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:39,220
So, please stay at your grandma's side, Louie. Okay?

531
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:43,410
Only for a little bit. I'll only go for a little bit.

532
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,100
I need some time to be alone.

533
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,070
Alright, here's the double shot of Maxim Gold that you ordered.

534
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:11,360
Thank you very much. (in French)

535
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,040
Strangely, the coffee I drink here tastes the best.

536
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,340
Drink a lot before you leave.

537
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:27,710
Do you really have to go that far away?

538
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,080
I'll come back when I settle my heart.

539
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,550
What about Hyung?

540
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:38,510
That kid. How can he abandon me and leave?

541
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,820
Bad guy.

542
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,510
Get a foot disease before you go 3 miles.
(From Korean folk song Arirang)

543
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:48,220
I don't know. He just stays in his room and doesn't come out.

544
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,100
Stop by and see him when you leave.

545
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,970
Yes.

546
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,530
Ahjumma.

547
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:02,250
Please, take care of Bok Sil well. You must.

548
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,360
Bok Sil doesn't have a family, so take care of her like your own daughter.

549
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,250
Don't worry.

550
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:13,450
Without your request, I was already thinking of Bok Sil as my daughter.

551
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:16,530
Only your nagging skills improved, just like a grumpy pants old man.

552
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,730
I learned that from you.

You're saying that the company Cha Joong Won moved to is a hole-in-the-wall store with a total of two employees, including the president?

565
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:40,850
Yes. The president is a woman who used to be a contract employee on our product development team not long ago.

566
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:44,050
Her name is Go Bok Sil.

567
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:51,420
Cha Joong Won isn't in his right mind then, is he?

568
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:57,530
Yes, yes. This is the first time I've seen such a foolish career move in all my 60 years.

You shouldn't have gone far.

584
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:55,050
At least in Korea, you should have stayed under the same sky.

You've got a delivery.

00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,970
Young Master!

624
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:44,000
Young Master!

625
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,390
You should be on a plane to Paris right now! What happened?!

626
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:49,600
Did you come to take me with you?

627
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,170
Jeong Ran, something bad has happened. Young Master disappeared.

628
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,270
What?

629
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:11,100
♬ In a few seconds I am exploding. ♬

630
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,370
♬ You Can't Stop Me  ♬
♬ Broken Timer Switch ♬

631
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:17,860
♬ is heading straight for zero. I ♬

632
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,550
♬ won't stop anymore.  ♬

633
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:25,730
♬ The day I fought the piercing showers ♬

634
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:31,040
♬ Trapped in the cold air  ♬

635
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,850
♬ what made me soar above was your warm eyes ♬

636
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:41,390
♬ All Right All Right, it's not a sudden impulse ♬

637
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:45,220
♬ Allow Allow ♬

638
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:54,560
♬ My heart is burning white hot white hot, like a fire ♬

639
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:01,790
♬ As if to melt passionately my love, heart is a time bomb ♬

640
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:15,110
Why is Bok Nam here? That's Bok Nam, all right.

641
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:19,070
Wait! Ahjusshi, wait! Wait a moment!

642
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,520
Oh!

643
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,570
Oh!

644
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,340
Bok Nam.

645
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,420
Who are you?

646
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,690
Bok Nam! Bok Nam!

647
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:51,320
So you were alive, Bok Nam. I looked for you so much! You're really Bok Nam, right?

648
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,570
Your watch.

649
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:55,450
I can't give you this. My grandmother gave it to me.

650
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:03,280
Bok Nam, don't go! Bok Nam! Bok Nam!

651
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:06,670
Bok Nam!

652
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:14,710
Bok Nam! Wait a second! Wait a sec—

653
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:45,100
Hey! He's not here. He was definitely here though.

654
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:50,660
Bok Sil, your nickname is Mt. Odae Flying Squirrel.

655
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,160
What's Bok Nam's nickname?

656
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,390
Mt. Odae Narrow-mouthed Toad.

657
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:57,610
Ow, that's hot? Narrow-mouthed toad? What's that?

658
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,560
What are you saving your phone for? Look it up.

659
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,830
It looks like a frog.

660
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:10,790
Because Bok Nam is a bit tongue-tied, Granny called him that.

661
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:14,750
That's right. There's no way I can't catch a narrow-mouthed toad.

662
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,760
Bok Nam! Bok Nam!

663
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:32,540
Bok Nam! This brother won't bully you!

664
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:35,310
Wow, how does he know my name?

665
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:39,310
Don't run away! Please.

666
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,730
Ah, won't I get caught by the cops?

667
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,750
Bok Nam!

668
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,490
Bok Nam!

669
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,480
I'm sorry for that time!

670
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,420
No, no, no! You don't have to be sorry. Bok Nam!

671
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:03,600
Bok Nam! Ah, that's not it!

672
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,430
Ow, it hurts.

673
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,410
Fire Hydrant

674
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,310
So, we're going with Kim Gi Jang Seaweed?

675
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:00,580
Yes. I'm planning to proceed with it along with Kim Gi Jang Kelp.

676
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:04,820
Kim Gi Jang... The name of the owner is pretty peculiar.

677
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:09,030
His Grandfather named him that, because he was born here in Gi Jang.

678
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,280
Thank you.

679
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,780
Thank you. Let's eat.

680
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,940
Bon Appetit!

681
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:26,690
The day that I first saw you and Louis at the rooftop house, you'd dumped porridge on him, right?

682
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,650
Yes.

683
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:33,120
Do you know that Louis went back to France?

684
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:40,840
Yes. He wrote me goodbye, before he left.

685
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:45,220
He'll live well. He'll probably live well, no matter where you drop him now.

686
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,880
He's a guy who even slept like the dead in the company bathroom.

687
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:53,160
He sleeps well even on stairs or anywhere really.

688
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:59,010
The story about how Louis was raised in a hot-house,

689
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,130
don't you think it was all a lie?

690
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,300
Let's eat.

691
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,940
Yes. Bon appetite.

692
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,710
Ow, it's hot!

693
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:16,230
I have to go first, so you come back after you finish working.

694
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:17,880
Yes, sir.

695
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:24,280
If you ride the Donghae Nambu Line train from Haeundae Station, it'll take you all the way to Pohang.

696
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:28,370
Okay. I'll look into the half dried Pacific herring and Gokgang spinach and then make my way back.

697
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,750
Louis.
♬ In a few seconds I am exploding. ♬

01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:21,950
Louie.
♬ From within your time and space ♬

703
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,250
Why do you look like this?
♬ The dynamite which has been ignited ♬

704
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,200
I heard that you left for France. Why are you here in this state?

705
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,600
♬ will reduce the last traces of hesitation to powder. ♬

706
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,600
I'm Louis?
