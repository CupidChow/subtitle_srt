1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,770
Mr. Wang Louis, then in this new start,

2
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,480
when is the most memorable moment?

3
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,940
All day long,

4
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,070
♬ When Sunny Day It's Fine Day ♬

5
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,820
the times I spent waiting for you.

6
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,800
Miss Go Bok Sil, when is your most memorable moment?

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,200
♬ Where Am I and Are You ♬

8
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,350
This moment, right now.

9
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:06,870
♬ It's Dark I Can't See You ♬

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,470
So you've heard the name Louis?

11
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,330
Of course.

12
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,400
Do you know him?

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,570
Of course, I do. Louis is my— ummm.

14
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,220
He is the grandson of Chairwoman Choi Il Soon.

15
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,880
How do you know Louis?

16
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,510
Is he alive by any chance?

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,960
Yes.

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,120
My identity was being revealed.

19
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,950
Bok Sil.

20
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,190
What do I do?

21
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,610
I'm hungry. Give me food.

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,590
Of course, it's about the time that the beggar in your tummy appears.

23
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,830
He wants ramen. Three of them.

24
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,060
Okay.

25
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,660
I have to go somewhere quick. You go ahead and make ramen.

26
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,940
Where are you going?

27
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,360
It's a secret.

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,610
Don't be surprised later.

29
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,870
Soon there will be a storm.

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,290
Is it closed?

31
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,640
Bok Sil's probably very expectant.

32
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,510
I'll have to come back tomorrow.

33
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,920
Will we be able to not cry

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
in this fierce storm?

35
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,110
Episode 9
Can't smile without you

36
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,550
It is somewhat urgent to transfer the shares now.

37
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,430
I'd like to rush to arrange the paper work while the chairwoman is still in Seoul.

38
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,230
Actually, I already got a call from the chairwoman.

39
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:17,940
You did?

40
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,040
She told me to transfer all her shares to you.

41
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,210
I'm sure you heard.

42
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,230
Of course.

43
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,320
Honey! Honey, Honey!

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,360
What are you doing here?

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,880
Madam.

46
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,630
You were here, Attorney Hwang. Hello.

47
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,210
What is it that you have to come without any notice?

48
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,030
Honey, I found Louis. I found Louis!

49
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,870
Excuse me?

50
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,590
Attorney Hwang, let's talk later.

51
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,340
- Ah, how can this be?
- I'll get back to you soon with the details.

52
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,990
Ah, yes.

53
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,770
Of all times, you had to come now! Off the wall, what are you saying?

54
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,590
Earlier, a detective came to the book store,

55
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,410
and told me where Louis is.

56
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,470
What? A detective?

57
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,700
How did the detective know about your book store?

58
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,520
I have no idea about that.

59
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,710
What did you ask him, not asking the most important question?

60
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,980
Did you tell him that Louis is the grandson of Gold Group?

61
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,970
Of course I did.

62
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,570
Now what do I do with Louis?

63
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,250
HANUL Search engine

64
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,780
September 19th,

65
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,710
Kang Ji Sung, Gold Group heir, dies.

66
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,850
You can't identify his fingerprints?

67
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,130
Bok Sil brought Louis for the first time...

68
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,220
September 20th.

69
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,930
Those clothes are definitely Bok Nam's.

70
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,150
Louis was wearing Bok Nam's clothes?

71
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:36,480
Officer Oh, sorry to bother you, but can I see the traffic accident report of September 19th?

72
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,430
Why isn't he back yet?

73
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,700
The ramen is going to swell up.

74
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,110
Oh!

75
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,210
- What is it?
- Please come with us.

76
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,980
What?

77
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,310
Bok Sil! What are you doing to me? Bok Sil!

78
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,160
Where on earth did he go that he's not coming back?

79

Oh! Sil Sil Bok Sil, what are you doing at this late hour?

94
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,200
I'm sorry to come by at this time. Is Louis here by any chance?

95
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,900
Of course not. Why would Louis be here instead of that lovey-dovey house of yours?

96
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,260
Did you guys have an argument? Maybe a lovers' quarrel or something like that?

97
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,930
"Can't live with you, can't live without you." Did Louis run off after such an argument, like my dad?

98
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,740
Stop that nonsense.

99
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,710
He probably went shopping. He's an adult, why worry?

100
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,350
He said he'd be back soon and it's been an hour.

101
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,430
Did you try calling him?

102
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,190
He left his phone at home.

103
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,450
Did he suddenly get a headache and is lying on the street somewhere?

104
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,890
- Sorry?
- You didn't know?

105
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,980
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.

106
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,700
Louis passes out sometimes when he gets headaches.

107
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,870
Huh.

108
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,870
Where are you going?

109
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,020
Follow her!

110
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,050
Why are you wearing my shoes?

111
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,910
Don't fall!

112
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,090
Wait for me!

113
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,950
Louis! Louis!

114
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,260
Louis!

115
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,440
Louis!

116
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,580
Wang Louis!

117
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,950
- Louis!
- Louis!

118
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,080
- Wang Louis!
- Louis!

119
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,070
Wang Louis!

120
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,170
Oppa, this is Louis's.

121
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,740
Ah, that kid, where did he go leaving one shoe?

122
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,410
Does he think he's Cinderella or what? Don't worry Bok Sil.

123
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,590
There's still warmth in the smell.

124
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,060
He's probably playing a prank on you.

125
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,780
You don't think something serious happened to Louis, right?

126
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,630
What if he really passed out somewhere and was taken to the hospital?

127
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,070
You think he went to the Director's house? Give him a call.

128
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,140
Okay.

129
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:01,120
♬ There’s not enough time to love ♬

130
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,840
Louis is missing? When and how did he disappear?

131
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,810
Okay. I'll be there.

132
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,990
What do you mean by grandson of Gold Group?

133
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,530
So you're saying Gold Department Store, Goldline.com, G-Mart?

134
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,400
That Gold Group's heir? Louis is? Second-generation chaebol?

135
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,060
That doesn't make sense.

136
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,120
I'm sure you're shocked. I was shocked, too.

137
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,930
Wait a sec. But they said the Gold Group heir died in a car accident not too long ago.

138
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,470
I think there was some kind of big misunderstanding.

139
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,250
Mother,

140
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,000
don't be too shocked and listen to me.

141
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,420
What is it that makes you look like that?

142
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,420
Louis is

143
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,830
alive.

144
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,940
What?

145
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,510
Detective.

146
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,620
Then how did Louis end up wearing Bok Nam's clothes?

147
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,090
He probably picked them up from somewhere.

148
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,780
I told you last time, too, that it's a national track suit.

149
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,930
Every guy in Korea owns one.

150
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,350
He's right. Louis is so crazy about brand names.

151
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,800
He probably picked it up and wore it because it looks like Luis Ssaton.

152
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,970
He's right. You're a genius.

153
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,940
Thank you.

154
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,730
Anyway, Bok Sil, I think I really have to become a fortune teller.

155
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,990
Do you remember when I first saw Louis and said he looks like a 2nd generation chaebol? You remember? You remember, right?

156
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,420
Daebak,daebak, daebak! What do I do?

157
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,780
But how could he just disappear without a word all of a sudden?

158
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:52,060
When Bok Sil raised him so diligently, carrying him on her back, and feeding him all this time!

159
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,250
Have you still not found Louis?

160
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,640
What do you mean Louis is alive?

161
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:05,020
If he's alive, what has he been doing all this time without any contact?

162
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,500
Louis hurt his head and was amnesic.

163
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,060
What?

164
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,220
My Louis, where is he?

165
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,340
I have to get him right now.

166
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,130
He's on his way here right now.

167
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,870
I already sent someone.

168
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,650
Seon Gu, thank you!

169
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,500
Thank you so much for finding my Louis!

170
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,790
Don't cry on such a happy day.

171
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,230
You have to greet your grandson who came back alive from being dead with a smile.

172
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,910
Yes, yes, I should.

173
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,890
It's not a time for this.

174
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,800
- Butler Heo.
- Yes.

175
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,770
Prepare a meal with what Louis likes.

176
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,340
Yes.

177
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,990
Ma Ri's mom, help me pick out my clothes.

178
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,400
Butler Kim, check up on Louis's room.

179
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,310
It's where Louis will sleep once he returns.

180
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,160
Yes.

181
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,770
Oh my...

182
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,740
How can something like this happen?

183
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,420
Director, you really didn't know that Louis was the grandson of Gold Group?

184
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,910
How can you not know the grandson of the chairwoman when you work at an affiliated company?

185
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,390
Louis's face has never been known.

186
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,660
We only heard that the chairwoman had a grandson living in a faraway foreign country.

187
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,880
Moreover, that heir died in an accident on the day he returned to Korea,

188
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,130
and there was a funeral. How could I have any doubts?

189
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,460
Anyway, it's good that Louis found his family.

190
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,380
Now he only needs to find his memory.

191
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,670
Dude, his spending and discerning eyes were exceptional.

192
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,460
And now he surprises me this way.

193
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,870
Bok Sil, today was the most surprising day of my life.

194
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,210
Surprising days.

195
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:05,400
Just thinking of him being cocky in front of me makes my blood pressure shoot up!

196
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,140
You're in trouble now, Director.

197
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,600
Louis is alive.

198
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,310
He's on his way here right now.

199
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,680
I already sent someone.

200
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,120
President Baek, he was so suspicious in many ways.

201
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,080
But he found the Young Master first.

202
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,950
Did I have pointless doubts about him?

203
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,090
It's not time for that. Young Master is on his way.

204
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,100
I have to hurry.

205
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,780
Yeah, Dad.

206
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,880
Ma Ri. Come to Grandma's house immediately.

207
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,660
Why? I took all the makeup off and am in bed.

208
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,070
Louis will be back.

209
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,380
What?

210
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,370
Dad! What are you talking about now?

211
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,490
You said you'd send Louis off to China with Go Bok Sil.

212
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,950
I'll tell you the details later. Just get here quickly.

213
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,380
So suddenly? I'm not even mentally ready!

214
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,540
What do I do? If he recognizes me, what do I say?

215
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,840
Oh no!

216
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,660
What do I do?!

217
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,220
What? Second-generation chaebol?

218
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,440
Third-generation chaebol, to be exact.

219
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,990
Dear Lord, Buddha, Father, oh my God!

220
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,290
What lightening-out-of-the-blue kind of news is this?

221
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,500
It's not a lightening out of the blue, but long-awaited-sweet-rain like news, Mom.

222
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,290
Here, think about it.

223
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,190
Do you think Louis is a character who'd just leave us like this?

224
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,700
He is such a loyal character.

225
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,810
- Louis has a loyal side to him, like a dog.
- That's what I'm saying!

226
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,800
And he spends so much money.

227
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,040
- He tends to spend all of it on himself and others.
-Right!

228
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,930
When money's scarce, he's the kind who'd give you an apoplectic fit,

229
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,650
but now in the situation when he has tons of money?

230
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:19,590
It's game over. We and Bok Sil all be on a rosy path.

231
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,660
Son!

232
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,470
Mom!

233
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,440
- What should we do when we come into some money?
- We have to buy a house, first!

234
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,720
- Should we get a car, too?
- You have to get a job first, punk!

235
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,790
Crazy punk, crazy punk, crazy punk!

236
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,690
Let's get a scooter! Scooter!

237
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,320
No, it's too dangerous.

238
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,840
Young Master!

239
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,630
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you.

240
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,970
I missed you so much every night my heart fell apart!

241
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,430
Who are you?

242
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,170
Did you really forget me?

243
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,080
Well, your memories will eventually come back.

244
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,420
Young Master, congratulations for making a comeback as the heir of Gold Group!

245
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,390
Oh my God.

246
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,850
I'm the heir of Gold Group?

247
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,140
Yes, you are.

248
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,000
Somehow I knew I was rich.

249
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,660
Bok Sil, I finally found my family.

250
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,710
Hey, I don't have my phone.

251
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,850
Yeah, right.

252
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,840
Ahjussi, I need to go home for a little bit.

253
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,500
No way. Chairwoman is waiting.

254
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,920
It'll only be a short while. Bok Sil will be worried. She's probably waiting for me.

255
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,040
Chairwoman's been waiting for you longer.

256
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,030
I don't know who Bok Sil is, but you should see Chairwoman first, then contact Bok Sil.

257
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,540
Let's go inside, Young Master.

258
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,810
But Bok Sil's waiting for me.

259
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,420
Young Master.

260
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,470
Such a waste. I have to throw all the ramen out.

261
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,920
Where are you going?

262
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,120
Don't be too surprised later.

263
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,450
Louis, I was very surprised.

264
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,940
Young Master is coming.

265
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,000
Louis!

266
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,900
Oh my precious! Ji Sung!

267
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,430
Louis!

268
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:37,110
Don't touch him! He's mine! My grandson!

269
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,710
Ji Sung!

270
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,450
What? What?

271
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,480
Louis.

272
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,370
- His head.
- Are you okay?

273
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,480
The chairwoman said.

274
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,250
What to do?

275
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,610
Ah! My head!

276
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,300
What to do? Louis!

277
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,790
Young Master!

278
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,070
Louis!

279
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,570
Call Doctor Jeong, right now!

280
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,920
Yes!

281
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,030
Louis!

282
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,460
Why are you wearing sunglasses at night?

283
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,170
- Mom!
- You're not a roll of toilet paper!

284
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,690
What is all this? You scared Louis and he collapsed!

285
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,150
Leave me alone!

286
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,400
I have reasons.

287
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,770
Ma Ri!

288
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,800
Mom! Shhh!

289
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,940
Ma Ri!

290
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,990
Louis.

291
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,090
My precious.

292
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,330
Do you have time to talk with me?

293
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,810
Yes.

294
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,730
Well...

295
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,300
I can imagine what's bothering you.

296
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,820
What happened to Louis that day, that he wasn't in the vehicle in the accident?

297
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:40,300
How did he hurt his head and why was he wearing Bok Nam's clothes? I'm looking into them.

298
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:46,210
Since there's nothing clear, let's not talk of Bok Nam to Go Bok Sil.

299
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,340
I was thinking the same.

300
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:13,810
♬ When will it end? ♬

301
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,100
♬ That wound in the long trail of tears ♬

302
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,220
Why did you suddenly come back?

303
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,390
I was worried about you.

304
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,490
Your director asked me to live with him.

305
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,280
I will find Bok Nam for you without fail. Just trust me.

306
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,250
Just trust me.

307
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,790
I will protect you.

308
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,600
Let's get cell phones!

309
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,960
We can buy everything we need in the comfort of home.
♬ When I'm on a cold street  ♬

310
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,440
What is it? Hey!
Don't do that!

311
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,160
♬  The warmth of that day♬

312
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:01,950
♬ comes, embraces and permeates. ♬

313
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,260
I'm the only one who can eat Bok Sil's food.

314
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:15,570
♬  Seeing you from behind hurts.  ♬

315
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,570
♬  I'm not looking as you leave far away ♬

316
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,740
Are you up? This is all wet.
♬  I feel empty ♬

317
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,750
Just wait a little bit.

318
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:35,840
♬ You are like the fragrance blown away by the wind .♬

319
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,270
Is it because the sun's too hot? I can't remember a thing.

320
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,030
Bok Sil.

321
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:09,160
♬ You know I can't smile without you ♬

322
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,240
♬ I can't smile without you  ♬

323
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,300
♬ I can't laugh and I can't sing ♬

324
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,620
♬ I'm finding it hard to do anything ♬

325
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,510
♬ You see I feel sad when you're sad ♬

326
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,520
Hey, are you trying to get on the bus with me?

327
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,090
♬ I feel glad when you're glad ♬

328
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:39,280
♬ If you only knew what I'm going through ♬

329
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:45,510
♬ I just can't smile without you ♬

330
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:56,030
♬ You came along just like a song, And brightened my day ♬

331
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,610
♬ Who would've believed that ♬

332
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,730
Oh, are you here? I'm going to die. I am so dead tired.

333
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,880
I'm so tired. I had a drink last night.

334
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,260
Assistant Manager, is something going on at the company?

335
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,510
I don't know. I didn't see anything on the internet news. What could it be?

336
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,820
It definitely feels like something's going on.

337
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,700
I know, right?

338
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,800
Listen to me and don't be surprised.

339
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:30,280
My grandson Ji Sung will soon come back to Gold.

340
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,030
Chairwoman, didn't he die in an accident not too long ago?

341
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,270
There was a problem with the accident.

342
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:45,690
Ji Sung is alive, so I'd like your cooperation in grooming him to become the next CEO of the Group.

343
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,170
Oh, you're here.

344
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,390
Mother.

345
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,260
Yes. Have a seat.

346
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,880
Yes.

347
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:08,060
Half of my shares will go to Ji Sung, and the other half will go to you.

348
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:14,790
Please support Ji Sung. I can't trust anyone except you.

349
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,410
Manager, you're that happy?

350
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:39,040
That's not a talisman. You're looking at a star rating given by a one-time part timer, over and over.

351
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,030
You'll bore a hole into the paper.

352
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,350
Do you know how long it's been since I had a compliment?

353
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:48,030
At home, I get in trouble for not watching the kids and only doing work stuff.

354
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,170
At work, I get in trouble for not doing a good job.

355
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,910
In my 40's, I only get scolded so I feel even more shriveled up and worn out.

356
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,450
You'll never understand me, Do Jin.

357
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:05,640
There are times when a person feels moved and encouraged by a mere compliment.

358
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,200
Those good words make me live through tough today.

359
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:18,050
Manager, I will give you lots of compliments from now on.

360
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,160
Never mind.

361
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,530
It doesn't work like that. It needs to be sincere like Wang Louis's.

362
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,410
You're here.

363
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,700
Team Leader Baek, this is the draft of products scheduled to be uploaded today. Will you pick which one?

364
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,240
Later.

365
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,110
You know I'm not good at deciding.

366
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,070
- Can you just—
- Not now. Later!

367
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,220
Later, later, later, LATER!

368
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,950
Okay...

369
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,560
She must have something troubling her.

370
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,890
She has a harsh side to her.

371
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,070
Congratulations on not having to support Louis anymore.

372
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,500
Yes. Such a relief.

373
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,870
A troublemaker requiring a lot of attention disappeared.

374
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,200
Where am I?

375
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,270
Young Master! Have you come to yourself?

376
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,810
Ahjussi.

377
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,520
Why are you calling me ahjussi?

378
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm a bachelor! Please call me Butler Kim.

379
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,210
As usual, annoyingly playfully and affectionately.

380
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,030
Ok, Butler Kim.

381
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,220
Am I married?

382
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,900
Do I have a wife or a lover, or something like that?

383
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,400
Of course, you do.

384
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,330
You have a wife and three sons at Chateau Bourron-Marlotte.

385
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,690
They are coming here after hearing of your return.

386
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,790
Oh my God!

387
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:24,000
Bok Sil! I have three sons?

388
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,650
How old am I?

389
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,090
You're 40.

390
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,090
I'm as old as 40 years old?

391
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,290
Bok Sil and I are 19 years apart!

392
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,100
You really lost your memories, Young Master.

393
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,850
I was just playing a prank on you.

394
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,230
Why are you toying with me, Butler Kim?!

395
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,910
Now it's more like you.

396
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,820
Such a relief, Bok Sil.

397
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,580
I have to go somewhere quick.

398
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,910
- You can't.
- It'll only take a little while.

399
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,030
Ewww! A millipede!

400
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,660
Young Master!

401
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,840
Oh! You surprised me.

402
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,890
Hello.

403
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,630
I'm Chairwoman's right arm, Heo Jeong Ran.

404
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:27,450
Yes, hello.

405
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,670
First, you should have your meal.

406
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,650
Yes, I got it.

407
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,160
What's Louis's real name?

408
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,440
- Kang Ji Sung.
- Kang Ji Sung...

409
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,950
It's a pretty name.

410
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:06,850
Ask him everything you want to know about him when you see him, not me.

411
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,340
Coffee, coffee...

412
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,920
Yes.

413
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,690
How's work? Doable?

414
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,640
Yes.

415
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,520
Why do Louis and Director both keep getting involved with Go Bok Sil?

416
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,920
So annoying.

417
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,270
Do you have any plans to move?

418
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,440
Team Leader, are you here for coffee?

419
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,370
No, I was just passing by.

420
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,430
Team Leader, is there something going on at the company?

421
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,170
What happened in the lobby in the morning was no joke.

422
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,980
There will be a shocking piece of news.

423
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,420
You probably have no idea.

424
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,570
I'll be off now.

425
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,510
Yes.

426
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,710
Team Leader Baek, who's behind her?

427
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,280
So curious!

428
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,510
I'll give half of my shares to Ji Sung,

429
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,070
and the other half to you.

430
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,510
Gold Group went through all the CCTV footage from the scene of the accident that day

431
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,060
and we didn't find anything suspicious.

432
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,120
The accident happened here and the drivers were already switched.

433
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,090
Something must have happened before the car got here.

434
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:39,310
If I trace the route from the airport to this point...

435
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,410
Forensic Video Analysis Lab

436
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,780
Stop. Right here. Can you magnify right there?

437
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,440
Okay.

438
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,150
That's Bok Nam!

439
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,770
Can I check the license plate of that car?

440
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,640
Number of the accident vehicle
23 Ga 1551

441
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,220
Time Stamp: 09/19/2016 17:20:34
23Ga1551

442
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,420
That's Louis's car for sure.

443
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,440
Could I have more ketchup?

444
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,440
You never ate these kind of things.

445
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,390
This is so good.

446
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,710
Do you want to have a bite?

447
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,640
It's okay.

448
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,280
Can I have this wrapped in a bag?

449
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,170
This and that as well.

450
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,540
Bok Sil would like them.

451
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,340
I have someone to take these to.

452
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,350
- I can get dressed by myself.
- No.

453
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,690
Perfect.

454
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,390
Pack all of these please.

455
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,130
I have someone to give them to.

456
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,790
Yes.

457
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,820
I have a lot of money because I'm rich, right?

458
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,770
Of course.

459
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,540
Then can I have some money?

460
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,310
I owe Bok Sil a lot of money.

461
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:29,010
We'll start with 5,000,000 won ($5,000).

462
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,560
Isn't he by any chance a gigolo conman?

463
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,360
(Mouthing) Come here, quickly!

464
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,640
Are you sure that person is Young Master Louis?

465
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,260
Why are you asking such an obvious thing?

466
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,460
Let's have a DNA test done on him and Chairwoman.

467
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,900
It's because I just can't believe that he was the prince who used to inhabit Chateau Bourron-Marlotte.

468
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,910
It's because he lost his memory.

469
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,670
Memory or damnatory, I don't care.

470
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,140
He's packing all the expensive things and asking you for money. It's so weird.

471
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,690
Stop having useless thoughts and go back to your work.

472
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,670
What kind of woman is Bok Sil?

473
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,130
Oh...

474
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,680
Go rake in all the coins.

475
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,310
If you don't meet your quota, you might get scratches all over your body.

476
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:46,290
- Go!
- Yes.
♬ I see nobody, nobody but you. ♬

477
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:51,480
♬  I'm never confused. Hey, hey ♬

478
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,980
♬  I'm so used to being used.  ♬

479
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,530
When you get into that household, just get the lion's share of money no matter what.

480
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:12,490
Bring all the money and expensive things. Understand?

481
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,780
Go!

482
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,810
Go

483
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,620
Bok

484
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,730
Sil

485
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:41,200
Bok Sil! Bok Sil!

486
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,440
Ahjumma!

487
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,470
Has Louis called you?

488
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,650
Not yet.

489
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,290
Really?

490
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,180
He can't live without you for even half a day.

491
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,690
Is he, by any chance, brushing us all off now that he's rich again?

492
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,960
You know in the dramas, there are

493
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,760
those ungrateful bastards who, after succeeding, abandon girls who used to take care of them.

494
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,700
This Annoying Style son-of-a-bitch. Just wait until I get my hands on you.

495
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,090
I'm not going to let you be.

496
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,660
What is this? Louis the 25th.

497
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,420
Everybody, look at the reviews on our site.

498
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,040
- Why?
- What is it?

499
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:32,740
"Louis the 25th..."

500
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,400
I want to buy the ginseng you dug out. - Louis the 25th.

501
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:53,520
I'm not getting a refund this time. - Louis the 25th.

502
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,990
Coffee drunk in the employee lounge at dawn is the best. - Louis the 25th.

503
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:04,590
Who committed this act of terrorism again?

504
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:10,880
Make me 100 toasts. - Louis the 25th.

505
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,480
It'll look preety (misspelled) on you. - Louis the 25th.

506
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,070
Louis.

507
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:22,570
Don't they reek of that elementary kid Shopping King Louis from a while ago?

508
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,160
Look at his horrendous spelling.

509
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,780
Can this be, by any chance, Louis?

510
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,580
Shopping King Louis leaves and now Louis the 25th appears.

511
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,240
It's not even "Louis XIV". What does he mean by "Louis the 25th"?

512
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,280
Spam you fried for me is the best. - Louis the 25th.

513
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,420
They are like messages he's sending to someone.

514
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,170
Doesn't it... somehow... feel like

515
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,430
a love letter?

516
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,480
♬ Your Space  ♬

♬ Will I be able to wake up someday ♬

518
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:58,660
I will buy you something better than what Director bought you. - Louis the 25th

519
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,800
Aish...

520
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,130
Bok Sil. I'm doing okay.

521
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,280
I will comm (misspelled) get you soon. Wait for me.

522
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:14,130
And... call me Oppa. - Louis (in) the 25th (year).

523
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,440
So, he was 25 years old.

524
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,280
♬ Like a dream. Like a Dream ♬

525
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,130
- Are you the owner of the car #2892?
- Yes.

526
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,400
I'm Detective Nam Joon Hyeok, who called you.

527
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,250
Here is what you requested, my dash cam video files. They should include the ones from September 19th.

528
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,770
Thank you for your cooperation.

529
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,640
I'm Detective Nam, who called. Thank you!

530
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,660
Put it over there.

531
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,980
What is this?

532
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,810
Oh my! Honey! Honey!

533
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,550
What's the matter?

534
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,250
Joong Won must have a girlfriend!

535
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,920
- Really?
- Really.

536
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,680
- Bok Sil.
- Yes.

537
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,220
You called?

538
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,400
Call Ferragato Cozi at the designer brand mall and negotiate

539
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,530
the discount rate up to 40%.

540
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,140
Because the current rate of 20% is not very different from those offered at other offline stores,

541
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:54,160
we can't meet our sales goal for Black Friday at this rate.

542
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:58,320
If we lower the prices now to meet our goal,

543
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,920
it won't be fair to customers who already made purchases.

544
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,420
They'll think they lost out.

545
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,840
Are you talking back to me?

546
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,590
No... I'm just looking at this from the prior purchasers' angle...

547
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,590
Enough. Just do what you're told to do.

548
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:22,760
What do you know about designer bags?

549
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,000
Does Team Leader Baek dislike Bok Sil? She keeps cutting in.

550
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,960
Oh, that dummy.

551
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,530
You dummy!

552
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:16,530
I put it down for you. Why are you going around it?

553
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,870
- For me?
- Yes!

Young Master...

571
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,230
I'm so envious.

572
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,630
When did that pure and innocent puppy raised in the hot-house

573
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:09,570
grow into a virile lion like that?

574
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:13,530
So annoying!

575
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:19,390
♬ When I open my eyes another wind blows ♬

576
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,530
Here you go.

577
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:28,440
- It's so pretty.
- Right?

578
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,430
Please come in.

579
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,500
- How do you do?
- Hello.

580
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,490
I'm Young Master's secretary from Gold Group.

581
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,880
Hello! I'm Jo In Seong!

582
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,550
I'm Hwang Geum Ja!

583
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,550
Hair hasn't been washed for at least three days.

584
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:04,970
Sweat pants with knees popping out. Bare feet.

585
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,620
Bumming around at home.
[In Seong's pin says, "I Heart Surplus."]

586
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,550
A 99% chance of being jobless.

587
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,400
She had the son early.

588
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,250
She is too young to have such a big son.

589
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:20,250
We heard about you from the young master. You helped him a lot.

590
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,560
Yes.

591
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:27,050
Because Louis was so ignorant about the ways of the world and slow on the uptake and... Ahhhh!

592
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,690
Ah-attractive,

593
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,980
and lovely creature, I had hard time teaching and taking care of him

594
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,100
as soon as I met him.

595
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,690
Please sit.

596
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,110
Whew! So nice!

597
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,690
Get up. You'll get wrinkles on your clothes.

598
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,870
- It's okay if they get wrinkles.
- But they're nice clothes.

599
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,960
You think? Then should I change into something more comfortable?

600
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,960
No. It looks good on you.

601
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,010
Right? I look kind of cool, right?

602
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:24,130
See? I told you I felt like I used to be rich.

603
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,920
What do you want to do with your clothes and things?

604
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,720
Do you want to take them since you're here?

605
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:34,900
Bok Sil.

606
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,210
Did our Young Master really live in a small room, even with a divider like this?

607
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,440
Those kids do not have a divider, but

608
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,030
they use curtains. Very luxurious curtains.

609
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,500
Even though you may feel sorry for him, from the looks of the living arrangement, he did not have a hard life at all.

610
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,940
Bok Sil really took good care of Louis.

611
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,000
She supported him a lot, when all did was spend money like water.

612
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:02,240
Bok Sil didn't abuse him like a slave?

613
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,150
No way!

614
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,740
Louis followed Bok Sil around like a puppy.

615
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:12,220
He begged for food, money and love.

616
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,010
- Bok Sil must have had some hard time.
- Yes.

617
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:20,990
Even when Louis sucked the very marrow out of her backbone,

618
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:25,910
when Louis hankered for braised ribs, Bok Sil was the kind of girl who'd give him that, even if she had to use her own ribs to cook it.

619
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,010
Missing a few screws, huh?

620
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,380
- You mean me?
- No, Bok Sil.

621
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:35,890
Ah! She's very smart. And dreadfully meticulous.

622
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:50,640
Louis, you found your family.

623
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,570
You have to live with your family now, not here.

624
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,280
Still.

625
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:03,370
Then you come live with me.

626
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:09,030
Did you forget? You promised to stay with me until I find my memory.

627
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,990
We are still under the same sky, even if

628
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:18,780
I'm here and you're there. It's practically like we're together.

629
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:28,230
Just hurry and get your memory back so I can find Bok Nam too.

630
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,440
You said you'd find Bok Nam for me, right?

631
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,950
Of course. I will find Bok Nam for you no matter what.

632
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,010
Just trust me.

633
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,410
Bok Sil. What do I do?

634
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,070
Get away.

635
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,900
I'm hungry. Feed me.

636
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,540
Whoa, the color on this is to die for.

637
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,790
Try them on.

638
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:46,420
You too, try them on.

639
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,250
Wow, everything is a brand-name product.

640
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,570
Ah, this jerk. If he's going to give us something, he should give us something new.

641
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:56,330
What if he's giving us what he is done using and is throwing away?

642
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,230
Hey, there's even a watch!

643
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:02,450
Seeing good things, he probably thought of you and wanted to give them to you.

644
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:06,520
Louis, that kid, is quite affectionate.

645
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:12,740
Butler Kim, how much are the houses around here?

646
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,740
Are you trying to invest in real estate?

647
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,890
No. It's because I want to buy houses for Bok Sil and Hyung In Seong.

648
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:33,710
Who is ringing the bell?

649
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,760
A girl?

650
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,260
O-O-Oh my... No way!

651
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:54,410
Honey! Honey! Hey, come over here!

652
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,130
Why are you so excited?

653
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,360
She's here! She's right here!

654
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,450
Who, Joong Won?

655
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,190
No! Joong Won's lover.

656
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,070
Really?!

657
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,430
Am I looking good?

658
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,790
What do you mean, you are always beautiful.

659
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,150
What about me?

660
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:14,330
You are h-h-handsome.

661
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,190
WELCOME!

662
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,420
Hello!

663
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,590
You are Product Planning Team Leader?

664
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,240
Yes.

665
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,150
You have such skills at a young age, like Joong Won.

666
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,300
I got my MBA at Harvard,

667
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:59,100
then I got lucky and got into Goldline.

668
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:02,470
Oh! What an alpha female you are!

669
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:06,000
Why is your face so pretty?

670
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,020
Beautiful, beautiful.

671
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:13,030
For how long have you been dating Joong Won?

672
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,580
It's not been that long.

673
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,830
We've just started.

674
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:24,220
Joong Won doesn't take after me, so he's a bit rough. But look kindly on him.

675
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,280
Yes.

676
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,560
It's yours, right?

677
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:35,660
But she has a very different style from this dress...

678
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,430
It's mine!

679
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,820
Yes.

680
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,810
Team Leader Baek, what brings you to my house?

681
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,410
Director!

682
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:13,420
I'll be straightforward and confess,

683
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,660
I like you.

684
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,620
Are you okay?

685
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,160
That confession makes me feel a bit uncomfortable.

686
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,160
I'll pretend I didn't hear.

687
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,740
Director!

688
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:43,100
Why...

689
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,930
is it not me, but Go Bok Sil?

690
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:48,630
I really wanted to tell you this for some time:

691
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:53,630
Baek Ma Ri, a person's sincerity doesn't come packaged.

692
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:57,420
It might hurt, but please take it to your heart.

693
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,130
Yes, I understand.

694
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:10,450
But... President Baek, I wonder if we should

695
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:13,840
continue to keep our relationship a secret like this?

696
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,590
As for me, I don't think I can keep this up much longer.

697
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,860
President Baek?

698
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,760
Who do you keep calling from early in the morning?

699
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,070
Why do you care who I call? Why are you ordering me around? You're ridiculous.

700
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:28,550
No way. Butler Heo and President Baek?

701
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:36,700
Butler Heo. I really like you.

702
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:40,130
You are exactly my style.

703
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,690
Me, too.

704
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:52,040
Come here, Busan Double Ax.

705
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,330
I'm here, Mr. Baek.

706
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,410
NO!

707
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:15,020
Butler Heo! Why don't you date me instead!

708
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,260
Miss Jeong Ran!

709
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,320
A proposal...?

710
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,990
Do not continue such a risqué relationship anymore.

711
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:25,720
Eh?

712
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:50,460
Bok Sil, Bok Sil.

713
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:54,900
What again?

714
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,220
I waant (misspelled) to sleep nesxt (misspelled) to you.
The room here is too big.

715
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,120
Are you bragging about your large house?

716
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:05,480
It's laarge (misspelled) but feels lonely.

717
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:11,350
Bok Sil, since I beccame (misspelled) rich, I'l (misspelled) grant all your wishes.

718
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,230
I'll buy you 100 bowls of redd (misspelled) bean parfait,
I'll buy you a ring as well.

719
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,320
Go onboard a cruise, too.

720
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,790
Even when we're not together, I feel reassured.

721
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,900
Reassured?

722
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,660
Reassured??

723
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,870
Why is there no answer?

724
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:46,570
Bok Sil!

725
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,770
What again? Hurry, go to sleep.

726
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:51,130
Oh, I told you I can't sleep.

727
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:54,100
What are you doing? Are you lying down?

728
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,570
Uhm... I'm in bed.

729
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:58,660
What are you doing tomorrow?

730
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:02,380
I have nothing to do. I will come and see you.

731
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:08,270
Hey, it's late. Hurry and go to sleep.

732
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,330
You sleep first, hurry.

733
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:12,830
Okay, got it.

734
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,890
Sleep well.

735
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,990
Sleep well.

736
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:57,260
Those two met. Their clothes haven't changed, yet.

737
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,570
Louis and Bok Nam swapped places?

738
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,100
They really swapped places!

739
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,560
Bok Sil!

740
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:57,830
Detective! What brings you here so early?

741
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:01,240
What do you mean what? I came to see you.

742
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:08,600
Is it by any chance... Did you find Bok Nam?

743
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,830
Yes.

744
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,600
Really?

745
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:30,540
Detective, what has Bok Nam been up to?

746
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:33,130
No, no! Don't tell me.

747
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:36,300
I'm going to hear it straight from his mouth and break his legs.

748
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:41,630
This punk, just wait until I see you. I'm going to give you at least 100 back slaps.

749
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,400
Did he tell you whether he's been eating well all this time?

750
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,940
His face does not seem gaunt, does he?

751
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,770
I can see him myself in a little bit.

752
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:12,570
Detective, how far are we going?

753
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:22,210
Bok Sil, what I'm about to tell you,

754
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:24,630
you have to listen to it and be strong.

755
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:27,670
Bok Nam...

756
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:31,630
Bok Nam is dead.

757
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:38,830
The person who died instead of Louis in the car accident was Bok Nam.

758
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:48,340
Hurry up. I miss you, Bok Sil.

759
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:52,230
♬  You can't stop me. The broken timer switch ♬

760
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:56,080
Even so I can wait.

761
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,900
♬  I'm not going to be stopped anymore ♬

762
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,800
♬  On the day I fought the piercing shower, ♬
