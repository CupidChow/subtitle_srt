Sorry for breaking the contrect (misspelled).

00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,910
If you want the refrigerator and washing machine, I'll return them to you.

3
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,170
But widout (misspelled) those, it will be inconvenient for Bok Sil.

4
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,510
Do as you wish, Mr. Cha Joong Eon (misspelled).

5
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,810
You slippery eel-like bastard. Just wait until I catch you.

00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,280
Bok Sil! Bok Sil!

What is this uncomfortable feeling that is driving me crazy?

15
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,200
My name is Go Bok Sil! Go Bok Sil!

♬ My heart burning whitely whitely like a fire, fire ♬

I want to identify this feeling.

He sleeps there at least 3 to 4 times a week, after playing billiards.

29
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,080
Hey, what's wrong? Are you looking for someone?

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,320
By chance, do you know Go Bok Nam? I am Bok Nam's older sister.

31
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,480
It's been over a month since I've seen him.

32
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,940
Do you know where he is, by any chance?

33
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,660
How do I know where he is?

34
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,590
Bok Nam doesn't come here anymore, so don't disturb the business and leave now.

♫  Our love, our love  ♫

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,700
Is it Unni Bok Sil?

37
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,200
Aish, so persistent. Block her calls.

38
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,730
But where is Bok Nam when his sister is looking for him?

39
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,080
Please move out of the way.

40
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,730
Please move...

41
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,410
That's our house.

42
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,600
Oh my goodness. Someone died in the rooftop room again.

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,410
Oh my. Did something happen to that handsome young boy?

44
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,300
That's what they're saying. What kind of situation is this?

45
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,070
Hey, wait. Wait!

46
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,940
Are you his family?

47
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,060
I-I'm his guardian.

48
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,790
Get in.

49
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,870
Louis, come to your senses.

50
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,990
Goodness, what's going on?

51
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,910
It's so chaotic, seriously...

52
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,400
- What happened?
- I know...

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,540
Did something happen?

54
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,090
There was a robbery and murder in that rooftop room over there.

55
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,630
What?

56
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,940
- Bok Sil!
- You are not allowed to go in.

57
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,430
But I live here.

58
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,040
- Hey. Where have you been?
- What's going on?

59
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,050
I don't know. Some weird guy died in your house.

60
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,900
It's not Bok Sil, right?

61
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,870
Aigoo, seriously.

62
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,510
The phone is ringing.

63
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,740
You can't go inside.

64
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,580
Then can you get me my cellphone?

65
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,530
We can't touch anything in the crime scene.

66
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,150
The person you are calling is not answering...

67
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,480
Why isn't he answering?

68
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,580
Yeah, Bok Sil?

69
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,220
- Louis? He's next to me.
- Where are you?

70
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,440
Hey. The real question is, where have you been?

71
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,880
I went to meet you at the bus stop. Why?

72
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,460
You're okay, right?

73
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,700
Of course. Where are you?

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,840
- I'm in the ambulance.
- What?

75
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,500
Are you hurt? Where? How badly?!

76
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,440
I didn't get hurt, so stop screaming. My ear will fall off.

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,470
You, don't uselessly wander around and stay with In Seong.

78
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,080
Okay.

79
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,460
- What did she say?
- She told me to go to your house.

80
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,440
Excuse me, do you live here?

81
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,900
Yes.

82
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,040
Where were you coming from?

83
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,140
I went to the bus stop.

84
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,010
Your name?

85
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,080
It's Louis.

86
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,730
What about your last name?

87
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,880
I don't know.

88
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,840
How do you not know your last name?

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,230
Detective, he lost his memory a while ago.

90
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,610
He doesn't know who he is, where he came from, or what he used to do. He doesn't know anything.

91
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,570
Even the police said he's an unregistered person without fingerprint records.

92
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,330
Why?

93
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,380
Just say that you're sorry.

94
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,680
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,370
For now, we will take your fingerprints.

96
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,920
- What happened?
- Go up.
- Yes.

97
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,350
Eunsung-ro
93-5

98
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,290
So Bok Sil was living here?

99
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,390
- Are you okay?
- I'm not in the best mood.

100
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,080
Probably not.

101
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,110
- Louis!
- Ajussi!

102
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,760
Are you okay?

103
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,280
Bok Sil! Where did Bok Sil go?

104
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,000
She's on her way here.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,810
If I had known sooner, I would have done something.

106
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,540
But why didn't you say anything?

107
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,520
We didn't know either.

108
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,750
I didn't know either.

109
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,500
But who is he?

110
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,640
I am Jo In Seong and I live downstairs.

111
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,040
- He's an employment preparer.
- Hey, punk, aish...

112
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,950
But employment preparers are cool.

113
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,200
I found out who died instead of Louis. It's Go Bok Sil's brother.

114
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,790
You know, Go Bok Sil in my team who was hired because of her connections to Director Cha.

115
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,910
Louis was wearing Go Bok Sil's brother's clothes.

116
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,160
Don't be surprised. Go Bok Sil is taking care of Louis right now.

117
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,730
She's keeping him in the hopes of Louis's memory coming back so she can find her brother.

118
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,000
Headquarters Director Cha has nothing to do with them, though?

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,490
Why would he be involved?

120
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,690
Then why was he going in and out of that house?

121
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,380
Hello? Do you know the owner of this phone?

122
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,960
The owner of this phone is in surgery right now.

123
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,790
He had no ID, so we can't identify him.

124
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,800
Hello? Are you listening?

125
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,070
Where and how did he get hurt?

126
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,580
He hurt his head really badly.

127
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,980
What... What kind of situation is this?

128
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,120
Ah, yes. Thank you.

129
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,690
Team Leader, the victim who is in surgery right now

130
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,490
can't be identified.

131
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,260
He may be an illegal immigrant.

132
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,120
Look up his cell phone number.

133
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
There is a high chance that it was opened under another name.

134
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,640
You can get the call records and at least look for the owner.

135
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,790
I'll go to the hospital to check if there is a cellphone. It could be in his clothes. I'll be back soon.

136
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,540
- Hey, hey!
- Yes?

137
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,640
- What about the weapon we found?
- It was sent to the National Forensic Service for a fingerprint analysis.

138
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,370
Come inside.

139
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,220
Ajumma, you shouldn't do this to us.

140
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,250
I heard that you told him to keep this as a secret from us!

141
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,760
If I had been home, I would have ended up in the hospital.

142
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,160
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,850
It's scary to think that I almost died.

144
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,370
I'm really sorry. That's why I'm taking responsibility and letting you sleep here.

145
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,330
In Seong, put the blankets down.

146
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,620
I should have told you guys.

147
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,680
I didn't think something like this would happen again.

148
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,070
They say ignorance is bliss. I did it because I was afraid that you might live in fear.

149
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:29,000
That's right, Louis. You're a character who'd 100% run away from home if you knew about it.

150
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,050
That's how you think of me?

151
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,750
You have more loyalty than I thought, worrying about Bok Sil and such.

152
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,970
Everyone, it's okay as long as we're fine.

153
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,960
But Bok Sil, where did you go?

154
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,330
We were looking for you everywhere.

155
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,340
If I gave them the reward money,

156
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,030
they said they would tell me where Bok Nam is, so I went.

157
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,170
So did you see Bok Nam?

158
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,420
- He wasn't there.
- How much money did you give them?

159
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,010
- One million won (approximately $1,000).
- What?

160
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,890
Huh? Is getting scammed your occupation?

161
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,570
How can you be so naive as him?

162
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,270
Hey, Bok Sil! If something like that happened, you should have told me first!

163
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,640
Why wouldn't you take advantage of the brain in the group?

164
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,080
Brain, my behind. You're exactly like them.

165
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,060
That's what I'm saying.

166
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,350
Having to take these lacking ones under my wing and survive... All before me is black despair.

167
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,700
Aigoo my fate.

168
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,870
Oh, really.

169
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,930
Bok Sil, I'll get that money back for you no matter what. Just trust me.

170
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,480
Okay!

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,390
Aigoo! My insides are about to explode. What do you mean trust?

172
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,060
What do you mean you'll trust the endless fibs this dummy is dishing out?

173
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,300
Just leave them be. This is something you wouldn't understand with your common sense.

174
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,510
They are a couple with an incomprehensible trust system functioning between them. Just go to bed.

175
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:01,550
Just looking at them, I feel like I'll hit the ceiling.

176
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,020
But is the man who got taken away in the ambulance the burglar?

177
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,120
I don't understand why a burglar went into your house when there's nothing special.

178
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,260
And who the heck put that burglar in that state?

179
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,140
Wait a minute.

180
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,500
It can't be that rotten bastard that wasn't caught before, right?

181
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,480
I think a real serial killer lives in the neighborhood.

182
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,650
But this is already the third incident...

183
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,720
Oh, I have goosebumps.

184
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,290
Why did that policeman ask me a bunch of personal questions?

185
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,810
I'll say... The way he was asking the questions left some uneasiness in my heart...

186
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,550
Hey, are they possibly suspecting you?!

187
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,650
- What?
- LET'S SLEEP!

188
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,760
Yes, I am in front of the crime scene in Eunsung-dong.

189
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,580
Wow. It's crazy out there.

190
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,650
Mom, there are rows of cameras and reporters outside.

191
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,560
The booger-sized neighborhood streets will be jammed again.

192
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,190
Since I'm in the middle of this incident that caught the whole country's attention,

193
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,100
I get so excited

194
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,290
that it's no joke.

195
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,690
Such a silly thing to get excited about.

196
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,820
Bok Sil, fry me some ham.

197
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,480
Ajumma, do you have ham?

198
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,610
Before that, just one cup of morning coffee. Make it Maxim Gold.

199
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,110
Where is the coffee?

200
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,710
Th-Th-That bane of our existence! So particular! That thing!
- Huh?

201
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,740
- Are you the only mouth here?
- It's so delicious.

202
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,490
Bok Sil, get me water.

203
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,660
And fry me more ham.

204
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,700
- Isn't there cold water?
- Cold water?

205
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,020
- Ajumma, grill some fish for dinner tonight.
- Hey!

206
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,570
Aigoo, really, what a variety of ways you have to annoy people!

207
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:48,420
Maid 1, Maid 2, Maid 3

208
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,100
- Grilled fish...
- This annoying style, seriously...

209
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,550
Regarding the Eunsung-dong incident, the police think that the other two incidents

210
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,290
that occurred three and six months ago were done with the same modus operandi

211
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,540
and are investigating, with the focus on the crimes as a possible serial murder case.

212
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,670
However, the victim who suffered a serious head injury and underwent surgery in the hospital yesterday,

213
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,670
was discovered not to be the occupant of the house at the crime scene.

214
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,170
This fact is expected to complicate the police investigation yet again.

215
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,440
As soon as we have new information...

216
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,650
The police said the Eunsung-dong incident...

217
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,750
That house, that neighborhood feel strangely familiar.

218
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,970
Don't scare me, saying that.

219
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,050
It is rather chilling.

220
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,990
Ma Ri, you, too, should be always on your guard.

221
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,550
The police said the killer was at the crime scene...

222
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,980
Our neighborhood should be okay, right?

223
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,000
- Right?
- Yeah.

224
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,500
Dad, are you sick? You don't look so good.

225
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,500
Honey, go down to Busan.

226
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,660
To Mother?

227
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,810
Stay right next to Mother and make sure she doesn't watch the news channels.

228
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,220
Turn to a different channel immediately, if you think she's about to see the news.

229
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,850
Why? Is there something she can't see on the news?

230
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,270
Just do what you are told to do.

231
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,160
Don't ask why.

232
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,730
What is this all about again?

233
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,750
On the way to Busan. It's a lonely journey.

234
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,280
She also travels around by herself too.

235
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,600
What is her identity?

236
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,970
Honey, look at this picture.

237
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,100
- It's a selfie that is taken in the backseat of a car, right?
- Yeah.

238
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,560
Is there a chauffeur? The seats also look luxurious.

239
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,650
- Look!
- That's a nice car.

240
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,910
If she is a VVIP at a department store, she must be really rich.

241
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,040
What does her husband do?

242
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,470
When I see her next, I must get straight to the point and do a census search on her (get family, social and financial background data).

243
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,800
Is everything going okay? Should I help you with something?

244
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,400
No, I will do it. Honey, you go over there

245
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,570
and engage in your chats.

246
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,500
Team Leader, everything about this cell phone, call records was done under another's name.

247
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,000
Maybe that person lying in the hospital bed is a hit man?

248
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,800
- He has not woken up yet?
- Right, he's in a coma.

249
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,080
Team Leader! The fingerprint analysis result is in from the National Forensic Service.

250
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,460
All the fingerprints found on the weapon belong to one person.

251
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,200
- Who?
- The amnesiac man living in that house, by the name of Louis.

252
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,870
Amnesiac?

253
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,870
He was at the crime scene last night, too. I couldn't ID him, so I took his fingerprints.

254
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,240
- They coincide with the ones on the weapon.
- Since when has he lived there?

255
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,140
It hasn't been long. Maybe a little over a month.

256
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,050
How do you know that, punk?

257
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,100
He's a kid I know. It isn't him.

258
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,160
He doesn't have the capacity to commit something like that!

259
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,110
I don't need anything else. Just bring in that amnesiac named Louis or whatever.

260
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,910
Now, let's finish this quickly.

261
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:03,100
You don't know your name. You don't know your age. You don't have a job.

262
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,950
Address is the location of the crime.

263
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,940
At the time the crime was committed,

264
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,050
you went to the bus stop, but there are no witnesses who can testify

265
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,030
and you left your cellphone at home. Is that correct?

266
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,040
But it's really not me.

267
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,250
From the hammer used as the striking weapon, only a bunch of your fingerprints came out.

268
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,640
How will you explain that?

269
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,760
I used that when I peeled garlic.

270
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,890
Does it make sense to peel garlic with a hammer?

271
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,590
It was the first time peeling them, so I thought it would work better.

272
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,010
I'm not a bad person.

273
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:53,520
Detective, he can't even hurt a bug. That's the truth.

274
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,340
It's the weekend, you should rest at home. Why go outside and sweat for no reason?

275
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,490
Eat it up. I floated some ice cubes in there.

276
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,610
Yes. I'll eat well.

277
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,490
- Dad, you must have made this.
- It's a bit tasty, isn't it?

278
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,990
Didn't you put in any plum syrup?

279
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,190
Ah, I forgot.

280
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,700
Of all things, how could you forget that?

281
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,010
-I'm done!
- I'm done.

282
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,840
You're all done already?

283
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,300
Joong Won, you really have no relation with that butt-naked flower boy who was sleeping in your house, right?

284
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,100
How many times do I have to tell you that he was just a pitiful guy I took in.

285
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,340
He ran away and we don't even live together any more.

286
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,000
Young Ae, stop nagging the kid,

287
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,770
- and let's just watch some TV.
- Let's do that, Father.

288
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:15,920
Was the killer caught? There's been so much hue and cry all day long.
The Eunsung-dong crime scene

289
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,740
is in quite a lot of chaos, with countless investigators and reporters.

290
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,550
The incident that took place in the fourth floor rooftop room...

291
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,990
That is Go Bok Sil's house...

292
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,700
exactly coincides with the locations of other murders

293
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,210
and is sending a shock wave. The police suspect that the killer is still at large...

294
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,500
Go Bok Sil, where are you right now?

295
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,570
What?

296
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,850
You came again? Why don't you punch in and out every day?

297
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,860
How old am I?

298
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,240
I'm twenty-one, so

299
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,220
maybe you're twenty?

300
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,180
You think I'm younger than you?

301
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:19,490
You act just like an elementary school student, but you look older, so I'm letting you be twenty years old.

302
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:28,470
Bok Sil, not knowing oneself is a very scary thing.

303
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,630
There's a chance that I'm a bad criminal.

304
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,220
You could also be a monk who doesn't know the ways of the world.

305
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,770
Could I have been a poor person being chased by debt collectors?

306
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,550
You were probably a rich person who did nothing, but spend lots of money.

307
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,510
I could have been an orphan.

308
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:52,490
Most likely, you had a good family that took care of you.

309
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,240
I don't even know if I'm married and have a wife.

310
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,760
Oh! That can't be.

311
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:04,050
A person in whom all possibilities and impossibilities co-exist.

312
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,540
That's me.

313
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,850
♬  Where am I going? ♬

314
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,870
Louis.

315
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,350
You are a kind, beautiful and lovely person.

316
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,920
Just looking at you, I know.

317
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,200
In every person, the way they lived in the past can be seen in their present self.

318
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,750
♬ Past countless stars. Fly away. ♬

319
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,700
Bok Sil.
♬ The space where memories fell asleep ♬

320
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:40,520
Hey, what's with you?
♬ Can I wake up sometime and fly? ♬

321
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,040
Thank you.

322
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:50,010
♬ Lost the way. Lost the way. ♬

323
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,910
Wow.. being young is nice, isn't it?

324
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,740
Bravo!

325
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,250
Be quiet!

326
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,070
Separate right now!

327
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,050
Oh, Director.

328
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:16,110
His fingerprints were found on the weapon and he can't prove his alibi.

329
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,370
You can check the location of his phone at the time.

330
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,590
Unfortunately, he says he left his cell phone at home at the time.

331
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,880
We started with the possibility of use of excessive force in self-defense.

332
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,380
But I feel uneasy about how the M.O. is the same as in the past two crimes.

333
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:34,380
It's even more suspicious that his past conduct is unknown. You know that he has amnesia, right?

334
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,510
Of course. For now, I'll vouch for him.

335
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,370
I said that I'd vouch for him as well.

336
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,200
I told you that they're not the ones.

337
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,140
Detective!

338
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,690
Bok Sil, it's okay, so don't worry.

339
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,590
You too, Louis.

340
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,550
This sole has a pattern that isn't in our database.

341
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,440
Just what kind of shoes was the person wearing, so they're not even in the database?

342
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,540
Bont Riots... custom-made heat moldable shoes.

343
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,000
They're shoes that are worn for cycling.

344
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,360
You couldn't find the pattern because they use carbon composite construction

345
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,130
to mold by heat, based on the rider's sole and arch.

346
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,470
It's custom made.

347
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,950
These.

348
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,320
It's like these shoes.

349
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,130
There aren't that many places that sell those kinds of shoes, so go investigate.

350
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,700
The culprit could be someone who is a good cyclist.

351
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,280
How did you know that?

352
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,310
Were you a professional cyclist? Can Louis try riding it once?

353
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,270
Can I ride it?

354
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,940
Sure, try riding it.

355
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,420
Ah, I can't. This won't do.

356
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,260
How does someone who doesn't even know how to ride a bicycle, know about cycling shoes?

357
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,480
Maybe you were a shoe-a-holic?

358
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,150
Is that it?

359
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,260
You two will stay at my place for the time being.

360
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,990
It's bothersome and annoying, but I'm being charitable. Just know that.

361
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,270
Follow me.

362
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,730
He definitely has a personality disorder.

363
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,080
- What are you talking about?
- He's watching.

364
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,180
For now, let's go.

365
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,040
I should carry those, but my body is not well yet. I'm sorry, Bok Sil.

366
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,580
Carry what, when you're still plastered with pain patches? Don't worry, I'll do it.

367
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,840
There are a lot of things there. The refrigerator is big, and the house is big too.

368
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,580
I'm crazy. Crazy.

369
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,910
What am I doing right now?

370
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,080
What kind of enemies were we in a former life?

371
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,520
Ah, dammit!

372
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,750
The repair is all done. I'm sure you'll like it.

373
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,380
Thank you.

374
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,980
Ta-da! A pink item that you like so much!

375
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,460
I love it!

376
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,840
Is it pretty?

377
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,810
The best.

378
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:58,830
I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation, Madam. But I have something to ask you.

379
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,740
Me?

380
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,270
What is it?

381
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,680
Just a moment will do.

382
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,770
Last time, why did you touch the young master's teeth storage box?

383
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,980
How did you know that?

384
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,990
You made it, so that it was noticeable.

385
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,690
Teeth

386
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,510
Oh my.

387
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:32,240
Just why would you take a tooth, when you came for a watch repair?

388
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,710
It seems that one of the upper teeth is gone.

389
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,290
That... To tell you the truth...

390
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,630
My husband...

391
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,550
No, President Baek asked me to do so.

392
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:51,920
I asked why too, because I was curious, but he didn't tell me.

393
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,820
Don't you think perhaps he needed it to get some kind of talisman?

394
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,010
My husband said that it was not a big deal.

395
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,730
What are they saying?

396
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,530
What?!

397
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,990
I heard that you asked her to bring Young Master's watch and tooth.

398
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:13,270
Madam told everything to Butler Kim.

399
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,350
Dad, is something wrong?

400
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,540
Call your mom right now.

401
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,080
I understand.

402
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,520
It's nothing. Please keep working hard.

403
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,620
She's not answering.

404
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,390
Oh, Mother, your sense of humor is really unique.

405
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,970
You sure have a lot to laugh about.

406
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,970
Ah, seriously.

407
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:48,340
Butler Kim, turn the TV on so I can watch the news.

408
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,950
Yes.

409
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,850
It's been a long time.

410
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,610
Tired?

411
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,260
You should act like a man.

412
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,560
Bok Sil, fill up the tub with some water.

413
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,840
You fill it up. I'm going to wash up.

414
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,420
Sure. Should I fill it up with cold water?

415
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,630
Make it 36.5 degrees.

416
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,880
Yes sir.

417
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,270
I'm sorry. Since you have lived with him before, you will know

418
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,620
he is not quick to get the drift.

419
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,110
Why should you be sorry? Don't apologize.

420
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,350
Yes.

421
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,560
Here.

422
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,840
Director, thank you so much for taking us in when we had nowhere to go.

423
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,060
Don't say things like "thank you."

424
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,280
If it really must be said, you shouldn't do it. Tell that guy Louis to do it.

425
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,440
And you, use that room. Louis can use the room he was using before.

426
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,470
I hate when things get in the way, so do your best to stay out of the way.

427
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,750
Understand?

428
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,110
I understand.

429
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,440
Clean this up.

430
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,380
Yes.

431
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,540
Please rest!

432
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,970
Wow!

433
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,470
Go Bok Sil, don't touch anything.

434
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,930
Yes.

435
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,590
Oh, wow!

436
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,990
It's okay to eat anything in the fridge.

437
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,820
If you do laundry, hang it there. Sort the recyclables there neatly.

438
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,480
What?

439
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,000
Hang the laundry there, and sort the recyclables there!

440
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,690
Yes.

441
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,000
He said to stay out of the way, but why does he keep following me around?

442
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,770
Go Bok Sil, sleep on this one and use this one as a blanket.

443
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,460
Ah, yes. Give it here.

444
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,210
No, I will lay it out for you.

445
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,830
- Give them to me.
- No! I will do it!

446
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,260
- I said I'll do it!
- I...

447
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,710
No, I'll do it!

448
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,460
What are you two doing?

449
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,770
Oh! I was trying to make my bed when...

450
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,990
It's fine. Don't explain everything in detail.

451
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,670
You didn't do anything wrong.

452
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,580
- As for dinner—
- I'll prepare it—
- I will order in.

453
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:33,600
Bok Sil, don't get too close to Director.

454
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,540
What's that nonsense again?

455
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,090
Don't be angry at the house owner, who's letting us live here and be nice to him.

456
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,450
What are you doing?

457
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,920
Give me a massage.

458
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,990
I'm still in a lot of pain.

459
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,190
Get up quickly.

460
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,830
The victim of this crime I have reported to you earlier

461
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,750
is still unconscious after emergency surgery.--

462
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,080
The police said this Eunsung-dong incident...

463
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,550
All the news is negative these days.

464
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,920
There's nothing that helps with your mental well being.

465
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,270
Mother, let's watch something else.

466
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:28,050
Hey, it's distracting. Just leave it.

467
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:33,420
Uh. Ah! Should we watch "Real Story: Eye." which you like, Mother?

468
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,700
The police said the killer at the crime scene...

469
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,470
The thing that made Grandmother Kim Soon Ja this lonely

470
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,560
could have been everyone's indifference.

471
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,780
Shouldn't we all think deeply about it once more?

472
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,950
Oh, it's over.
Next, we are waiting for your tips.

473
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,400
On the afternoon of October 12th,

474
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,800
a man was running through the streets with pain patches all over his body. We're searching for this man.

475
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,260
The male subject ran approximately 10 kilometers from Hyeonwoon-dong to Eunsung-dong.

476
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,980
He was witnessed running with pain patches on.

477
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,940
An eyewitness at the time filmed and provided this footage...

478
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,850
That person...

479
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,530
Isn't that Louis?

480
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,840
But Louis is dead.

481
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,160
Wouldn't it be someone who resembles him?

482
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,730
The line from his neck to shoulder, the angle...

483
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:22,340
The precise head to body proportions of 8.2!

484
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,640
According to my analysis, that physique belongs to Young Master Louis for sure.

485
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,350
- What?
- Impossible.

486
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:32,340
What do you mean it's Louis?

487
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,520
Find out immediately! Hurry!

488
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,170
Yes.

489
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:41,280
But what is happening?

490
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,020
Louis. Ji Sung.

491
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,130
Mother! Mother, relax.

492
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,600
- Oh, you're going to collapse like this!
- I'll check the blood pressure.

493
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,530
Mother!

494
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,400
Did you starve all day long?

495
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,400
Please order me one more bowl.

496
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,010
Eat this. This!

497
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,180
No.

498
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,790
The meat is tough and has the taste of being fried thrice in oxidized oil.

499
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,240
Just eat it!

500
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:29,560
Excuse me... Can I please also eat one more bowl of it?

501
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,340
Is this the Chinese restaurant? Please bring here two more bowls of black noodles, with the sauce on the side.

502
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,510
Thank you.

503
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,260
Bok Sil, water.

504
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,280
Stop right there!

505
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,380
Keep eating.

506
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,000
Oh, a rag, a rag.

507
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,080
Sit down! Hey! You clean it!

508
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,290
Yes.

509
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,640
- Stop it.
- Ow, that hurt.

510
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:54,260
Butler Cha

511
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,960
Should I do the dishes?

512
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,640
No, I'll do it.

513
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,570
Forget it. I'll do the dishes.

514
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,880
You two are getting in my way. Just go and watch some TV.

515
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,410
Today, it'll be totally fun.
Butler Cha

516
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,740
What's the plot?

517
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,050
That man is an amnesiac.

518
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,840
- And that woman abandoned him.
- Why?

519
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,760
Because he's a beggar. But it turns out that man is a second generation chaebol.

520
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,990
Today is the day that his real identity is revealed, so she's going to have a fit and faint today.

521
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,770
It's fun, right?

522
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,040
I'd like a cup of Maxim Gold!

523
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,220
Hey! I'll make it for you.

524
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,590
Just watch TV!

525
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,040
She's going to have a fit.

526
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,710
She's going to have a fit.

527
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,890
Just why am I doing this?

528
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,420
President Baek, it's me.

529
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,570
What did you just say?

530
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,900
On TV, a person who looked just like Master Louis appeared.

531
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,650
There was a big commotion.

532
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,330
Butler Kim went up to Seoul to find the young master.

533
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,780
Butler Kim did?

534
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,370
The Chairwoman is sleeping right now.

535
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:56,000
She's so shocked that she had to take a sedative.

536
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,810
Either use the replay function to watch the program or

537
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,780
try calling the broadcast company.

538
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,410
That guy sure looked a lot like the young master.

539
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,270
Hello?

540
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,880
President? Are you listening?

541
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,740
President!

542
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,430
For now, just make sure Mother is in good health.

543
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,540
I'm hanging up.

544
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:40,470
Honey, I found Louis.

545
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,960
While watching TV, I flipped the channel to 11, and

546
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,930
right there, at that moment, a strange man who resembled Louis appeared.

547
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,920
Everyone was so shocked that they couldn't say a word,

548
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,480
but I yelled out, "Isn't that person Louis?"

549
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,270
Honey, I did well, right?

550
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:00,450
If it weren't for me, we all might have missed that broadcast.

551
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,990
Why are you doing this to me?

552
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:07,610
Just why the heck are you doing this to me, your own husband?!!!

553
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:12,290
I abhor the sight of you, so don't ever appear in front of my eyes again!

554
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,310
Hello? Hello?

555
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,180
Why is he angry at me?

556
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,170
Secretary Goo is bedridden.

557
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,520
The whole country is up in arms about that case.

558
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,360
And what sort of added bomb is this?

559
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,870
What are you doing here, not sleeping?

560
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:55,440
To soak the rice. That way, it will taste better.

561
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,060
I'm going to make breakfast. So don't do anything.

562
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,580
I'm saying don't interfere with my housekeeping rights.

563
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,370
I will do it.

564
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,870
I said I would do it.

565
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,850
- I'll do it.
- I will do it.

566
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,040
- I'll do it.
- I will do it!

567
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,300
I'll do...!

568
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,540
Such a waste...

569
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,740
I'll do it. Go and rest.

570
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,810
No need. You go and rest.

571
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,240
Headquarters Director, can I give you a nickname?

572
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,490
Verbal Meanie.

573
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,270
What?

574
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:42,160
I've noticed that you say such mean things, but all your actions are the total opposite.

575
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,740
Where did you learn such things?

576
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,870
When did I? Clean up everything here, without leaving a single grain of rice behind, before going to bed. Got it?

577
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,370
Yes, yes. Don't worry and go to bed.

578
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,070
I will make you breakfast tomorrow morning.

579
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:02,140
That's the least I can do, when we are imposing on you.

580
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:27,130
♬  Perhaps love is like a resting place, a shelter from the storm ♬

581
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:33,450
♬  It exists to give you comfort. It is there to keep you warm. ♬

582
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:39,600
♬  And in those times of trouble when you are most alone ♬

583
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:45,440
♬  The memory of love will bring you home. ♬

584
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,990
♬  Perhaps love is like a window, perhaps an open door. ♬

585
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:58,490
♬  It invites you to come closer. It wants to show you more. ♬

586
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:04,370
♬  And even if you lose yourself and don't know what to do ♬

587
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,170
♬  The memory of love will see you through. ♬

588
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,210
I feel strange.

589
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,170
What is this feeling?

590
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:16,300
♬  Oh, love to some is like a cloud, to some as strong as steel. ♬

591
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:22,140
♬  For some a way of living, for some a way to feel. ♬

592
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:27,950
I can't fall asleep.
♬  And some say love is holding on and some say letting go. ♬

593
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,990
♬  And some say love is everything ... ♬

594
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,990
You scared me.

595
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,230
Why are you up already?

596
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,000
I couldn't sleep a wink.

597
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,040
What?

598
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,180
Why? Was the bed uncomfortable?

599
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,480
My heart felt uncomfortable.

600
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,510
What nonsense is this from early in the morning?

601
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:09,850
Do you want some help?

602
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:13,410
For you to do nothing is to help me. Just stay still.

603
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,810
Then, I will be watching you.

604
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:44,240
Hey, go and watch TV. You're distracting me.

605
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,900
No, I should at least do this.

606
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,720
Goldline Luxury Goods Store
2016 FW Luis Ssaton ...

607
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,410
That's right! Who am I, after all?

608
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,850
Is breakfast ready?

609
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,180
Really...

610
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,020
Do all men own that track suit?

611
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,070
Even if all men do, the pedigrees are different.

612
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,180
Mine is a limited edition, authentic one.

613
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,420
That one is a counterfeit from a countryside market. Look closely.

614
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,810
Mine is a work of art infused, stitch by stitch, with the sweat of the French master artisan.

615
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:32,490
That one, you can tell by just one glance, is cheaply printed.

616
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,620
Now that you say so...

617
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:39,010
Right, they are very different.

618
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:45,240
I have this feeling that I went around wearing Number 1.

619
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,220
As if.

620
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:58,920
Go Bok Sil, you've worked hard.

621
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,250
Now, then, let's eat.

622
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,120
What the heck are you doing right now?

623
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,180
Bok Sil's food is for my mouth only.

624
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,120
Hey, why are you acting like this?

625
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,780
The meal you prepared is for my mouth only.

626
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:47,920
I am sorry.

627
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,450
Buy yourself whatever you want to eat and wait at home.

628
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:04,310
I don't want to.

629
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,180
Are you feeling sick? You just picked at your breakfast food and now you're saying no to allowance money?

630
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,550
Go Bok Sil, let's go.

631
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,020
Yes.

632
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,020
Where are you going?

633
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,550
I will take you.

634
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:17,830
I will give her a ride.

635
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,710
That's convenient.

636
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,860
I have to stop by somewhere myself.

637
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,150
The car is really nice, right?

638
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,160
I have a feeling that I rode cars that were so much nicer than this one.

639
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:53,340
I feel that I owned about 100 pairs of shoes.

640
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,240
Even the house... I think I used to live in a castle.

641
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,460
You're full of hot air, aren't you?

642
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,630
What did you say?

643
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:06,740
If it is good for your mental health, be that way. It won't hurt anybody else.

644
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,240
Dad!

645
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,310
Your complexion is even worse than yesterday. Why on earth are you like this?

646
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:37,850
Is it because of your installation ceremony?

647
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:42,330
Ma Ri, that is not the problem right now.

648
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,920
I am Kim Ho Joon who has contacted you before.

649
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,720
Ah, yes.

650
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,020
I am sorry it's early in the morning, but this is such an urgent matter.

651
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,790
Butler Kim has called.

652
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,360
He has already met the PD from the broadcasting company

653
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,210
and they've decided to look for the young guy together,

654
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,820
while sharing the real-time tips coming through the social networking sites.

655
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:11,580
The broadcasting company does not have any noteworthy information yet, either.

656
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:17,220
Jeong Ran, you go up to Seoul, too, and help Butler Kim.

657
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:21,210
What? You're telling me to go around with Butler Kim?

658
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,470
I don't want to.

659
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,630
I don't want to.

660
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,330
You dislike Butler Kim that much?

661
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:39,290
That's right. I dislike him.

662
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,970
It's because you don't know him well. But Butler Kim is a decent guy.

663
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,690
He's so smart.

664
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,300
He is also very responsible and honest to a fault.

665
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,870
But, then, why didn't he get married yet?

666
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,850
I guess he hasn't met his match yet.

667
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,320
He looks like he wouldn't be able to meet his match.

668
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:06,210
If you hate it so much, should I ask Mother on your behalf not to send you?

669
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:10,730
Since it's the chairwoman's order, I should follow it.

670
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:13,060
See you later.

671
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,260
Ahjumma, I will do it. Give it to me.

672
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:28,260
Omo, this kid... Why would you clean with these hands that handle important work? Leave it.

673
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,710
But your back hurts.

674
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,950
You don't know anything, do you? If a pencil pusher does cleaning, that means I will lose my job.

675
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:38,290
Don't touch the source of my bread and just work hard at your job.

676
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,630
Yes.

677
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,740
Are the conditions okay at the director's house?

678
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,440
He is not treating you guys badly, is he?

679
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,960
No.

680
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:54,600
I'm not worried about you, it's Louis I'm worried about.

681
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,380
It's not like he's lacking a little.

682
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:01,450
Like a kid playing alone by a waterside, he's a pis, pis (short for "pigonhan style"; Worrisome Style).

683
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:04,700
The tiring type?

684
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,180
Yeah.

685
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,400
Give me the money. (Spelled incorrectly)

686
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,090
- What the heck? Who's pulling this prank?
- Hey, what is it?

687
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,640
Donjo? (spelled incorrectly, it means "give me money".)

688
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,000
What's that?

689
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,730
What do you mean what? It's the name of a Joseon king.

690
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:28,810
Yeongjo, Jeongjo, Donjo ("don" can also mean pig), you don't know?

691
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:33,440
Wow, you really are the brain of the group. So amazing.

692
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,220
- Give me the money, give me the money, give me the money.
- Wow, it keeps coming.

693
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,030
Give me the money, give me the money, give me the money.

694
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,260
Block the number.

695
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,360
- Aish.
- Why?

696
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:51,150
Hey, it's because you're sending these kinds of messages that the kids are blocking you right away.

697
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,300
And what do you mean "geeve me money"? It's spelled "gimme" (In Seong gets it wrong, too).

698
00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:00,180
Aish, so frustrating. The brain cannot help but interfere here.

699
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,930
Hey, look.

700
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,980
Here, call again with this phone.

701
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,480
"I am Director Jo In Seong from the Financial Fraud Investigation Team 1 of the Financial Supervisory Service." Like this.

702
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,750
You know, like when you got voice phished.

703
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,100
I am Director Jo In Seong from the Financial Fraud Investigation Team 1 of the Financial Supervisory Service.

704
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,990
There was a report that you got scammed.

705
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,720
This f*#%ing stupid assh@%* mother-$#%&er!

706
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,350
They're no joke.

707
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:41,050
Right? They're scary kids.

708
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:46,090
During the Korean Black Friday Sales period, our Goldline will have a big sale event as well.

709
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,940
Then we need to update the vendor list after negotiating the discount rates with them.

710
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,770
That's right. Come up with an event that can motivate purchasers to join Gold Pay.

711
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:56,440
Also, think about a way to promote it online including at main web portal sites.

712
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,490
What about making a Black Friday tab on our main page?

713
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:04,460
We'll think about that when we get more vendors and products willing to participate.

714
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:08,410
For some reason, I think that the workload will increase a lot.

715
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:10,640
I can do it.

716
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,480
You alone will not be enough.

717
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:18,590
Manager Lee, once again, you are the first one to realize that the workload will increase.

718
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:20,690
How can you possess such amazing talent,

719
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:24,910
I cannot help but be awe-struck by it.

720
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,530
Manager Lee, find a short-term temporary part time worker.

721
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:31,120
Yes.

722
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:41,740
You said Louis lives with Go Bok Sil, right?

723
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:47,230
You know that rooftop house where an attempted murder took place the day before yesterday?

724
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,990
It's the place they live in.

725
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,670
What? Then, Louis got hurt?

726
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:56,830
Louis is safe. Someone else got hurt, so don't worry about that.

727
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:01,710
We need to first find out where Louis is and how he's doing.

728
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:06,480
Asking Go Bok Sil will be the easiest way to find out, right? As nonchalantly as possible.

729
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,980
Bok Sil.

730
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:20,040
I saw the news. You must be shocked. I heard the culprit wasn't caught.

731
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,230
It must be scary.

732
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,590
Thank you for worrying.

733
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:29,480
Where are you staying? There must not have been many suitable places.

734
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,500
I've just been...

735
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:37,060
living downstairs.

736
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,230
Downstairs?

737
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:39,620
Yes.

738
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,620
Ah, it's so narrow.

739
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,040
Is this where she lives?

740
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,520
Do people actually live here?

741
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:59,040
Hello, stranger.

742
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:11,870
♬ She may be the face I can't forget ♬

743
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:15,660
♬ The trace of pleasure or regret ♬

744
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:19,450
♬ May be my treasure or the price ♬

745
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:23,160
♬ I have to pay ♬

746
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,700
The culprit isn't caught yet. Is there something else you're curious about?

747
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,390
Are you a reporter?

748
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:31,380
No, you know the focus of the police investigation is on how this may be a possible serial murder case.

749
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,320
- Are you a detective?
- No.

750
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,980
I am...

751
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:42,450
I am Jo In Seong. Nice to meet you.

752
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,540
This is my home.

753
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,860
In Seong's pin: Okay Style

754
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,080
Who are you?

755
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,170
How is the condition of the patient in Room 607?

756
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,570
I'm a police officer.

757
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:32,920
His vitals are stable, but he's not conscious yet.

758
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,220
Another person already asked about that though.

759
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:39,760
Oh, Detective Kim must've stopped by.

760
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,700
Work hard.

761
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:51,910
Look here. Below this picture, there is a comment about how he was seen in this hospital.

762
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:55,640
"He is the patient who made a scene in our hospital emergency room a while ago."

763
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,550
Nurse Moon must've made this comment.

764
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,720
Where is she?

765
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,960
It's her day off. Please come back tomorrow.

766
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:10,080
President Baek? President Baek Seon Gu!

767
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,610
Butler Kim, why are you here?

768
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,050
What brings you here, President?

769
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:28,100
Oh, my friend was admitted here.

770
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,710
I stopped by.

771
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,510
I see.

772
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,800
Hey, we should eat together!

773
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,500
Oh, totally my style. Is this different from what we had before?

774
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,590
- Yes, it's Korean pork, domestic.
- Yum yum yum, Korean pork...

775
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,300
It's so delicious. Can't we eat this again for breakfast tomorrow?

776
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:05,770
Director, hurry come! The meat's done cooking!

777
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:06,810
Hold on!

778
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:07,770
Who cares if he doesn't eat.

779
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:09,270
Hey.

780
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,860
Hurry up!

781
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,200
Ah. He's here.

782
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:38,640
Whose is this?

783
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,320
- It's mine. Give it.
- I don't want to.

784
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,950
- Give it to me already.
- I don't want to.

785
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:46,980
I said I don't want to.

786
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,040
It's mine...

787
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,110
I said I don't want to!

788
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,240
Hey! Let me see, let me see.

789
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,890
You burned yourself. What is this?

790
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:06,540
What else? It's the first coin you gave me.

791
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,130
Hold out your hand.

792
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,510
Five-hundred won for every time you do the dishes.

793
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:24,810
♬ I'm going to explode in a few seconds, you can't stop me  ♬

794
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:27,460
♬  The timer switch is broken ♬

795
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:32,470
♬ I'm running to zero, I won't be stopped anymore. ♬

796
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,940
Geez, the grease is everywhere.
♬ From within your time and space ♬

797
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:41,320
♬  The dynamite which has been ignited ♬a

798
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:45,190
♬  will reduce the last traces of hesitation to powder. ♬

799
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,150
Why are you looking at me like that, Bok Sil?

800
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,820
♬ All right. All right.

801
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,450
Dummy.
♬  It's not a momentary impulse. ♬

802
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:59,450
What? Dummy? You're dumber, Bok Sil.

803
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:00,950
Dummy.
♬ My heart is burning white hot white hot ♬

804
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:04,840
Huh? What, you dummy?
♬ ♬  Like a fire ♬

805
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,110
The dummy is smiling?

806
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:13,310
♬  As if to melt, passionately, my love. Heart is A Time Bomb. ♬

807
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:16,400
The sky's color is dark red, dark red..

808
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,110
It's red.
♬ Like a Fire (fire) ♬

809
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:20,900
Show me the coin.
♬  The wait is over.  ♬

810
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,070
No!

811
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,950
Hurry.

812
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:27,550
Ah, Bok Sil.

813
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:31,240
♬  Don't stare for a long time ♬

814
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:38,900
♬  Because my wings are shabby ♬

815
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:43,690
♬ Yes, I'm a tiger moth ♬

816
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:46,550
♬ Yes, I'm a tiger moth ♬

817
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:53,400
♬  As if to melt passionately my love. Heart is a Time Bomb. ♬

818
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,920
♬ Yes, I'm a tiger moth ♬

819
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,560
♬ Yes, I'm a tiger moth ♬

820
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:06,480
♬  I will live like the flame.  ♬

821
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,080
It's me.

822
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,160
I just saw President Baek Seon Gu at the hospital.

823
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:29,340
I'm not sure. I don't know where he went.

824
01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:00,070
Who is it at this hour?

825
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,830
It's past 11 p.m.

826
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,530
President Baek?
