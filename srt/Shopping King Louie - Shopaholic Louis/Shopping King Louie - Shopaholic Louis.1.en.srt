This is a time when the world is connected as one.

♬ If I rush, all the more I'll get caught violating the speed limit. ♬

You have a delivery!
♬ Navigation should obey the rules and signals ♬

Episode 1
Pick Me

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,340
We are going to use Louis Ssaton tracksuits to promote our site's brand-name goods mall.

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,750
Louis Ssaton brand is a high-end brand,

25
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,920
but in the case of the tracksuit, as soon as Lee Min Ho wore it in his drama,

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,330
there have been too many copies made.

27
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,610
There was only one of these left. Looks just like the original.s

28
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,640
It's a class-A copy.

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,250
Wow, Bok Nam!

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,610
It's being called the national tracksuit. All over the nation, women, men, old and young alike,

31
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,660
are wearing Louis Ssaton tracksuits.

32
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,760
Wouldn't it be too hard to use this item for publicizing our brand-name goods mall?

33
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,470
Is that really what everybody thinks?

34
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,460
Ah, well....

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,800
GoGod

36
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,390
Louis Ssaton
2016 FW Millenium Lofter M10 Special Edition

37
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,900
At 12 p.m. Korea Standard Time on August 15th, in the brand-name goods mall on our site,

38
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,030
we will sell a special edition Louis Ssaton tracksuit,

39
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,630
but just 100 as a limited edition.

40
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,490
And since it's a special edition, Louis Ssaton will inscribe each tracksuit with numbers from 1-100,

41
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,560
and our Goldline is the only one selling that.

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,070
In a word, an exclusive contract. Exclamation point.

43
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,670
Serial no. 1 is 10,000,000 won, no. 2 is 9,990,000 won.

44
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,770
As the number goes up, the price goes down by 10,000 won, so no. 100 is sold for 9,000,000 won.

45
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,580
It'll be the first time an item had multiple pricing.

46
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,600
Now in a minute, shopping maniacs will come to our site

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,530
and go crazy trying to buy this item.

48
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,270
They will do whatever they can to buy the lowest serial number at the highest price possible. Why?

49
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,270
The moment a number gets put on the tracksuit, it'll become the only one in this world.

50
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,760
That is the draw of a limited edition.

51
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,180
GOLDLINE Brand-name/Goods/Mall serving 100 special buyers

52
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,730
Buy

53
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,160
Five, four, three, two, one.

54
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:29,820
Please wait for a moment...

55
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,780
Mr. Louis, thank you for purchasing 'NUMBER 1'

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,370
Oh yes! Number one!

57
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,620
Woo! Yes!

58
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,890
Sold Out

59
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,820
Since it's me, I can't be the one wearing Number Two.

60
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,510
Don't you think so, Butler Kim?

61
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,010
Congratulations.

62
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,830
There's a big problem, Headquarter Manager. The Louis Ssaton special edition...

63
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,940
It sold out in 10 seconds!

64
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,480
Visitors to the Brand-name goods mall have increased more than 100 times.

65
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,200
The page view numbers are amazing too.

66
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,300
I think our Goldline Brand-name Goods Mall was property promoted this time.

67
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,410
This is amazing!

68
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,710
By the way, who do you think bought the 10,000,000-won Number One?

69
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,080
- Mr. Louis.
- Yes, thank you.

70
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,390
King of shopping.

71
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,220
Hello.

72
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,080
Hello.

73
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,580
King of shopping. (Mandarin, gou wang)

74
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,530
The Shopping King (In multiple languages)

75
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,530
Shopping King, Louis.

76
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,350
It's time to eat breakfast.

77
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,970
Let me take a nap first.

78
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,690
I'll have brunch instead.

79
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,540
There will be new items in the boutique today.

80
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,270
If my analysis is correct,

81
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,280
if you don't get there before noon,

82
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,540
the sunglasses your heart reserved will be sold out.

83
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,680
We should go then. Let's go.

84
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,270
Perfect.

85
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,440
- Bonjour, Elsa.
- Bonjour, Maître Louis.

86
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,930
Oui.

87
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,530
Butler Kim, I'm all ready.

88
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,160
- Good morning, Maître Louis.
Good morning.

89
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,290
I'm in a hurry, so make a sandwich so I can eat on the way.

90
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,690
You must eat rice for breakfast before you leave.

91
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,500
We don't have time. Come quickly.

92
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,340
It's from the chairwoman.

93
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,380
Sit down. If I were you, I would use this time to eat it fast.

94
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,190
But they will be all sold out!

95
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,320
From the chairwoman.

96
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,490
Please eat slowly. The chairwoman...

97
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,400
I told you that I don't have time.

98
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,430
But why is there so much rice today?

99
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,800
Please give me Panama Geisha coffee.

100
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,550
Master! Here.

101
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,170
- Ugh.
- Ding Dong Dang.

102
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,560
It's herbal medicine for your stamina during the summer.

103
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,280
- This is the chairwoman's orders. No coffee for two weeks.
- Ahh! Seriously?!

104
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,920
Master! Master!

105
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,980
I'm not going to drink that!

106
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,150
Master! Master!

107
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,900
Why are you doing this!

108
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,070
Master! Master!

109
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,760
Seriously. I'm not going to drink that!

110
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,320
Master! Master!

111
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,250
Master!

112
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,830
Bonjour, Maître Louis!

113
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,660
Bonjour.

114
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,600
Master!

115
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,580
Don't come!

116
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,000
You must drink this.

117
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,360
I said I'm not drinking that!

118
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,280
Please don't get up.

119
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,400
Don't get up!

120
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,500
Master!

121
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,840
Hey!

122
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,350
I'm not going shopping with you.

123
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,730
So petty. Why are you doing this?

124
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,220
Okay I'll drink it.

125
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,380
I said okay. Give it to me. I'll drink it.

126
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,620
I'll drink it.

127
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,300
Master!

128
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,230
Ow my nose! Nose, nose, nose!

129
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,440
Master!

130
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,560
Are you okay?

131
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,630
Nose bleed!

132
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,710
I'm bleeding! So annoying!

133
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,220
Oh Master! Master!

134
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:21,370
Chairwoman! Chairwoman!

135
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,480
Chairwoman!

136
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,920
What's going on that is making you so noisy in the middle of the night?

137
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,770
Master Louis, his nose

138
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,970
Blood ... It's bleeding!

139
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,370
What? He's bleeding?

140
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,230
Oh my! Chairwoman!

141
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,380
Are you alright?

142
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,570
Hurry and contact Dr. Go.

143
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,400
Okay, Dr. Go.

144
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:06,680
My precious treasure. Why are you getting hurt and making me upset?

145
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,730
My precious!

146
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,810
This isn't the time for us to be doing this.

147
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,590
They will all be sold out!

148
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,460
Stay here for now until Dr. Go arrives.

149
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,410
I said I'm okay. Why did you tell Grandmother and make this blow out of proportion?

150
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,860
This is all because of you. Why did you run away?

151
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,750
Because of me...

152
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,090
Is that what the person who fell on top of me should say?

153
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,410
But why did you make me drink the herbal medicine?

154
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,680
Following the chairwoman's orders and protecting you is my job.

155
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,980
I did my job well.

156
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,430
Butler Kim, you really don't have flexibility.

157
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,430
Since you're so stuffy like that, you couldn't get married until now.

158
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,770
Master! You should say it as it is!

159
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,060
I dedicated my precious youth all to you.

160
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,590
I was always with you, so I couldn't date and get married. So I just aged like this.

161
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,190
Butler Kim, you should say it correctly.

162
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,490
Since you always followed me around, I couldn't make one friend or have a girlfriend.

163
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:21,050
And during college, you followed me to the cafeteria and bathroom. Who would like me then?

164
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,990
I was an outcast! They asked me whether I was a papa's boy.

165
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,530
You can't talk to me like that!

166
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,860
I am really upset!

167
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:43,450
That's why... we should at least go to the boutique now and get the sunglasses. That will be a consolation.

168
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,300
If we keep going like this, our hearts will be in pain, right?

169
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,490
So I have something in mind.

170
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,340
- I don't want to!
- Right now, our master...

171
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,190
I don't want to!

172
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,360
He's crying like this. No matter what I do to comfort him, it's no use.

173
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,510
What's wrong Louis? Huh?

174
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,860
Don't cry! Don't cry!

175
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,780
My precious! Don't cry!

176
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,250
Butler Kim, what do you want me to do?

177
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,910
Go! Go! Go!

178
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,770
Why are you traveling just 60 km in a bull (Lamborghini) and making me lose excitement?

179
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,260
I must abide with the speed limit.

180
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,020
So rigid, seriously...

181
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,830
Pull over so I can drive instead.

182
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,790
Oh, no no no no!

183
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,500
You are forever banned from driving.

184
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,360
That's what you said at least ten thousand times.

185
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,660
You won't let me drive, go on trips or eat anything I want.

186
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,840
Everything is not allowed! King of evil nagging, seriously!

187
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,000
It's not something a nagging provoker should say.

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,340
A provoker, you called me?

189
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,190
Whether a king of evil nagging or a provoker, what's important when

190
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,250
you are on your way to go shopping?

191
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,830
Oh yeah. We're going shopping, right?

192
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,950
Drive safely.

193
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,140
Bonjour Monsieur Louis, comment allez-vous.
(French: Hello, Mister Louis. How are you?)

194
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,980
Ca va.
(I have been well)

195
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,230

196
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,390
♫ Pick me, pick me, pick me. ♫

200
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:30,070
♫ My heart is racing when I see you. ♫

206
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,360

216
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,490
Enchanté.
(Nice to meet you.)

217
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,170
Comment faites-vous pour avoir de si bon goûts ?
(How do you have such a keen eye?)

218
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:02,470
Brand new items, rare items, limited editions, you've picked them up all in one go.

219
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,650
C'est quoi votre truc?
(What's your trick?)

220
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,440
Have you heard of "infrathin"?

221
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,760
It's a word Marcel Duchamp coined.

222
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,500
My master has the magical eye that can recognize

223
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,600
even paper-thin differences among objects.

224
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,970
Non ?! C'est vrai ?
(No! Is it true?)

225
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,780
C'est un secret, mais...
(This is a secret, but...)

226
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,890
To be honest, these things talk to me.

227
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,420
Oh yeah!

228
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,090
Tenez, voici un petit cadeau pour vous.
(Here is a small present for you.)

229
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,070
Mr. Louis, you've made shopping king of our boutique, this quarter, again.

230
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,120
Please accept our gratitude for you.

231
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:49,150
This is the finest quality underwear made just for you

232
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,070
using a marvelous blend of cotton suprima and lIVA

233
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,510
by the talented artisan Monsieur John Sebastian Moise who even had an exhibition at the museum in

234
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,970
France, région centre, Val de Loire, dans la ville de Bourges,
(In France, in Bourges located in the center, in Val de Loire,)

235
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:10,630
We even wrote your name on it, this is the only pair of underwear like this in the world.

236
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,700
Et ça, c'est un diamant.
(And that is a diamond.)

237
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,760
C'est pas mal.
(Not bad.)

238
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,990
The chairperson is the spitting image of a silver angel.

239
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,550
- But Assistant Manager.
- What is it?

240
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,160
Her fate is supposed to be really rough.

241
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,210
Why?

242
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,780
When I think about it, there is no one with a sadder life than our mother.

243
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,130
At 42, she lost her husband, who was like the sky to her.

244
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,230
At 52, she lost her son and daughter-in-law, who were like crown jewels to her.

245
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,950
Now, the only one left of her own flesh and blood is Ji Sung.

246
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,290
There is a very uncanny shaman, called Master Hong,

247
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,000
on Mt. Gaeryong, and Mother frequently visits him.

248
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,300
That shaman told Mother that she was born with strong evil luck, so she would end up killing her family around her.

249
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,800
Something about her having as many as three strokes of evil white tiger fortune within the four pillars of her destiny.

250
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,570
As many as three strokes of evil white tiger fortune?

251
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:31,610
Yeah, so the shaman told her to keep Ji Sung far away from her if she didn't want to cut his life short.

252
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,800
Oh my word, that's a totally heart-rending separation.

253
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,670
If only she hadn't heard that... But since she did, how uneasy her heart must have been.

254
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,170
I would have done the same.

255
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,220
What about the chairperson's grandson? How old is he?

256
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,780
We didn't know someone was inside. Sorry for being so loud.

257
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,380
He is twenty-five years old.

258
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,050
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

259
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,990
The age of the chairperson's grandson.

260
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:05,790
You know that ID called "Louis" who always wins the yearly title of Shopping King at our shopping mall?

261
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,330
That shopping King Louis is...

262
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,890
the chairperson's grandson.

263
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,910
It's Miss Ma Ri.

264
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,440
I don't want to pick up.

265
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,210
Please pick up. According to my analysis, it's certain that you will get married to Miss Ma Ri by next autumn.

266
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,370
What? Butler Kim, are you crazy?

267
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,070
Why would I get married to Ma Ri?

268
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,660
Because her obsession and persistence toward you is more than enough to accomplish a marital union between you two.

269
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,260
Just watch. Another call will come after one second.

270
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,150
Baek Ma Ri

271
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,200
Baek Ma Ri

272
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,960
Wow...

273
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,170
Hello?

274
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,950
Ji Sung! Are you doing well?

275
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,970
I'm doing well.

276
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,680
How's the weather there?

277
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,150
Here, it's so hot.

278
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,070
Aren't you using the air conditioner too much to the point of getting sick from it?

279
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,900
I am really really worried about you.

280
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,560
Hey, Baek Ma Ri. Do you love me?

281
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,370
What?

282
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,300
You're calling every day to ask if I'm doing okay and if I'm healthy,

283
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,580
and asking how the weather is.

284
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,070
Do you like me that much? Do you miss me that much?

285
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,180
It's your freedom to like me or not, but

286
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:41,220
I don't like you, so don't even think of getting married to me.

287
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,770
I'm hanging up!

288
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,550
He's full of himself and just spends a lot of money.

289
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,880
What is he that he says he doesn't like me?

290
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,010
Okay, let's see if you'll say the same thing after getting married to me.

291
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,800
Do you think Ma Ri really likes me?

292
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,510
According to my analysis, Miss Ma Ri calls you once a week at the same time

293
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,340
and hangs up after asking about the weather and your wellbeing.

294
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,510
In other words, should we call it insincere communication like clockwork?

295
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,080
Ding Dong Daeng! That's exactly it.

296
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,130
When I don't have any friends, even those who call me are all like this.

297
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,080
Miss Bok Sil says she harvests medicinal herbs and sells them in the market.

298
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:48,200
It's because the youthful 21-year-old mountain maiden is the breadwinner, responsible for the livelihood of her family of three.

299
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,930
Ahjussi! You can fall easily here so be careful.

300
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,910
Ahjussi! Be careful of the snakes.

301
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,730
Snakes?

302
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,110
Oh! That scared me.

303
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,900
Are you okay?

304
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,970
♫ She may be the face I can't forget ♫

305
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,730
♫ The trace of pleasure or regret ♫

306
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:54,830
♫ May be my treasure or the price I have to pay ♫

307
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:59,880
♫ She may be the song that summer sings ♫

308
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,560
♫ May be the chill that autumn brings ♫

309
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,090
♫ May be a hundred different things ♫

310
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:12,350
♫ Within the measure of a day ♫

311
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,460
Discovery of a rare item, pupillary response.

312
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,960
No, it's subtly different.

313
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,140
Master?

314
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,250
Are you hurt?

315
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,780
You should be careful. Don't fall.

316
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,830
Master? Are you uncomfortable?

317
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:42,760
Butler Kim, there are still people living in places like that in Korea?

318
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,460
Of course. That's why they made this program.

319
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,760
It says the program name, "Backwoods Korea," in the corner of the screen.

320
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,890
Backwoods Korea?

321
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,160
Backwoods... Backwoods. What's backwoods?

322
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,920
Like the place that's on TV right now. Those kinds of places are called backwoods.

323
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,670
Remote area.

324
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,660
I see.

325
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,710
Smell it.

326
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,610
Isn't the scent amazing? Codonopsis is really good for a cough.

327
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,190
My granny said it releases the heat in one's lungs.

328
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,250
It's even better eaten when the seasons change.

329
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,420
Butler Kim, can you order that for me? I have rhinitis, you know. She says it's really good for it.

330
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,840
Master, this program is not some kind of home shopping.

331
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,140
It's a documentary.

332
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,400
Ah, sorry.

333
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,090
It must be uncomfortable without running electricity.

334
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,420
Yes, it really is.

335
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,430
Don't you think life would be easier only if you moved to the town?

336
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,050
I can't go anywhere else because of my granny.

337
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:14,000
For Miss Bok Sil, who lives in this uncomfortable place earning a living for her granny and younger brother,

338
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,840
the item she wants the most is a refrigerator.

339
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,250
It's tough to make side dishes in the summer.

340
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,440
Wouldn't it be, though, since they go bad quickly and I have to make them fresh every day?

341
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,290
The item I want the most is a refrigerator.

342
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:36,760
Butler Kim, find out where that is and send them a large, cutting-edge-tech refrigerator.

343
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,810
Master? They said they have no electricity.

344
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,010
Without electricity, what good is a refrigerator? It would just end up as a cupboard.

345
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,890
And that program is not about helping others like Unicef campaigns or donations for refugees.

346
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,930
It's just a normal documentary. Documentary.

347
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,510
Ah okay.

348
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,700
Put it here.

349
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,490
What is this?

350
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,150
Does he eat at home or not?

351
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,910
How are the side dishes always in the same spot?

352
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,340
Honey, fill it up with the new ones we brought.

353
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,260
Yes.

354
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:31,320
There's no point. Joong Won, this punk, never eats at home.

355
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,800
I told him to diligently eat my side dishes for his health,

356
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,500
but he really doesn't listen!

357
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,280
He's like that because he resembles someone.

358
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,630
Don't buy those healthy ingredients on TV and make dishes with them.

359
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:51,060
Joong Won's stomach is weak, so he doesn't eat stuff like this.

360
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:58,140
Knowing how hard I worked to prepare those, are you able to say this?

361
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,390
Which ones? Which ones don't match your taste?

362
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,780
It's not that... I can eat all of this.

363
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,750
Isn't it a bit much to put plum in shredded mudfish?

364
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:16,390
Think about the taste! Perilla seeds go best with mudfish.

365
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,580
You! I travelled all the way to Gwangyang with Sang Yeop's mom

366
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,920
to buy organic plums and made plum marmalade. Do you or do you not know that?

367
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,220
I know!

368
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,180
Then how can I not put in plum? It's so good for your health!

369
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,170
Yes, you're right.

370
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,590
Oh my world...

371
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,040
You also need to finish what you're doing and look around and see if there is any spot that looks like a woman has been here.

372
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,100
Okay.

373
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,640
This guy is going to turn 40 soon. How has he not brought one girl home?

374
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,930
He needs to get married soon so I can have grandchildren. I am so upset.

375
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,300
This guy is good at everything else.

376
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,150
I don't know why he can't get married.

377
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:35,310
Honey, let's go somewhere together.

378
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,580
You just have to wait one more month.

379
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,460
- He'll meet his fate in one month?
- Umm.

380
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,480
Right now, both the woman

381
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,500
and the man are far away.

382
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,460
- What do you mean by man?
- I don't know.

383
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,830
I just see both a woman and a man.

384
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,330
What, besides the coupon sale, can encourage purchases?

385
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,910
That...

386
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,950
- This.
- It's mine.
- Did you copy and paste everything from another company's site?

387
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,560
All the points are exactly the same!

388
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,090
This. Do you think 10 of these will be sold in a day?

389
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,890
A special sale day of high-quality brand name goods is not bad.

390
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,780
But as it is, it's not competitive price-wise.

391
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,580
Get a credit card company on board and ask about discounts when purchased with their cards and explore additional incentives when paid with Gold Pay.

392
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,140
Yes, sir.

393
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,980
Peter Drucker said,

394
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,920
"Knowing all about the trends can't guarantee your success 100%."

395
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,380
"However, if you don't know the trends...

396
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,480
you can guarantee your 100% failure."

397
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,690
The MD ( Director of Marketing ) who can't read the trend

398
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:57,290
has no point in existing.

399
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,450
- Chief Lee.
- Yes.

400
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,940
What grades are your kids in again?

401
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,610
They're in 4th grade, 2nd grade,

402
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,280
five-years old, and a one-year-old.

403
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,580
At this rate, can you continue to work here until your youngest enters kindergarten?

404
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:20,820
No... Yes... I mean...

405
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:49,930
Eureka!

406
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:55,520
What is this?

407
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,070
- Did you find something?
- You did a good job!

408
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,840
It looks over 50 years old!

409
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,940
What did you dream about yesterday?

410
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,740
You can harvest this kind of ginseng only if heaven grants it to you.

411
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,920
You can get five-million won for this!

412
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,680
- I'm giving this to my grandma.
- What did you say?

413
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,480
You're going to feed this precious thing to your grandmother?

414
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,620
It would be such a waste...

415
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,130
Is your grandmother sick?

416
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,380
Yes, she is. She became sick right after my younger sibling left home.

417
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,950
This disaster wouldn't have happened only if the people from Seoul hadn't come to film that thing.

418
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,490
He is full of hot air.

419
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,820
Don't worry. Who is Bok Nam, after all?

420
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,680
He's a guy who'd live well even if stranded on a deserted island.

421
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,650
Yep! I believe so too!

422
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:48,120
Oh, it's coming out. There it is!

423
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:56,400
Bok Sil, give this to me. I will pay you a good price.

424
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,320
Not a chance! It's for my grandmother.

425
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,420
For your granny, you can just give her bellflower roots or codonopsis.

426
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,480
I don't want to. I can't!

427
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,160
Grandma!

428
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,820
Grandma! I'm back!

429
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:19,100
Grandma... Grandma. Today, when I was in the mountains I-

430
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,720
Grandma...

431
00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:00,650
Grandma... Granny...

432
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:09,140
Grandma... Come to your senses.

433
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,400
Grandma. Get up.

434
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,310
Grandma...

435
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,630
Grandma...

436
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,580
Grandma. Look at me.

437
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:51,720
Grandma. Grandma, come to your senses.

438
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,800
Grandma!

439
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,610
Grandma!

440
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,930
Master!

441
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:08,110
On rainy days like this, you should not open the window. The temperature has cooled because of the rain.

442
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,170
You will catch a cold being in the cold wind. Due to your allergies and rhinitis,

443
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,590
- when the humidity is high, you should be more careful. I think—
- You've said it a lot of times.

444
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,890
Will it rain in the afternoon too?

445
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,950
The chance is 50%.

446
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:33,430
Fifty percent.

447
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,200
Fifty percent.

448
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,010
Master! Master! What's wrong?

449
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,450
There is David's birthday party. Get the car ready.

450
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:46,020
You're banned from going out when it's raining. Research shows that there is a 21.4% increase in the chance of getting into a car accident when it's raining...

451
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,120
You said that more than a thousand times. Even so, I'm still going.

452
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:55,070
The chairperson will be worried.

453
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:06,640
Why is grandmother keeping me locked here?

454
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,960
Because you are precious to her.

455
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,550
No... Because she loves you.

456
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:20,090
Not stuff like this! Buy me a mom!

457
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,440
Buy me a dad.

458
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,950
My mom!

459
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,440
You are a good boy, right, Ji Sung?

460
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,530
They went up to heaven so I can't buy them for you.

461
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:39,090
You have your grandma by your side instead.

462
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:44,090
Buy me a mom and a dad!

463
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:49,030
Ji Sung, should we try and pray to the star?

464
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,290
Ask them to send Mom and Dad?

465
00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:00,640
Mr. Star, I want to have Mom and Dad,

466
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,470
just like Ma Ri and Jun Seo.

467
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,550
I want to eat food with my mom

468
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:10,690
and take a bath with my dad, too.

469
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,190
I like Grandma too, but

470
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,270
I think I would be happier if my mom and dad were here.

471
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:22,420
Mr. Star, I want to have Mom and Dad.

472
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,950
Grandma. Are you crying?

473
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,170
Crying? Why would Grandma be crying? I'm not.

474
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,910
Is it because you want to see my mom and dad too?

475
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,370
No.

476
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,630
My puppy, Ji Sung...

477
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,470
Okay, I can't make Grandma sad.

478
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,540
Bok Nam, are you doing well?

479
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,680
You don't even know Granny passed away.

480
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,100
But you shouldn't be this way after all that Granny suffered to raise you.

481
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,110
You, brat!

482
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,330
Just wait until I catch you. You'll die by my hand.

483
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,340
Granny, have one of these.

484
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,800
Aigoo, when you don't have enough to eat yourself,

485
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,280
how can I pull out my spoon? Just eat it yourself.

486
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:14,070
But I had a big breakfast. Please have this.

487
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,560
Then, thank you.

488
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,800
Granny, are you okay?

489
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,460
Young Lady, if you go to the first car of the train,

490
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,720
there is a canteen. Please go there

491
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,260
and buy me one bottle of water.

492
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,840
Yes, yes, Granny. Just wait a little bit. I will be back in a jiffy.

493
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,790
First of all, give me four beers and...

494
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,550
also four corn dogs and...

495
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,470
one bag of seasoned chestnuts and...

496
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,300
Four beers, that would be...

497
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,890
Excuse me, the granny who was here, did she go somewhere?

498
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,460
Well, I'm sorry I don't know.

499
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:08,490
You came all this way to Busan. You should eat something yummy. Is ice cream enough?

500
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,100
But for me, this is the yummiest thing.

501
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,890
My mom's friend's friend's friend said she would introduce me to a great bachelor, so I even cancelled my trip to Japan to be here.

502
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:25,470
I think I did well. I like you more than I expected.

503
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,800
You are quite a beauty yourself.

504
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:33,210
I hear that often.

505
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:41,100
However... You are not my style.

506
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,620
What is wrong with my style?

507
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:51,670
Your eyes are as round as Sajik Baseball Stadium and your nose is as sharp as Mt. Hwangryang

508
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:55,030
and your lips are cherry-like, just like Scarlett Johansson's.

509
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,490
I don't even need to mention the shape of your face.
 Perfect

510
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,870
You are too doll-like.

511
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:06,500
- Are you saying you dislike me because I'm pretty like a doll?
- Yes.

512
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,420
Which station did the grandma get off at?

513
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:42,320
- Cheonan.
- Are you sure the grandma took your bag?

514
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,830
That is... It seems that way.

515
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,660
But I did not see it with my own eyes.

516
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,860
Ahjussi, I must find that bag.

517
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,460
Here. You never know.

518
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:01,490
We will contact you if the bag ends up in the lost and found. Write down your cell phone number here before you go.

519
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:06,170
I... don't have a cell phone.

520
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,010
Are you saying you do not have a cell phone?

521
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,490
But I did go on the blind date. So I did as you wished, Mom.

522
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:40,340
So what if she's a doctor? She's not my style.

523
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,270
I'm telling you one more time. If you arrange a date for me like this again,

524
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:47,980
just know that I will move away without your knowledge.

525
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,920
Who the heck is that... swarthy woman?

526
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:59,220
No way she is eyeing me...

527
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,330
Is she a psycho?

528
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,080
Is this woman crazy?

529
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,080
- Buy a wild ginseng.
- Wild ginseng my butt.

530
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:29,000
What are you doing? Won't you let this go? Let this go. What do you think you are doing?

531
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,970
Let me go. This girl, really! Aish!

532
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,510
- Is this woman crazy?
- Oh, wait!

533
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:43,060
Hold on a second. Please take a look at this. Here, here, here...

534
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,510
Although you might not think it, this here is a 50-year-old real thing.

535
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,900
Look here. If you look at the head, the answer is staring at you.

536
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,190
Whether it is a wild ginseng or farmed one.

537
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:56,380
Without further ado, this is a 100% real wild ginseng that I dug up myself.

538
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,640
You'll regret it if you don't buy it.

539
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:08,080
I know this is strange. I am sorry to ask you to buy a wild ginseng at this late hour at a train station.

540
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:11,370
But I have my reasons.

541
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,650
Actually, I came to the capital city today.

542
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,940
I got my bag stolen on the train.

543
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,530
I really need some money.

544
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,090
I will give it to you for a cheap price, please buy it.

545
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,660
I am not buying.

546
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,190
Ahjussi, this is one-of-a-kind wild ginseng.

547
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:35,820
Even if you comb through this country, no, the whole world, you would not find another one that looks like it.

548
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,500
The color trend of the year is dusty pink.

549
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:44,420
Adding a little bit of razzle-dazzle, with some frills

550
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,390
and ruffles. Buy that kind and the dining table will look luxurious.

551
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,630
Thank you.

552
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,190
It's a limited edition, you have to buy it no matter what.

553
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,390
So, how much are you asking?

554
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,340
Just give me $1000.

555
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:08,090
- $1000?
- This is worth as much as $5000.

556
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,150
How would I ask for $1000 if it were a fake?

557
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,410
I'm only asking for $1000 because it's real.

558
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,490
Pure Garcinia Cambogia HCA 95% 
You feel like you're going to lose a lot of weight since it's 10,000 euros, right?

559
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:19,430
You trust it more because it is expensive.

560
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,190
That is what's called premium pricing marketing strategy.

561
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,660
Look here, young lady.

562
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,040
How do I know if this is real or fake?

563
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,620
Trusting only in your words,

564
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,530
what crazy dude will buy

565
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,980
this ridiculous grass root for $1000 at midnight, at Seoul train station at that?

566
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,950
I swear on my good name. My name is Go Bok Sil.

567
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,050
Go Bok Sil!

568
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:44,610
Ferragamo, Chanel, Dior, the names themselves are warranties.

569
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,570
The reason why companies put their lives on the line for best branding strategies. Buy.

570
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:48,850
Umm.

571
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:52,930
Can you prove whether your name is Go Bok Sil or Gae (Dog) Bok Sil?

572
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:58,580
Ah, since your bag was stolen, of course you wouldn't have any ID on you.

573
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,240
Okay.

574
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,700
This is the deposit. I will get it appraised whether it's real and if it is, I will give you the balance then.

575
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,570
You are going to get it for $100 and bolt? What do you take me for?

576
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,510
No frigging way!

577
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,060
You can't trust me? Then never mind.

578
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,590
Ah, well...

579
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,180
Show me your ID. Then, I'll sell it to you.

580
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:31,770
But that's a foul play. It's only fair that we enter into this contract with neither of us showing an ID.

581
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,820
Do you understand?

582
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:39,000
I understand. Give me the deposit.

583
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,780
But tell me your name.

584
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,640
What are you going to do with that knowledge?

585
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,900
That's only fair, isn't it?

586
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,690
It's Cha Joong Won. Cha-Joong-Won.

587
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:56,660
Mr. Cha Joong Won, I am trusting you and making this deal with you. So you can't run away with the wild ginseng.

588
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,190
Because then I'm going to pursue you to your grave.

589
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:00,670
You might not think it, but I am the Flying Squirrel of Mt. Odae.

590
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:06,150
Whether a flying squirrel or a chipmunk, you sure are chatty, when you say you trust me.

591
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:12,240
Give me your cell phone number.

592
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,890
I don't have a cell phone.

593
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,930
Then, you call me.

594
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,040
I'm going to call you every day.

595
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,000
You have to find out if it's real and pay me the balance right away.

596
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,700
If it's a fake, what are you going to do about my $100?

597
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,650
That will never happen. No worries.

598
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:59,070
Was I crazy? Why did I buy this?

599
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,750
I swear on my good name. My name is Go Bok Sil.

600
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,620
Go Bok Sil!

601
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,360
Go Bok Sil...

602
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:38,360
I'm really dizzy. Where can I close my eyes?

603
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:47,180
24 hour Bathhouse & Sauna

604
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:53,010
Is that a place where they do jjimjil (Korean hot spa) 24 hours?

605
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,700
What's happening?

606
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,680
Let's hurry and go and see.

607
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,680
Burglar! Burglar!

608
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,900
Burglar! Burglar!

609
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:09,720
Young Master! Young Master!

610
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:12,870
Young Master!

611
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,970
Young Master!

612
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:30,710
Young Master!

613
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,860
Butler Kim,

614
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:37,420
farewell.

615
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,750
Young Master!

616
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,610
Young Master, no!

617
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,310
No! No!

618
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,130
Don't go, Louis!

619
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:53,100
Don't go! Come back!

620
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:03,120
How can there be such a weird dream like this?

621
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,960
You're a ball of fire! Thermometer! Where is a thermometer?

622
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,470
I dreamed Louis disappeared.

623
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:23,710
Louis went into the dark woods.

624
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,200
Into the dark woods?

625
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,340
Chairperson?

626
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,920
Chairperson!

627
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,170
Chairperson!

628
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:48,900
She's got Type A influenza with a serious case of pneumonia to boot.

629
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:54,100
I will use all available drugs, but if the high fever does not go down, even then...

630
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:59,070
In the worst case scenario, I think you will have to prepare yourselves.

631
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,750
Young Master!

632
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:22,040
I will come on the next flight. Will you be okay by yourself?

633
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:27,450
Chairperson will be furious if she finds out I let you ride the plane by yourself.

634
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:30,390
But there was only one seat left.

635
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:33,180
That is why even by myself, I will have to go there first.

636
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:39,870
You're all grown up, Young Master. President Baek will meet you at the airport.

637
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,700
Sir, would you like something to drink?

638
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,020
No, thanks.

639
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:04,590
Of course, President Baek Seon Gu will have to become the next chairperson.

640
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:08,930
As you all know, little Ji Sung is just a child

641
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:13,070
shopping like crazy under the protection of his grandmother.

642
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:14,970
Chairman, congratulations.

643
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:18,110
Uh huh, these guys. Be quiet.

644
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:21,610
It's not like the chairperson passed away yet.

645
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,500
Here.

646
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,900
Louis!

647
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,110
- Mother!
- Louis!

648
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:49,180
Mother, Mother!

649
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,210
- Chairperson!
- Butler Heo, get Dr. Kim right away! Hurry!

650
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,780
Hurry, hurry.

651
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,560
Mother...

652
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:08,120
I mean to leave Gold Group to Louis.

653
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:12,070
Where is Louis?

654
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:16,480
He is on his way to Seoul right now. He will arrive by this evening.

655
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,880
Jeong Ran,

656
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,310
Yes.

657
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:28,170
Prepare a welcome party for Louis, so we can welcome him as much as possible.

658
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,900
I understand.

659
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,490
Seon Gu.

660
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:32,590
Yes, Mother.

661
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:38,110
I will announce his succession to the top management position at the party.

662
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,150
Now, we have no time. Hurry up.

663
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,540
Please take a look at this. He's my little brother. Thank you.

664
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,590
Yes, he's my little brother. Just take one look.

665
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:48,230
Thank you, thank you.

666
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:50,720
Excuse me, this, this, take a look at this just once.

667
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,060
Thank you. Please look at this.

668
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,920
He's my little brother, please look. Thank you.

669
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,880
He's really good looking.

670
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,250
He's a flower boy.

671
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,100
Aish, you mean a flower beggar rather than a flower boy.

672
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,310
Let's hurry and go.

673
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,200
What's going on?

674
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:24,960
Bok Nam!

675
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:28,740
Bok Nam!
