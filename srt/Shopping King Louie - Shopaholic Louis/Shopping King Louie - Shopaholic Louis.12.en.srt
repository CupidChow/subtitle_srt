1
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,500
There's an Indian saying that if you repeat something over 10, 000 times,

2
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,830
then those words will definitely come true in the future.

3
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,410
I'm going to marry that man.

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,400
By all means, I'm going to.

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,440
♬  No matter what you say ♬

6
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,060
It is said that my mother, Mrs. Shin Young Ae, the icon of tenacity,

7
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:01,300
repeated, "I will marry that man," ten thousand times in order to make my father, Cha Soo Il, her husband.

8
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,890
Yes, Joong Won. What time is it in the US?

9
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,910
I'm sorry to call you so early.

10
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,560
I looked into it and your extracurricular activity must be ice hockey, no matter what. Okay?

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,200
My mother, Mrs. Shin Young Ae, for her son to do the extracurricular activity that she wanted,

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,310
is also said to have repeated, "Ice hockey, no matter what," 10,000 times.

13
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,230
So, if we're talking about Bok Sil...

14
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,700
To sum it up, she took in our Director Louis, who lost his memory and became a beggar,

15
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,850
and fed him, gave him a place to sleep, clothed him, and loved him.

16
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,080
She's the kind of woman who looked after him so whole-heartedly.

17
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,360
Yes.

18
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:42,590
But why was Director Louis wearing Bok Sil's brother's clothes?

19
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,010
That's a good question.

20
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,950
On the day of his return to Korea, on the way to his house, he ran into... what do you call them? A motorcycle...

21
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,070
- Motorcycle gang?
- That's right, motorcycle gang.

22
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:58,070
He got into a fight with a motorcycle gang, and it looks like all his clothes and his car were stolen then.

23
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,710
Excuse me.

24
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,080
Yes, the one in red.

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,140
Then does that mean the person who died in the car crash was Bok Sil's brother?

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,700
That's correct.

27
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,830
My goodness! How could there be such a sad connection!

28
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,380
So to sum it up, you're saying that the life-and-death situations of her lover and of her younger brother changed hands.

29
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,280
That's right.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,400
That's why they separated.

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,070
Because looking at each other, their hearts hurt too much.

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,360
They're both so pitiful...

33
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,690
Manager!

34
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,810
Why are you making such a scene crying and everything, seriously?

35
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,500
Can't Headquarters Director Louis and Bok Sil love each other again?

36
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,170
Please, let us love each other again.

37
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,460
Despite not knowing the Indian saying, the Shopping King Louis that I know,

38
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:59,480
repeated the words, "Please let us love each other again," ten thousand times, as was his usual habit with words.

39
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,990
Please, let us love each other again.

40
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:10,290
Please... Let us love each other again.

41
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:17,070
And the words he repeated 10,000 times were about to come true.

42
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:24,220
Episode 12 Reality
A Dream Equals Reality

43
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,120
Louis...

44
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,580
Louis!

45
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,170
Louis.

46
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,250
Louis, why do you look like this?

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,060
I heard you went to France. Why are you here like this?

48
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,000
Am I Louis?

49
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,650
Louis...

50
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,350
Do you know me?

51
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,390
Who are you?

52
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,190
Bok Sil.

53
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,510
Go Bok Sil.

54
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,150
Bok Sil...

55
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,670
Bok Sil...

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,990
My heart hurts so much.

57
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,090
Or is it my head that hurts?

58
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,290
Louis.

59
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,430
What's wrong? What's wrong, Louis?

60
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,410
Were we really close?

61
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,690
♬ The day I fought the piercing showers ♬

62
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,010
♬ Trapped in the cold air ♬

63
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:39,690
♬ What made me soar above was your warm eyes ♬

64
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,320
♬ Alright, alright. ♬

65
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,280
♬ It's not a sudden impulse ♬

66
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,020
♬ Allow allow ♬

67
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,680
♬ My heart is burning white hot white hot ♬

68
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,400
♬ Like a fire (fire) ♬

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,440
♬ As if to melt passionately my love, ♬

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,910
♬ Heart is a time bomb ♬

71
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,600
Butler Kim, this is Bok Sil.

72
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,580
What? What happened to Young Master?

73
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,010
I understand, I'll be there immediately.

74
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,370
Bok Sil, take Young Master to Dongbaek Island Yacht Dock and wait for me there.

75
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,810
You must hold onto him.

76
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,650
Yes, I understand.

77
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,700
♬ My wings are shabby. ♬

78
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,020
You have to keep taking me with you everywhere from now on. Okay?

79
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,390
♬  Yes, I am Tiger Moth. ♬

80
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,240
♬ Yes, I am Tiger Moth.  ♬

81
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,170
♬ As if to melt passionately my love ♬

82
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,270
♬ Heart is a time bomb ♬

83
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,530
♬ Yes I am Tiger Moth. Yes I am Tiger Moth ♬

84
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,110
♬ Yes I am Tiger Moth.  ♬

85
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,390
♬ I'll live like a flame. ♬

86
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,060
Louis.

87
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,450
If you're hungry, should I buy you something?

88
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,430
Buy me coffee, please.

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,420
That damn coffee of yours.

90
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,250
Okay.

91
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,190
Just wait here for a little bit. You can't go anywhere, okay?

92
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,760
Okay.

93
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,730
Is it good?

94
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,310
There's another coffee you used to like better.

95
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,780
Do you know a lot about me?

96
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,700
Of course!

97
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,620
Young Master!

98
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,330
Butler Kim, over here!

99
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,450
Grab Young Master!

100
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,270
Louis...

101
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,510
Louis!

102
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,960
Louis!

103
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,020
Louis...

104
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,420
Mister, can't you go back?

105
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,350
I didn't mean to get on. You just took off.

106
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,990
I can't turn back.

107
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,100
I have to finish the entire route.

108
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:12,170
Yes, Butler Kim. Did you catch Louis?

109
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,290
Yes, I'm with him right now.

110
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,030
That's a relief.

111
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,920
Can you wait for me just a little bit until the yacht goes back to the dock?

112
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,860
Yes.

113
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,430
Yes, thank you.

114
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,690
Detective.

115
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,320
Bok Sil, where are you right now? Where are you?

116
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,890
Why? Is it something urgent?

117
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,170
Hey, we found Bok Nam!

118
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,760
What?

119
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,450
Bok Nam... Bok Nam's dead.

120
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,280
It wasn't Bok Nam who died!

121
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,170
Hello? Bok Sil, are you listening?

122
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,460
Then...

123
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,770
Then where is Bok Nam right now?

124
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,630
We received word that he's in Busan.

125
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,090
Busan?

126
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,840
Detective, I'm in Busan right now!

127
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,660
Tell me where Bok Nam is.

128
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,820
Where are you in Busan?

129
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,050
This is... I'm on the sea.

130
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,800
Right now, I'm riding a yacht in the middle of the sea.

131
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,720
In front of me, there is Marine City,

132
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,880
Gwangan Great Bridge,

133
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,760
and I see Dongbaek Island.

134
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,090
Is there another yacht passing by in front of you?

135
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,600
A yacht?

136
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,890
Bok Nam is there! He's there!

137
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,620
Bok Nam.

138
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,550
Bok Nam!

139
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,610
Bok Nam!

140
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,580
Bok Nam!

141
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:17,040
♬  `Cause I am your lady ♬

142
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,490
♬  And you are my man ♬

143
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,800
Noona!

144
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,980
♬  Whenever you reach for me ♬

145
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,530
♬  I`ll do all that I can ♬

146
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,210
Bok Nam!
♬  I`ll do all that I can ♬

147
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,450
♬  I`ll do all that I can ♬

148
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,830
Noona, I'm sorry.

149
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,340
I was wrong.

150
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,730
Bok Nam.

151
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,450
♬ Somewhere I've never been ♬

152
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,200
Are you really Bok Nam?

153
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,730
Yes.

154
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,850
Bok Nam.

155
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,490
Bok Nam.

156
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,320
Oh what happened?

157
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,240
If you are alive like this, you should've come to me first!

158
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,680
I went to Gangwon-do, but there was no one there.

159
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,960
Bok Nam.

160
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,250
Bok Nam, Noona is sorry.

161
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,510
No, Noona. I'm sorry.

162
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,630
Bok Nam, Bok Nam.

163
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,530
You rascal. Let's see what happens when you leave home again.

164
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,590
I'm never going to leave.

165
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,010
Bok Nam...

166
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,810
But you...

167
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,510
How did you get on here?

168
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,720
To be honest that is...

169
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,890
How do you have this?

170
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,300
Bok Sil, did this surprise you a lot?

171
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,250
Didn't I tell you I was going to find Bok Nam? I kept my promise.

172
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,410
3 days earlier

173
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,930
Bok Nam!

174
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,010
Oh, oh! I'm sorry for that time! Geez!

175
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,480
No, no, you don't have to be sorry. Bok Nam!

176
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,710
No. That's not it!

177
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,370
It hurts.

178
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,700
Fire hydrant

179
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Fire hydrant

180
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,280
♬ In a few seconds I am exploding.  ♬

181
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,390
♬ You can't stop me, broken timer switch ♬

182
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,660
♬ is heading straight for zero.  ♬

183
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,970
♬ I won't stop anymore ♬

184
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,060
♬ The day I fought the piercing showers,  ♬

185
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,100
♬  trapped in the cold air ♬

186
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,410
♬ What made me soar was your warm eyes ♬

187
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,300
♬ I've decided to become a prisoner of your love forever. ♬

188
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,050
♬ I am prepared to go all in.  ♬

189
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,620
♬  I know it is my fate. ♬

190
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,850
♬ I will never give up ♬

191
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,490
What's wrong with them?

192
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,930
♬ Even if you don't see me, I just have to protect you ♬

193
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,630
♬ I Can't Breathe. You fill the inside of my heart. ♬

194
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,700
♬ Although the decalcomanie of tear fragments were drawn on my heart  ♬

195
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,500
♬ like a cave mural, no one knows how long it will last  ♬

196
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,860
Hey, stop right there!

197
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,060
No, that's not it.

198
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,590
Stop the car!

199
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,410
♬ It's not a sudden impulse ♬

200
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,190
♬ Allow Allow ♬

201
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:57,330
Ohh... My... God.

202
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,520
Ouch, I'm dying here!!

203
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,750
Hey!!!

204
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,720
Get out!

205
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,620
Geez, this bastard. If you hit someone,

206
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,520
you should get out. What the heck is he doing?

207
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,620
Get out!

208
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,370
Wh-What's the matter?

209
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,650
You rich bastard. Were you planning on a hit-and-run?

210
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,450
Butler... Butler Kim...

211
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,660
But Hyung!

212
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,330
I'll take care of it and meet you there, so wait there.

213
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,100
He's goofing around and rude,

214
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,920
the type I totally can't stand.

215
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,090
What a relief. I thought he hurt himself.

216
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,520
Your wallet and shoes...

217
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,580
Give them to me.

218
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,060
Your phone!

219
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,430
My phone too?

220
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,570
My bros are really scary.

221
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,950
If you don't want to get beaten to death, just listen to me.

222
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,410
Your watch.

223
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,450
No way. I got this from my Grandmother.

224
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,380
Hyung Dae Sik saw that watch earlier, you know.

225
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,220
If I don't bring that, I'll die.

226
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,490
But my grandma gave me this...

227
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,780
Take off all of your clothes too.

228
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,160
Huh?

229
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,730
I need to go to Grandma though...

230
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,320
Why isn't he coming?

231
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,070
You're really coming back in an hour, right?

232
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,320
- You're being serious, right?
- That's what I said.

233
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,230
I don't know the address and I don't have a phone either. I'm going to go crazy, seriously.

234
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,290
Butler Kim!

235
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,790
Hyung! I'll take care of it...

236
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,490
Bok Nam saved me.

237
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,970
As expected.

238
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,320
Bok Nam is indeed Bok Sil's younger brother.

239
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,190
Bok Nam!

240
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,950
Bok Nam!

241
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,040
Bok Nam.

242
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,130
Bok Nam!

243
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,620
What is this?

244
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,300
Ah, what the heck. It's 168 stairs. Jeez!

245
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,770
Bok Nam!

246
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,950
Bok Nam!

247
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,780
Bok Nam!

248
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,950
You can do it!

249
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,270
Ah! Ah, Bok Nam!

250
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,030
I'm ruined...

251
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,320
Bok Nam... Hey.

252
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,760
Bok Nam.

253
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,640
I'm really sorry for taking your clothes and car that day,

254
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,680
so please just don't report me to the police.

255
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,180
Of course not! Bok Nam, thank you so much for being alive.

256
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,100
I can meet Bok Sil now...

257
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,860
Bok Sil... Bok Nam...

258
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,500
Bok Nam, I'm a nice person. You don't have to run away, okay?

259
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,520
So you know my sister?

260
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,880
I know her very well. Go Bok Sil.

261
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,990
- How?
- We used to live together.

262
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,300
No way.

263
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,860
Did my sister get married?

264
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,570
Marry?

265
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,450
Well, not exactly.

266
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,280
So you're saying my sister lived with you in Seoul?

267
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,940
That's right.

268
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,000
That's why no one was there when I went to Gangwon-do.

269
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,170
That's not it! Bok Sil went to Seoul to look for you!

270
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,950
Jeez, Go Bok Sil.

271
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:27,360
How did you end up in Busan? Do you know how much I was looking for you?

272
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,020
I cried so much, thinking you died in my place.

273
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,470
What happened was...

274
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,440
Why the heck did you take your clothes off for him?

275
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,690
I was really scared.

276
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,660
I was scared so I went back home

277
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,260
but my grandma and sister weren't there.

278
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,900
I didn't know what to do.

279
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:38,420
So I decided to go somewhere farthest from Seoul

280
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,690
and this is where I ended up.

281
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,130
I see.

282
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,150
It must've felt dark and scary for you too, Bok Nam.

283
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,900
I know that feeling. I was like that too.

284
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,870
But thanks to Bok Sil, I wasn't scared at all.

285
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,560
I'll protect you now.

286
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,000
Brother.

287
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,340
Oh, yeah!

288
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,100
What do you call your wife's younger brother in Korea?

289
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,300
Sister-in-law? (wrong term)

290
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,520
- Sister-in-law?
- Yeah, sister-in-law.

291
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,030
Okay. Sister-in-law, your hyung will protect you.

292
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,470
This guy went to France. What's with the domestic phone call?

293
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,430
Hello?

294
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,310
Hyung! Hyung! This is Louis!

295
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,310
What's going on, you punk? Are you here in Korea?

296
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,140
Hyung, don't get surprised. I found Bok Nam!

297
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,320
What? Bok Nam?

298
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,920
Try until you get it.

299
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,270
Hyung, gather everyone and come to Busan, quick.

300
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,630
Bok Nam is alive! You see him, right?

301
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,910
- I'm Go Bok Nam.
- I found him in Busan.

302
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,630
It wasn't Bok Nam who died in the accident but someone else.

303
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:41,010
I'll start the Bok Nam & Bok Sil Family Reunion Project right now, so come straight to Busan and please help me.

304
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,000
By the way, Ahjussi Cha Joong Won has something else he needs to do for us.

305
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:56,090
Go Bok Sil. You'll need to go on a business trip to Busan today.

306
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,560
- Right now?
- Yeah.

307
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,760
Do you know Louis went back to France?

308
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:09,880
Yes. He gave me a goodbye letter before he left.

309
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,170
He'll live well. Now, no matter where you drop him, he'll get by just fine.

310
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,870
Ahjusshi, after you say something that makes Bok Sil think of me...

311
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:22,740
If you take a Donghae Nambu Line train from Haeundae Station, it'll take you all the way to Pohang. See you in Seoul.

312
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,720
Then send Bok Sil to Haeundae Station.

313
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,680
Louis!

314
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,250
Louis.

315
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,290
Hyung In Seong, you oversee the whole plan.

316
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,480
Louis and Bok Sil met.

317
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,230
Bok Sil, take Young Master to Dongbaek Island Yacht Dock and wait for me there. You have to hold onto him.

318
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,470
Butler Kim, please lure Bok Sil to the yacht dock area.

319
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:24,030
♬ On Love Way which is moving like a snail whether due to traffic or an accident ♬

320
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:30,180
♬ I would like someone to tell me the way to go to you ♬

321
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,250
Young Master!

322
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,000
Butler Kim, over here!

323
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,810
Grab young master!

324
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:38,240
When Butler Kim chases after me, I'm going to run toward the yacht.

325
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,010
Go, go!

326
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,740
Hide here, alright?

327
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,980
Butler Heo, take control of Bok Nam,

328
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,170
Sir, you need to take off as soon as a woman gets on and a man gets off.

329
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,130
Even if the woman tells you to stop, don't stop no matter what! You have to make sure you go out to the middle of the sea, okay?

330
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,410
and tell the yacht driver what to do.

331
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:01,350
Hello, Bok Sil? Where are you? Is there another yacht passing by in front of you?

332
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:07,270
- Bok Nam is there, on there!
Detective, you call Bok Sil and let her know the news about Bok Nam.

333
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,130
Do it in the most urgent way possible.

334
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:13,270
Bok Nam! Bok Nam, over here! Bok Nam!

335
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:18,660
- Bok Nam, you just have to come out when your sister calls your name.
- Noona!

336
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,720
What do you think? Is everyone okay with it?

337
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,280
- Okay!
- Okay.

338
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,230
I'm against this plan.

339
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,310
Why?!

340
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,550
Go Bok Sil will get so surprised! If you, who supposedly left for France, appear as a beggar,

341
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,420
it will be a huge shock to her!

342
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,360
That's why it's called a surprise! This is meant to surprise Bok Sil.

343
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,480
When she's shocked and dazed because of Louis, she'll be surprised once again by Bok Nam.

344
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,210
Shall we call it a great decoy leading up to the Bok Nam surprise?

345
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,870
I'm also against it.

346
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,590
Why?

347
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,860
A beggar's part for you, Young Master? Why do you have to voluntarily become a hobo?

348
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,990
Could it possibly be alright for our precious Young Master to do that?

349
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,750
When I first met Bok Sil, I was a beggar for real!

350
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,300
Bok Sil saved me when I was like that, and I want to reenact

351
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,090
that day when we met and make her remember our first time meeting each other!

352
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:13,010
I'm going to prove that our meeting was a blessing, with Bok Nam!

353
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,490
Our young master is so cool.

354
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,790
For Bok Sil,

355
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:24,210
he even knows how to prepare this kind of event.

356
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,690
I'm really touched.

357
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:34,670
Anyway, please help me everyone. Please.

358
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,880
Okay?

359
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,290
Okay!

360
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,780
- Okay.
- Okay?

361
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,530
Okay.

362
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,360
One. Ready, action!

363
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,050
Why did you take a picture?!

364
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:59,480
Oh. Oh, sorry, sorry. Sorry. I'll try it again. Alright, now it's on video.

365
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,640
Ready... Action!

366
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,400
Bok Sil! Were you really surprised?

367
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,280
I told you that I would find Bok Nam, didn't I? I kept my promise.

368
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,310
Okay. That was good!

369
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:18,250
Why did you cut it off? I wasn't done yet!

370
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,440
Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Go on and I'll continue the shot.

371
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,920
- Jo In Seong, please do it right this time. Is it back on?
- Yeah.

372
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,900
Bok Sil! Were you really surprised?

373
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,740
I told you that I would find Bok Nam, didn't I? I kept my promise.

374
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,750
Do you know how much I went through? I ran around a ton,

375
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:46,720
and you said he's the Mt. Odae Narrow-Mouthed Toad, didn't you? He runs so well! Leaping and hopping away...

376
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,440
I even climbed 168 stairs! I mean 168 stairs!

377
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,160
And I'm wearing this thin thing today to put on this play,

378
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,160
wearing layers and all...

379
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,660
♬ Oh Lost My Way  ♬

380
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,500
Bok Sil...

381
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,090
The day I first met you,

382
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,510
it was the luckiest day of my life.

383
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:21,050
♬ These tears like paint spreading ♬

384
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:26,640
Thank you so much for meeting with me again today.

385
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,050
♬ Met you by surprise ♬

386
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:59,390

The day that I first met you, Bok Sil,

392
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:34,710
was the luckiest day of my life.

406
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,120
I told you that I would find Bok Nam for you, didn't I?

407
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,730
I told you to just trust in me.

408
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,410
Thank you, Louis.

409
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,820
♬ I dream of holding you all night ♬

410
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,990
♬ And holding you seems right ♬

411

♬ Perhaps that's my reality ♬

412
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,630
What are you doing? Clap. Whoo-hoo!

413
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,420
That must be it. She lives in a very high place.

414
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,240
Is it okay for us to just come visit like this?

415
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,910
Aigoo, what do you see me as? I got permission from Bok Sil.

416
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,110
She let me know her passcode.

417
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,570
Your tenacity is--

418
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,200
What? What's wrong with me?

419
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,670
You know I'm the lady who made you, a man without any ambition, into the postmaster.

420
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,660
Well, that's right.

421
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,720
Making Go Bok Sil a doctor of oriental medicine is nothing.

422
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,620
From what I see, she shows promising signs.

423
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,560
If I just support her well, she'll become something big.

424
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,250
So she lives in a place like this.

425
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,880
Put that in the refrigerator.

426
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,350
Oh, okay. Sure.

427
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,810
Don't move!

428
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,190
Who are you two?

429
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,310
Who in the world are you to come into another person's empty house and open the fridge doors and stuff, huh?

430
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,830
Who are you to say such things?

431
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,200
What is your relationship with Bok Sil?

432
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,560
You know Bok Sil?

433
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,330
Hm?

434
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,920
To introduce myself...

435
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,940
I'm Bok Sil's mom.

436
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,890
Bok Sil said that she doesn't have any parents, though.

437
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,360
Well, I'm her neighbor and security manager and

438
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,520
her adoptive mother, something like that.

439
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,220
Ah...

440
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,580
And you are...?

441
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:15,950
Oh, I'm... the person who'll become Bok Sil's mother-in-law in the future.

442
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,840
M-M-Mother in law?

443
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,900
Wait, Louis said that he didn't have any parents and that only his grandmother was alive.

444
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,260
Louis?

445
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,770
You're not Louis's mom?

446
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,150
I'm Cha Joong Won's mom.

447
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:41,490
Oh my! Oh my, oh my, what's going on?

448
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:45,940
If it's Louis... Are you possibly talking about the grandson of Gold Group?

449
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,850
Yes!

450
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:53,810
So, right now... are you saying that Bok Sil and the chairwoman's grandson are dating?

451
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,720
Aigoo, would they just be dating? They even lived here together.

452
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,450
Huh?

453
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,050
Why isn't he here yet?

454
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,070
Ma Ri! You should meet someone who likes you!

455
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:23,190
Director Cha and Louis both said that they're not interested in you. So I'm saying don't waste your energy for no reason.

456
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,810
Mom, are you really my mother?

457
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,650
Why aren't you taking my side?

458
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,920
Because you might get even more hurt later if I take your side now.

459
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,990
I got you a blind date, so do you want to try meeting him?

460
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:41,630
He's the son of one of my college classmates, and he seems to be a pretty good man.

461
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,570
You know that I care a great deal about beauty, right?

462
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,570
Are you possibly Baek Ma Ri?

463
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,330
Ah, that's right!

464
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:09,700
What did you just say?

465
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,270
I said that I have another woman that I like.

466
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:15,560
She's a lady from Yokji Island who just came to Busan.

467
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,350
I can't live without her.

468
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:29,500
Then why did you come here?

469
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,290
I mean, if I would have heard this from the get-go, I wouldn't have even come here.

470
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:39,750
I made an effort to come here all the way from Seoul, and you dare to shame me?

471
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,620
He's the son of my college classmate.

472
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,090
I can't... I can't throw it on him.

473
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:50,360
I am Goldline's Mother Teresa, Baek Ma Ri.

474
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,970
Then...

475
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,010
I got it. Take the Go siblings and go back first.

476
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:22,090
It's been a while since I've been to Busan. Busan wants to play with me and won't let me go.

477
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,680
Dude, you're actually worrying about me?

478
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,960
You're all grown, Louis.

479
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,960
Okay, I'll hang up.

480
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,990
Oh? Ma Ri?

481
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,500
It's Ma Ri! It's Ma Ri! Why is she in Busan?

482
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,190
- Ma Ri!
- Oh, you scared me!!!

483
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,700
Oh? Is something wrong? Why are you crying?

484
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,590
What does it matter to you whether I cry or not?

485
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,460
- Ma Ri!
- Ah, don't!

486
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Stay far, far, far away from me!

487
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,730
- Th-That time before—
- Don't!!!

488
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,790
Don't say it!!!

489
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,000
Am I scary? I'm dirty, aren't I?

490
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,050
Let's go together!

491
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,960
- Ma Ri!
- Why do you keep following me?

492
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:18,590
Uh... If you feel depressed (oo-ul-ha-myeon), then you eat ulmyeon (noodle dish similar to udon).

493
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,500
If you're annoyed (jja-jeung-na-myeon), then you eat jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles).

494
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:28,610
Do you want to go watch a movie with me? I know a really good place.

495
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,980
It's over there, right over there, in the mountain.

496
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,720
It's pretty.

497
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,000
Do you want to go? Follow me.

498
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,620
Hey! Let Go Bok Nam sit beside Go Bok Sil!

499
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,800
Why?! It's been a long time for me, too, since I last saw Bok Sil, you know!

500
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,710
- Go Bok Nam came back from the dead!
- I came back from the dead too, you know!

501
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,370
Shut up! It's my car!

502
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,560
Fine.

503
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:17,030
I'm not even your chauffeur... Just my luck...

504
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,330
Everyone put your seat belts on!!!

505
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,230
Driver Cha, let's get going.

506
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,890
Hey!!! What do you mean, Driver?

507
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,590
Go, go, go! Go, go!

508
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,420
That lighthouse seems to resemble a baby bottle.

509
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:46,040
Ding dong daeng (correct)! It's actually named The Baby Bottle Lighthouse.

510
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,850
I just took a wild guess, but I got it right.

511
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:52,360
The lady from the supermarket let me know that you end up having a baby if you visit here.

512
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,170
A baby?

513
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:58,480
Jeong Ran. You're up there in age, so you should hurry up and have a baby.

514
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,500
Ho Joon.

515
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:09,860
Right now... You're talking about a baby when there's no marriage or even a proposal?

516
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,790
Please do things in the right order! Please!

517
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,780
Young Master Louis prepared such a tear-inducing event for Go Bok Sil!

518
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,990
You're not even worth half of half of him, seriously!

519
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:25,750
Jeong Ran. Jeong Ran. I'm just worried about you having a late pregnancy, that's all.

520
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,710
Worry about yourself! Yourself!!

521
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,000
Don't come near me!

522
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,610
- Ah, w-wait—
- Don't come!!!

523
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,280
Jeong Ran, that's not what I mean. Jeong Ran!

524
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,470
Do we still have a long way to go?

525
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,190
Man, I've gone crazy.

526
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:46,130
I followed you for no reason and now I'm going through all this.

527
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:49,180
Ow, my foot hurts!

528
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,750
- Here.
- What?

529
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,710
Please wear this at least.

530
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,650
You said your foot hurts.

531
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:04,180
I'll never be able to wear that! With this kind of elegant style, do you think wearing those shoes makes sense?

532
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:08,680
I know that it doesn't make sense, but you said that you were really hurting, so we could make it make sense. Wait a second.

533
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,430
Oh my, oh my! What are you doing?

534
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:13,460
Oh my, wait a minute!

535
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,560
Oh my! What in the world. Omo, look here!

536
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,400
Oh my god. Excuse me!

537
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,150
Oh my god. Omo, omo. Hey!

538
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,170
Where are you going with my shoes?!

539
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:29,490
You told me to stay far away from you. We're almost there, so please follow me!

540
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,870
Why is he acting like that, freezing his feet off? Is he pretending to be nice in front of me?

541
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:42,760
Oh, just looking at him annoys me!

542
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,350
What is this?

543
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,420
What's up with this?

544
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,820
One, two, three!

545
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,530
- Oh, the movie's starting.
- Let's go.

546
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,390
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Hey, I told you to keep your distance, didn't I?

547
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,550
Yes, I'm planning to.

548
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,300
That time...

549
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,060
You had a really hard time because of me, didn't you?

550
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,690
Oh no, what should I do? Hurry up!

551
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:17,530
What are you telling me to do?!

552
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:22,850
If you keep this up, I think I might really do something here that I'll be sorry to you for.

553
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,720
Hold it in! Hold it in no matter what, okay?!

554
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,580
I... Oh, Father! Oh, Father!

555
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,750
Oh, Father! What should I do?

556
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,510
What in the world?

557
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:58,450
- You see, I—
- Shut up.

558
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:02,740
Don't even bring that up. I don't even want to think about it.

559
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,290
I heard that you don't drive your car around because of me.

560
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,000
- I said forget it!
- Yes, ma'am.

561
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,530
But, if you happen to need it, I—

562
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,160
Oh, seriously!

563
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,740
- About your car, I can—
- Why are you doing this to me?

564
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,920
Do you want to go see the movie?

565
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:08,900
Is she cold?
♬ Dreams are my reality  ♬

566
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,530
- Go away.
- Okay.

567
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:32,120
Oh. Should I just let it out silently?

568
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,040
Is she thirsty?

569
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,780
- Ma Ri, here's a dri—
- I told you to go away!

570
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,420
I got it, I got it. Okay.

571
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,370
Sorry.

572
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,840
I should just go outside.

573
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,800
- Wow, what's this smell?
- It stinks.

574
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,400
This farting sound is my farting sound. For sure!

575
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,190
Oh, he must have eaten kimchi.

576
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:52,030
No! I ate meat, actually! Woo!

577
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,250
- Hey, let us watch the movie.
- Sorry!

578
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,150
I even pooped a month ago.

579
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:01,200
What in the world.

580
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,540
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

581
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,200
- Let us watch the movie.
- Sure thing.

582
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:10,620
It sounds like a ship horn, right? Bonggggg!

583
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,690
I'm going nuts.

584
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,430
Take your time and eat a lot.

585
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:28,130
- He's not a ghost, right?
- Right.

586
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,870
So he isn't a ghost.

587
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:37,830
Hey, you better be good to your sister since you came back from the dead.

588
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:41,220
Your sister shed a lot of tears because of you. Got it?

589
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,660
Yes, ma'am.

590
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,650
I cried a whole lot too, understand?

591
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,300
Yes.

592
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,850
How did you end up having two men who died and came back to life around you?

593
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:56,910
Aigoo, your life has so much variety.

594
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,860
I know, right?

595
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,490
Slowly, eat slowly. You might get indigestion.

596
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:05,630
Oh, I'm full.

597
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,480
You go home now.

598
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,160
Why? I'm going to sleep here.

599
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,470
This place is seriously small. How can three people sleep here?

600
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,780
Last time, four of us slept in your house.

601
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,550
Back then it was just because you guys didn't have anywhere else to go.

602
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,440
Now you have a mansion. Why cramp your style in this tiny house?

603
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,830
- But Bok Sil is here.
- Yeah, you should sleep over, Hyung.

604
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,430
That's my plan.

605
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,500
Come on out now.

606
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,860
The siblings haven't seen each other for so long, they must have tons to talk about. Read between the lines, will you?!

607
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,280
Oh... Is that right?

608
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:46,170
Bok Sil... I'll concede my place to Bok Nam today.

609
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:48,200
Thank you.

610
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,790
- Sister-in-law, good night.
- Okay!

611
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:54,640
Ow.

612
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,500
You mean brother-in-law, not sister-in-law. Where did we get another narrow-mouthed toad?

613
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,310
You two make such a pair, don't you?

614
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,370
Good night.

615
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,410
- Be safe on your way back.
- Okay.

616
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:07,640
Do you want to sleep over with In Seong?

617
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,280
No way!

618
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,390
Alright. Good night.

619
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:13,770
Good bye.

620
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:20,690
You must be tired. Let's sleep.

621
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:31,330
Bok Nam... Do you know Grandma passed away?

622
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:37,240
Yeah. I heard.

623
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,570
She was so worried about you.

624
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,920
I promised Grandma that I would find you and

625
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,590
feed you a warm meal, when I came to Seoul.

626
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,530
Grandma,

627
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,570
Don't worry about Bok Nam and go peacefully.

628
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:05,950
I will find Bok Nam, feed him and take care of him.

629
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:11,330
So Grandma, don't worry about us

630
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,300
and go peacefully, please?

631
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:55,570
Grandma, I kept my promise.

632
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:58,540
Now don't worry about us anymore.

633
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:09,340
The man I know, called Shopping King Louis,

634
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,060
seemed naive and stupid, but

635
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:17,210
he had a sincere heart like a kid who doesn't calculate.

636
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:21,780
And his 10,000 times of sincerity

637
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:27,880
became the seed of a miracle that changed her sadness into happiness.

638
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,480
Yes, this is Detective Nam Joon Hyeok.

639
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:01,120
The victim of the Eunsung-dong case is awake?!

640
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:07,030
Yes, I will be there right away. Detective Lee, let's go to the hospital.

641
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:18,290
The victim of the Eunsung-dong case regained consciousness.

642
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,950
Oh, is that so?

643
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:28,360
We are on our way to the hospital. I will contact you as soon as we find out his identity.

644
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,810
Okay. Thank you.

645
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:39,040
Hopefully Secretary Goo won't speak about me.

646
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,280
What is this?

647
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,830
Yes, Team Leader. The Eunsung-dong victim is gone.

648
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:09,530
Hey! Officer Wang! Officer Lee!

649
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:16,670
What have you guys been doing?! Hurry and search around the hospital. Now!

650
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:29,190
President Baek, we got to the hospital but the Eunsung-dong victim has disappeared.

651
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:37,150
R-Really? I wanted to know his identity, but okay.

652
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,550
Let me know when you find him.

653
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:58,850
Hello? Yes, that's right.

654
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,520
Who's speaking, please?

655
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,010
Yes, you work with my husband? You're Secretary Goo?

656
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:10,020
Come over sometime. I'd like to prepare a meal—

657
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,310
What's with you?

658
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,620
Get out right now. Get out!

659
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,740
Honey, Secretary Goo might hear you. That's so rude!

660
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,370
Get out please!

661
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:22,240
Why do you always vent your anger on me?!

662
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:34,870
Secretary Goo? Where are you? We should meet immediately. Let's talk in person.

663
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,250
Long time no talk, President Baek.

664
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:44,450
I see that Kang Ji Sung has returned to Gold Group while I was sleeping.

665
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:52,260
Are you trying to threaten me?

666
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,990
What do you mean threaten? I didn't even go visit the Chairwoman, yet.

667
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,850
President Baek, if you act so defensively,

668
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,490
I can't guarantee you how I'll change.

669
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:13,290
Fine. How much will do? What do you want me to do?

670
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:17,660
Hello? Hello!

671
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,900
No way.

672
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:40,930
Hello?
