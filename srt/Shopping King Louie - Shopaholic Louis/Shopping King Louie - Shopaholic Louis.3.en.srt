Hey!

24
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,000
[Crazy Presence]

25
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,250
Hello, stranger!

26
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,600
Where are you going?

27
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,990
I'll... become your umbrella.

28
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,100
Come on.

29
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,030
What's your name?

30
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,180
- I don't know.
- Heol...

31
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,710
- Hah!
- How old are you?

32
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,680
I don't know that, either.
- Heol...

33
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,070
You...

34
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,280
You're a thief and a scammer! Give me my ginseng back!

35
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,540
Give me my money!

36
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,210
What is this? Are they fighting?

37
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,660
What's wrong with you!

38
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,250
Sheesh...

39
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,590
She fainted!

40
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,870
He hit her...

41
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,760
Go Bok Sil. Go Bok Sil?

42
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,190
Go Bok Sil! Go Bok Sil!!

43
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,240
Whoa

44
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,070
Call 911, tell them to bring an ambulance!

45
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,070
Big news!

46
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,050
Big news, big news!

47
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,610
- The headquarters director got himself into trouble.
- What are you talking about?

48
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,060
There's a big commotion, because an ambulance came downstairs to take a lady who was cleaning the lobby.

49
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,040
A cleaning lady? Why?

50
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,960
- The director hit that woman and she... passed out.
- What!

51
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,170
He didn't hit her, he just pushed her hard.

52
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,710
That's the same thing.

53
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,690
At any rate, at first, the headquarters director started screaming and the fight began

54
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,830
and that woman suddenly went like, "Hey! You scammer! Give me my money!"

55
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,140
And jumped on him.

56
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,810
Hey, the headquarters director is not a person who'd scam others...

57
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,340
But...

58
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,970
How do you know a person 100%?

59
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,670
A hysterical director by day and a mysterious con artist by night.

60
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,950
A Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde can be next to us.

61
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,140
I have a favor to ask.

62
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:44,440
I just need to check the footage from Elevator No. 3 around 10 a.m. yesterday morning.

63
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,840
Yes, there!

64
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,640
That man there, please zoom in on him.

65
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,810
That has to be Louis's face.

66
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,860
But he died... Who is that hobo?

67
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,510
A warm cup of fish cake soup on a rainy day. That is the best.

68
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,430
What do you think?

69
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,720
It's completely my style.

70
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,860
Okay, then let's sum up what you've told me.

71
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,840
One day, you woke up wearing Bok Nam's fake track suit

72
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,600
sleeping next to a scary hobo. And you have no memory of anything before that, right?

73
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,530
It's retrograde amnesia. Didn't you have a wound on your head?

74
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,150
Uh, well I think it was a bit swollen over here.

75
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,680
Oh my god!

76
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,280
Because of physical force, there is a big chance a certain part of your brain was damaged.

77
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,320
Hyung, are you a doctor?

78
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,180
No.

79
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,810
Is it true that you only have 3000 won ($3)?

80
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,000
You're sure that the girl you're living with is a janitor at the Goldline Building?

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,970
Then we'll come into some money.

82
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,200
Let's see!

83
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,080
Ah, you have an aristocratic face.

84
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,490
Your skin also looks great.

85
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,120
You look 100% from a rich family!

86
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,140
- Hyung, are you a fortune teller?
- A fortune teller?

87
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,300
No, no. Not that.

88
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,370
Then, what do you do?

89
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,090
- Employment preparer.
- Huh?

90
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,890
I said an employment preparer, punk.

91
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,810
What is that?

92
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,680
You don't know what that is?

93
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,390
In other words, job seeking activist. It's a job where you study.

94
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,210
That's why there's no way but for me to know a lot.

95
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,660
Aunt! I'd like one more cup of fish cake soup, please!

96
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,150
Unlimited free refills allowed. Enjoy yourself.

97
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,500
Malnutrition?

98
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,810
Oh my...

99
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,670
VIP Room

100
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,880
Bok Sil... Bok Sil...

101
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,340
Go Bok— Huh?

102
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,480
She doesn't have money, why is she in a VIP room?
 1106 Go Bok Sil VIP

103
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,080
Who are you?

104
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,040
Are you Go Bok Sil's mother?

105
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,800
No!

106
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,690
I came to give this to her because she left her clothes at work.

107
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,770
Please have a talk with me.

108
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,840
I truly have nothing to do with Bok Sil!

109
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,760
Don't even start if you're going to ask me to pay for her hospital bill or to take care of her.

110
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,770
I'll take care of her bills.

111
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,820
Don't worry and talk at ease.

112
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,420
So it's been about a month since Go Bok Sil began working at Goldline?

113
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,550
Tomorrow's payday, so it's exactly one month now.

114
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,400
But Bok Sil, that girl, she works hard and does it well. But

115
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,640
oh, because she doesn't have money or something, she seems dingy.

116
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,640
She's always asking to borrow my cell phone, to find her a room. She even borrowed money from me today.

117
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,890
On top of that, she says she was scammed out of a 5,000,000 won worth wild ginseng or something.

118
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,470
I felt sorry for her when that sprightly girl was crying and sniffling.

119
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,320
This damn person had nobody to scam, but to cheat wild ginseng out of a kid who just came up to the capital city.

120
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,600
Anyway, that type of people needs to be thrown into the Han River over there or

121
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,070
be stuffed into a burning hot fire pit and feel the full wrath of heaven.

122
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,380
Who says?!

123
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,770
It was a con job?

124
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,050
Headquarters Director, you are quite strange.

125
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,470
Why are you siding with a con artist?

126
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,790
I'm just saying that people all have their own circumstances.

127
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,310
But if that son-of-a-bitch was in some kind of circumstances, he should have called... She called so many times.

128
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,840
Anyway, whoever this son-of-a-bitch is, when he gets caught by my hands, he's dead.

129
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,510
You scammer! Give me my ginseng back!

130
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,340
Who are you calling a scammer? Calm down!

131
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,580
Why am I here?

132
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,740
You just passed out anywhere and fell asleep.

133
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,270
Aigoo, why are you doing this?

134
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,920
I remember you throwing me aside, Ahjusshi.

135
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,500
What are you talking about?

136
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,940
I never threw you aside nor scammed the ginseng out of you.

137
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,380
Here, open it.

138
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,380
You sold it to me for 1 million won, but I gave you what it's really worth.

139
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,950
Ahjussi!

140
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,900
Out of 5 million won, I took out 1 million won for fees. So, it's 4 million won.

141
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,580
Everything in this world goes through a middleman in distribution and has fees taken away.

142
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,690
That's the rule, so don't begrudge the fees too much.

143
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,650
Ahjussi, thank you!

144
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,660
Thank you so much, Ahjussi!

145
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,520
From this moment on, I'm not the wild ginseng con-man, but the wild ginseng benefactor. Who am I?

146
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,720
- Ginseng Benefactor!
- That's right, Ginseng Benefactor. Starting Monday, report for work at the product planning department.

147
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,790
Yes!

148
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,870
What? Wait a minute.

149
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,080
What did you just say?

150
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,780
I said that you should report for work at the product planning department. You can't understand what I'm saying?

151
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,000
What do you do at that place? The thing is, I...

152
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,110
You say a lot of unnecessary things. Who am I?

153
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,500
The Wild Ginseng Benefactor.

154
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,770
Your benefactor is saying it, so no ifs or buts.

155
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,250
I'm leaving.

156
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,160
Rest well over the weekend, and eat lots of meat.

157
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,660
Bok Sil!

158
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,590
Why are you back so late? I waited a really long time.

159
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,270
Hey, the wild ginseng con-man -

160
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,800
No, the Wild Ginseng Benefactor has appeared.

161
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,950
What?

162
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,800
Ta-da!

163
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,890
What's this?

164
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,350
Oh my god! Where did he appear from?

165
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,040
From the company. Isn't it incredible?

166
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,850
I was going to catch the thief for you, but it's all over now.

167
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,940
Just get your memory back and find Bok Nam for me.

168
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,910
Okay, I'll definitely find Bok Nam for you. Trust me.

169
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,540
You're really trustworthy.

170
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,080
What is that?

171
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,050
Hotteok! ( pancake) It smells good, right?

172
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,500
Let's hurry up and eat. I'm hungry!

173
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,540
Why are you eating outside when it's nighttime?

174
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,700
There's a bug in the room.

175
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,470
A bug? Where is the bug?

176
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,480
Right there.

177
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,310
- Where?
- Why isn't it here?

178
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,320
- It's not here.
- Aaaah!

179
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,070
What? What?

180
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,650
- It has too many legs!
- Huh?

181
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:52,470
Hey, this is a money bug (centipede). This is a good guy.

182
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,870
Don't touch it!

183
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,650
Okay...

184
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,390
Is it okay now?

185
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:18,610
♬ She may be the face I can't forget  ♬

186
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,340
♬  A trace of pleasure or regret  ♬

187
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:28,370
♬ Maybe my treasure or the price I have to pay  ♬

188
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,450
♬ She may be the song that summer sings ♬

189
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,730
♬ May be the chill that autumn  ♬

190
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,080
Bok Sil.

191
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,260
Did we ever meet a long time ago?

192
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,290
What are you talking about? Did you go crazy after eating a hotteok?

193
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,320
It's late. Let's go to sleep now.

194
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,940
There's a lot to do tomorrow.

195
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,740
I have no appetite.

196
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,380
Chairwoman, you must eat.

197
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,030
If you keep doing this, you'll collapse!

198
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,990
Chairwoman.

199
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,970
Should I bring in the breakfast feast with 12 side dishes that the young master used to eat?

200
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,750
What Louis used to eat?

201
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,120
Bring it here.

202
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:37,320
You said that Koreans live by the strength that rice gives them, so you told us to always feed him rice for breakfast.

203
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,640
This is the breakfast food that my Louis always ate?

204
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,280
Yes. Instead of instant foods, I always made him organic and natural foods.

205
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,850
W-W-Why are you doing this?

206
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:14,180
Do you prefer that I throw you a punch and give you a puffy black eye?

207
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:19,390
Or do you want to experience the feeling of your nose bridge collapsing after bleeding buckets from your nose?

208
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,380
D-D-Did I do something wrong?

209
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,030
Don't touch the chairwoman's food.

210
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,050
If you act up again,

211
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:36,980
you'll get to know how it feels to have your mouth broken open and have all of your teeth fall out. Okay?

212
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,560
Butler Heo!

213
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,800
Yes!

214
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,590
Hey.

215
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,030
You sure are high maintenance.

216
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,410
Is it that delicious?

217
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,300
After we eat all of this, let's go shop for household items.

218
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,080
We're going shopping?

219
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,700
Sheesh, really!

220
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,660
Bok Sil.

221
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,220
Induction Titanium Diamond Frying Pan

222
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,580
Bok Sil, that one.

223
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,030
Storeowner!

224
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,750
Storeowner, I'll take this one.

225
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,830
Wow!

226
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,920
Bok Sil, I like it here so much.

227
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,570
Me, too.

228
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,740
Hey, how are you so good at picking items?

229
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,470
You have a precious talent.

230
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,960
They start talking to me, saying, "Please buy me."

231
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,440
For sure, you are crazy.

232
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,480
Let's go buy clothes.

233
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,050
I have my dignity to consider. I can't wear this knockoff forever.

234
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,040
Where did your brother find an outfit like this?

235
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,270
Hey! I paid as much as twenty dollars for it, you know.

236
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,820
No, no, no.

237
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,190
This was introduced in the Luis Ssaton 2016 SS collection.

238
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,430
It's a tracksuit from the Goldline Luxury Store in a special edition launch of one hundred,

239
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,150
with numbers 1-100 embroidered on the back.

240
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,620
Number 1 cost more than 10 million won!

241
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,180
I can't understand a thing you're saying.

242
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,890
So...

243
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,070
There are too many things you don't know, Bok Sil.

244
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,210
Hey! Is that something you should be saying right now?

245
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,000
Quickly, we need to go buy clothes!

246
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,030
Ta-da!

247
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,770
Does it look okay?

248
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,750
It's cute.

249
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,520
You look pretty.

250
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,680
I haven't even bought rice yet, but we have so much.

251
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,310
Let's buy a cell phone. If we have a cell phone,

252
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:21,150
from the comfort of your home, you can buy everything you need.

253
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,520
They deliver it to your house too!

254
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,190
- How can such a thing exist?
- Are you possibly an idiot?

255
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,710
Hey... who's calling whom an idiot?

256
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,640
Look. Everyone here has a cell phone.

257
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,810
If you have that, there's nothing you can't do.

258
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,060
Look. You can shop, watch TV,

259
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,220
take pictures, and make calls.

260
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,360
Ah, buy me a cell phone! I'm the only one in our class without one!

261
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,990
If I have that, I can surf the internet, send texts to my classmates...

262
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,950
You can watch TV. And those mobile games, w-well, you can do it all!

263
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,370
Noona!

264
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,580
You're saying the same thing as Bok Nam.

265
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,120
Yeah, Bok Nam! If we have a cell phone, we can track his location and find him!

266
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,860
Really?!

267
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,380
- I've signed on two phones under Go Bok Sil.
- Yes, thank you.

268
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,810
What the heck? Hey!

269
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,000
Oh, stop! Don't do it! Hey!

270
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,900
Thank you.

271
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,750
Bok Sil!

272
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,290
Ah, why?

273
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,870
Please give me a hand with these. I'm so tired.

274
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,520
You eat so much, where does all that strength go?

275
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,980
Give it to me.

276
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,650
- This feeling is new to me.
- What kind of feeling?

277
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:59,480
It's heavy, my arms and legs hurt, I'm sweating, and I'm short of breath. Ah, I'm tired.

278
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,280
- Hello.
- Ah, you scared me. Hyung!

279
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,620
Hi. You must be Bok Sil.

280
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,950
- He's the hyung that lives downstairs.
- Oh.

281
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,960
Hi. Call me Oppa In Seong. Jo In Seong.

282
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,690
- Hello.
- That's right.

283
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,700
You're prettier than I thought you would be. And you seem to have strong survival skills.

284
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,920
Early 20's?

285
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,920
- I guess you don't wear makeup.
- No.

286
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,290
Isn't he the best? He's not a fortune teller, but knows a lot.

287
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,020
What was it? Emp-Emp...

288
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,860
What was it, Hyung?

289
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,780
- Employment preparer...
- What?

290
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,450
Employment preparer...

291
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,770
Employment preparer?

292
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,930
Ah, someone looking for a job...

293
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,740
He's cool, right?

294
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,230
- I guess you didn't buy any food.
- Right.

295
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,370
- We couldn't carry any more.
- Oh, I see.

296
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,740
Then, should Oppa help you?

297
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,890
- Please deliver it here.
- Yes.

298
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,910
Detective, I'll tell you my phone number.

299
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:53,490
Wow, you finally bought one! It's good.
Did you receive your pay?

300
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,270
Yes, I got my salary and got money for my wild ginseng too.

301
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:01,060
Go Bok Sil, I guess you'll be better off now.

302
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,850
Detective, I heard that if you have a cell phone, you can find Bok Nam.

303
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,250
Can you try to find him?

304
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,630
Bok Sil, that is...

305
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,400
It's not yours, but I need Bok Nam's phone number to

306
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,020
be able to track him down.

307
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,340
Really?

308
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,130
Hey, anyway... how is that homeless guy? Is he manageable?

309
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,550
Guys, the delivery is here!

310
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,110
Wow, the partition is nice!

311
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,730
We have blinds at our house, but you guys have fabric.
It's so pretty.

312
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,960
Why is she putting up a curtain?

313
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,620
- You've never used something like this before?
- No, I lit a fire in the cooking fireplace.

314
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,800
Fireplace? The kind where you burn logs? That fireplace?

315
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,650
Bok Sil, that kid, works really well.

316
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:09,890
Look how fast her hands are. She's young, but very mature.
Don't you think?

317
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,000
I know, right? I think Bok Sil will make a good maid.

318
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,150
Maid? Heol...

319
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,460
What does this say?

320
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:32,900
- What are you doing?
- Look, there's English on the back.

321
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,430
- Louis?
- Give me this. Wow, this is a designer item.

322
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,930
- It is studded with zircon. Daebak!
- Really?

323
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,450
This brand doesn't make underwear.

324
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,400
How do you know that?

325
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,760
Louis... Louis... Louis...

326
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,220
Hey. What if that's your name?

327
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,390
Hey, Bok Sil. We are not in the army. Why would anyone engrave his name on the back of his underwear?

328
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,840
- But Louis suits you. Make that your name.
- Should I?

329
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,890
Yeah.

330
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,890
Louis... Louis...

331
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,000
Mom. Was Louis a twin?

332
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,310
What are you talking about? He's an only child.

333
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,110
There isn't any birth secret, either?

334
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,750
Maybe he had a secret twin that was cast aside, or a different brother.

335
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,510
Ma Ri, is there something wrong?

336
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,760
At the company, I saw a beggar that looked exactly like Louis.

337
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,730
Are you worried that dead Louis was reincarnated as a beggar? It must be someone who resembles him.

338
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,980
Go first. An urgent matter came up, so I have to go to the company.

339
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,880
Uh...

340
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,370
You can drive, right?

341
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,370
Okay.

342
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,960
He just left.

343
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,800
Louis is dead.

344
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,300
Louis!

345
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,600
Woah.

346
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,010
Wow, the taste is killer.

347
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,420
- It's undercooked!
- It's okay.

348
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,420
It's mine!

349
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,510
Pieces of meat don't have your name written on them.

350
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,560
Hey, the meat is going to burn, flip it over.

351
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:19,180
Hey, I'm supposed to start working at the product planning department tomorrow, but

352
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,810
what kind of work do they do there?

353
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,910
I thought you cleaned.

354
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:27,880
The thing is, a higher-up at the company all of a sudden told me to come to work there.

355
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,790
That ginseng benefactor?

356
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,570
He's doing that so he can fire you later.

357
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,570
- Pardon?
- It's a strategy they use often in companies.

358
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:41,530
They want to fire you, but they look bad if they simply fire you. They also have to give you some severance payment.

359
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,840
What if you insist on not leaving? It becomes a huge headache for the company.

360
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,580
So, he's sending you to a totally different place.

361
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,150
Then what would happen? What?

362
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,990
You'd become self-conscious and start feeling left out, because you don't know how to do your job.

363
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,370
From there, you seem like a useless person, and your self esteem hits rock bottom.

364
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:03,260
Even if they don't force you to go, you leave with your own two feet.

365
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,910
That person is moving Bok Sil so he can fire her?

366
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,540
That's right. From the company perspective, they want to blow their nose without lifting a finger.

367
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,570
Bok Sil, cut it.

368
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,450
Yes.

369
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,730
Hey, they could just fire her. Why would they do that, making their own heads hurt?

370
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,710
I think he scouted Bok Sil because she's a good worker.

371
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,380
Look at this beautiful young man. Have you been living in a hot house, sheltered all your life?

372
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,050
He paid for the ginger root though.

373
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,070
He could be a sincere and generous person.

374
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,480
You said you came from the mountain, but you really know nothing about the world.

375
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,600
He just shut you up with money because you cornered him for being a scammer!

376
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,860
After all, there's no way you two would know how big companies work.

377
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:51,770
- Aigoo, I've been wondering why you haven't been asking for food.
-You're here?

378
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,750
You were eating dinner here?

379
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,010
Pork belly? But I like neck meat better.

380
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,730
Eat plenty!

381
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,860
It needs to be crispy to taste good.

382
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,070
Huh? There's no Ssam (bean paste + pepper paste) sauce.

383
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,360
Ah! I'll bring it!

384
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,890
Eat a lot.

385
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,050
This tastes really good.

386
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,850
This is Bok Sil's!

387
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,090
So cheap! Are you showing off with a few pieces of meat?

388
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:21,330
I won't eat it! I won't!

389
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,820
So dirty and cheap...

390
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,650
Oh? You're already leaving?

391
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,250
Your burden is giving me the stink eye, so I'd better go down.

392
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,640
Burden? Me?

393
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,240
What else are you?

394
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,350
Hey, I had a nice meal!

395
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,210
Goodbye!

396
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,740
It's okay.

397
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,120
But there're still four left.

398
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,930
Mom... You know, those guys? Don't they seem like they're missing some screws?

399
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,770
Look who's talking.

400
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,680
Saying you're studying for the civil service exam, for ten years you've been rolling around

401
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,220
cleaning the floor with your back. You're...

402
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,530
plenty lacking, yourself.

403
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,720
Just go out and bring even 10,000 won ($10).

404
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,170
It's my wish to buy at least soybean paste noodles with that money.

405
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,840
Bok Sil, are you sleeping?

406
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,980
No.

407
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,230
What are you thinking about?

408
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,550
I'm thinking of Bok Nam.

409
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,510
Bok Nam likes meat too.

410
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,230
I'm worried if he's eating well.

411
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:25,920
When my memory comes back, I'll find your brother. Trust in me.

412
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,390
Okay.

413
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,740
There's no closet and no refrigerator.

414
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,820
There're so many things left to buy.

415
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,340
I'll order everything.

416
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,360
So don't worry about it and go to sleep. You need to go to work tomorrow.

417
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,720
Sleep well, Louis.

418
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:11,230
"Louis." She called my name.

419
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,330
Why are you following me? Don't dare say that you want to go to work with me.

420
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,770
Floral patterns are okay.

421
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,870
But the fabric material and design... Bok Sil, your overall style is too old.

422
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,200
Oh... oh. Wear the one we bought yesterday.

423
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,760
I don't want to.

424
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,780
Wow. Bok Sil is so stubborn.

425
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,760
♬ Lost The Way ♬

426
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,080
Hey! Are you thinking of riding the bus and following me?

427
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:18,480
At least tie this on. This won't do.

428
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:24,320

A subtle difference completes the look.

435
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,090
For your old-style look today, this is the best complement.

436
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,210
You're pretty!

00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,080
Hello!

446
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:14,280
Huh? You're the one who got carried away by the ambulance.

447
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,540
Ah, yes.

448
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,420
Are you here to clean the office?

449
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,650
You came?

450
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,320
This is Go Bok Sil who will start working with us today.

451
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,850
Introduce yourself.

452
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,950
Ah. I'm Go Bok Sil! Please take care of me!

453
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,260
- Manager Lee, you said you need more people, right?
- That's right, but—

454
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,870
Go Bok Sil will take care of all of our miscellaneous tasks.

455
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,910
Everyone, make good use of her.

456
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,440
- Byeon Do Jin?
- Yes?

457
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,690
Go to the support team and get the laptop Go Bok Sil will be using.

458
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,310
Okay.

459
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,610
Stop by HR, fill out the forms and go get your ID.

460
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,450
Follow him.

461
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,210
Alright.

462
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,290
I'll have her intern for one month and decide if she should stay or not.

463
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,100
So keep that in mind. Get ready for a meeting at 10.

464
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,270
Yes.

465
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:14,010
What kind of baffling situation is this? Seriously...

466
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:18,040
Does he like that girl?

467
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,420
Aigoo, our manager...

468
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,940
I heard you're preparing for the Fall Hot Deal.

469
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:29,530
Yes, it's a project we're simultaneously pushing in order to introduce mobile UI that's improved with curation.

470
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:33,050
Okay, good. Is Sunnyland opening in October?

471
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:38,930
Yes, we're doing our best to build the best Shop-A-Tainment space for mall goers.

472
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,550
- I got it.
- Then—

473
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,780
Oh, yeah, I heard something strange from the HR.

474
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,870
I heard you hired someone from the janitorial staff as your intern?

475
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,360
Won't there be a lot of talk?

476
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,910
I hired her as temporary staff for a month. I needed more hands as well.

477
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,100
I think she's someone I can train up as a great MD.

478
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,740
You don't know how to use a computer?

479
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,410
That's right.

480
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,270
Then what about the internet?

481
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,340
I used it a little bit in middle school.

482
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,400
Is it okay to hire anyone like this?

483
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,740
A computer and net illiterate at a shopping mall company?

484
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,190
This is like some illiterate person working for a publishing company.

485
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,960
Aigoo. She must have at least used mobile shopping apps, right?

486
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,460
Do you have a cell phone?

487
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,710
Yes. I bought one yesterday. I know how to call.

488
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,300
Oh!

489
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,750
Go Bok Sil. Go do some errands.

490
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,710
Go to Starmex and buy a cup of ice shake, dark mocha, decaf.

491
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:36,300
- I'll have an iced Americano. - Then I'll have a Matcha Latte.

492
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,910
I'll also have an iced Americano. Large size.

493
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,700
I'll have a Strawberry Creme Frappe.

494
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,000
I'll have a Caramel Macchiato, standard size.

495
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,680
?????

496
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,760
- I'll—
- Why don't you come with me?

497
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,410
Bok Sil, I'll help you.

498
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,540
If you have any questions from now on, ask me.

499
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,160
Let's go.

500
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,050
Oh my goodness. Team Leader Baek is too much.

501
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,400
Is it okay to be this nice?

502
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,350
She has everything. She's so perfect!

503
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,660
She's pretty, talented, and nice. That's a rare combination.

504
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,070
She's a total OP (overpowered; anime, game jargon) character.

505
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:20,350
She's us female employees' wanna-be star.

506
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,100
Please add whipping cream to the milk tea latte.

507
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,940
- Yes, I understand.
- That will be to go.

508
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,820
Hello.

509
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:33,570
Strawberry Creme Frappe, Ice Shaken Dark Mocha, Matcha Latte...

510
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,940
Two cups of Iced Americano, one large,

511
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,130
and Caramel Macchiato, standard size.

512
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:53,400
♬ She will be the face I can't forget♬

513
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,140
♬ The traces of pleasure or regret ♬

514
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:03,120
♬ May be my treasure or the price I have to pay ♬

515
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,200
♬ She may be the song that summer sings ♬

516
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,820
♬ May be the chill that autumn brings ♬

517
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,430
♬ May be a hundred different things ♬

518
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,740
♬ Within the measure of a day ♬

519
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:25,300
Luis Ssaton, Louie Carros, Louis the 14th

520
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,590
- Geez...
- Louis!

521
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:33,440
Louis! We should eat. It's lunchtime!

522
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,410
Ooh! Yo! Fried egg and bean paste soup!

523
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,690
This is mine.

524
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:45,700
But there are two bowls of rice. I'll buy dinner later so let's eat.

525
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,640
How did you know there was food?

526
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,220
Hey, you can tell right away when you see Bok Sil's face.

527
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,370
She's the type of person who'd prepare a meal table even for her unwanted family member and then go to work.

528
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,510
Wow...

529
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:05,550
Hey, you need to get a rice cooker. With that, you can eat warm rice at every meal.

530
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,750
- Wow, Bok Sil's cooking is just...
 - Purchase

531
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:20,090
is so great. This is so delicious. You're such a lucky bastard.

532
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,650
Doesn't your mom feed you?

533
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,010
She does. Once in a while.

534
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,340
Oh my god.

535
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,750
I'm so full. I feel like throwing up.

536
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,680
Do you have coffee?

537
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,290
I do, but no hot water.

538
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,050
You can just boil it.

539
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,010
How do I?

540
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,470
This punk, what exactly is your identity?

541
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,710
Buy a gas stove and electric pot.

542
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,780
You need a gas stove for Bok Sil to make side dishes and soup at the same time.

543
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,900
Electric pot will come in handy when you have to boil water.

544
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:13,430
Wow. You know so many things.

545
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:18,040
Hey, you may be a shopping king, but you have no idea about kitchen appliances.

546
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,510
It means you lived your life without experiencing such things.

547
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:30,640
Louis, by chance... were you locked up somewhere and ate food given to you by other people?

548
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:53,860
No... Louis looks too well off.

549
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,340
He looks too healthy to be like that.

550
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,760
Right, Louis might even be an immature second generation chaebol (Conglomerate owning family).

551
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,380
Here, please drink it.

552
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:55,750
No matter when I drink this, it's completely my style. It clings to my mouth.

553
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,440
Son of a rich family, my butt.

554
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:09,220
When I see Joong Won's company chairwoman's grandson's death...

555
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,010
life is really meaningless.

556
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,700
I heard he was young, too.

557
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,840
Yes, 25.

558
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,760
I marinated it in the plum syrup. Try it.

559
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:27,260
Sang Yeop is passing out invitations for his wedding next month.

560
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,850
When is Joong Won going to meet a woman

561
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:33,370
and get married?

562
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:03,990
I'm sorry!

563
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,300
Why didn't you just take the next one? Why did you run in?

564
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,690
I guess you have someone craning their neck waiting for you at home?

565
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,300
How does he know?

566
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,470
Don't run in the company.

567
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,700
Yes, Sir!

568
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,410
Thank you.

569
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,370
Thank you. Take care.

570
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,200
Europe Romance Tour Package Trip

571
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,090
Bok Sil. Bok Sil, come here.

572
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,280
Did I live here? It feels so familiar.

573
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,750
What?

574
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:34,660
Over here. If you turn at the end of this street...

575
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:39,970
there's a cafe called Boutiquere and their coffee and croissant is really yummy.

576
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,290
Really?

577
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,730
Awesome!

578
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,950
Louis! Bok Sil!

579
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:51,090
Since you're working, you have no time to look for your brother, right?

580
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:54,930
So, Louis and I have set up a company to find Bok Nam.

581
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,400
We'll go around the main areas in Seoul that see lots of foot traffic, and

582
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,790
we'll hand out flyers and Louis will sing from time to time.

583
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,560
♫ "Please find Bok Nam," like this.

584
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,960
Something of an event. Isn't it great? You can join us after work or on weekends.

585
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,660
Really?

586
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,980
It'll cost 30,000 won a day. It's for transportation and lunch.

587
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,870
Since you're the client, you should pay, right?

588
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:18,720
Of course.

589
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,990
I didn't include our pay.

590
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:24,320
It's like we're volunteering our services.

591
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,720
I really thank you for caring for me.

592
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,030
Geez... We're neighbors.

593
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,980
It's just that I don't think his memory is coming back anytime soon.

594
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,150
Here, just put your thumb stamp here.

595
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:52,390
There we go. Good!

596
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:55,540
Hey, Louis. Remember the song I taught you earlier? Let's sing it.

597
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,820
Okay. One, two, three, four!

598
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,640
- I'm embarrassed.
- We can't charge her at this rate.

599
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,750
C'mon, do it. One, two, three, four!
 Bok Nam... Bok Nam...

600
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,980
Bok Nam... 
One, two, three, four!

601
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,130
Ah, geez...

602
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:12,820
Geez...

603
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,410
Mom, eat slowly and a lot.

604
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,260
But where did you get hired anyway?

605
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,390
Huh? A venture. It's a start-up that advocates following the "Creative Economy" slogan.

606
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:31,740
My working hours are flexible and they pay me well.

607
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:36,710
More than that, they have such a huge trust in me. I even got paid in advance.

608
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,740
There was such a creative and wonderful company?

609
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,800
Yeah!

610
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,240
You're finally doing your job as a human being after ten years.

611
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:48,240
Oh, my son. Give it up, give it up, good, good boy!

612
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:53,280
Hello, please look at this. Thank you.

613
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,930
Hello.

614
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:05,370
Hello, thank you.

615
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,910
Yeah! Work done for today. Let's go home, Louis.

616
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,170
- Already?
- Yeah!

617
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:16,160
Hey, if you feel sorry just going straight home, do you want to stop by the street market over there?

618
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,440
Market?

619
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,450
Yeah! Great! Let's go.

620
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:27,900
How much?

621
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,920
Three thousand won. Take a look.

622
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,680
Mister, what about those?

623
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,560
- Hyung, try these on.
- They're cool.

624
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,240
♬ lasts forever. In the end ♬

625
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,310
♬ you changed. There is no reason, ♬

626
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,230
Wow!

627
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,530
♬ no sincerity  ♬

628
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:48,160
♬ Take away such a thing as love  ♬

629
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,980
♬ Tonight, I’ll be crooked ♬

630
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,300
Here you go!
♬ Leave me alone ♬

631
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,970
This is totally my style.

632
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,700
Hyung! How's this?
♬  alone anyway, I have no one, ♬

633
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,030
The color, debak.

634
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,300
What's debak?

635
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,560
♬ Take away the sugar-coated comfort  ♬

636
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,130
That one, please.
♬ Tonight, I’ll be crooked  ♬

637
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,960
What's this... ai...

638
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:09,870
Hyung, does this make sense?

639
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:12,690
With only 10,000 won, it's game over from head to toe.

640
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:15,470
But more than that, you're the one who doesn't make sense, shopping king.

641
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:20,570
Geez, you have a neat skill. You have quite a taste.

642
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:22,540
What kind of person did I used to be?

643
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:26,870
I know right? What on earth did you use to do, huh?

644
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:30,940
From today I will knight you with the title of "Shopping King".

645
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:35,390
Shopping King... Sounds familiar.

646
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,540
Overreacting again.

647
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:40,300
- Louis!
- This is why you shouldn't compliment little kids because they think it's true.

648
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,380
Louis!

649
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,170
Merry Christmas

650
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,090
Hey, what's wrong? Are you hurt?

651
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,310
My head feels like it's exploding.

652
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,110
My chest hurts too.

653
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,910
Does it hurt a lot?

654
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,730
Oh Louis, what should we do?

655
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,530
He doesn't have a fever.

656
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,550
I don't know what that is, but he won't let it go. So I had to spend my emergency fund to buy it.

657
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:16,200
It's used, but he said it's a limited edition and asked for 50,000 won. So surprised.

658
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,630
I'd like you to add that cost to the daily operation fee.

659
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,450
Gold Department Store?

660
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,250
It's beautiful.

661
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:58,470
It's the beach that our Louis used to like so much.

662
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,900
Gobosi, over here!

663
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,920
Here! Uh, here!

664
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,640
Here! Here!

665
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,560
Gobosi? What's Gobosi?

666
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,570
The young master says it's a secret and won't tell me.

667
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:21,530
Thanks to Gobosi, I'm so glad my Ji Sung gets to laugh a lot.

668
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:28,120
Did you say Gobosi lived 14 years?

669
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:32,980
I buried him in a nice sunny spot.

670
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:37,720
I had a hard time then because the young master wouldn't eat for a month.

671
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,910
I'm grateful to Gobosi.

672
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:46,740
He stayed by my Louis in my place.

673
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,950
Do you want me to fry some ham?

674
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:17,000
Bok Sil, this is a music box made by Gold Department Store 18 years ago. It's one of only 30 that were produced

675
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,550
to commemorate the 30th anniversary.

676
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,480
All of those facts show up there?

677
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,550
Of course.

678
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:24,560
How is your head?

679
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,710
If you are feeling sick, stay home today.

680
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:28,610
Don't wander around for no reason.

681
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:32,000
No, we should look for Bok Nam, really hard.

682
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:48,500
Why do you keep following me, so annoying.

683
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,500
Because I like you.

684
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,560
Why are you saying such poppycock early in the morning, making me cringe?

685
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,080
That's more like you.

686
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,100
[Breaking News] Heir to Gold Group Dies in a Car Accident

687
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:27,080
So, Gold Department Store and we are all the same company.

688
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,580
The chairwoman's grandson died.

689
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:36,340
So he died back then because of a car accident.

690
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,430
Go Bok Sil.

691
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,610
You haven't even worked here too long. How can you play around during work hours?

692
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,490
I'm sorry.

693
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:47,330
It's not enough for you to save every second, every minute for work. Yet you're surfing the internet?

694
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:50,790
Do you want to end your work here in a month? Do you want to be a janitor all your life?

695
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:52,040
No, Sir.

696
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,110
Bring me the schedules of all the meetings between our employees and vendors set for today.

697
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,720
Yes, Sir.

698
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,400
Hyung, let's go to work!

699
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,850
Wait a minute!

700
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,740
Hello?

701
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,260
I'm Director Kim Sang Wook from Financial Fraud Investigation Unit of the Financial Supervisory Service.

702
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:36,850
By chance, did you recently lose your wallet, ID, or passport? Things with your personal information?

703
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,760
Yes, right. Do you have my ID?

704
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,880
Yes, it's here.

705
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,350
What's my name?

706
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,940
It's Song Joong Gi.

707
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,160
Song Joong Gi...

708
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:00,280
So my name is Song Joong Gi.

709
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,080
Where are you? I will come.

710
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,100
First, listen to me well.

711
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,650
Well, right now...

712
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,760
because of a squad of scammers who committed fraud using your name...

713
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,360
some people have been victimized.

714
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,460
If you can't settle with them right now,

715
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,820
you yourself can be arrested.

716
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,870
Arrested?

717
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:26,020
So, you need to deposit the cash you have now to the account I'll tell you.

718
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,930
Don't hang up.

719
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:31,270
Take your ATM card and go to the bank right now!

720
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:35,330
This is an investigation pertaining to national security, so you can never disclose this to third-parties.

721
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:37,530
Please make your move quietly.

722
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:42,080
If I settle with them, can I get my ID back?

723
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,640
That's for sure.

724
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,240
What is my address?

725
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,700
You live in Cheongdam-dong (ritzy neighborhood).

726
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,350
Did you get to the bank?

727
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,490
Oh, yes I just got here.

728
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:59,310
Louis! Let's go, hurry!

729
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,600
Louis!

730
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,410
Eh? Louis!

731
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,580
Did he go somewhere?

732
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:15,090
The line is busy. Please leave your message after the beep...

733
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:18,600
2,000,000 won ($2,000)
Proceed to transfer?
No/Yes (Yes clicked)

734
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,400
I've just transferred the money.

735
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,910
Good! You did great! Great!

736
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:30,440
Song Joong Gi! You're free from now on!

737
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,120
So where should I go now?

738
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,490
Just go home! What do you mean where?

739
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,750
Eh?

740
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,700
Hello?

741
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,470
Hello?!

742
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,150
High-Class Brand Day.

743
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,520
Geeve (misspelled) 7% discount to Nara Card customers only?

744
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,540
Whaat (misspelled) about people like me without credit cards?

745
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,010
- Shopping King Louis

746
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:11,210
Shopping King Louis?

747
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,340
Didn't he come back home yet?

748
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,880
He didn't eat.

749
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,810
Don't luk for me!

750
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:37,020
Don't look for me... Don't luk for me?

751
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,130
What's with this kid?

752
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:41,410
He is such a mysterious guy.

753
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:43,640
Maybe he is saying to not look for him.

754
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:49,800
Eh? Are you saying he ran away from home? He has nowhere to go.

755
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,180
Probably he wants to be alone for a little while. Just let him be.

756
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:57,470
Why? Did something happen?

757
01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:01,830
You said the cell phone was bought under Go Bok Sil's name. Go Bok Sil is Song Joong Gi, does that make sense?

758
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:05,380
I didn't know. I really didn't.

759
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:11,550
I just wanted to know who I am, really.

760
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,750
Catch it!

761
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,170
Gobosi?

762
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:42,530
Gobosi... Gobosi!

763
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,380
Gobosi!

764
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:07,380
Gobosi! Gobosi, come here!

765
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:09,280
Gobosi!

766
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,920
Gobosi!

767
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,740
Why!

768
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,520
♬ Lost The Way, ♬

769
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,800
♬ I lost the way Far Away Far Away  ♬
