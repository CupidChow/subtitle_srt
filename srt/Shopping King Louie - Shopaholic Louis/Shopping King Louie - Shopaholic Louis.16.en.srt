1
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,580
This is an era where all the world is connected as one.

2
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,030
Hello?

3
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,790
- Ji Sung-
- I'm hanging up.

4
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,060
You can make a phone call anywhere, anytime.

5
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,270
With whom?
We didn't get to watch a movie last time.

6
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,890
You can send and receive messages whenever and wherever.

7
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,900
I miss you.

8
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,730
Why did you run away, Young Master Bok Nam?

9
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,500
Some people from Seoul came to our house to film a documentary.

10
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,240
I was curious about city life.

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,970
A documentary?

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,970
Do you remember the name of the documentary?

13
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,870
Backwoods Korea.

14
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,510
It says the program name, "Backwoods Korea," in the corner of the screen.

15
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,980
Backwoods Korea.

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,420
Are you okay?

17
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,540
♬ If I rush,  ♬

18
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,030
♬ all the more I'll get caught violating the awkwardness speed limit. ♬

19
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,250
♬ I will obey the signals you made, ♬

20
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,520
♬ turn on the navigation ♬

21
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,750
Bok Sil. I thought she felt familiar for some reason.

22
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,270
Didn't you already fall for her at that time?

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,630
No, I didn't!

24
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:03,260
♬ And I Need a Navigation Takes Me Where  ♬

25
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:10,810
Isn't she cute?
♬ It Can Lead and Tell Me Where You Are ♬

26
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,320
Was this truly... our first meeting?

27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,710
Last Episode
When You Wish Upon a Star

28
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,340
Goldline

29
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,690
The president is coming!

30
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,950
It's the president! President!

31
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,140
- President Cha, I love you!
- I love you!

32
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,500
I thought that Headquarters Director Louis would become the president.

33
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,150
Maybe someday.

34
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,350
Don't you think that Director Cha has gotten cooler, since he became the president?

35
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,960
You're so right. Even his mustache looks cool.

36
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:06,280
♬  If you want a lover, I'll do anything you ask me to ♬

37
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:14,310
What is this? Why is he so cool?
♬  And if you want another kind of love, ♬

38
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,010
♬  I'll wear a mask for you ♬

39
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:24,100
♬  If you want a partner, take my hand ♬

40
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,650
What the heck? Do I still like Cha Joong Won? Huh?

41
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,320
No way.

42
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,850
This is so weird!

43
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,650
Ah, it tastes so good.

44
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,030
The coffee drunk here is the second best after the coffee at the rooftop room.

45
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,790
To me, too.

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,680
Sitting here reminds me of when we first came here.

47
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,580
This tastes delicious!!!

48
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,890
That is coffee for you. Delicious, right?

49
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,290
What is that dress?

50
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,880
My mom used to wear it. I cried so much when I lost it.

51
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,160
Oh... Bok Sil, your mom is not here anymore?

52
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,400
I don't even remember her face.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,520
Did you lose your memory, too?

54
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,560
She passed away when I was really young. My dad did too.

55
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,550
I see.

56
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,890
Do you think I have a family, too?

57
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,730
Of course! Don't worry too much and just wait.

58
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,010
Your memory will come back.

59
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,440
Like you said, my memory has come back,

60
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,800
and I got to see my family pictures and now remember Mom and Dad's faces as well.

61
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,080
What should we do about you, Bok Sil?

62
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,070
It's okay. Just finding Bok Nam made me plenty happy.

63
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,570
Thank you for finding Bok Nam for me, Louis.

64
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,140
Bok Sil.

65
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,920
Hey! People are coming!

66
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,150
Have some coffee.

67
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,160
I'll enjoy it... sir. (added formal -yo on end)

68
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,290
Director Lou, you look handsome today as well.

69
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,880
Hehe.

70
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,690
Director Lou is love.

71
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,170
- Ah, thank yo—
- As expected, our Director Lou is the best!

72
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,240
- Do Jin. Please take care of the tray.
- Yes, sir.

73
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,320
- Enjoy drinking it!
- Thank you!

74
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,520
Why are there so many papers to sign off on?

75
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,410
I should have continued with my sabbatical year. Why did I take on the useless president's position?

76
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,830
Wait. But are they working well?

77
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,880
Why am I so curious?

78
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,340
I'm not bored. I'm not bored, I said!
President Cha Joong Won

79
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,930
Aish, I'm so sick of this, seriously.

80
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,520
- Besides the coupon sale, ways to encourage purchases...
- What, besides the coupon sale, can encourage purchases?

81
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,610
- That's...
- you've nailed them.

82
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,540
You did a good job.

83
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,600
Daebak!

84
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,950
Copy and paste everything here...

85
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:08,190
Did you copy and paste everything from another company's site? All the points are exactly the same!

86
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,010
- I... I personally di—
- is what other companies would want to do.

87
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,660
There are so many distinctive points.

88
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,330
Considering the overhead for maintaining the main page,

89
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,480
Considering the overhead for maintaining the main page, how can you put up this kind of item as the special sale event product?

90
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,960
this is exactly the kind of item we should put up as the special sale event product.

91
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,020
Yes!

92
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,500
Even as it is, it's competitive price wise.

93
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,490
But as it is, it's not competitive price-wise. Get a credit card company on board and ask about discounts...

94
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,760
I don't think you need to negotiate discount rates with credit card companies.

95
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,870
Okay.

96
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,760
As expected, of course.

97
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,790
Peter Drucker said,

98
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,840
"Knowing all about the trends can't guarantee your success 100%. However,

99
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,150
- 'if you don't know the trends, you can guarantee your 100% failure.'
- ...guarantee your 100% failure."

100
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,060
- Manager Lee.
- Manager Lee!

101
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,280
- What grades are your kids in again?
- What grades are your kids in again?

102
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,270
They're in 4th grade, 2nd grade, five-years old, and a one-year-old.

103
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,920
At this rate, can you continue to work here until your youngest enters kindergarten?

104
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,620
At this rate... until your youngest goes to college, the company'd better take care not to lose you.

105
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,290
You're the total trend leader. You're ahead of the times!

106
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,440
- Oh, Manager!
- Aigoo, aigoo.

107
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,410
No, no, it's nothing.

108
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,100
And Ms. Go Bok Sil, the vendors that you've made new contracts with all have good reviews.

109
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,160
Goldline's image has even gotten better, thanks to Singsingline. Thank you.

110
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,020
Thank you.

111
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,030
Everyone... Do you think it's okay for you to work this well?!

112
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,760
Yes!

113
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,120
Yay!

114
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,270
What is this? What's going on? Why are you all playing around? Aren't you going to work?

115
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,260
We're working right now,

116
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,960
in a manner that's ahead of the times.

117
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,090
What are you talking about?

118
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,740
Why do you keep leaving your office to come in here and play around?

119
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,790
Who's coming to play around?

120
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,110
I came here as the president to inspect whether you were doing your work well or not. This is supervision!

121
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,430
Welcome.

122
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:47,370
Go Bok Sil, is our Singsingline running well?

123
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,850
Yes, thanks to you.

124
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,310
Our? What do you mean, our?

125
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,570
- To whom are you referring when you say "our"?
- Way to go!

126
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,660
I'm still Singsingline's investor.

127
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,100
It is correct to say "our".

128
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,710
As soon as those two even see each other...

129
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,290
Are they on good terms or bad terms?

130
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,130
Ah, that's right. President, how many stars did you get from Director Lou back then?

131
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,140
Why won't you tell us?

132
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,260
No, why do you all think that Director Lou gave me stars?

133
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,950
Don't you still have a good grasp of Director Lou?

134
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,840
Everyone look!

135
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,970
Director Lou is this kind of person.

136
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,910
Cha Joong Eon, Thanks!
Wang Louis.

137
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,870
A person who knows how to destroy conventions, creative destruction!

138
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,200
Look and learn from this, everyone!

139
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
As expected. Of course!

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,270
Why do you carry that around in your wallet?

141
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,620
It's mine to do whatever I want with.

142
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,240
Go Bok Sil. Shall we go have a meeting for Singsingline?

143
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,280
Ah, yes.

144
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,570
But why is President Cha

145
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,290
carrying that thing around in his wallet so prettily folded?

146
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,380
Could it possibly be...

147
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,540
Does President Cha like Louis?

148
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,240
Hey, no way.

149
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,390
Even though we cut back on our margin, because of the additional distribution chain,

150
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,640
the fact that we got this much net profit is really awesome.

151
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,910
Go Bok Sil, you did a good job.

152
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,990
It's all because of what you taught me.

153
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,910
- Do you have time tomorrow?
- Is there something happening?

154
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,170
Why don't you have a date with me?

155
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,140
What?

156
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,400
It's beautiful. Both the path

157
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,040
and the weather.

158
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,670
Being outside is mood-lifting and so nice.

159
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,340
I really enjoyed lunch too.

160
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,010
You always pay for the meals. I'll buy next time.

161
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,050
Today, is the last time just you and I will be eating together.

162
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,580
What?

163
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,810
Now it will have to be the three of us, including Louis, when it comes to eating.

164
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,350
Do you think Louis will tolerate the sight of just the two of us eating together?

165
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,020
I barely stopped him from following us today too.

166
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,540
When Louis is like that, he seems like a big dog. He's always following me around.

167
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,060
He doesn't like seeing me with anyone else.

168
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,520
And sometimes he's jealous, even when I'm with Bok Nam.

169
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,830
Because that guy Louis was apart from his family for so long,

170
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,070
he'll need more affection and love than other people.

171
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,690
- Treat him well.
- Okay.

172
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:42,750
It's such a relief that you're Louis's mate.

173
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,720
By the way, where are we going?

174
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,110
Wait here for a second.

175
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,830
Here, Go Bok Sil!

176
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,310
Bok Nam already bought a workbook, though.

177
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,990
It's not Bok Nam's. It's yours, Go Bok Sil.

178
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,660
- Mine?
- I told you this before, but you can make it big.

179
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,130
First get your GED and take the college entrance exam, then go to college.

180
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,310
Because, you're smart and hard-working, you'll get it done in no time.

181
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,310
Director...

182
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,610
I don't know what kind of future you're planning with Louis,

183
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,660
but I hope that you don't miss out

184
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,580
on the chance to study, no matter what circumstances you're in.

185
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:33,000
Director. I think you're a really good person, Director.

186
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,740
A good person?

187
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:41,140
That's right. In the future, I'll keep right on being

188
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,330
a good person to you. Don't change that feeling.

189
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,910
Yes, sir!

190
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,880
- It's $55.
- What?

191
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,120
It's a joke! Hahahaha!

192
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,460
- It's cold out, isn't it?
- Yes.

193
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,260
Oh, seriously. Ow, seriously.

194
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,700
I told you that I get nauseous, just from the smell of food.

195
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,260
But you still need to eat.

196
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,050
Try to eat at least a little bit of it.

197
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,920
I prepared it whole-heartedly for you.

198
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,140
I'm telling you I can't eat right now.

199
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,150
Open it.

200
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,250
What amazing food is it, seriously?!

201
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,380
♬ Love, love, love♬

202
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,100
♬ Love, love, love♬

203
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,720
It looks fake on the table like this, doesn't it?

204
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,790
♬ Love, love, love, love♬

205
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,040
But it's real.

206
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,790
♬ There's nothing you can do, can't be done.♬

207
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,170
Just like my feelings for you are real.

208
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,580
♬ Nothing you can sing, that can't be sung.♬

209
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,370
♬ Nothing you can do, that you can learn after you.♬

210
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,580
Thank you so much.

211
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,780
Jeong Ran, please marry me.

212
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,730
♬ All you need is love♬

213
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,130
♬ All you need is love♬

214
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,220
♬ All you need is♬

215
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,290
I'm sorry my proposal is late.

216
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,250
How did you think of something like this?

217
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,520
Actually, my Sunbae told me about it.

218
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,970
I searched for this manner or that manner, but this was the best.

219
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,010
I also really, really like it!

220
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,500
♬  All you need is love, love♬

221
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,420
♬ Love is all you need♬

222
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,860
- What are you doing right now?
- We're moving in.

223
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,490
We're going to live here from now on, until you get married.

224
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,560
Are you really going to do this?

225
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,740
I also want to see you get married.

226
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,330
I'm not going to get married just because you're barging in here like this!

227
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,530
With your personality, you can't live with us.

228
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,120
Then you'll come up with ways to get married, even if by one day sooner.

229
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,720
What kind of senseless logic is that, Mom?

230
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,440
We'll wait and see.

231
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,220
You're okay with eating ramyun, right?

232
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,330
H-honey, I'll cook it. You go and rest a bit.

233
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,960
You worked hard at packing, so I'll cook it.

234
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,900
Stop!

235
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,120
Plum syrup in ramyun?

236
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,410
I can't take it anymore!

237
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,360
Honey ...

238
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,520
Father... Father...

239
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,540
From today onward, this kitchen is mine.

240
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,760
Don't you ever come near here again.

241
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,940
- W-Why in the world are you doing this to me?
- And

242
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:21,070
in my kitchen, there is no more plum syrup!

243
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,050
Aigoo. Are you okay?

244
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,500
Dad, stop it!

245
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,140
Why are you coming to my house and fighting over the possessory interest in the kitchen?

246
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,000
Alright then. You take this entire kitchen.

247
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,930
Since, I won't be living here!

248
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,220
Mom! Mom!

249
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,790
Did you come here to do this? This will really make me want to get married!

250
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,270
My zeal to get married is springing anew, anew!

251
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,260
She won't have anywhere to go. Where is she going this late at night?

252
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,100
I will not get involved, so you take responsibility for everything. Please!

253
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,230
Ah, h-hey.

254
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,840
Today, Team Leader Baek is paying!

255
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,700
Why would Team Leader Baek buy the alcohol? I'm paying.

256
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,550
Omo, Team Leader won't be able to make it home by herself.

257
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,950
It would be nice if Headquarters Director took her.

258
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,710
Omo, omo! Omo, what in the world? Why did you drink so much?

259
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,330
Then I'll be leaving now.

260
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,770
Mom, what do you think of the headquarters director?

261
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,070
He's pretty good, right? He's cool and manly, isn't he?

262
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,910
President Cha's mom? Omo, omo.

263
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,750
Come in, Vivien!

264
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,010
I'm sorry for coming here so late, Audrey.

265
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,000
Hello, Mother.

266
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,670
Omo, omo. It's been a while.

267
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,430
You must have been resting. I hope I didn't disturb you.

268
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,170
Oh, no. I was just reading some poetry.

269
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,470
I'll go to bed after doing some cross-stitching.

270
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,350
What? You're doing what?

271
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,870
You're so lady-like.

272
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,970
- Then, please rest comfortably.
- Okay.

273
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,790
Since we're together like this,

274
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,840
should we call Cleopatra and have a sleepover party?

275
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,790
Call!

276
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,890
But, Cleopatra, didn't you say that you bought a building in Singapore?

277
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,060
No, a hotel.

278
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,090
Oh yeah, Audrey! Didn't you say that you were buying something in Paris, too?

279
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm planning on building a hotel too.

280
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,930
What good is idle money? I have to grow it.

281
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,870
Omo, Audrey, you trespassed on my land!

282
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,120
Please pay up your taxes before building a hotel.

283
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,490
Oh, why do I keep trespassing on Vivien's land?

284
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,000
Now, here I go.

285
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,320
Aish, really. I landed on a desert island again.

286
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,270
I'm bankrupt. I'm dead. I'm not playing this round. Let's take it back just this once.

287
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,690
Omo, no! Cleopatra!

288
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,420
- Let me take it back just once.
- Nope.

289
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,670
Your turn.

290
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,130
But, Vivien.

291
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,040
How badly did you fight with your husband, that you left the house?

292
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,180
Is it serious?

293
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,540
Yeah. Ugh.

294
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,950
Aigoo, I thought it was something worth fighting about. That's nothing!

295
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,260
It's good that your husband prepares the meals.

296
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,260
But still, the kitchen is the symbol of the female identity.

297
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,410
How can he treat my plum syrup like a virus and ban it from the kitchen? Where on earth have you seen such a man?

298
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,670
Aigoo, still how good must it be to live with a husband, even if such a man?

299
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,740
My husband has already crossed the Jordan River (died) and is no longer a part of this world.

300
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,760
I jabbed my thighs so many times (to calm sexual desire).

301
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,410
My husband is sitting in prison.

302
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,760
What to do, Audrey.

303
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,930
We didn't mean it that way.

304
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,550
There's no such thing as an easy married life.

305
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:05,220
Oh yeah. Tomorrow's the wedding. Should we also make some preparations?

306
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,080
Prepare what?

307
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,350
Taking care of our skin, so we can apply makeup well. Call? (Okay?)

308
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,840
- Call!
- Call!

309
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,870
I'm too nervous.

310
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,670
Me too.

311
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,500
It looks delicious.

312
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,010
Bok Sil.

313
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,380
Since, you're wearing tight clothes tomorrow, eat only a little.

314
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,180
Okay.

315
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,620
I'll just eat one more bite.

316
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,860
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

317
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,500
Eat another bite.

318
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,120
Just one more?

319
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,680
Yeah.

320
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,030
Thank you to the entire Shop-aholics Team

321
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,930
Thank you to our channel manager Bkiss

322
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,000
Thank you to segmenters: Kitty100, mihaelagh, s14950, bkiss, ladyvillegas, bjohnsonwong, gesti_lagi,

323
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,900
Thank you to segmenters, cont: shms, dudie, robertases, pilar_velasquez, cgwm808, Amypun, and mosstar

324
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,390
My grandmother, Madam Choi Il Soon, taught me

325
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,290
that I can understand a person by the things the person buys.

326
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,800
Our Joong Won has to marry soon as well.

327
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,270
My In Seong hasn't turned 30 yet, so I'll marry him off later.

328
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:53,180
He's not thirty yet? Oh my, I thought he was older than my son.

329
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,790
It's because my son drank wrong herbal medicine when he was little. My husband looked so young for his age.

330
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,340
Really?

331
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,130
I wish Ma Ri would just live with me forever without marrying anyone.

332
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,130
She's too precious to send off.

333
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,390
You're so immature! After you die, Ma Ri would be over 60.

334
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,900
You're telling her to live alone when she's old?

335
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,100
To me...

336
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,140
Ahjumma Vivien, who's a health food aficionado, prepared herbal medicine good for the newlyweds

337
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,640
and that cure-all-heal-all plum syrup as her wedding present.

338
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,330
All of this...

339
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:32,600
Ahjumma Cleopatra, who thinks cash is the best of all, prepared an envelope filled with cash.

340
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,470
I wish the two of them would live beautifully together.

341
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:42,160
Ahjumma Audrey, who loves everything of beauty in the world, prepared an elegant tea set as a present.

342
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,290
You came, Ahjusshi?

343
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,650
Thanks for inviting me.

344
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,120
Who called that person?

345
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,410
I did.

346
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,920
It's a festive day. Kiss and make up already.

347
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:16,060
Yeong Ae, I'm sorry. I missed you.

348
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,490
Is the bride all ready?

349
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,040
- Jo In Seong, come here.
- Why?

350
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,840
How would you like to quit being Louis's secretary and come work for the Goldline Product Planning Department?

351
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,560
Really? You're going to bring me in by parachute (using connections/nepotism)?

352
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,800
Try passing the official company pre-employment test next year. You've already used up one parachute becoming Louis's secretary.

353
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,480
Can't you make a spot for me just one more time?

354
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,900
I said no.

355
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:55,620
Mr. Cha Joong Won, a sunglasses maniac with quite a fashion sense, gave edgy couple sunglasses as a present.

356
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,500
The mood maker of every place, Hyung In Seong, gifted them with a mood lamp.

357
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,600
- Aigoo, sorry I'm late.
- You came?

358
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,740
Wow, this house is gigantic. Where shall I put this?

359
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,530
- Oh, this way.
- Okay.

360
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,950
There he goes again, showing off his strength with the gift. Born servant!

361
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:23,030
A strong tree-like man, Detective Nam Joon Hyeok appeared carrying a heavy plant as a present yet again.

362
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,020
All I have is strength, after all.

363
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,780
Do you have a girlfriend, Detective Nam?

364
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,600
- I don't.
- What did you say?

365
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,060
He said he doesn't have one.

366
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,410
Anyway, where is Louis, this rascal?

367
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:42,950
The Goldline family gave a stack of Goldline gift certificates, maybe to show their deep love for their company.

368
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,410
We will start the wedding ceremony now.

369
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,290
Bride and groom, enter!

370
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:53,450
Special thanks to ariel797 for subtitling in both Korean and in English.

371
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,500
Thank you to Korean to English subtitlers: baritaggie, d3lyricool3x, peppy210, reenbeanie, jelly

372
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Thank you to Korean to English subtitlers, cont.: alessia_prata, phillygirl315, sera19_27, wheelykpopeonni and itsjoo

373
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,800
Thank you to editors: cgwm808 (Chief), bkiss, baritaggie and joysprite

374
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,350
♬ I'm taking a walk ♬

375
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:18,660
♬ in a calming silence ♬

376
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:26,340
♬ After the day passes ♬

377
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,270
Ma Ri who has a high-class discerning eye and sense of smell,

378
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:35,390
gifted the finest scent diffusers used in the nation's best hotels.

379
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:42,160
Go Bok Sil, the angel without wings, gave a never expiring Singsingline coupon.

380
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:49,150
And I, Shopping King Louis, who used to be the crown prince of consumption in the past, gifted them

381
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,630
with a sturdy car that Butler Heo and Butler Kim Ho Joon Junior could ride around in.

382
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:56,350
♬ Finding the traces one by one ♬

383
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:03,850
Of course, the thing that is more important than presents is the sincere feelings conveyed from person to person.

384
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,440
Then, for the next order of business,

385
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,940
our bride will throw her bouquet.

386
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,300
Everyone who wants to catch it, move to the front!

387
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,480
Yes, come out. Please throw the bouquet!

388
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:29,130
♬ The time which I can't remember ♬

389
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:37,130
♬ That familiar scent enters and permeates. ♬

390
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:44,330
♬ The Time in my two eyes ♬

391
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:49,650
♬ The melody which stayed in my ear enters ♬

392
00:28:52,820 --> 00:29:01,100
♬ A time for me which was unidentifiable as if it had faded ♬

393
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,180
Ma Ri!

394
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,270
Do you like President Cha?

395
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,470
How did you know?

396
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,120
I saw you staring at him.

397
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,830
Have you confessed to him?

398
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,950
I got rejected! Why?

399
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:39,230
Ma Ri, in the future, if you like someone, start by showing him every side of you.

400
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,870
I'm saying, don't tire yourself out trying to package yourself all glamorously.

401
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:49,370
Baek Ma Ri, a person's sincerity isn't something that can be packaged.

402
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,340
What's inside can be more enchanting.

403
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,020
What is this?

404
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,290
Baek Ma Ri, did you mean to send this to me?

405
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,350
What does it mean?

406
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,990
Wait...

407
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,850
What should I say?

408
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,860
My heart.

409
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,000
I'll send you one every day.

410
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,140
Why are you sending hearts to me?

411
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,920
I feel like it.

412
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,740
- I got it, so hurry up and sleep, Baek Ma Ri.
- It worked!

413
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,040
- Hyung.
- Hm?

414
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,840
Do you like Ma Ri?

415
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,930
Is it really obvious?

416
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,540
Of coursies.

417
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,410
- You like her?
- Of course.

418
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,490
There's something that you need to know, Hyung.

419
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,700
What is it?

420
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,150
- Ma Ri...
- Yeah?

421
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,430
She likes President Cha Joong Won.

422
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,380
What?

423
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,370
It's the truth.

424
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,480
It's your choice to have a one-sided love,

425
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,570
so if you can handle it, keep going. If you don't want to get hurt, then stop.

426
00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:01,410
You... Do you even know how many extraordinary things happened between Ma Ri and I during all that time...

427
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:05,420
And... I acted like I farted instead of her.

428
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,550
There's no way that's true.

429
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:17,790
Well... I'm telling you because I'm worried that you might get hurt.

430
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:22,270
You make the choice, Hyung. Whether you'll keep going or not.

431
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,030
It's up to you.

432
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,670
Ma Ri, what should I do?

433
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,140
♬ Our meeting... (starts singing "Meeting" by No Sa Yeon)

434
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,010
Is there anything to this life that you only live once?

435
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,920
I'm just going to give my all to Miss Ma Ri.

436
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,030
I love you. Ma Ri, I love you.

437
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,320
I love you, Ma Ri!

00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,880
Bok Sil, marry me.

453
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,170
This isn't it.

454
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,430
Bok Sil, live with me.

455
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,360
That's not it.

456
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:43,860
Bok Sil! Eat with me for the rest of our lives!

457
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,400
That's not it.

458
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:53,100
Bok Sil... stay by my side forever.

459
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,150
This isn't it either.

460
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,860
What should I say?

461
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:13,150
Bok Sil. From today on, become my wom... Ah!

462
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,910
Well, whether she's a doctor or a lawyer, I don't need any of them!

463
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,530
I said I'm not going on blind dates!

464
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,390
I'm going to use my free will to date whomever I want!

465
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,820
The connection between people doesn't just happen the way you want, so you'd better give up the thought now, Mom!

466
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,680
Who the heck is this... spy-looking woman?

467
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,890
No way... To me?

468
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,470
What are you doing right now?!

469
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,610
You'll have to spare me some time right now (in thick Chungcheong dialect).

470
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,170
What?

471
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,810
Hey, let me go! Won't you let me go?!

472
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,150
Is this woman insane?

473
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,860
You're a complete psycho!

474
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,350
Buy some farm-raised ginseng.

475
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,660
Is this woman crazy?

476
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,570
Buy a wild ginseng.

477
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,590
Although you might not think it, this here is a 15-year-old real thing.

478
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,190
Here, here, here... Although you might not think it, this here is a 50-year-old real thing.

479
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,920
Actually, I came to the capital city today and I got my bag stolen on the train...

480
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,300
Miss, was your bag also stolen as soon as you came up to Seoul?

481
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,330
What are you talking about?

482
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,450
Then why are you suddenly asking me to buy this?!

483
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,470
Look at it right now.

484
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:18,060
You can tell if it's real or not when you look at the head.

485
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,510
Look here. If you look at the head, the answer is staring at you.

486
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,660
Whether it is a wild ginseng or farmed one.

487
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,880
Without further ado, this is a 100% real wild ginseng that I dug up myself.

488
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,270
You'll regret it if you don't buy this!

489
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:32,300
No need to even look at it. It's the best quality woods-grown ginseng.

490
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,890
I know.

491
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,920
How do you know?

492
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,750
Without meaning to, I've been through quite an experience with wild ginseng for a long time, so I know it well.

493
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:44,070
So, just tell me the reason why you're asking me to buy this.

494
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,770
This is one-of-a-kind wild ginseng!

495
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,640
Even if you comb through this country, no, the whole world, you would not find another one that looks like it.

496
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,050
Why?

497
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:56,650
Is this ginseng also the only ginseng of its kind in the whole world?

498
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,770
I don't understand what in the dog poo you're talking about.

499
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,790
Then what is it?

500
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:07,180
Actually, my parents suddenly got sick,

501
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,770
so I'm in urgent need of money.

502
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,900
How much are you going to sell it for?

503
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,720
I'm not going to sell it to you.

504
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,490
What?

505
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,900
I want to enter into a contract with Singsingline.

506
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,030
Look at her!

507
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:32,570
Ah. So you're saying instead of selling just this one box, you're going to open up a whole new account?

508
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,860
Besides these, I also have ginseng fields.

509
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,930
Our town Geumsan is known for its good ginseng.

510
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:42,510
Woo hoo, now even field-grown ginseng?

511
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:47,270
I have to take care of my mother and father so I don't have time to negotiate.

512
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:52,610
They say going slow will make you go faster. I'm taking this chance to secure a good deal.

513
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,090
Since you know how to tell the quality of the product, I won't speak of it anymore.

514
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,620
She's a natural born businesswoman.

515
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,720
But why is it our company of all places?

516
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,970
This place is the best! Isn't it?

517
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,300
♬  She will be the face I can't forget ♬

518
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,990
♬  The trace of pleasure or regret ♬

519
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:27,030
♬  Maybe my treasure or the price I have to pay ♬

520
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:32,140
♬  She may be the song the summer sings ♬

521
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,960
I'm late in introducing myself, aren't I. My name is Wang Mong Sil. Wang Mong Sil.

522
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,350
Go Bok Sil, farewell. Goodbye.

523
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,350
Please take good care of me in the future.

524
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:50,700
♬  She may be the beauty or the beast ♬

525
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,660
♬  Maybe the fan that autumn ♬

526
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,700
- Bok Sil! I'm here.
- You're here?

527
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,640
Hyung!

528
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,170
Brother-in-law's here, too.

529
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:18,040
I'm going to rest at home today. There are too many people outside on the weekends.

530
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,960
Oh, I see.

531
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,880
I made some ramyun. Let's eat it together. Bok Nam said he wanted to eat some.

532
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,100
I did good, didn't I?

533
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,890
Yeah. Aigoo. I wanted to eat out with Bok Sil.

534
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,540
Louis, Bok Nam! Set the table up!

535
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,780
Okay.

536
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,260
Move.

537
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,190
Mm, it's delicious.

538
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,590
What can it be?

539
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,980
Oh my.

540
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,010
Where did this come from?

541
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,350
It's delicious.

542
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,320
Yes, Ahjumma Audrey. How is it going?

543
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,330
Louis, I have a present to give you.

544
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,690
What kind of present?

545
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,250
♬ Before I knew it,  ♬

546
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:01,380
♬ No matter what you say ♬

547
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:07,640
♬ I'm fine with it  ♬

548
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,710
How could this...

549
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,110
How could this happen?
♬ The time we spend together today ♬

550
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:24,770
♬ feels a little too long. ♬

551
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:28,540
♬ I hope you won't feel the same way. ♬

552
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,960
Bok Sil.

553
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,550
You can't sleep again?

554
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,760
My heart is pounding because I'm excited.

555
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,810
Why?

556
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,220
Because I'm thinking about watching a movie.

557
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,720
What movie?

558
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,880
I still haven't watched a movie with you.

559
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:56,330
♬ This time like the last meeting ♬

560
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:00,060
It's way too scary! That's the first movie I've ever seen in my life.

561
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,930
Hey, what is this?

562
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:05,180
It was a free ticket.

563
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,940
Next time, let's see a movie that's not scary.

564
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,100
Yeah, not a scary one.

565
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,200
I decline any scary movies.

566
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,520
♬ And I'm so fine  ♬

567
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,220
It's a touching one.

568
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:25,100
♬ Fading memories So Fine ♬

569
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:31,370
♬ Even an unfamiliar expression So Fine ♬

570
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:37,740
♬ Without any regrets So Fine ♬

571
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:43,320
♬ Like this we are Fine ♬

572
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,570
There's no one here. No one here but us.

573
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,360
Yeah. I rented the whole place.

574
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,160
What?

575
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,560
Because I wanted to watch it just with you.

576
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,940
What movie is it that you'd do that?

577
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,550
Oh, it's starting.

578
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:33,120
From now, we will start the celebration ceremony marking Gold Department Store's 30th founding anniversary!

579
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,200
We have presented free gifts in honor of the 30th anniversary of Gold Department Store.

580
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,770
Next is the highlight of this ceremony.

581
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,510
We will start the raffle drawing to present

582
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:50,680
the limited edition 30th anniversary music boxes.

583
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,450
It's pretty, right? In a way that matches with the 30th anniversary,

584
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:01,720
We only made 30 of this—

585
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,280
What is this?

586
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,150
- Is this really a movie?
- Yeah.

587
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,730
Watch.

588
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:22,810
There are only two music boxes left!

589
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:26,610
The owner of the 29th music box is...

590
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,960
Number 81!

591
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,080
Yes. Here.

592
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,400
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

593
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,840
The owner of the last and 30th music box is...

594
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:50,960
The number of the last lucky draw winner is Number 77!

595
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:58,930
Here! Here! Right here!

596
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,770
That dress...

597
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,960
Those clothes...

598
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,560
It's your mom.

599
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,840
And your dad beside her.

600
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,710
Mom.

601
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,840
Dad.

602
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,060
Here you go.

603
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,380
There, baby.

604
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:52,640
- Don't lose it, and take care of it for a long, long time!
- Yes.

605
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:56,440
- Wow.
- That's right.

606
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,900
Ah, yes. Congratulations. Congratulations.

607
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,290
You also have a baby in your stomach.

608
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,930
Have you picked a name?

609
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:12,260
Bok Nam. Go Bok Nam.

610
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:17,420
Bok Nam, you receive a lot of blessings, too.

611
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,700
Now, I'll be taking a picture.

612
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,230
Mom and Dad.

613
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,690
They're smiling.

614
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,800
They're looking at me and smiling.

615
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,950
Bok Sil, you look a lot like your mom.

616
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:31,190
Bok Sil. You have to look what happens after this too.

617
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,730
It's really important.

618
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,790
Ma Ri! Aigoo!

619
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,560
Ji Sung, what's the matter? Is something wrong?

620
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,700
It's mine! It's mine!

621
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,860
What's yours? Did you lose something?

622
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,600
Mom... I want a music box, too..

623
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,720
Give me a music box!

624
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,860
They only give that to people who won at the raffle.

625
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:19,900
Me too, me too! I want a music box!

626
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,750
The music box is mine!

627
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,850
Why are you acting like this, too?

628
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:33,610
Stop! If you don't, Mom will scold you! Ma Ri!

629
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,940
Ah, seriously. Please watch Ji Sung.

630
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,800
Ji Sung, I'll be right back. Stop crying, Ma Ri!

631
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,130
I want a music box too!

632
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,290
Oppa, dawn't cwry (baby talk).

633
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,910
Are you giving this to me?

634
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,130
What's your name?

635
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,050
Go Bo Si (baby talk).

636
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,230
Go Bo Ssi?

637
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:19,510
Aigoo, our daughter is so kind.

638
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,340
Shall we go?

639
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:29,850
Go Bo Ssi!

640
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:40,470
♬  When you wish upon a star ♬

641
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:45,360
♬  Makes no difference who you are ♬

642
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:54,980
♬  Anything your heart desires will come to you ♬

643
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:00,550
♬  If your heart is in your dream ♬

644
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:05,010
♬  No request is too extreme ♬

645
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:12,130
♬  When you wish upon a star ♬

646
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,900
You're surprised, aren't you?

647
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,730
♬  Fate is kind ♬

648
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:25,720
♬  She brings to those who love ♬

649
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:31,580
♬  Their sweet fulfillment of their secret love ♬

650
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,800
Go Bo Ssi

651
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:40,600
Don't cry, Go Bo Ssi.

652
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,320
♬ Lost The Way ♬

653
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:30,400
♬ I lost the way Far Away Far Away ♬

654
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,150
♬ I'm searching for myself again All Day ♬

655
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,280
♬ In the smoky sunlight ♬

656
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,030
♬ I ask again ♬

657
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:50,280
♬ Which way should I go ♬

658
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:58,200
My Go Bo Ssi that I had preciously kept in my treasure chest is in front of me right now.

659
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:01,690
♬ But I Can Fly  ♬

660
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:06,220
♬ Past countless stars, fly away ♬

661
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:10,990
I believe that it was Louis's great heart that didn't forget me

662
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:14,540
but treasured me inside it, that, in the end, reunited us after journeys

663
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,960
through long periods of time

664
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,930
and a vast expanse of space.

665
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:25,040
♬ Lost The Way ♬

666
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,010
♬ Oh Lost My Way  ♬

667
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,680
♬ Find The Way ♬

668
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,370
It's cold. Let's go in.
♬ I want to know. Let Me Know ♬

669
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,510
Okay.

670
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:47,730
♬ These tears like paint spreading ♬

671
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:53,430
♬ Is there an end, perhaps ♬

672
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,930
Ah, it feels like I've come back to my hometown.

673
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:06,610
Welcome!

674
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:13,740
Bok Sil.

675
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,180
Hm?

676
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,730
There's something I'm curious about.

677
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,960
What is it?

678
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:35,210
You were the only one who believed me when no one else did.

679
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:41,580
Bok Sil, was I that trustworthy to you?

680
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:52,830
As I was growing up, there was no one who told me to only trust in them.

681
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:59,860
I was the breadwinner for Bok Nam and Grandma and had to take care of them.

682
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:06,060
You were the first person to ever say those words to me.

683
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:11,530
Those words comforted me.

684
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,310
They were reassuring.

685
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:31,960
Bok Sil.

686
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:40,300
I... will say

687
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,950
those words to you, for you,

688
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,190
forever.

689
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,430
Just trust me.

690
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:07,990
♬ My step that was hesitant ♬

691
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,860
Thank you.

692
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:15,400
♬ I call you again ♬

693
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:21,430
♬ Hey You Hey You Hey You ♬

694
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,050
Bok Sil.

695
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,190
I love you.

696
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,780
I love you too.

697
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:48,260
♬ Hello Hello Hello ♬

698
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,570
♬ Where you, the star is shining ♬

699
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,980
♬ That place is my universe ♬

700
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:01,900
♬ Even if that star loses its shine someday ♬

701
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,170
♬ I'll look for you who's losing the shine ♬

702
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:10,370
♬ And I will shine my light on you ♬

703
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:16,060
♬ With Shiny Light of Mine  ♬

704
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:23,960
♬ Rising one by one ♬

705
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:29,930
♬ Your star, shining so bright ♬

706
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:37,670
♬ I call you again ♬

707
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:44,200
♬ Hey You Hey You Hey You ♬

708
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:48,980
We give our sincere thanks to the viewers who were together with Louis ♥ Bok Sil and us.
