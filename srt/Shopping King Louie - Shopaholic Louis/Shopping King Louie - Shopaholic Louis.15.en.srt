1
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,270
Come have a seat here.

2
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,450
You, are my butler from today on.

3
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,700
How can I serve the chairwoman of Gold Group? No thanks.

4
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,770
Do you have somewhere to go to?

5
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,460
♬  I'm completely fine ♬

6
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,340
Jeong Ran.

7
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,740
I have a good eye for products, but I also have a good eye for people.

8
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,690
No matter how you've lived up until now,

9
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,590
whether you've had a good education or not, it doesn't matter.

10
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,860
Your attitude of even risking your own life to help a complete stranger...

11
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,980
Just with that one aspect of you, you're a very worthy person.

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:30,300
♬ I think I feel a little bit sorry ♬

13
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,890
- Jeong Ran.
- Yes?

14
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,890
I'm very thankful to you

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:44,240
for having taken care of me with all your heart and soul. I could always rely on you.

16
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,930
Why are you saying such embarrassing things so early in the morning?

17
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,290
You have to say what's in your heart freely while you have the chance, instead of holding back.

18
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,750
If you don't do it then, you may never be able to.

19
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,890
Why are you speaking like someone who's about to leave on a trip?

20
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,290
I'll get your breakfast ready.

21
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,580
Okay.
♬ And I’m So Fine ♬

26
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,100
Grandma and her way of life.
Episode15: My Way - My Splendid Life

27
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,770
Bok Sil!

28
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,640
Bok Sil!

29
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,560
Bok Sil!

30
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,750
Bok Sil...

31
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,540
The power is off, so you'll be redirected to the voicemail—

32
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,680
Bok Sil!

33
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,290
Wait, where did that guy go?

34
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,730
Did he go inside and is sleeping indoors all by himself?

35
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,040
This little rascal! Aish...

36
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Hey! Where did you go?

37
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,090
- Have you seen Bok Sil?
- No.

38
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,120
This is strange.

39
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,640
I was supposed to meet up with her, but she did not come and I can't get in touch with her.

40
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,900
Just the ring was lying on the ground.

41
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,300
First of all, calm down. Let's go to her room first.

42
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,850
She might have gone back to her room.

43
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,110
Okay.

44
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,580
So noisy.

45
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,100
No manners.

46
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,570
What are you doing so late at night?

47
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,550
- What about Bok Sil?
- Huh?

48
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,840
Wait.

49
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,670
Did she tell you anything?

50
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,590
She left to go meet Louis.

51
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,050
You weren't together?

52
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,120
Team Leader Baek, wake everyone up and let them know what's going on.

53
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,560
We'll go look outside for her first.

54
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,520
What's going on?

55
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,770
Go Bok Sil has gone missing.

56
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,820
Omo! What to do?

57
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,730
Ji Sung! Bok Sil!

58
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,180
Bok Sil. Bok Sil!

59
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,880
Bok Sil! Bok Sil!

60
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,340
- She's not there?
- No.

61
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,120
Her cellphone is off and the ring was on the ground.

62
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,230
I don't think it's just a simple case of disappearance.

63
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,780
Then?

64
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,780
I have to check first.

65
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,870
I'll go to the surveillance room first. Please keep searching.

66
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,470
Let's go together.

67
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,640
Keep looking for her. If you find anything, get in touch with us right away.

68
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,680
You give us a call if you find anything too.

69
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,700
Alright, I understand.

70
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,610
- Let me go with you!
- Let's hurry up and go.

71
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,400
- Ma Ri, let me go too, then.
- In Seong.

72
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
- Yes?
- You come search this way with me.

73
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,030
Okay. But I... I...

74
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,040
I have your daughter.

75
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,870
What?

76
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,540
Tomorrow at noon, bring the money to the Clock Tower at Gold Plaza.

77
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,080
I'll let you know where your daughter is once I get the money.

78
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,540
If you let the police know,

79
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,900
I can't guarantee what'll happen to your daughter either.

80
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,230
Hello? Hello?!

81
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,800
Oh, Dad!

82
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,260
M-M-Ma Ri! Are you okay? Where are you right now?

83
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,700
Where would I be? I told you I was going on a company outing.

84
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,810
Oh, you did. You're really okay, right?

85
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,720
Oh, hang up if you've got nothing else to say.

86
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,790
Go Bok Sil suddenly disappeared, so I'm quite distracted!

87
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,270
Is this it?

88
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,380
What's this now about Go Bok Sil suddenly going missing...

89
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,520
Did this bastard possibly take Go Bok Sil instead of Ma Ri?

90
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,990
How can this bastard not do even one thing right?

91
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,470
I mean... What is he trying to do by messing with Bok Sil?

92
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,930
I'm going to go crazy, seriously!

93
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,060
No.

94
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,000
He said that he'd let me know where she is if I just give him the money,

95
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,430
so all I have to do is give him the money and save Go Bok Sil.

96
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,310
That's right.

97
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,760
Stop! Zoom in there.

98
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,330
- Here?
- Yes.

99
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,660
It's not definite yet. You can't see her face that well either.

100
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,880
- You can't make it any clearer?
- No, this is the clearest.

101
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,670
Wait, that is Go Bok Sil!

102
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,510
I let her borrow that coat. I'm sure!

103
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,370
Bok Sil!

104
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,430
I feel like I've seen him a lot somewhere before. Does anyone know who that man is, by any chance?

105
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,170
I can't really tell because of the mask.

106
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,840
I don't know either.

107
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,120
Why is he kidnapping Bok Sil? There's no one who hates her, and she doesn't have any money either.

108
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,260
You have a lot of money, though.

109
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,210
Goldline heir, Kang Ji Sung.

110
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,830
You're saying Bok Sil got kidnapped because of me?

111
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,770
Because of me?!

112
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,610
Because of me...

113
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,180
Get a hold of yourself, Kang Ji Sung! You have to keep grounded at times like this!

114
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,280
You're the only guardian the kidnapped Go Bok Sil's got! You understand?

115
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,680
Yes. I'll find her, no matter what. So what do I need to do, then?

116
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,600
If he's really after your money, then he'll get in touch with you soon.

117
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,370
Keep checking your phone. Let's stop the search and go to Seoul for right now.

118
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,990
I should go to the station and pull up the car records first.

119
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,700
Bok Sil...

120
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,280
This woman is...

121
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,740
This woman is involved with Louis,

122
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,780
so find out about her and keep an eye on her.

123
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,870
This is Go Bok Sil!

124
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,400
I bought it from a boutique that I go to often. Do you think it'll look good on Ma Ri?

125
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,580
What in the world happened?

126
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,090
I definitely double-checked her clothes.

127
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,730
Are you insane? What are you doing right now?

128
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,490
There was a slight misunderstanding.

129
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,260
I told you that I would give you money in the first place. Why do you keep making bigger problems?!

130
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,150
You first acted in such a way that I couldn't trust you.

131
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,040
What in the world are you talking about?

132
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,050
Anyway, I just have to give you the money.

133
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,670
I'll give you the money right now, so let Go Bok Sil go.

134
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,620
Come to the place we met before with the money.

135
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,810
Sorry, for keeping you waiting.

136
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,880
I checked on the car 1511 and it's a stolen vehicle.

137
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,340
So, as of now, I won't be able to point out a suspect.

138
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,550
What about security camera footage?

139
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,180
Nothing from there yet, either.

140
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,930
We're looking through all the footage around the retreat center and toll gates, so we'll get a call in no time.

141
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,210
We put the stolen vehicle in the wanted list, so let's just wait a little longer.

142
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,410
Have you got a call from the kidnapper yet?

143
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,970
No.

144
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,080
If he asks for money, I'll give it to him,

145
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,590
but he's not contacting me. It's driving me crazy.

146
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,180
Cheer up. You'll get a call soon.

147
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,070
What's taking him so long?

148
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,000
The police people can trust and rely on.

149
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,100
I can't wait anymore. I'm going to go look for her.

150
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,080
Where the heck are you trying to go to?

151
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,140
I don't know. I have to look for her anywhere.

152
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,790
I'm worried sick for Bok Sil.

153
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,850
If you act like this, you'll be worn out first. Brace yourself.

154
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,300
I wish I just get the call.

155
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,320
Go Bok Sil

156
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,370
Bok Sil!

157
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,330
Bok Sil?

158
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,550
Do you know the owner of this cell phone?

159
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,990
Are you not Bok Sil? Who are you?

160
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,380
This is a hospital.

161
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,350
The owner of this cell phone was in a traffic accident and brought in here.

162
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,100
What?

163
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,300
Where is this? What hospital is it?

164
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,290
That bastard. Why isn't he coming?

165
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,070
He gets the money I gave him stolen,

166
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,260
he kidnaps someone else and screws up the matter even more.

167
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:10,150
Why isn't he coming when I brought the money again?

168
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,030
Seriously!

169
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,160
Bok Sil!

170
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,190
It's not Bok Sil.

171
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,230
What's going on here?

172
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,750
T-This guy..

173
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,630
Why is this guy...?

174
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,430
It's Secretary Goo!

175
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,390
You know him?

176
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,320
Yes. He's a brother of Ahjussi Seon Gu's hometown friend.

177
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,320
I saw him at Ahjumma Audrey's book store the other day.

178
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,460
What?

179
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,600
He's the guy who got hit by a hammer and collapsed at your rooftop place.

180
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,360
What?

181
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,330
Has the patient injured his head before?

182
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,120
Yes. He lay unconscious for a long while,

183
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,600
and he left the hospital without getting treated.

184
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,310
There is a chance that he might never wake up again.

185
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,270
Then what about Bok Sil?

186
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,860
He knows where Bok Sil is. What about Bok Sil!

187
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,610
Calm down. There must be a way.

188
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:19,330
Bok Sil... Are you talking about the lady who came together?

189
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,330
Where is she right now?

190
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,460
Hey! Detective Nam seems to have found that Eunseong-dong case victim who had run away from the hospital.

191
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,280
From where?

192
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,450
He was brought to a different hospital after an accident. Go join him.

193
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,980
Yes, sir.

194
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,190
Detective Lee? To what do I owe this call?

195
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,350
That victim is at a hospital.

196
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,710
W-What did you just say?

197
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,010
He got into a traffic accident and hurt his head,

198
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,530
so he's unconscious again.

199
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,820
We, the police, will take care of him from now on, so don't concern yourself with him any longer.

200
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,710
W-Why? Did he do something?

201
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:08,870
He tried to kidnap someone tonight, so a full-scale investigation is on.

202
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,610
Bok Sil!

203
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,360
Louis!

204
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,660
Bok Sil, are you hurt?

205
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,870
Where? How much?

206
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,390
I'm okay. I just pulled a ligament.

207
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,680
Louis...

208
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,900
Bok Sil... You must have been shocked.

209
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,890
I said I'd protect you. I'm sorry for not keeping my promise.

210
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm okay though.

211
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,640
I'm so sorry, Bok Sil.

212
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,750
Aren't you hungry? You had a tough night.

213
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,060
A little.

214
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,280
Then wait a little. I'll go get some stuff.

215
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,390
That male human detective is really the best civil servant.

216
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,890
But why did he kidnap me?

217
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,950
We thought it was for the money at the beginning, but now we don't think so.

218
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,650
That culprit is the one who got hit with the hammer at our rooftop.

219
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,380
What?

220
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,640
Are you sure that guy is an acquaintance of President Baek?

221
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,800
Yes. He surely said he was a younger brother of his hometown friend.

222
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,550
It's really strange, right? Why did Ahjussi Seon Gu's acquaintance come into our house?

223
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,620
Honey.

224
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,100
Where were you all night long?

225
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,340
You look terrible.

226
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,060
Jae Sook...

227
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,320
Are... you not feeling well?

228
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:13,880
Could you take the box on my desk to Mother's house in Busan?

229
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,640
There is a secret space under the floorboards in Louis' attic.

230
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,180
You can just put it in there.

231
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,710
Why do I have to put it there?

232
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:31,430
Please, don't ask any questions and do me a favor.

233
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,680
Get going now.

234
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,310
O-Okay.

235
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,410
Attorney Hwang, it's me.

236
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,910
Can we meet right now?

237
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,580
Is it good?

238
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,230
Yeah.

239
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,460
Here, eat some more.

240
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,110
Just a sec.

241
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,720
What are you trying to do?

242
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,730
I'm making a ponytail.

243
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,720
Make it pretty.

244
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,670
Of course.

245
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,030
Wow!

246
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,630
Whoever did it, it's really pretty.

247
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,330
Really?

248
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,490
Then... let's eat.

249
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,220
Okay.

250
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,790
I spilled.

251
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,250
I just have to wipe it for you.

252
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,040
Wipe my mouth, too, please.

253
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:24,380
♬ Lost The Way, I lost the way Far Away ♬

254
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,760
Get me water.

255
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,710
♬ I'm searching for myself again All Day ♬

256
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,420
Drink it.

257
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,180
♬ In the smoky sunlight ♬

258
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,240
♬ I ask again ♬

259
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,350
I thought I lost it, but it's made its way to the owner well.

260
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,820
Just one look and I knew. Is this your present?

261
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,340
Yes.

262
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,840
And there's one more.

263
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,990
There's another present?

264
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,180
Come closer to me.

265
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,620
Huh?

266
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:07,210
♬ Fly Away, The space where memories fell asleep, Your Space ♬

267
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,510
♬ Will I be able to wake up someday ♬

268
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,150
I really like you a lot.

269
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,900
A confession is your gift?

270
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,860
What do I do?

271
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,000
Hey, no! What are we going to do if people walk in?

272
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,600
♬ Find The Way, I want to know. Let Me Know ♬

273
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,420
All set.

274
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:42,750
♬ These tears like paint spreading ♬

275
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,180
♬ Is there an end Perhaps ♬

276
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,050
Miss Go Bok Sil.

277
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,960
Hey! Don't! No, go away! Don't touch!

278
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,710
- It's not that.
- Don't! No!

279
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,520
No! Go away! Don't touch!

280
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,530
What are you d—

281
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:12,310
Miss Go Bok Sil, you can go home today.

282
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,530
Okay.

283
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,780
I will clean everything up before we leave.

284
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,750
Yes, please do.

285
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,860
We're sorry.

286
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,640
Here.

287
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,330
I'll get it.

288
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,310
You got one here.

289
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,630
It's not all clean here yet.

290
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,340
No, no. Let me.

291
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,840
- Why?
- I'll get it.

292
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,600
- Why?
- I'll get it.

293
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,330
- Why? Your wrist hurts.
- No, I'll get it.

294
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,980
- It'll hurt.
- It's okay.

295
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,870
Sister-in-law!

296
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,230
- They're here!
- In Seong, put down the blankets.

297
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,600
Yes, yes.

298
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,090
Move, move.

299
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,980
Oh, Bok Sil! Are you alright?

300
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,010
Yes.

301
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,080
- What do I do?
- Here, lie down.

302
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,540
Our Bok Sil, you must've been really shocked.
Maid 1, Maid 2, Maid 3, Maid 4

303
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,330
You got hurt a lot.

304
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,020
I'm okay.

305
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,520
It was tough, right?

306
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,610
I'm okay. You're treating me like a patient.

307
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,450
You need to take a rest. Sleep.

308
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,380
Why did he take our innocent Bok Sil and make her go through all that?

309
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,260
That damn bastard. Wait until I catch him, I'll break his legs into three pieces!

310
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,630
So, did they catch the culprit?

311
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,390
He's hurt and still unconscious.

312
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:44,800
There's a high chance that guy at the hospital is an illegal immigrant and a hit man.

313
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,630
We've been keeping an eye on him for that reason.

314
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,330
What?

315
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,770
How can a person like that be a brother of President Baek's hometown friend? Isn't it weird?

316
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:57,590
It's just my speculation, but I think he could be a person President Baek hired.

317
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,980
If President Baek hired a hit man...?

318
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,540
Aish...

319
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,830
That guy is such a weirdo.

320
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,530
Wait, wait!

321
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,950
Hello.

322
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,980
Yes... Where did the guy who was in front of you go?

323
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,450
He just left.

324
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,380
Do you know him well?

325
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,280
No. What's the matter?

326
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,690
Yeah... It's nothing.

327
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,490
President Baek might have known much earlier

328
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,340
that dead Louis was actually alive.

329
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,000
But why was he hiding it?

330
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,050
Louis

331
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,060
I just wanted a minor fender bender, not such a huge accident!

332
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,920
What are you going to do? How will you take the responsibility?! A person died!

333
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,900
You think we did it on purpose? We just followed our plan,

334
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,380
but he suddenly started speeding making the accident big.

335
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,920
If only the matter hadn't gotten out of hand back then,

336
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,710
I wouldn't have attempted a plan to cover up that crime.

337
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:35,490
What does it matter now?

338
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,580
Detective Nam, Secretary Goo's still unconscious?

339
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,820
You have to ask him right away when he wakes up, why he kidnapped Bok Sil, okay?

340
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,590
I will take care of things here, you should try to get some sleep.

341
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,380
You've exhausted so much energy since yesterday.

342
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,740
You did too, Detective. Alright.

343
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,330
Thank you for your trouble. Bye.

344
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,350
It's warm milk.

345
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,910
Drink it and take a nap.

346
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,520
Butler Kim.

347
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,400
Yes, Young Master.

348
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,860
May I drive?

349
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,360
Why all of a sudden?

350
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,670
I want to drive Bok Sil myself.

351
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:38,070
You always whined to drive, even back in France.

352
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,210
You're right.

353
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,950
But you screwed up by taking President Baek's car without permission and driving away on the day of your return to Korea.

354
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,730
I'm not sure if Chairwoman would let you.

355
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,520
What? What do you mean driving without permission?

356
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,720
I heard that you took off in the car while President Baek went to the restroom.

357
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,510
You go ahead. Something urgent came up, so I have to stop by the company first.

358
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,710
- You can drive, right?
- Okay.

359
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:14,160
I didn't do that.

360
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,070
Excuse me?

361
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,010
To be honest, I was very suspicious about President Baek in many respects.

362
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,860
Like that time he had your baby tooth and watch taken from the Busan house,

363
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,160
and the time I ran into him, while I was asking around about you.

364
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,140
But he ended up bringing you back,

365
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,050
so I had to believe him.

366
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,100
Hello.
He did seem pretty shocked to see me that time.

367
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,430
I got all my memories back.

368
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,510
It was the same when he heard I got my memory back.

369
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,660
What?

370
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,750
The reason I shouldn't return alive...

371
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,260
The reason I shouldn't get my memory back...

372
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,450
What could it be?

373
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,510
Who is here at this hour?

374
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,150
I'm sorry for stopping by so late.

375
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:54,590
No problem. I was planning on going to see you tomorrow anyway.

376
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:01,020
Does that mean you know why I'm here?

377
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,880
Ji Sung... I'm sorry.

378
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,100
I did a terrible thing to you for which I deserve to die.

379
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,870
Ahjussi...

380
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,430
I didn't plan

381
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,540
such a huge accident from the beginning.

382
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,610
I mean to leave Gold Group to Louis.

383
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,350
Without consulting me at all, the Chairwoman

384
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:40,750
all of a sudden said that she'd give Gold Group to you.

385
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,410
At that moment, I got so mad. Gold Group

386
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,310
was a company that I spent my youth to build up.

387
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,370
After your father died, I served the Chairwoman like my own mother.

388
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:59,250
It was so easy for her to push me aside and decide

389
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,040
to give you everything, when you were in a faraway foreign land.

390
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,440
That decision really aggrieved me.

391
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:15,670
If I get you hurt a little bit with a traffic accident,

392
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:21,270
I thought the chairwoman would get scared and send you back to France.

393
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:26,260
But things got bigger.

394
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:32,890
The accident spun out of control. It's the truth, Ji Sung.

395
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,400
Since the day you, who were thought to be dead, came back,

396
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,810
I didn't have a single day of peace of mind.

397
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:45,140
I was always worried that my crime would be revealed,

398
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,110
and I lived like a fugitive.

399
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,550
Ahjussi...

400
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:24,030
I'm thankful to you for staying by Grandma's side up to now,

401
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,370
in place of my late parents and me.

402
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,430
Louis...

403
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,210
I think that I'll be able to forgive you just because of that.

404
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:43,970
But still, someone died because of the accident.

405
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,500
I'm going to accept the punishment for my sins.

406
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,210
I was already getting things ready to turn myself in.

407
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,640
I already told Lawyer Hwang to transfer all the company shares

408
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,120
that I got from the chairwoman to you, too.

409
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,380
Ahjusshi...

410
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,680
When it comes to people,

411
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,910
when they start getting greedy,

412
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,260
their conscience also begins to dwindle without an end.

413
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,320
There's one thing that's still weighing on my mind.

414
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,410
The chairwoman might collapse if she finds out about this.

415
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,770
That worries me.

416
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,110
Don't worry about that.

417
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,880
I'll make sure Grandmother never knows.

418
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,490
I don't want to make her sad.

419
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,690
Thank you, Louis.

420
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,850
Detective 1-3 Team

421
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:18,590
Please take good care of Ma Ri and her mother while I'm not there.

422
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:21,880
Okay. Don't worry.

423
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,910
I came to turn myself in.

424
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:25,570
I'm thankful to you for putting down everything and admitting your crimes,

425
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:31,570
but there's a part of your statement that doesn't coincide with Mr. Goo Jeong Hoon's, so I'll have to interrogate you together.

426
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,530
What?

427
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:38,380
President Baek ordered me to do everything, from the car accident to kidnapping Go Bok Sil.

428
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,860
What are you talking about? This man threatened me for money.

429
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,660
Me?

430
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,750
I've never asked him for money.

431
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,150
That's not true. He's framing me.

432
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,220
This man was trying to kidnap my daughter, and ended up kidnapping Go Bok Sil accidentally.

433
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,480
I'm just an employee at a private investigator's office.

434
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,600
I just did what he ordered me to do.

435
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,230
That's not true.

436
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,260
I didn't do that!

437
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:12,920
I know it won't be easy to believe what I say in this kind of situation,

438
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,460
but I really didn't do it, Louis.

439
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,810
I heard a rundown of everything from Detective Nam.

440
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,130
Do you have anything you can use as proof?

441
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,110
I definitely brought the bag of money and went to the bookstore,

442
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,980
but it was after Secretary Goo had disappeared.

443
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,120
They said there are no CCTV's around the bookstore area.

444
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,090
There's no way to prove it.

445
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,120
The bookstore, you said?

446
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,240
Director Cha. I've got something for you to do.

447
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,640
Are you sure that's the car?

448
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,480
Ah, you surprised me. Don't whisper in my ear.

449
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:02,430
Yes. He's been there for a few days now.

450
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,520
In that spot, just like that.

451
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,380
Then shall we head over first?

452
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,470
He's excited, so excited. Jeez!

453
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,960
This is the police. I have a few things to ask you.

454
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,180
I caught him!

455
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,140
Stay still. Stop moving!

456
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,120
Wow, where did all these pictures come from?

457
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,000
There was a stalker following Mrs. Audrey.

458
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,630
- A stalker?
- Yes.

459
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,900
He set up camp in front of the store and took pictures. We confiscated all of it.

460
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,210
Detective, you have to take care of this one. Okay?

461
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,320
Of course.

462
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,540
If you look at this picture, you can see the both of them talking.

463
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,420
And look here. You can see that Ahjussi Seon Gu brought the bag of money the very next day.

464
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,490
Now, his story is proven, right?

465
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:21,160
Wow. You could become a detective.

466
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,900
Your eye for things is awesome.

467
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,790
But! Why did you go to the bookstore, Detective Nam?

468
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,560
The atmosphere looks so warm and cozy.

469
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,580
It's hard for a woman to run a bookstore by herself.

470
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,220
Also, she was a big help in finding Louis.

471
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,760
Since I was so thankful to her, I'd carry heavy books for her and help her out from time to time.

472
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,840
Anyway, you're so nosy. You're in the final stages of your Servant's Disease. Terminal!

473
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,010
Why did you go so far as kidnapping Go Bok Sil, no, I mean, Baek Ma Ri?

474
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,250
What did you do with the bag of money you got before?

475
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:57,710
My bag of money got snatched, so I had no other option.

476
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,950
That grandmother seriously had unreal skills, like a ghost!

477
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,640
A professional pickpocketing grandmother?

478
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,470
Detective Nam, what are you doing?

479
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,700
Oh. Did you get the CCTV footage?

480
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,240
I got her identity as well.

481
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,950
Her name is Jo Ha Ni. She has nine prior larceny convictions.

482
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,540
She's someone I've caught before.

483
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,600
Do you know her residence as well?

484
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,920
This is my field of specialty. I've already sent the guys.

485
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,670
Good work.

486
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,680
Stop trying to get out of this now. The CCTV captured everything.

487
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,800
That isn't me.

488
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,500
It's someone who looks like me.

489
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,340
Seriously.

490
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,720
I'm glad that it's all better.

491
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,450
Still, you can't overwork it, okay?

492
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,660
Okay.

493
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,860
Let's stop by the police station on our way out.

494
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,430
I told Ahjussi Seon Gu to apologize to you in person.

495
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:04,010
He's not even the one who did it.

496
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,670
But still, he must be having a hard time. Let's at least greet him and then go home.

497
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,440
Okay.

498
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,210
Ms. Jo Ha Ni, let's hurry and finish up.

499
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,720
Where did you hide that bag of money?

500
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,370
You really don't believe what other people say.

501
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:22,370
Omo, what time is it already?

502
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:27,300
Is it okay to detain a person like this without any proof, Mr. Detective?

503
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,600
Ah, this grandma, seriously.

504
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,180
Detective!

505
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,270
Oh, Bok Sil.

506
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,080
Grandmother!

507
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,530
Grandma!

508
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,740
Grandma!

509
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,500
My grandma also had cold hands, you know.

510
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:13,090
Grandmother, I won't ask or argue with you about you lying about your grandson.

511
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:19,810
I just want you to give that money back. It belongs to someone that I know.

512
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:24,170
I-I told you that I don't know anything about that.

513
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,880
Mr. Detective must be waiting for me.

514
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,520
I see your hurt leg is all better now.

515
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,640
That's a relief.

516
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,100
Aigoo, what kind of clothes are these for a young girl to wear?

517
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,260
It's so old-fashioned.

518
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,830
I don't wear this kind of stuff.

519
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,860
Then give me those clothes back and go in your undies.

520
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,060
This is the first time I've seen a girl so obsessed with her clothes!

521
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,410
This was my late mom's.

522
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,940
I'm sorry.

523
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:06,060
Don't take to heart what a silly old woman like me says to you.

524
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,620
Go and live well.

525
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,570
Living in Seoul is pretty tough.

526
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,080
Yes, ma'am. You find your grandson too, Grandmother!

527
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,040
Grandmother!

528
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,520
With this, at least buy yourself a meal.

529
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,540
Return home safely.

530
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm remembering such useless things. It's so annoying.

531
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,870
Call the Detective for me.

532
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,710
I'll tell you where the bag is.

533
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,420
Really? Then I'll go get the detective.

534
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:22,860
I never knew I, the Black Sable, would exchange 1 million USD for $10.

535
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,740
Kang Ji Sung wanted to clear you of your false accusations

536
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:31,160
and even found evidence. You shouldn't be like this.

537
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,750
Someone died in that accident. Who would believe that you had no intent to kill anyone?

538
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,680
Detective, this is so unfair.

539
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,390
Frankly, wasn't it your guilty conscience

540
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,170
which led you to even bribe me?

541
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,510
Please make sure to give me a call when the unconscious patient in the hospital wakes up.

542
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,260
You don't have to give me something like this.

543
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:56,770
That was... because I was worried about when Secretary Goo would wake up.

544
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,330
There was no other hidden motive behind it.

545
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,420
I retrieved the money bag.

546
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,700
And we discovered this.

547
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,210
There's an audio recording in here.

548
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,500
- Secretary Goo, you just have to cause a simple fender-bender.
- Isn't it better to get rid of him while you've got the chance?

549
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:23,510
No. If Ji Sung gets hurt even a little bit, the chairwoman will send him back to France.

550
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,490
Don't complicate the matter needlessly.

551
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,810
There aren't any more copies of this recording, right?

552
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,690
Of course not.

553
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,090
Secretary Goo lied to me!

554
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,670
This is a relief.

555
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,970
Thank you.

556
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,500
Detective, thank you so much.

557
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,310
I found it thanks to Bok Sil, so thank her later.

558
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:53,100
Thanks to this, your sentence will decrease drastically.

559
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,080
Thank you. Seriously.

560
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,850
I owe you guys so much.

561
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,480
Thank you, Louis.

562
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:52,910
So the President of Joong Won's workplace got arrested for something shameful?

563
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,450
It must be unsettling for the company and employees.

564
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:00,570
I'm more worried about my Audrey than the company.

565
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,260
She must be having a hard time after sending her husband off to prison.

566
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:18,720
Jae Sook, sorry for always being irritable.

567
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,200
I haven't been in my right mind for a while.

568
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,980
I committed a sin and I've been so focused on that.

569
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,930
But just know that I've been having a hard time too.

570
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,700
I will gladly pay back for what I did,

571
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,800
so stay healthy and well with Ma Ri.

572
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:45,390
I want to thank you for being always kind to Louis in my place.

573
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:51,240
Will I ever be able to repay you all the debts I owe you?

574
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:57,870
Why did he? Why?

575
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,330
Why did you do this?

576
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:23,780
I looked for it everywhere. Are you sure you left it here?

577
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,900
Absolutely. I'm sure.

578
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,350
I told you I was right.

579
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,770
When I came here last time, it definitely wasn't there.

580
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:42,250
Since you are getting older, get some reading glasses.

581
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:48,940
I still have 20/20 vision.

582
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,640
Stop attacking me about my age. I'm going to get upset.

583
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,110
Ahjussi Seon Gu said that when you get older, you sweat when you eat.

584
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:58,420
Becoming more tearful, is that also because of age?

585
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,560
Young Master...

586
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,520
Okay.

587
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,580
Here is the 30th anniversary music box.

588
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,320
"Go Bo Ssi"

589
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,320
Hello Go Bo Ssi.

590
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,140
You treasured him so much that you even wrote his name down here.

591
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,310
I been wanting to ask you this, but what is "Go Bo Ssi"?

592
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,960
Is it a name of a seed? (Ssi means a seed in Korean.)

593
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:38,490
It's the name of a very cute kid with a beautiful smile.

594
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:44,200
That kid must be living a good life, right?

595
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,530
Probably, I guess.

596
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,650
Anyway, it's a relief that you got your memory back.

597
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:56,910
After your supposed death, the chairwoman was looking for this box everywhere.

598
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,520
Grandma did? Why?

599
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,300
Because this contains Chairwoman's treasured memories.

600
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,330
Chairwoman, I finally found it.

601
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,500
Really?

602
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,620
You wanted to look at it so badly, so look at it as much as you want.

603
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,450
March 15, 1996. Mom, Dad, Ji Sung.

604
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:28,510
I will be outside.

605
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,130
Okay.

606
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:53,270
Their voices... Their voices...

607
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:57,410
I missed them so much.

608
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:00,910
Should we jump? One. Two. Three! Whee!

609
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,170
Was that fun?

610
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:10,940
My son Geum Seok, Daughter-in-law...

611
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,130
I miss you.

612
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,350
What should I do?

613
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,440
Chairwoman...

614
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,950
Did Sister-in-law go somewhere?

615
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,850
It's Brother-in-law.

616
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:45,970
Oh yeah, Brother-in-law.

617
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:49,640
The name I learned first got stuck in my head.

618
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,250
He went out to play.

619
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:56,440
It must be so hard for him to keep his butt in contact with the floor.

620
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,640
It's okay if he goes out a bit. I really wanted to wander around at that age.

621
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,010
I'm sad that I couldn't.

622
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,540
Okay.

623
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,950
Oh yeah. Louis!

624
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,080
This, this.

625
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,210
Are you giving this to me?

626
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:21,540
It's what you earned and saved, so this is yours.

627
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,230
If there was something you wanted to buy, go buy it.

628
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,220
Should I get a present for Grandmother?

629
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,620
Yeah, do that.

630
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,580
Usually, with your first paycheck, you're supposed to buy red thermal undergarments for your parents.

631
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,090
Buy your grandmother some undergarments.

632
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:44,280
No. I want to buy something else.

633
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,120
What?

634
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,020
There's something like that.

635
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:57,490
Grandmother, I bought this with the money I earned while working hard.

636
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:02,130
It wasn't a paycheck from Gold Group but my real first paycheck.

637
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:03,700
Louis.

638
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,130
Bok Sil told me to buy red undergarments, but I bought these.

639
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:10,410
You are a silver angel wearing high heels.

640
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:17,180
Oh my goodness, how did you choose the ones that I really like?

641
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,740
Try them on!

642
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,880
Yes, okay.

643
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,610
Aigoo, yes!

644
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:29,250
Aigoo, they fit perfectly!

645
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,960
How is it? Does it suit me?

646
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,010
Perfect.

647
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:37,780
These are high heels that were created in this world just for you.

648
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,880
What really came into this world just for me

649
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,690
is you, Louis.

650
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:47,700
Thank you so much

651
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,470
for coming to me.

652
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,390
Grandma...

653
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,310
- Why isn't Grandma coming?
- I'll go get her.

654
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,150
No, I'll go.

655
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,260
Grandma! My Grandma!

656
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,390
Grandma, get up. We set the table.

657
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,600
Grandma!

658
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,350
Grandma.

659
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:05,430
Grandma!

660
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:12,980
Grandma.

661
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,620
Grandma...

662
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:24,390
Grandma!

663
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,920
I'm sorry for coming so late, Grandma.

664
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,910
Grandma!

665
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:08,140
Chairwoman, if you leave me like this, what am I going to do?

666
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,310
Grandma!

667
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:51,230
Goodbye, Grandma.

668
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:56,350
♬ Now the end is near♬

669
00:53:56,350 --> 00:54:02,450
♬ And so I face, the final curtain♬

670
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:08,340
♬ My friend, I'll say it clear♬

671
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:15,630
♬ I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.♬

672
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:21,570
♬ I've lived a life that's full♬

673
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:27,930
♬ I've travelled each and every highway♬

674
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,140
♬ And more...♬

675
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,440
People buy things with different values in mind.

676
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:34,850
If you look at someone's purchase pattern,

677
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,500
you can understand who that person is.

678
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:46,710
♬ Regrets I've had a few♬

679
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:53,630
♬ But then again, too few to mention♬

680
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:58,720
♬ I did what I had to do♬

681
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,370
But Grandma, why do you wear stilettos even though your back hurts?

682
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:05,770
♬ Without exception♬

683
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:11,450
Because to your grandmother, who always wants to live young,

684
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:15,280
stilettos are like an attitude toward life.

685
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,410
When I wear heels, this stooped-over back becomes straight,

686
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:24,260
and my gait becomes energetic.

687
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,520
♬  I did it♬

688
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,400
I always wanted to walk like that.

689
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:33,960
Young and confidently.

690
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,480
♬ I'm sure you knew♬

691
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:43,690
♬ When I bit off more then I could chew♬

692
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:46,360
♬ But through it all♬

693
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:50,070
The one who came into this world truly for me

694
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,070
is you, Louis.

695
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:59,480
Thank you so much for coming to me.

696
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,850
♬  And I stood tall♬

697
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:08,530
♬  and did it my way♬

698
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:34,070
♬  At some point, you ♬

699
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:39,950
A good amount of time passed, but it still felt like something was missing in the empty space Grandma left behind.

700
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:42,130
♬ I'm fine with it. ♬

701
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,540
And then one day...

702
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:50,650
♬ The time we are spending together today  ♬

703
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,460
Jeong Ran. Jeong Ran!

704
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,360
A new life came into our house.

705
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:03,720
As if it was Grandma's gift to us.

706
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,450
Jeong Ran.

707
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:11,490
I love you.

708
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:17,940
♬ I think I feel a little bit sorry ♬

709
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,710
I'm dizzy!

710
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,830
My beloved Butler Kim

711
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:26,670
hasn't been able to properly propose because he's still analyzing things.

712
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:32,660
And the Queen of Stubbornness Go Bok Sil is ignoring me when I tell her to live with me at my house,

713
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,910
and is still insistently living in our rooftop room.

714
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:40,270
- Bok Sil, I'm here!
- You're here?
- Hyung!

715
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:43,410
- Oh, Brother-in-law was home, too.
- I'm taking a break at home today.

716
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:47,430
- There are too many people outside on the weekends.
- Yes, I see.

717
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,860
I made some ramyun, so let's eat it together. Bok Nam said he wanted some.

718
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,710
I did well, didn't I?

719
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:58,840
Yeah. Aish, I wanted to eat out with Bok Sil...

720
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,620
- Louis and Bok Nam, set the table up!
- Okay.

721
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,560
Is it working now?

722
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:18,180
Yes. I'm finished with the repairs, and I also got the tape out of it.

723
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,480
Thank you.

724
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,810
What is it?

725
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,180
Where did this come from?

726
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,790
It's good!

727
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:01,460
- Yes, Ahjumma Audrey. How is it going?
- Louis!

728
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:04,440
I have a present to give you!

729
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,710
What present?
