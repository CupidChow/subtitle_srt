00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,720
Why are we shopping in the morning? I'm tired.

10
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,890
I feel a bit depressed.

11
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,550
Why? Is the director bullying you?

12
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,380
Is he abusing you like Cinderella?

13
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,780
No way, there's no way.

14
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,700
Whatever he tells you to do, it'll come back like a boomerang

15
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,360
and he'll be startled to find himself doing it.

16
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,490
You have that kind of talent.

17
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,940
When will my memory come back?

18
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,760
What do you think my job was?

19
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,980
All of a sudden, I felt like going to work today.

20
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,830
You feel left out, all by yourself,

21
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,100
when the rest of the world is carrying on busily?

22
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,930
You feel a sense of loss when you see those skyscrapers, endless offices, all those desks,

23
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,810
and there is no place for you, right?

24
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,960
I want to be a part of them no matter what.

25
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,370
That kind of desire, urge creeps up on you.

26
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,000
Hyeong, have you been inside my head?

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,390
- Who am I?
- Employment preparer.

28
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,790
- Who?
- Employment preparer!

29
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,330
That's right!

30
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,780
The job of an employment preparer is not only studying but also meditating.

31
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,500
The longer you study, the deeper your thoughts grow.

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,470
Dude, you're becoming more and more human.

33
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,200
Of course you have a long way to go to get to my level.

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,570
Let's buy stuff, let's finish shopping,

35
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,860
and let's find Bok Nam.

36
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,280
I've started wanting to become a better person.

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,060
Then I'll tell her.
[Episode 8 - Be My Baby]

38
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,890
Let's go together!

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,700
Bok Sil moved in with the director.

40
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,230
What?

41
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,270
Any way that I look at it, the director

42
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,320
100% likes Bok Sil.

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,760
If that wasn't the case, why would he take Bok Sil and have her charge into his own house?

44
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,650
Ah, there is this boy named Louis whom Bok Sil is taking care of for the time being.

45
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,830
He's really nice, but he's... he's...

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,330
he's weird, he's like an alien. Anyhow, he's a burden.

47
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,620
- I see.
- Yes.

48
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,540
You came all the way here and couldn't meet Bok Sil, what to do?

49
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,630
That's okay. I just came here because I was worried about Bok Sil, as her boss.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,360
I know it's not appropriate to say these things when we just met,

51
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,670
but both your face and body, no, no...

52
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,810
I mean your heart... Both of them are silky nice.

53
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,030
It's nothing.

54
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,460
Oh, don't do that. You're too perfect.

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,960
Dad. Louis is living at the headquarters director's house right now.

56
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,990
What did you say?

57
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,440
Ah, it's so annoying!

58
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,760
Go Bok Sil is living with them too! I'm going to make them move out immediately.

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,170
Ma Ri. Ma Ri. Don't get agitated.

60
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,930
Dad will take care of everything, so just don't do anything. Understand?

61
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,160
Who is it at this late hour?

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,840
It's past 11 P.M.

63
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,160
President Baek?

64
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,190
Excuse me? The president?

65
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,790
Why would Bok Sil's workplace's president come here?

66
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,290
Hide in the study for now. Quick!

67
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,500
Ah. The shoes.

68
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,660
Hurry.

69
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,900
- Hold this.
- President.

70
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,290
What brings you here so suddenly?

71
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,260
Sorry for coming so late. I had to talk to you about something urgent.

72
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,500
Let's go in and talk.

73
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,040
Wait a mo—

74
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,210
Is the Director in a high position at work? The president personally comes to talk—

75
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,160
Be quiet!

76
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,930
Is there someone home?

77
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,940
No way. You know full well that I live alone.

78
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,670
I think someone is in that room.

79
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,730
President!

80
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,570
President!

81
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,280
Although you're the president, I think

82
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,550
that opening someone else's doors so abruptly is going a bit far.

83
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,710
Sorry, there was just some rumor I heard.

84
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,440
I've become too sensitive.

85
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,900
Do you sleep in the study?

86
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,220
Ah, yes. Sometimes, I sleep in here after working.

87
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,250
I see. Then let's talk here.

88
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,370
You sit too, Director Cha.

89
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,450
Yes.

90
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,940
I heard something strange about you today, Director Cha.

91
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,290
About me?

92
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,540
I heard that you were living with a female employee in your department.

93
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,850
Is that true?

94
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,780
Moreover, that female employee is

95
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,090
the janitor that you got onto the team a month ago,

96
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,000
through your connection or something.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,780
The second-hand embarrassment was such that I yelled at the gossip-monger.

98
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,990
You are not that kind of person, Director Cha.

99
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,670
Someone who can't draw the line between public and private matters,

100
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,400
and making arbitrary hiring decisions, all blinded by your desire for a woman.

101
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,090
You're not someone who would do that.

102
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,880
I already told you before, but

103
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,990
Go Bok Sil has got what it takes to become a great merchandising director, so

104
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,770
I merely gave her an opportunity.

105
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,360
She didn't waste that opportunity, but secured a contract employee position.

106
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,700
From there all is the result of her own hard work.

107
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,810
So please don't disparage by saying

108
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,440
it was because of my desire or personal feelings.

109
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,360
Of course not! If I can't trust

110
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,580
Director Cha, who under the sun can I trust?

111
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,570
What I'm saying is, there isn't anything good that will come out of it

112
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,530
if that kind of rumor is circulating.

113
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,870
Getting a scratch on your clean and pure reputation,

114
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,270
I don't like that.

115
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,370
Thank you for your concern.

116
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,730
That employee... Go Bok Sil.

117
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,840
What do you think of sending her to the Shanghai branch?

118
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,290
Excuse me?

119
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,450
Think about it.

120
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,940
It might be a good opportunity for her, too.

121
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,390
Sorry for coming at such a late hour.

122
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,590
No need to see me out.

123
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,220
Have a safe trip back.

124
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,760
Director, I'm sorry.

125
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,790
We only thought of ourselves.

126
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,840
I didn't know it would affect you like this.

127
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,130
If Bok Sil is sorry,

128
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,330
I'm sorry as well.

129
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,340
Go pack your belongings.

130
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,020
Halt.

131
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,610
I don't know who's been saying such nonsense,

132
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,270
but I'm fine with it.

133
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,550
I'm okay with you guys living here.

134
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,810
The house owner says it's okay so stop overreacting. It's late

135
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,210
so just go sleep.

136
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,000
Director, but I don't want to put you in a tough spot because of us—

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,440
Thank you for taking care of us even when it's tough on you.

138
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,980
Hey, what are you doing?

139
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,260
It's basic manners to happily accept someone's kind gestures.

140
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,790
Right, Director?

141
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,960
What's with you? You're actually saying something right.

142
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,580
But, Director.

143
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,850
You don't by any chance like Bok Sil, do you?

144
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,170
Stop saying nonsense!

145
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,300
What? Your president said so earlier.

146
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,840
You don't like her, right?

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,300
- Of course not.
- What a relief.

148
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:30,370
Then, will you really send Bok Sil to the Shanghai branch?

149
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,510
No.

150
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,880
Give up the useless worrying and go to sleep.

151
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,670
Go upstairs!

152
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,840
If you're in an awkward situation at work, should I spread the rumor that I live together (with you) too?

153
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,390
Just hurry upstairs!

154
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,700
If we send Go Bok Sil to Shanghai, Louis has to follow her.

155
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,430
Louis just needs to stay out of sight until the company shares are taken care of.

156
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,650
Louis doesn't even have any form of identification. How do we send him to China?

157
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,840
I'll take care of that.

158
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,710
Go Bok Sil wouldn't want to go, either.

159
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,880
She's looking for her brother as if her life's on the line.

160
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,650
But isn't her brother already dead?

161
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:14,170
Ma Ri, you need to tell her that truth.

162
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,960
She might want to go off somewhere far away if she finds out her brother died.

163
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,430
That is a perfect motivating force to send someone far away.

164
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,990
Don't waste time.

165
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,060
Are you sure this person bought flowers here?

166
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,420
Yes, he was so picky picking the rose...

167
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,720
So which one did he pick?

168
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,800
An orange rose.

169
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,820
Butler Kim, do you know the language of flowers well?

170
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,510
Red means passion, yellow means jealousy,

171
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,430
and pink means happiness.

172
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,740
Do you know what orange means?

173
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,430
I'm not sure.

174
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,710
First love.

175
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,650
Have you even been in love, Butler Kim?

176
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,510
Young Master, such things shouldn't be asked so directly.

177
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,830
It's rude.

178
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,400
Why get hung up on such things between us?

179
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,680
Will I ever fall in love, too, some day?

180
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,130
Who knows.

181
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,580
If I find someone I love, I'm going to give this orange rose.

182
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,990
Just one stem.

183
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,400
What's with your expression?

184
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,630
It's Young Master for sure.

185
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,800
Did he say anything else?

186
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,470
He was going to give the flower to the woman he lives with.

187
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,590
Sorry?

188
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,840
They didn't seem married. Maybe they just live together?

189
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,100
How can a cohabiting guy be...

190
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,920
He paid for the flower with six 500 won coins, so I remember him even more.

191
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,620
Considering the payment method, there is no way he's the young master.

192
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,930
- Thank you.
- Sure.

193
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,310
I'm certain, I'm certain, I'm certain.

194
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,190
A thousand won for one! Two thousand won for two! Take your pick!

195
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,910
Louis.

196
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,040
Hyung, how's this?

197
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,620
You really have a great fashion sense!

198
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,230
I'm asking because I'm really curious, but did this kid talk to you, this time, too?

199
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,090
- Yeah.
- What did it say?

200
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,010
"Louis. Louis." It calls my name.

201
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:38,810
Louis, Louis, no matter how I look at you, you sure seem out of your mind.

202
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,190
You have a long way to go to reach my level.

203
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,570
Here's the money.

204
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,030
Come again.

205
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,690
- Can I have a bag?
- Sure, sure.

206
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,840
Thank you for the bag.

207
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,890
Yes, come again.

208
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,940
Hyung, did they say the culprit isn't caught yet?

209
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,050
Right.

210
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,310
That's weird. I gave them a big hint, so it's about time he got caught.

211
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,480
You know, I wrote a letter to the UN not too long ago. Our country will be reunified soon. Just wait and see.

212
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,560
What are you talking about?

213
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,160
It's dumbfounding, right? The same goes for you.

214
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,110
Okay, got it.

215
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,380
Team Leader! We found out suspect Jung Gil Do's residence.

216
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,460
Good, let's roll out.

217
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,360
We don't know which way he may try to elude us, so keep a tight watch around his house.

218
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,340
- Yes, Sir.
- Let's go.

219
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,500
What are you busy packing for?

220
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,780
You better move it! Aren't you listening?

221
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,300
Bok Sil.

222
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,310
Yes, Team Leader.

223
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,520
Talk with me after work.

224
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,170
Okay.

225
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,120
What is going on with the list of the vendors who are going to participate in the Korea Black Friday event?

226
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,010
Is it going well under every category?

227
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,490
Of course. There are many vendors and products hoping to participate.

228
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,460
As you can see, just the number of sample goods is staggering.

229
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,950
That is an eyesore. Organize them now!

230
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,490
Yes, Sir.

231
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,880
Manager Lee, what about the temporary part-time worker I asked you to hire?

232
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,750
He will come today.

233
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,230
Bok Sil went to get him.

234
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,050
Is that so?

235
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,140
Why are you alone?

236
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,820
The part timer had something urgent come up.

237
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,290
He says he's sorry for not coming.

238
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,530
- What?!
- As expected, your talent for hiring help is outstanding as well.

239
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,920
How can you be so outstanding in all facets?!

240
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,770
- I can again—
- Forget it!

241
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,340
Yes, Sir...

242
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,090
I'll look into it.

243
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,130
Move them, move them.

244
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,190
I said I'm sure. He's our regular here.

245
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:53,060
He always pays with 500 won coins, so I can't help but remember him.

246
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,500
Is he a panhandler?

247
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,500
He keeps on using only coins that he begged for.

248
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,340
He just bought a sweatshirt here, so I put a comment at the social networking site.

249
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,790
Did you say just now? When?

250
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,580
Maybe... 20 minutes ago?

251
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,490
Twenty minutes?!

252
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,210
- Yes.
- Oh!

253
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,610
If that regular comes again, please give me a call. Please.

254
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,380
Please!

255
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,150
- Mackerel.
- Come on!

256
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,370
Hey, let's go over there.

257
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,220
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

258
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,360
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

259
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,960
Look here! Excuse me!

260
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,750
Your eyes! Use your eyes when you're walking!

261
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,630
What if our Butler Kim got hurt?

262
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,920
Give me your contact information for now. Excuse me!

263
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,300
You can stop now, I'm fine.

264
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,730
I'm not okay!

265
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,930
You can't hurt your back.

266
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,990
Rapidly dancing pupils.. Pouting lips.

267
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,000
She's sincerely worried for me.

268
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,540
Are you really okay?

269
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,070
Why?

270
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,410
Why me?

271
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,190
It's so good.

272
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,180
Hello?

273
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,240
Really? I got it, I'll be there soon.

274
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,490
- What is it?
- I got a part-time job. Fifty-thousand won ($50) per day.
- Hot damn!

275
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,890
- Where?
- Goldline.com.

276
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,650
Hey! Goldline is that way!

277
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,920
I have to prepare things. I'll see you!

278
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,710
What is he buying again?

279
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,760
That kid can't start working without equipment.

280
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,310
Fifty-thousand won is such a huge sum!

281
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:10,620
♬ On the road which is as difficult as being in a maze for the first time. ♬

289
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:54,650

00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:02,820
♬ It Can Lead and Tell Me Where You Are ♬

291
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,540
- Hello.
- Hello.

292
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,310
Hello.

293
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,260
Did Director Cha Joong Won go somewhere?

294
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,430
He's at lunch right now.

295
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,170
What about Go Bok Sil?

296
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,700
- You know Bok Sil as well?
- Yes, we're close.

297
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,230
Don't tell me they went to eat together?

298
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm not... sure about that.

299
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,490
How annoying.

300
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,900
Please give me a cup of Maxim Gold.

301
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,550
Sure.

302
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,300
Who is he?

303
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,510
I saw that guy somewhere...

304
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,550
Those clothes, shoes and scarf are all Director's.

305
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,240
Huh?

306
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,760
Director, you have a guest.

307
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,300
Are you crazy? Who said you could wear my clothes? Do you want to die?

308
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,950
He's the part-timer, who will take care of our miscellaneous work.

309
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,810
Say hello.

310
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,600
Hello.

311
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,100
- His name is...
- Louis.

312
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,610
Louis the 14th, that Louis?

313
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,290
No last name? Just Louis?

314
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,800
Wang. (Wang means king in Korean)

315
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,110
Wang Louis.

316
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,100
Bok Sil?

317
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,640
Oh... Sunbaenim.

318
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,680
Who?

319
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,920
I'm her guardian.

320
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,180
That's right! He's Bok Sil's boyfriend. Isn't that right, Wang Louis?

321
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,900
No, no! No!

322
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,320
I'm more than her boyfriend. Umm,

323
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,160
Together, we just live—

324
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,990
Are finding someone. He's helping me find my brother.

325
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,640
Then why are you wearing Director's clothes?

326
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,450
Oh, we live...

327
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,710
We met trying to lose weight.

328
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,940
You lost a lot of weight.

329
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,090
What are you doing not getting to work?! There are mountains of stuff piled up in front of the storage room!

330
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,150
I got it!

331
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,540
What the?

332
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,560
Here you go.

333
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,490
Thank you. Your name?

334
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,910
Oh.

335
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,950
Lee Kyung Gook. I'll remember that name.

336
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,510
Yes.

337
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,240
Huh.

338
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,030
- He's the part timer.
- Ah...

339
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:11,280
You served coffee to a part timer. Nice one, Manager!

340
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,540
How did you meet Bok Sil? How did you come here? Do you have a job?

341
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,030
Where does the director go to work out?

342
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,160
Stop paying attention to the part timer and get to work!

343
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,100
Chief Lee, what are you doing?!

344
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,040
First open the boxes and check the contents. Then sort them by categories like clothes, baby goods,

345
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,770
cosmetics, household items etc., and take them to each person in charge.

346
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,150
Looks like there's nothing much to it.

347
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,890
Can I just leave them here?

348
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,640
Yes.

349
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,490
Oh my!

350
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,830
Dad! Dad! Big trouble!

351
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,130
Ma Ri.

352
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,080
Miss, what is the matter?

353
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,920
Hello.

354
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,750
Director Joo, let's talk later.

355
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,420
Oh, yes.

356
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,740
Dad! Dad! Louis came to the company!

357
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,580
He's in the product planning department right now!

358
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,770
What? Why did he suddenly appear at the product planning department?

359
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,950
Did you find out what he's there for?

360
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,700
I didn't have time, I came running here after being surprised.

361
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,060
Wait. Maybe he came as a part timer?

362
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,340
Part timer?

363
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,400
We had too much work because of the Black Friday event, so we decided to get a part timer today.

364
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,300
Because Go Bok Sil is working here, Louis keeps getting mixed up in this.

365
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,840
We need to take care of Go Bok Sil quickly.

366
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,200
What do we do?

367
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,420
No return address...?!

368
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,380
Oh no! What's going on here?

369
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,960
L-Louis, Wang Louis, are you okay?

370
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,860
Oh my!

371
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,830
Are you okay?

372
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,530
Oh no! What should we do?

373
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,930
Of course I'm not okay.

374
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,980
I'm positive some woman terrorized me just now.

375
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,790
She's not here.

376
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:17,230
That woman pushed these boxes on me as soon as she saw me.

377
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,170
If it's not Assistant Manager Kwon or Hye Joo, then...

378
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,260
Team Leader Baek?

379
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,410
- What nonsense.
- What do you take the Wanna-be-Star of Goldline for?

380
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,990
I know I saw her somewhere.

381
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,560
Oh my!

382
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,250
That's right! She's the woman who crashed into me with her car.

383
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,730
That woman hit me with her car,

384
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,360
paid me, and even called me.

385
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,480
So, the woman that pushed the boxes on you

386
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,560
is the same woman that hit you with her car?

387
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,760
Here, get up.

388
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,530
He looks normal, but he's a bit weird.

389
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,110
- He has a delusional disorder.
- Yeah.

390
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,860
I was envious of Bok Sil because of her handsome boyfriend, but he turns out to be a sour apricot that's only good to look at.

391
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,590
But he seems so familiar.

392
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,540
Wang Louis. Did I see him somewhere?

393
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,430
You saw me somewhere?

394
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,060
Where? When? Huh?

395
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,040
Look. Hurry.

396
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,850
Why hurr--

397
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,710
- But what's this smell?
- What is this salty smell?

398
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,930
Oh my!

399
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,210
- Hobo?!
- Pervert!

400
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,630
Whoa! What the!

401
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,760
- Ouch!
- What are you? A beggar or what?

402
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,800
Oh my, unbelievable!

403
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,620
Then they met at the lobby when Bok Sil worked as a janitor?

404
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,600
A fateful meeting of a country chicken janitor and a homeless person suffering from a delusional disorder?

405
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,980
Wow, what a tearjerking story. This is so sad.

406
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,040
What should she do?

407
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,950
Here.

408
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,810
Hey, what happened?

409
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,940
Bok Sil, I got hit here.

410
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,390
By whom?

411
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,030
By this.

412
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,070
Geez, you should've been more careful.

413
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,650
Looks like it hurts.

414
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,130
Bok Sil, Isn't it strange?

415
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,360
You're the only one who believes me.

416
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,160
Director always tells me that I boast.

417
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,330
You only need one person who believes in you in life.

418
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,590
And that one person is Bok Sil?

419
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,070
Why are you asking, of course.

420
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,770
Team Leader Baek, did you ever hit Wang Louis with your car by chance?

421
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,400
What are you talking about?

422
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,390
Who's Wang Louis?

423
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,360
You haven't seen the new part timer?

424
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,600
N-No, I haven't.

425
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,840
As expected! He is a strange person.

426
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,280
Hye Joo said that he's Bok Sil's boyfriend.

427
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,150
Does Bok Sil care only about the looks?

428
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,310
You mean she is a lover of human kind.

429
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,990
We will be off to a business meeting.

430
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,780
Okay.

431
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,690
Here.

432
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,350
What are you doing here, not going in?

433
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,140
Are you trying to avoid someone?

434
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,420
No.

435
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,820
The suspect is caught. Let's go to the police station!

436
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,470
He's caught? Let's go!

437
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,060
Let's all go. Quickly!

438
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,340
- Hurry, hurry!
- Did the culprit get caught?

439
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,720
Yes, yes, he is caught.

440
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,720
That's weird. I gave them a big hint, so it's about time he got caught.

441
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,240
Wow, he needs to become a fortune teller.

442
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,890
Hella goosebumps.

443
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,670
Jung Gil Do, who is the suspect for the Eunsung-dong serial murder case,

444
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,830
was apprehended.

445
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,780
He had left no evidence at the previous crime scenes, but he failed to see the unidentified powder

446
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,140
that was spilled on the floor of the third crime scene.

447
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,930
Bok Sil is such a neat girl. Why was her floor in that state at the time?

448
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,040
His footprints that he never dreamed of leaving...

449
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,990
Who in the world do you think had done it?

450
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,870
Day of the incident

451
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:43,590
When is Bok Sil coming? Did something happen?

452
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,340
I can't pick it up.

453
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,210
Sheesh, seriously.

454
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,220
It's so difficult to drink coffee.

455
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,090
I should just wait for Bok Sil.

456
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,780
Five minutes before the incident occurs.

457
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,180
What is this?

458
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:23,970
Team leader, shouldn't we give Louis a reward?

459
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,230
It's not even information about the suspect, man.

460
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:30,990
But still, he gave us information about the foot print, that wasn't even in our database, that sped up the process of finding the suspect.

461
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:34,590
I approve. If we hadn't investigated that store that sells those cycling shoes,

462
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,860
- we wouldn't have found the culprit.
- Jeez, you!

463
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,850
Wow, he might really hit us.

464
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:44,310
Then find out if we can give him part of it rather than 100% of the reward.

465
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,380
Take down the police line as soon as you're done analyzing the scene.

466
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,790
Yes!

467
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,600
Is the victim in the hospital still unconscious?

468
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,810
Yes. There's a good possibility that it was a mugger.

469
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,820
Should I keep investigating in that direction as well?

470
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,220
We should do that.

471
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,550
How many times did I tell you that it was an incorrect comment?

472
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,550
I mistook him for someone else.

473
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:07,770
That's why I erased the comment.

474
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,000
Please verify it one more time.

475
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,620
I'm busy, so I'll be going now.

476
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,970
But please...

477
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,360
You're no longer accepting tips? Why are you suddenly doing that?

478
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,260
- We were contacted by the Pain Patch Man's guardian.
- His guardian?

479
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,890
He said his son was mentally deficient, so he was going around doing weird things.

480
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,340
He didn't want that kind of son being on television.

481
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,730
From a parent's point of view, it's quite understandable. We took down all the videos and photographs.

482
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,040
That man is definitely someone I know.

483
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,680
That's enough. He said his parents have now come forward.

484
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,590
I'm sure that he is someone who really resembles the dead Young Master Louis.

485
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:43,370
And how could a dead person be running around?

486
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,050
Would it be possible to get his contact information?

487
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,330
We don't really know that either. Good-bye, then.

488
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,220
Excuse me.

489
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,930
President Baek, we went around to the hospital and the broadcasting station.

490
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,430
That man is not Young Master Louis.

491
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,470
Yes, I understand.

492
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,030
Who are you talking to?

493
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,630
I thought you said you hated the sight of me? Why did you change your mind?

494
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,050
How is Mother?

495
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:25,350
Mother? She's sleeping. Why do you ask?

496
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,460
Escort Mother and come to Seoul.

497
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,930
By chance...

498
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,900
Did you find Louis?

499
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,860
No. No, I said no!

500
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,870
Don't say anything strange to Mother, and just escort her here.

501
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:46,420
If you say something pointless again, I'm not going to let it go.

502
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,380
Who have you been talking to non-stop since morning?

503
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,210
It's just a friend I know.

504
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,350
You're lying right now.

505
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,720
I'll ask you again. Do you have someone you need to report to?

506
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,320
What does it matter who I talk to?! Why are you telling me what to do?! You're being ridiculous, seriously!

507
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,900
Why is she lying to me?

508
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,230
No way. Is she talking to her boyfriend?

509
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,700
Sheesh, just what am I thinking?

510
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,890
Wait for me!

511
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,540
Ah, the pasta at that place is really delicious!

512
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,470
I was so happy we had pasta, but now I'm sad I have to stay and work overtime.

513
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,410
Does Team Leader Baek have a lot to do outside the office? She's been keeping out of sight all day long.

514
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,910
Is she perhaps avoiding Wang Louis?

515
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,720
Sheesh, I'm seriously about to go crazy, Manager Lee.

516
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,630
Why are you always saying strange things that don't make any sense? You do it all the time. It's annoying.

517
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,760
Have Bok Sil and Wang Louis already gone home?

518
00:36:54,820 --> 00:37:00,080
Park Hye Joo, you get two stars. You talk tu (misspelled) much. You're too loud. Signed, Wang Louis.

519
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,260
He's really ridiculous.

520
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,230
Ah, seriously, this is unbelievable.

521
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,130
How many stars did you get?

522
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:10,120
Kwon Mi Young, you get one star. You look down on me. Signed, Wang Louis.

523
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,680
One? I got three.

524
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,520
Byeon Do Jin, three stars.

525
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,980
I only like your fashion style. Signed, Wang Louis.

526
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,220
- I got five.
- Lee Gyeong Gook, five stars.

527
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,260
You're kind. Thank you for the coffee. Signed, Wang Louis.

528
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,890
Why fuss over the star rating that one-time part timer gave?

529
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,070
That's true, but doesn't it make you feel bad anyway?

530
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,500
His spelling is all wrong, and he's going to judge us?

531
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,250
He did a good job.

532
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,880
He said to put the products with post-its on them online first, because they have a competitive edge.

533
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,090
Who is he to evaluate products?

534
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,380
I smell the scent of a guru.

535
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,950
There's something there.

536
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,970
Has Wang Louis finished all his work before going home?

537
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:10,040
Yes, he finished it all before he left.

538
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:32,050
Go down! Do some work!

539
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,470
Bok Sil, why did you lie to me?

540
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,090
- Excuse me?
- The director lives downstairs?

541
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,760
How could you deceive me like that?

542
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,680
Bok Sil, you have a sly side to you.

543
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,700
I'm sorry for lying. I did it because I thought it might make things difficult for the director.

544
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,930
So, why would you do something that would put him in a difficult situation?

545
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,370
I heard you even took a man with you when you moved in.

546
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,830
You don't have to hide it from me. I already know everything.

547
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:09,870
Could you please keep it a secret from everyone else?

548
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,590
Anyway, I was planning to move out of the director's house today.

549
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,260
Of course, you should move out.

550
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,660
You should stop going around causing an inconvenience.

551
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,620
Do you understand?

552
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,560
Yes.

553
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,200
The reason I asked to see you today is, because I had something else to say.

554
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,730
Is it something important?

555
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,320
Bok Sil, listen and don't be shocked.

556
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,550
The truth is—

557
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,510
Bok Sil!

558
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,180
Louis?

559
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,960
Go, go. Just go.

560
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,060
Bok Sil, I'll talk to you next time.

561
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,500
You surprised me.

562
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,770
Team Leader!

563
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,310
Hello, Team Leader.

564
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,110
Can I help you?

565
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,680
Don't come any closer. The two of you, just leave now.

566
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,630
Oh! I recognize your voice.

567
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,780
Oh, she's leaving with the tray.

568
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,620
Oh, customer, leave the tray before you go!

569
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,750
It's not something to covet, though, right?

570
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,300
Customer! Hey, you tray thief!

571
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,840
How dare you treat me like a tray thief?

572
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:47,640
You'll be totally surprised, if you find out who I am. Here, go back inside quickly.

573
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,700
But, Louis, that kid. Why is he omnipresent, going around everywhere?

574
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,380
What do I do?

575
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,970
Chairwoman, I am sorry.

576
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,790
For sure, I thought it was the young master.

577
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,840
Chairwoman, I am sorry.

578
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,580
I am okay.

579
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:15,850
Butler Kim and Butler Heo, both of you worked hard.

580
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:20,430
I am sorry, Mother. I made a fuss and blew this out of proportion.

581
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:26,430
No, you worked hard, too, keeping by my side.

582
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,330
Why is Seon Goo not here yet?

583
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,540
And why is Ma Ri so late?

584
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,030
They said they were on their way here together.

585
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,890
Why to Grandmother's house?

586
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,720
Grandmother is in Seoul. Let's go and say hi to her.

587
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,060
Did something happen?

588
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:46,950
We have to take care of the shares. We are meeting Attorney Hwang tomorrow.

589
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,010
Dad, will it be okay if we leave Louis like that?

590
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,320
How many times do I have to tell you that I will take care of this.

591
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,370
For now, don't show any signs to Grandmother. Understand?

592
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,170
Okay.

593
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,090
Are you so happy to get the reward money?

594
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,790
Of course. Today is a day when I get money from here and there.

595
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,440
Buy Bok Sil a lot of yummy things.

596
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,790
I will spend it all on Bok Sil.

597
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,700
Where are you going?

598
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:29,270
Detective Nam called me and let me know that the culprit had been caught.

599
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,910
That worked out well.

600
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:34,850
I will go back home now. We've imposed on you a lot all this time.

601
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,810
It's okay to stay on if the rooftop room is uncomfortable.

602
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,490
All I have are empty rooms, anyway.

603
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,950
I will only accept your kind thoughts.

604
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:48,780
And I... will never go to the Shanghai office.

605
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,630
I have to find my brother and Louis has to regain his memory. We have to stay in Seoul.

606
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,860
Neither will I... let you go, ever.

607
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,800
You've still got a lot to learn.

608
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,010
I mean you can never graduate from the training I'm giving you. Never, never... never.

609
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,840
Yes.

610
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,470
Don't think about other things, but just work hard. Got it?

611
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,410
Yep!

612
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:25,460
♬ I'm searching for myself again All Day ♬

613
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:34,520
♬ In the smoky sunlight I ask again ♬

614
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,050
♬ Which way should I go ♬

615
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,770
Did you come by yourself?

616
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,020
♬ One exhuasted step ♬

617
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,170
What's up with you, are you feeling sick?

618
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:48,730
I am always sore. Just put some pain patches on me.
♬ But I Can Fly  ♬

619
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:53,720
Let's go.

620
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,570
♬ Fly Away ♬

621
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,150
♬ The space where memories fell asleep  ♬

622
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,290
♬ Your Space  ♬

623
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,070
♬ Will I be able to wake up someday ♬

624
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,350
Oh? It's clean here.

625
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,180
Is somebody here?

626
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,230
Ahjumma!

627
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,040
Bok Sil!

628
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,320
- Oh, my god!
- You are here?

629
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,870
I will do it, it must be hard on you.

630
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,560
Why did you do all the cleaning?

631
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,750
Aigoo, cleaning is my specialty. You guys, wait outside. I just have to wipe over here.

632
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:35,020
When coming home, nothing feels better than a clean house waiting for you.

633
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,720
Isn't that so?

634
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,880
Ahjumma...

635
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,220
- Ahjumma...
- Why are you acting like this?

636
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,760
Enough... Sit up.

637
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,960
What do you think you're doing?! It's my mom!

638
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,570
Why are these kids doing this? Aigoo, seriously, these all-grown-up boys...

639
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:59,140
- Aish.
- Are you guys crazy, really?

640
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,890
Sit up already! What are you grown-up boys doing, huh?

641
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,950
Louis: Enjoy the food.

642
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:36,400
What food is he telling me to enjoy?

643
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,710
Enjoy.

644
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:53,460
See you again, Mr. Cha Joong Eon.

645
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:58,570
I told you "Cha Joong Won", you cow-being-read-the-Buddhist-scripture-like dude (means dense).

646
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,200
Aigoo, Louis.

647
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,650
These are all on you?

648
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,080
These are nothing. Please enjoy to your heart's content.

649
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:16,170
Punk, you're so lavish. From the way you spend money, you're 100% a second-generation chaebol.

650
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,940
Mom, hurry and sit down.

651
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,360
- Okay, aigoo...
- Bok Sil,

652
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,880
tell me if you want to eat anything else. I will buy it all for you.

653
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,310
Hey, this is enough. Stop ordering more.

654
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:30,200
Aigoo, my word, that lacking guy is acting increasingly more like human.

655
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,340
The sun will rise in the west tomorrow.

656
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,610
Aigoo, who am I, after all?

657
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:37,520
I cannot live like a dummy indefinitely.

658
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:42,870
I am Shopping King Louis.

659
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,770
The lacking ones are always the ones who toot their own horn.

660
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,940
Hey, hurry and eat before they get cold.

661
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,680
- Bon appetit!
- Yeah!

662
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,210
Mr. Jo In Seong, you, have just a little.

663
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,260
Should I, Mr. Song Joong Gi?

664
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,310
I said don't do that!

665
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:02,770
Louis, you can't just spend when you get money. You have to save, too.

666
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:08,580
Do you think I will,

667
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,230
in the middle of the night, eat this greasy thing?

668
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,920
I'm so speechless.

669
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,510
I shouldn't eat all of this. How many calories is all this?

670
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:37,420
Right, what the heck, I'll just eat and run.

671
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,770
So we are back.

672
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,910
Our home is the sweetest place, right?

673
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:01,090
But you had a good time at Headquarters Director's house, too.

674
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,690
I'm saying I'm happy that we two are alone.

675
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,300
I mean I'm happy that you will prepare only my meals.

676
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,340
Bok Sil,

677
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,850
I've been mulling it over this since last night.

678
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:33,430
Seeing how even your company president is giving you a hard time,

679
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,190
it won't do because it upsets me.

680
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:38,360
Quit your job and let's open a shopping mall.

681
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,210
Somehow, I feel like I'd do very well if we opened a shopping mall.

682
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,540
What?

683
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,870
Don't you trust me? I am Shopping Wang Louis.

684
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:52,420
Of course I trust you, when I'm the sole person in this world who trusts you.

685
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:57,680
Still, I should learn more on the job. Headquarters Director told me that's what I should do.

686
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,950
You trust Headquarters Director more than me.

687
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:05,310
Again, you're sulking over a trifle.

688
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,750
Bok Sil, then, what is it that you want to do the most right now?

689
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:15,350
I'm going to make everything you want to do happen.

690
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,180
- I want to see the ocean.
- Ocean?

691
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,310
Let's go!

692
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:27,080
- Wow, it's the sea!
- Sea!

693
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:39,690
♬ The night we met, I knew I... needed you so. ♬

694
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,040
Bok Sil!

695
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,720
It's fluffy like you.

696
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,930
♬ So won't you say you love me. ♬

697
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,310
I have heard this song a lot from somewhere. Do you know this song, Bok Sil?

698
00:49:54,310 --> 00:50:00,260
No.
♬  We'll make 'em turn their heads every place we go.  ♬

699
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:05,190
♬ So won't you please, be my, be my , be my little baby  ♬

700
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,810
Louis...

701
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:11,400
♬  My one and only, say you'll be my darling, be mine, be mine  ♬

702
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,870
♬  Be my baby now, Wha-oh-oh-oh.  ♬

703
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:17,110
You're good!

704
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:20,510
♬  I'll make you happy, baby  ♬

705
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,010
♬  just wait and see  ♬

706
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:27,800
♬  For every kiss you give me  ♬

707
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,390
♬  I'll give you three  ♬

708
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:35,120
♬ Oh, since the day I saw you  ♬

709
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,680
♬ I have been waiting for you.  ♬

710
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,810
♬ You know I will adore you, till eternity  ♬

711
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:49,600
♬ So won't you please, be my, be my, be my little baby  ♬

712
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,570
♬ My one and only  ♬

713
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:55,300
♬ Say you'll be my darling ♬

714
00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:00,560
♬ Be my baby now... ♬

715
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,640
Come on!

716
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:35,700
♬ I'm taking a walk in a calming silence ♬

717
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:43,490
Oh, my shoe!
♬  After the day passes ♬

718
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,600
Wait, I'll find it.
♬  I can't remember ♬

719
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,940
- Oh, there it is. There it is!
- I'll find it.

720
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,020
♬ Which way is the place I used to be ♬

721
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,450
Hey, that's a present from the director.

722
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,000
What?
♬ Can I know the times like dreams  ♬

723
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,120
Hey! What are you doing?
Should I put myself on top of the wind ♬

724
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,480
What do you think? I'm letting it go its way.

725
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:16,280
♬ The time which I can't remember  ♬

726
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:25,900
♬ That familiar scent enters and permeats  ♬

727
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:31,900
♬  The time in my two eyes ♬

728
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:39,580
♬ The melody which stayed in my ear enters ♬

729
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:47,320
♬ The precious memory The Time ♬

730
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:56,000
♬ The untouchable feeling which comes and hurts deeply ♬

731
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:59,500
♬ The Time in my heart then ♬

732
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,480
- Why aren't you coming?
- How can I go without any shoes?

733
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,330
What do you mean how? I just have to give you a piggy back ride.

734
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,800
Oh, ack! Hey!

735
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:34,320
They're pretty.

736
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,040
Of course. Who picked them out for you? Of course they're pretty.

737
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:41,710
My grandmother said that if you buy someone shoes, you'll say good-bye.

738
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:43,510
What?!

739
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:49,600
- You pay for this.
- Hey! I don't have money. I didn't bring my wallet.

740
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,820
Why would you say something that makes me feel uncomfortable?

741
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:56,640
How much is this?

742
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,150
Hello.

743
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,490
I'm a police officer.

744
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:46,290
You're here today. I came looking for you several times.

745
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:51,800
- Oh, well, did I do something wrong?
- No.

746
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,710
I just had a few things to ask you.

747
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,500
Do you by any chance have a Gold Department Store 30-year anniversary music box here?

748
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,490
Ah, yes. Over there.

749
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,570
Yes, this is the 30-year anniversary music box.

750
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:19,560
Then, perhaps, have you ever heard the name Louis?

751
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,210
Louis?

752
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:27,650
Mmmm! The smell of books. It's nice.

753
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,380
I'm hungry.

754
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:34,250
Do books look like something to eat? Aigoo.

755
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,670
Whoa, it exudes the passage of time.

756
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,460
"The train came out of the long tunnel at the border

757
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,570
into the snow country." (Reading from Yasunari Kawabata's Snow Country in Japanese)

758
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,020
"The bottom of the night turned white..."

759
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:03,120
Hey.

760
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:18,520
"I didn't know what to say, my mouth did not know how to name

761
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:22,300
and my eyes were blind." (Reading from Pablo Neruda's poem in Spanish)

762
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:27,710
What is this? Something else, something else, something else.

763
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:39,200
"How glad I am that I am gone!" (Reading from Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther in German)

764
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:42,970
Louis, you must have been really smart!

765
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,540
I'm totally cool.

766
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,670
Wow, I'm really cool.

767
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,440
Wow! The Director and Ahjumma Geum Ja should have seen this.

768
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:56,950
- Bok Sil, yeah, shoot this.
- Huh?

769
00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:00,110
- Quickly.
- Ah, oh, okay.

770
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,450
Just a minute.

771
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,280
Start.

772
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,330
"The train came out of the long tunnel at the border

773
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,730
into the snow country."

774
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:15,390
"The bottom of the night turned white."

775
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,640
"I didn't know what to say."

776
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:29,320
"My mouth did not know how to name and my eyes were blind."

777
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,610
"How glad I am that I am gone!"

778
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:44,700
I'm this kind of person. Don't treat me badly, okay?

779
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:48,140
Isn't there anything else?

780
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,830
Marcel Proust's A La Recherche du Temps Perdu

781
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,330
"In Search of Lost Time..."

782
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,170
What does that mean?

783
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:13,010
In Search of Lost Time (in Korean).

784
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:17,590
That's really similar to my situation right now.

785
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,790
Bok Sil.

786
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:30,030
I want to find the memories I lost.

787
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:35,320
But at the present which is a new beginning...

788
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,030
I'm also really happy. I feel warm,

789
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,570
and joyful.

790
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,110
Mr. Wang Louis, then

791
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:53,230
in this new start,

792
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,830
when is the most memorable moment?

793
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:03,880

♬ Where Am I and Are You ♬

796
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:24,720
♬ It's Dark I Can't See You ♬

00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:31,730
♬ One by one things are disappearing ♬

00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:38,310
♬ My step that was hesitant ♬

All day long...

801
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:55,770
The times that I spent waiting for you.

♬ Hello ♬

804
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:21,380
Go Bok Sil, what is the most memorable moment for you?

805
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,730
♬ Hello  ♬

806
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,380
This moment right now.

807
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,600
What do I do?

808
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,390
♬ I will explode in a few seconds. ♬

809
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:05,080
Why? Are you not feeling well?

810
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,030
♬ I'm running to zero. I won't be stopped  ♬

811
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:11,400
♬ anymore

812
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:17,550
♬ On the day I fought the piercing showers, trapped in cold air ♬

813
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:20,780
♬ what made me soar above was ♬

814
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,560
♬ your warm eye ♬

815
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:31,290
♬ All right, all right. It's not a momentary impulse. ♬

816
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:35,540
♬ Allow. Allow. ♬

817
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:44,270
♬  My heart burning white hot, white hot. Like a fire (fire) ♬

818
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:50,980
♬  As if to melt it passionately my love Heart is a Time Bomb. ♬

819
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,400
♬  The sky's color is dark red, dark red Like fire (fire) ♬
