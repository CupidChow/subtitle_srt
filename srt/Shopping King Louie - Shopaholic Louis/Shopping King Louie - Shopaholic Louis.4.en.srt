00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,190

♬  Lost the Way ♬

00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,320
♬ I lost the Way far away. Far Away ♬

5
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,420
♬ I'm searching for myself again All Day All Day ♬

6
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,340
♬ In the smoky sunlight ♬

7
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,200
♬  I ask again ♬

8
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,970
♬ Where am I going ♬

9
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:34,080
♬ One exhausted step ♬

10
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,890
♬ But I can fly  ♬

11
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,700
♬  past the countless stars ♬

12
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,440
♬ Fly away.  ♬

13
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,010
♬  I remember. I fall sleep. The deserted space ♬

14
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,310
♬ Your Space.  ♬

15
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,070
♬  Can I wake up sometime and fly?  ♬

16
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,730
♬ Lost the way  ♬

17
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,390
♬ Oh lost my way  ♬

18
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,430
♬ Where should I go ? ♬

19
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,660
♬ I think I know what to do ♬

20
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,350
There is a secret hidden amongst my memories that have disappeared.

21
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,250
♬ Past the countless stars ♬

22
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,190
♬ Fly away.  ♬

23
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,280
♬  I remember. I fall sleep. The deserted space ♬

24
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,050
And there is the truth amongst those memories which have disappeared.

25
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,570
♬ Can I wake up sometime and fly? ♬

26
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,470
Gobosi.

27
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,050
Gobosi. Gobosi!

28
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,810
What?!
♬ I've come to wait countless days ♬

29
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,580
♬ I've settled myself again and am holding on ♬

30
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,630
♬ I will be there some day ♬

31
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,730
I... want to find my memories.

32
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,690
Episode 4
My Memory

33
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,690
Um...

34
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,060
This seems like a dog that I know. It keeps appearing in my head.

35
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,560
What? Are you saying your memories came back?

36
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,160
No, not exactly.

37
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,350
I definitely remember this.

38
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,510
The dog's name is Gobosi.

39
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,250
Mongsil!

40
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:45,340
Mongsil! Don't keep running off and make Mommy sad!

41
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,710
Hey. His name is Mongsil.

42
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,390
My precious ...

43
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,740
My precious... That sounds familiar.

44
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,990
Um.. do you possibly know me?

45
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,210
Who are you?

46
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,840
That rooftop bum! I knew it!

47
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,750
"Don't luk for me." Aigoo. Seriously.

48
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,100
Where did Bok Sil find a guy like that...

49
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,290
She's suffering voluntarily.

50
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,520
Mom, I hope you'll stop treating Louis badly.

51
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,040
Sometimes, he seems like he could even be a second generation Chaebol.

52
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,380
Chaebol... Chaebol... Yeah, right!

53
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,900
Hey, have you seen an heir who misspells on TV dramas?

54
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,530
Where did you send that money? Where did you spend all that money?

55
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,290
I mean... He said that I was Song Joong Gi

56
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,190
and that he would give back my ID.

57
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,100
Bok Sil... I just really wanted to find out who I was.

58
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,050
I thought maybe my memories would come back then and... I would remember Bok Nam as well.

59
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,130
I'm really sorry. I'm sorry, but...

60
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,350
At that time, I really wasn't myself.

61
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,310
Something kept coming up in my mind.

62
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,510
You know how it is...

63
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,600
Feeling like I could easily carry two million won in my wallet, you know...

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,120
That feeling... It's just that kind of a feeling.

65
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,990
Bok Sil. Bok Sil!

66
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,750
What is it?!

67
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,970
I'm hungry...

68
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,120
Bok Sil must be really mad.

69
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,280
I'm hungry ...

70
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,970
Should I leave again?

71
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,400
Where would you go? You have nowhere to go!

72
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,100
Then I'll come in.

73
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,400
What are those now?

74
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,460
I thought we really needed them.

75
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,760
I fell last time and got a hole on the elbow area.

76
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,140
I really need to shave.

77
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,500
I'm not very mindful of time.

78
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,060
My pants kept falling down. I was wondering if I had lost weight...

79
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,410
I thought my memory would return if my heart and body felt at ease...

80
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,790
Hey!

81
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,190
Ah, I'm so scared...

82
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,690
Hyung! Come out! Hyung!

83
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,940
- Who is it?!
- Shh! Quiet down, please.

84
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,240
You little! You're the one who knocked on the door first. How dare you lecture me?

85
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,200
- Hyung, your mom is really scary.
- My mom used to be like Bok Sil at one time.

86
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,970
No way!

87
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,010
For real! She said it was a downhill for her after she met my dad.

88
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,430
My aunt was telling me with tears. My dad was just like you.

89
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,290
Did you eat?

90
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,190
Oh! You're here?

91
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:02,950
Bok Sil. The way I see it, I think Louis losing his memory is all a lie.

92
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,110
He has no sense of reality. Look at this. He has no idea of the value of money...

93
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,570
All he knows is living off of you.

94
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,360
I think he's mentally unstable, to begin with,

95
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,880
and you're uselessly taking care of him and making it harder on yourself.

96
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,300
Louis is not like that.

97
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,510
So frustrating. Hey, to be honest

98
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,480
he could have found your brother's track suit in the trash and worn it.

99
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,890
What are you going to do if he doesn't get his memory back when he even turns 80 years old?

100
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:42,640
Do you want to grow old looking after this bum who will just spend money like water until the day he kicks the bucket?

101
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,710
... is a place that the president built fifteen years ago.

102
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:51,490
From your seat, you could tour

103
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,290
all of the Palace at Versailles, the Eiffel Tower and the Champs-Élysées.

104
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,110
Yes, so the places that are hard to visit personally...

105
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,970
the luxury apartment which is prepared

106
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,760
Bok Sil, should we buy an apartment?

107
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,650
I'm hungry. Give me food.

108
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,720
No way. His memory should be back soon.

109
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,460
Where did you get that kind of guy? Should I throw him out for you?

110
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,770
Treat Bok Sil nicely.

111
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,270
What if she changes her mind and abandons you? It will put me in an uncomfortable situation.

112
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,490
No way. Bok Sil would never do that.

113
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,390
Think of my mom.

114
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:38,910
Picture Madame Hwang Geum Ja who was just like Bok Sil at one point...

115
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,940
Day in and day out, you're holed up at the house and taking it easy. And are you cleaning or are you doing laundry?

116
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,140
On top of that, I have to serve you three meals a day.

117
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,410
I've never seen a shameless bum like you in all of my 55 years!

118
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,270
Wow...

119
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,410
I wish my memory would come back faster.

120
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,340
Your memory is one thing. You need to grow up first.

121
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,340
You are in the top four of the most influential businessmen in Asia.

122
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,010
Not only did you transform Gold Group to keep up with the demands of the times,

123
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,680
but also you are a leader in mobile distribution trends.

124
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,760
"Issues and People"
Baek Seon Gu, Gold Group President

125
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,410
You're flattering me.

126
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,800
Rather than to call it my own accomplishments...

127
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,270
I think I've seen that man before.

128
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,270
That guy is the President of Gold Group. The big boss of the place Bok Sil works at.

129
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,340
- What do you mean a president is the big boss?
- Because he'll become the chairman.

130
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,270
A while ago, the heir to the group died,

131
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,700
so he's going to become chairman instead. He's hit the jackpot.

132
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,120
Wow. You have a lot of knowledge.

133
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,380
An employment preparer must know everything about the worlds of politics and economy like the back of his own hand.

134
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:50,490
Yes, that's correct. Considering the character of the retail industry at the time, it was a risky venture.

135
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,240
He seems so strangely familiar.

136
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,020
When others were failing to adapt to the changes in the distribution industry and crashing, our Gold Group ...

137
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,970
Should we go to Gold Department Store tomorrow?

138
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,080
- Did you want go to the department store?
- It's not like that.

139
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
I'm not going.

140
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,990
You said you would help me find my memories.

141
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,070
I said I don't want to go.

142
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,690
Is it good?

143
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,370
Ah. You're busy, but because of me. I'm sorry.

144
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,840
It's fine. I had to come anyway to investigate a case.

145
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,720
Oh! You should eat too! It's really tasty and cools you down.

146
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,970
I was angry all evening, but I feel like it's going down now.

147
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,760
Bok Sil. For voice phishing, it's hard to get compensated even after we catch the culprit.

148
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,620
I see.

149
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:40,020
It's really worrisome because both you and that Louis guy are babes in the woods.

150
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,790
Do you want another bowl?

151
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,040
Can I make it take out?

152
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,560
I think Louis would like it too.

153
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,900
Bok Sil.

154
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,210
It's nice and cool.

155
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,600
When I make a lot of money, I'll buy you 100 of these.

156
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,080
Really?

157
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,860
Just trust in me.

158
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,840
Just don't get scammed.

159
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,710
I'm really sorry.

160
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,540
Mom, where are you going dressed like that?

161
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,060
I'm going off to work. Are you the only one who works?

162
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,190
Do you even sell one book a day?

163
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,210
What do you see me as?

164
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,460
I'm going to throw them out. I decided to clean up what you don't wear.

165
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,780
Mom, put all of those in a shopping bag.

166
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,890
What are you going to do with them?

167
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,890
I'll throw them out.

168
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,390
Is it a coin?

169
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,890
A gold coin.

170
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,550
Hello.

171
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,960
Then, is that Gold Group's symbol?

172
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,820
Did you just find out now?

173
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,750
Are you learning well?

174
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,430
Yes. I can use the computer and phone well now.

175
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,510
Go Bok Sil, I didn't hire you so you can learn those things.

176
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,940
You know that the team is preparing the killer product for fall, right?

177
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,860
- Yes.
- You try preparing for that too.

178
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,470
What?

179
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,160
I'm saying you should also prepare a killer product aiming at the fall season.

180
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,100
Me?

181
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,370
I thought we are about the same size, so I picked out a few from my closet.

182
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,920
Oh, Team Leader. Thank you so much!

183
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,700
Oh my goodness Team Leader. I would think Mother Teresa resurrected.

184
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:08,010
You know... The director also told me to prepare a fall season product for the social commerce site.

185
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,870
You will help me, right?

186
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,750
The director said that?

187
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,230
Of course. If there is something you don't know, ask me.

188
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,960
Okay.

189
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,630
Bok Sil, there is a delivery for me at the lobby. Can you get that for me?

190
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,540
Ah, okay.

191
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,830
Right. Did you know that "Shopping King Louis" showed up at our shopping mall?

192
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,400
Yeah. I thought that was weird too.

193
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,500
I mean, some elementary school kid bombed and terrorized the site with his one-dimensional reviews.

194
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,070
Did you check the bad consumer list?

195
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,900
He's not a problematic consumer.

196
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,020
Seeing that he misspelled a bunch of words, it looks like an elementary schooler playing around.

197
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:55,660
But why does the ID happen to match the nickname of the dead grandson of the chairwoman?

198
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,510
Do you think Chairwoman's grandson is still alive?

199
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,950
The actual color is different from the one on screen.

200
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,400
Look at this kid...

201
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,030
Not luxurius (misspelled) at all.

202
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,570
It's 6350 won cheaper at Wimon.

203
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,700
The buckle tried to copy Ferragamo but it looks more like Nong* Bank's logo.

204
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,460
Give discounts to people who don't haave (misspelled) credit cards like me.
- Shopping King Louis.

205
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,690
Who is this?

206
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,080
Hyung, I'm really used to this type of setting.

207
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,660
I'm really uncomfortable in this setting. Let's leave as soon as you're done.

208
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,260
Okay.

209
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,780
This is amazing!

210
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,720
Do you like it?

211
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,550
It's here!

212
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,780
Hey, I'll be in the bathroom, so look around and come back soon.

213
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,380
Welcome.

214
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,230
Is this all from this season's collection?

215
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,270
Is there a specific product you're looking for?

216
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:20,290
I have underwear from here.

217
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:27,410
I want to know when, where, why it was made, and who it was sent to.

218
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,700
Can you find that out for me?

219
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,230
Customer, we don't manufacture underwear.

220
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,700
I know that. What do you see me as?

221
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,280
If you look at the back, the name "Louis" is inscribed on there.

222
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,710
What are you doing?

223
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,940
Manager!

224
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,310
Hurry and call security.

225
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,450
Okay.

226
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,820
I'm not a weird man.

227
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,400
Is this security? There's a pervert here.

228
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,730
Yes. Please come quickly.

229
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,640
No, it's not like that. On the back...

230
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,460
Don't come over here!

231
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,820
Aren't you leaving?

232
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:24,090
♬  Midnight, not a sound from the pavement ♬

233
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,670
♬  Has the moon lost her memory? ♬

234
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,750
♬  She is smiling alone ♬

235
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:42,460
♬  In the lamp light, the withered leaves collect at my feet.  ♬

236
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:50,510
♬  And the wind begins to moan.  ♬

237
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:57,760
♬  Memory, all alone in the moonlight,  ♬

238
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:07,540
♬  I can smile at the old days. I was beautiful then.  ♬

239
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:16,020
♬  I remember the time I knew what happiness was.  ♬

240
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:24,020
♬  Let the memory live again.  ♬

241
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,780
♬  Every street lamp  ♬

242
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:39,130
♬  seems to beat a fatalistic warning.  ♬

243
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,300
That scared me.

244
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,570
Hey, what is it? Let's go quickly. We're sorry.

245
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,590
Lou-That was definitely Louis.

246
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,250
Aish. Why do you keep causing trouble?

247
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,630
What did I do?

248
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,260
You said you would get your memories back if you wen to the department store.

249
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,680
Do you want to get caught by police for scaring someone? Don't you know how scary police are?

250
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,010
Aish, seriously hopeless dude...

251
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,950
Work alone for today.

252
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,070
- Hyung!
- Come when you've handed them all out.

253
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:26,020
Ah... Please take one.

254
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,030
Hyung!

255
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,840
Aish.

256
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,560
- What should we eat?
- Cold noodles!

257
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,110
- Soybean Noodles. - Cold Noodles. - Spicy Seafood Noodles.

258
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,660
Louis: I'm hungry. I'm in front of the building. Come out.

259
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,940
- Right now?
- Uh huh.

260
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,550
Excuse me. I'll have my lunch outside today.

261
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,100
Have a nice meal!

262
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,060
Ah... Traitor.

263
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,560
Maybe her boyfriend is here?

264
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,180
How long has it been since she got to the capital city that she would have a boyfriend already?

265
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,360
Every day, she works late and studies to catch up.

266
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,130
She probably doesn't have time to date.

267
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:08,090
Making otherwise unavailable time to date. That is what happens between man and woman.

268
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,230
Headquarters Director, aren't you going to eat?

269
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,990
You guys eat first.

270
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,540
But why is the director going outside?

271
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,260
Is he following Bok Sil?

272
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,430
Where did she go to eat?

273
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,580
Wait a second. Which department do you work in?

274
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,800
Hey, Counterfeit! Won't you stop right there?

275
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,780
Stop moving. Are you guilty of something? Why are you running away?

276
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,320
Who's guilty?

277
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,900
Which department do you belong to? I asked you before, too.

278
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,250
Honey? I saw Louis.

279
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,650
What?

280
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:03,750
At the department store, he was glaring at me through the show window.

281
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,510
Stop talking nonsense and just go home.

282
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,430
Stop the car right now!

283
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,970
You are not an employee here? Then, how did you enter the restroom?

284
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,990
Aish!

285
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,430
That bastard is really strange.

286
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,740
Hello.

287
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,650
Yes, right. Where is the man who was standing before you?

288
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,190
He left just now.

289
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,220
Do you know him well?

290
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,850
No. Why do you ask?

291
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,350
Oh, nothing.

292
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,400
Then, I'll take leave of you.

293
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,050
Cha Joong Won met Louis.

294
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,980
Kang Ji Sung died in the accident that day.

295
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,620
- What if that was not Ji Sung?
- That can't be.

296
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,040
What if Cha Joong Won knew something and swapped out Louis beforehand?

297
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,780
I understand.

298
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,230
When did you get here?

299
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,070
I was just about to enter. Shall we go?

300
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,170
You'd better go on first.

301
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,820
I have to go to the airport.

302
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,230
I will pick up Ji Sung and go straight to the party .

303
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,420
I see. I will see you in a little while.

304
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,280
But Headquarters Director Cha is on your side.

305
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,080
He is on my side and on Mother's side.

306
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,010
From the way he's feigning complete ignorance when he saw Louis right before his eyes, there's something suspicious.

307
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,610
Keep a watch on Cha Joong Won.

308
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:02,020
Follow him to work, home and everywhere he goes and report every single detail to me.

309
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,290
Go visit Mother in Busan right away.

310
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:11,760
Spy on what she does and if there is anything strange, contact me right away.

311
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,980
What on earth is this about?

312
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:36,370
Oh ho ho, it feels familiar. I can sense some soul in it.

313
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,180
Scary kids, music box, Gobosi fire hydrant

314
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,670
Chair with soul

315
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,900
Hyung!

316
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:59,440
Wh-Wh-What? You said you might remember something if you sat in that chair. Are memories coming back in a whirlwind?

317
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,110
No... The sunlight is hot. Hold a parasol over me.

318
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:10,610
This son-of-a-bitch, really, you, seriously, bastard... Am I your servant?

319
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,730
When Bok Sil is around, you use her like a maid and when she's not around, you pester me.

320
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,040
You can't act like that toward Hyung!

321
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,610
- Are you mad? (with aegyo)
- Don't do it.

322
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,590
Are you angwy? (with aegyo)

323
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,270
I... am going to hold it in for Bok Sil's sake.

324
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,070
Happy?

325
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,810
I have to think, so hold it from behind me.

326
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,920
Like this?

327
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,630
Oh, yeah...

328
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,850
Is it okay?

329
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,230
Isn't there another umbrella?

330
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,420
No, just go with this. Conjure up memories, quickly.

331
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,310
Memory, come back please.

332
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,630
Is it coming back?

333
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,600
- I'd like you to be quiet.
- Okay, I got it.

334
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,630
No space to sleep here. That's why he's sleeping outside.

335
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,450
You are here, Bok Sil?

336
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,430
I got a mosquito bite.

337
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:02,640
How can you sleep when the house is in this state? And where did you buy that chair and for how much?

338
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,250
You! Do you know how hard it is to earn money?

339
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,710
I wanted to come home and rest, but I feel more tired at home.

340
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,370
I am very sorry.

341
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,710
You are uselessly handsome.

342
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,230
You! Know that I'm taking this because you're handsome.

343
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,870
Why are you smiling? You're good-looking, so what?

344
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,830
Scrub harder.

345
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,980
Scrub inside too.

346
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,610
That's right.

347
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:10,390
You soap it up and scrub and rinse it until it's not slippery any more. You can do it, right?

348
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,420
Wow, I think I'm doing dishes for the first time in my life.

349
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,570
What have you ever done?

350
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,570
Don't go. Keep watching me do it, huh?

351
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,150
Did I do well?

352
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,170
Spread out your hand.

353
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,220
Every time you wash the dishes, I'll give you 500 Won
(50 cents USD).

354
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,500
Can't you give me 1000 Won (1 dollar USD)?

355
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,010
Should I cut it down to 100 won?

356
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,910
Where is your mosquito bite?

357
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,240
I... here.

358
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,960
Hey, hurry and put it back on! Hurry!

359
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,340
Ow, you said you would put medicine on it...

360
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,870
I was surprised.

361
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,050
Ow, it really hurts. It hurts.

362
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,710
Right here.

363
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,070
Teeth (in French)

364
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:47,420
Did Madame go somewhere?

365
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,040
Yeah. She briefly went up to Louis' room.

366
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,370
Madame? Come and have some tea.

367
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,480
I want to get the watch fixed.

368
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,220
Yes.

369
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,130
Teeth

370
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,180
Why is he making me do these things?

371
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,550
Joong Won!

372
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,240
- Put it there.
- Yes. Yes.

373
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,000
Where did he go?

374
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,500
Is there something wrong?

375
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,580
Uh, no.

376
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,380
They say black garlic is really good for health.

377
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,270
You watched the program with me.

378
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:46,460
If it's tasty, let's order and eat it all year round, okay?

379
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,070
Okay.

380
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,740
Huh? What's this?

381
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,460
It's shoes.

382
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,970
It's so pretty.

383
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,620
Is it mine?

384
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:14,080
- What are you doing?
- Honey. Pull this up for me.

385
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,040
This.

386
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,820
Aigoo, there's no way!

387
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,920
Honey, you're not Joong Won's Cinderella.

388
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,820
Perhaps? Honey, what if he got a girlfriend?

389
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,890
Omo.

390
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,750
What kind of woman?

391
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:45,460
Scary kids, music box ...

392
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,340
Gobosi, fire hydrant, soul chair...

393
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,820
My precious, Europe...

394
00:34:55,950 --> 00:35:01,080
Ah, maybe it's because of the hot rays of the sun, but I can't think properly.

395
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,950
Hello?

396
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,080
I don't need a loan!

397
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:17,520
I never hear from Bok Nam, but receive tons of weird calls from loan and insurance companies.

398
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,240
That's called a spam call. Be careful. You saw me get scammed.

399
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,970
In the blink of an eye. You have to be alert, answering the phone.

400
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:30,030
Is that what someone who spent all our money should be saying right now?

401
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,580
It's something I shouldn't be saying. An idiot like me...

402
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,190
Oh, Supervisor, hello.

403
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,630
Hey, put it over here.

404
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,290
- Bok Sil, this is what you asked for.
- Peel all these and become human, okay?

405
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,700
From now on, when you're home, peel these.

406
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,780
If you get 30000 Won ($30 USD) for peeling 20 kilograms, it's a good deal.

407
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,750
Hey, Annoying Style, you should work hard at peeling these.

408
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,470
How do I peel them?

409
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:02,440
It's easy, don't worry. You spent so much money on buying stuff, we're running out of money.

410
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,060
At least do this and earn some money.

411
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,990
Have you come, Chairwoman?

412
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,480
Yeah, it's been a long time.

413
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,280
I moved down here for good. I'll come by often from now on.

414
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Yes.

415
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,250
Long time no see, Busan Double Ax.

416
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,340
What are you going to do if someone hears?

417
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:44,390
Jeong Ran, you were quite famous in Busan.

418
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,530
Should I prepare it like always?

419
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,610
Instead of beef as the main, change it to fish.

420
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,810
Alright, Miss Double Ax.

421
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:47,020
Ah, my neck hurts.

422
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,590
Hey!

423
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,770
Oh! Why? What's the matter?

424
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,260
You, are those things attached to your head goggles?

425
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,600
Hey, goggles 70,000 won. Massager 80,000 won.

426
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,840
I told you to peel garlic. What did you buy now?

427
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,960
No, I thought I would need them while peeling garlic.

428
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,950
You make 30,000 won peeling 20 kg. Does it make sense to buy equipment worth 150,000 won?

429
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,600
You have to peel 100 kg more!

430
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:43,080
Louis, think twice and see if you really need that before you buy.

431
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,920
I don't know how you lived before, but take a look at how we're living now.

432
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,640
Okay.

433
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,490
Did you eat?

434
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:32,080
But still... I got a $10 discount on the massager by writing a customer review.

435
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,540
Bok Sil... I must've been rich.

436
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:54,570
I don't worry about money, no matter how much I spend.

437
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:58,430
I feel like I've never had to worry about money.

438
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,310
Let's see if you'll still say that after peeling 100 kg of garlic, okay?

439
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:11,040
From now on, be sure to think twice before you buy, okay?

440
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,920
Is it fun working at the company?

441
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,680
I get scolded every day.

442
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,450
Does the headquarters director badger you?

443
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,950
It's because I don't do a good job.

444
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,540
Headquarters Director is not wrong to do so.

445
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,890
Aish. You study so hard every night and he does not even appreciate that.

446
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,160
Should I beat him up for you?

447
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,560
So reassuring to have someone on my side.

448
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,620
Ah, I was thinking about the hot-deal product you are preparing...

449
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:58,400
- What do you think about a bottle, bottle?
- Bottle?

450
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:03,240
- Do you know? What "bottle" is?
- Hey, of course I know.

451
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,310
For some years now, new bottles have been coming out every season

452
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,530
because they are IT items you can carry around stylishly.

453
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:19,650
Last year, a BPA-free bottle called "My Bottle" was all the rage.

454
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,350
Since it's not expensive, if we diversify the design, people can easily buy the same item several times.

455
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:28,040
So I came up with the idea of a unique water bottle to promote Goldline.

456
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,230
On the water bottle, we can put a romanized Goldline logo design

457
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,510
and use the gold coin symbol of the company as the lid.

458
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,180
So you're twisting off the gold coin to drink Goldline.

459
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:45,450
What do you think about creating an urban legend about people getting rich after drinking from the Goldline bottle?

460
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,820
Just like people say eating the sticky sweet rice cake will help you pass exams?

461
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:58,070
Well... the idea seems okay.

462
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,520
I present Lurie sunglasses!

463
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,760
Customer trust for the products is already solid.

464
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,390
They promised to give us 30% discounts, and as for certain overstocked items, up to 70% discounts.

465
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:38,620
- Next.
- Tents for camping and...

466
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,150
camp kitchen gear.

467
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:44,780
- Go back to your seat.
- A diet food package for the fattening season of autumn!

468
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,200
- Next.
- Discount coupons for nail shop services...

469
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,960
Next.
Goldline Bottle Project Idea

470
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:11,040
It's a Goldline bottle. It will become a product promoting Goldline's new beginning.

471
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,440
Hey, where did Bok Sil get all these top brand clothes?

472
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,890
- I asked where Bok Sil got all these top brand clothes?
- Huh?

473
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,190
The clothes! Where did she get them?

474
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:36,030
Oh, those... Her team leader from work gave them to her.

475
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,740
All these expensive items? Hey, is the team leader a man?

476
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,110
No, she said she is a woman.

477
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,080
If an angel is living in this world, I think maybe she's the one.

478
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,880
Fall Hot Item - Goldline Bottle

479
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,930
I made the company's symbol, gold coin, into the cap.

480
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,420
This can convey the interesting concept of drinking Goldline, after opening the gold coin,

481
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,980
and the water bottle will bring the drinkers money. I am getting it ready for sale with that concept.

482
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,060
Using the scant bottle design that's fashionable this year, Tritan for the material and steel for the cap.

483
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,620
I priced it at $4.90, the optimum price for online sales.

484
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,960
An exclusive item that will convey a sense of fun.

485
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,000
I expect it to contribute to and promote Goldline's launching of a social commerce site.

486
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,480
- How about the stocks? Are they secured?
- Of course.

487
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,780
I have secured suppliers so selling them on the hot-deal page right away will be no problem.

488
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,480
Okay, you did well.

489
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:34,560
- The director actually praised someone just now.
- Daebak!
- Applause, applause.

490
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:46,700
Bok Sil, you're next. Your turn.

491
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:51,120
Goldine Bottle Project Idea

492
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:54,690
Oh, what is this?

493
00:44:55,590 --> 00:45:00,050
Bok Sil helped me a lot with the Goldline bottle idea.

494
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,660
Thank you, Bok Sil.

495
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:16,400
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, Team Leader Baek.

496
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,260
Headquarters Director praised you. You must be so happy.

497
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,880
I'll say. How did you come up with such a brilliant idea?

498
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,510
It was nothing really. Don't praise me to the skies. Your items were really wonderful as well.

499
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,740
Today, everything is on me. So enjoy yourselves. Order more tapas.

500
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,800
You left this in the conference room.

501
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,510
Do you think I stole your item?

502
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,640
Is it why you've been wearing this expression since back then?

503
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,750
But I thanked you.

504
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:13,430
Shouldn't you say "sorry" rather than "thank you"?

505
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,590
Bok Sil, you must be laboring under a big delusion.

506
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:21,610
If you had kept the Goldline bottle in your hand,

507
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:25,550
do you think it could have been commercialized and introduced on the Hot Deal page this quickly?

508
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:31,120
It would have just remained on that piece of paper.

509
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:36,610
If I made a hot product, for all to see, out of an item that would have ended up in the trash can.

510
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:40,160
You should thank me instead, Bok Sil.

511
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,020
Cheers.

512
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,490
I got goosebumps watching you make your presentation, Manager.

513
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:54,460
- I'm going to go crazy.
- Seriously.
- Yours was okay, too. Wasn't his okay?

514
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,370
But that was not that great.

515
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,430
Why isn't Headquarters Director here yet?

516
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,680
Pardon me...

517
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,040
I will get going now. The buses are about to stop running.

518
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,750
- Get a cab, Bok Sil.
- It's okay.

519
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,830
- I feel more comfortable with buses.
- Okay, then.

520
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,640
I am sorry.

521
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,400
But let's go together...

522
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,050
I think the country chicken Go Bok Sil will get fired this month.

523
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,200
I know, right? We went easy on her because she was from the countryside.

524
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,260
What use is just pretending to work hard?

525
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,980
Let us not gossip about someone behind their back.

526
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,430
Team Leader Baek, you are so angelic that you're no fun.

527
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:47,730
Team Leader is nice to a fault. Let's drink to that.

528
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,720
Headquarters Director, right here!

529
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:58,670
- He's here, he's here.
- Welcome. Welcome.

530
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:02,200
Did Go Bok Sil leave early?

531
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,910
Have a cool glass...

532
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,810
Team Leader Baek says she's buying today.

533
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:44,280
Why should Team Leader Baek buy us alcohol? I will pick up the tab.

534
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,810
Oh, you're the best!

535
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:52,480
- Yes.
- Thank you. We'll enjoy the drinks.

536
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,690
About social commerce, lately, upgrades are made every two weeks or...

00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,280
Did you do well today?

♬ Where am I going ♬

543
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:18,030
What's wrong? Bok Sil, why are you like this? Did something happen to you?

544
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,870
Because I'm so happy.

545
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:27,780
♬ Past the countless stars ♬

546

What a timing for a love confession...

547
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:33,590
Do you like me that much? Enough to cry?

548
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:38,460
Don't overreact... Under the same sky, the fact that I have someone on my side...

549
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,380
That's what I'm happy about. That's what I'm saying.

552
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:58,850
Bok Sil... I'm really happy that you're by my side, too.

00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:05,700

558
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:38,390
- Hey! Why didn't you grab the laundry?
- Oh, scared me!

559
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,000
I forgot to take the laundry inside, because I was so worried you'd be walking in rain.

560
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:52,080
Geez, how could you forget? You! Come over here! Geez!

561
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,340
Stop!

562
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:57,590
Those guys... What the heck are they doing on a rainy night? So annoying.

563
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,160
Hey! Are you having a lovers' quarrel?

564
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,120
Hey, do you know how hard it is to do laundry without a washer?

565
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,910
Stop nagging, Bok Sil!

566
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:09,930
I'll buy you one when I make money! Trust me!

567
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,950
He doesn't even have any money, geesh...

568
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:16,230
Louis! Stop lying, man!

569
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:19,440
Are they asking for it or what?

570
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,500
At least a terminally ill star

571
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,610
Shut up!

572
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,340
Okay.

573
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:35,030
Hey, what's this?

574
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,970
We're all wet.

575
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,440
What are you doing?

576
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,610
You woke up. These are wet. Wait just a minute.

577
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,420
I'll take a look, okay?

578
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,870
Good morning!

579
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,730
Oh, hello.

580
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,200
What's this?

581
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,590
What is it? What is it?

582
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,060
They're so pretty!

583
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,850
Did Team Leader Baek give you these, too?

584
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:04,460
She said thanks at that presentation. Did she prepare a gift, too?

585
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,550
- Try them on.
- Oh, no.

586
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,370
Try them on! I want to see.

587
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,170
Try them on! Omo, omo...

588
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,620
Where is she going?

589
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,490
She wants to try them on alone.

Director.

593
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:32,300
By chance... Were you about to throw them away?

594
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,920
Ah...

595
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,080
No...

596
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:42,220
Just... I was confused as to whether I should accept such a kind gesture or not.

597
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,310
I'm afraid that my heart will ache again.

598
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:17,410
Go Bok Sil. Backstabbing kind isn't the only kind of good will existing in this world.

599
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:22,050
There is also a beautiful kind of good will that cheers you on with sincerity.

600
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:28,220
Those are kind acts coming from me. So, put those on and work really hard. Understand?

00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:53,250
Shopping King Louis?

629
00:57:54,530 --> 00:58:02,020
"... while seating (misspelled)"... "try diveloping"... Could it be the young master?

630
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,310
Bok Sil, what's wrong?

631
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:32,500
Bok Sil. Are you sick?

632
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,620
Hyung! Hyung!

633
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,350
Geez, you'll break the door down.

634
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:49,760
Bok Sil is sick. She has high fever and is limp and can't talk.

635
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,160
Go to the convenience store and get something to lower her fever and treat a cold. Hurry! Hurry!

636
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,970
You haven't gone to work yet and you're making porridge?

637
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:11,960
I work in the afternoon today. Hey, did Bok Sil's fever come down?

638
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,040
What? Are you making porridge for sick Bok Sil?

639
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:21,520
What in the world... Did the sun rise from the west? I don't think so.

640
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,340
Geez... People feel the most vulnerable when they're sick.

641
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:31,490
That Louis... He's nothing but a pretty face. You think he'd feed her?

642
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:37,000
True. Louis is 100% the type of guy who'd wake up sick Bok Sil to have her cook for him.

643
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,040
Oh, worthless...

644
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,330
Gosh... Such an annoying style...

645
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:47,640
It's not like we can send him away to an orphanage or something...

646
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:53,280
Bok Sil! Bok Sil!

647
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,180
What the heck? Hey, Hey! Wake up.

648
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:05,170
Did Bok Sil go to work?

649
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:13,530
After all... Bok Sil is 100% the type who'd drag her sick body to work. Yup.

650
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:17,380
But what do I do with this?

651
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:29,470
The DNA test you ordered between the blood on the watch and the tooth came out not a match.

652
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:40,000
GOLDLINE

653
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,690
President, the person who died during the accident...

654
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,970
is not Louis.

655
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:54,700
Wh... What?

656
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:31,000
♬ I will explode in a few seconds, You can't stop me, The broken timer switch ♬

657
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,930
Hello.
♬  I can't stop it anymore  ♬

658
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,400
♬  From within your time and space the dynamite which has been ignited ♬
