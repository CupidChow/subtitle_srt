00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,640
I don't want to hide my feelings for you.

3
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,930
Bok Sil.

4
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,630
I really like you a lot.

5
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,820
Whenever I think about you, for some odd reason, I get butterflies.

♬ I don't recall ♬

7
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,370

♬ Shall we leave the traces  ♬

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,410
Louie asked me how much I liked him.

Episode 10
This Moonlight that Reflects My Heart

12
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,710
I like Bok Sil.

13
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,720
You liked me a lot in France.

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,960
What? I liked you?

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,220
You don't seem like my type though.

16
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,960
You used to follow me around everywhere.

17
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,130
Did I have a lot of friends?

18
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,770
Not really...

19
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,310
Why not? I feel like I would've been really popular.

20
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,820
It wasn't your fault, but the environment's fault.

21
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,390
Shall we call you the icon of overprotectiveness? At any rate, that's how it was.

22
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,250
What was I best at?

23
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,310
Is that even a question? Shopping, of course.

24
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,520
Don't you remember? Your nickname was Shopping King Louis.

25
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,410
I don't remember.

26
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,830
But the hyung living downstairs nicknamed me Shopping King Louis.

27
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,140
Gobosi... I remember Gobosi, though.

28
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,010
You cherished him a lot and he is the first thing you remember.

29
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,040
Where is he now?

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,480
We buried him at Chateau Bourron-Marlotte four years ago. Don't you remember?

31
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,950
So he died...

32
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,260
From a dog's perspective, he lived a long life.

33
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,250
You also gave him lots of love.

34
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,410
Gobosi...

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,420
Perhaps, do you remember your treasure chest as well?

36
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,240
You used to cherish it when you were young.

37
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,640
Treasure chest?

38
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,080
Is it something important?

39
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,450
If you remember, you need to tell me first. You must.

40
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,290
Okay.

41
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,060
It's late now. You should go to sleep.

42
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,910
Butler Kim.

43
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:40,900
You said the car I drove was in an accident and completely burned up, right?

44
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:53,000
Then... That means there was someone who died instead of me.

45
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,380
Detective, where was Bok Nam and what was he doing all this time?

46
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,900
No, no. Don't tell me.

47
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,160
I'm going to hear it straight from his mouth and break his legs.

48
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,170
This punk, just wait until I see you. I'm going to give you at least 100 back slaps.

49
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,230
Did he tell you whether he's been eating well all this time?

50
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,580
His face didn't look gaunt or anything?

51
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,520
I can see him myself in a little bit.

52
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,150
Detective, how far are we going?

53
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,150
Bok Sil.

54
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,450
Listen to what I'm about to say with a strong heart.

55
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,390
Bok Nam...

56
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,500
Bok Nam is dead.

57
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,740
The person who died in the car crash in place of Louis was Bok Nam.

58
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,320
Bok Nam...

59
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,800
My little brother Bok Nam...

60
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,070
Do you know how much I wished to find you?

61
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,120
Don't you know how much I missed you?

62
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,960
Bok Nam, Noona will never scold you.

63
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,930
I won't ever hit you.

64
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,490
So, please just return to me.

65
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,890
Please...

66
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,660
Eat warm rice that Noona will make for you.

67
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,220
You should let Noona baby you.

68
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:08,650
What were you doing, so long buried alone in the cold ground?

69
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,360
Bok Nam...

70
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,890
Kang Ji Sung
1992-2016

71
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,780
Big news! Big news! Big news!

72
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,800
Don't get too surprised. Well ...

73
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,730
Chairwoman's grandson is alive.

74
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,730
What?

75
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,020
Does that even make any sense?

76
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,930
Grandson? He died in an accident a while ago.

77
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,330
No matter what the back story is, there is even a rumor that he will participate in the company management soon.

78
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,150
I am so curious about that grandson.

79
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,890
You all probably know him as well.

80
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,560
- What?
- We've seen him before?

81
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,890
- Who?
- Who is it?

82
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,790
It can't be Wang Louis.

83
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,030
Wishful thinking on your part because you got five stars from him, really.

84
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,030
Who is it?

85
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,050
What brings you here, all of a sudden, like this?

86
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,480
I have something I'm curious about.

87
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,060
About what?

88
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,260
When you saw me in the lobby, why did you act like you didn't know me?

89
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,980
The day I came to deliver porridge, you saw me. I even greeted you.

90
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,090
Hello.

91
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,890
Ji Sung.

92
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,380
You were already a dead person. We had even held your funeral.

93
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,360
That's why I obviously thought I saw someone that looked like you.

94
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,590
Still, just in case, I took the leading part in looking for you and discovering you.

95
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,060
The person who brought you back to Gold Group, when you were living like a beggar, was none other than myself.

96
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,820
Do you understand?

97
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,530
Yes. Thank you.

98
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:59,240
But I... didn't live like a beggar.

99
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,370
Really? Then that's a relief.

100
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,320
You came, Ma Ri.

101
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,460
You...

102
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,340
Ji Sung...

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,330
3... 2... 1... On cue

104
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,720
Are you really Ji Sung?

105
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,470
What's with you?

106
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't believe you're alive.

107
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,020
Do you know how much I cried when you died?

108
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,720
I should've saved my tears in a bottle.

109
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,460
Then I could've shown you my feelings for you.

110
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,400
Were we really close?

111
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,990
Of course. You two were the closest childhood friends.

112
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,610
- It's mine!
- It's mine!

113
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,080
I said it's mine!

114
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,640
So close that I thought you two would marry.

115
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,950
My dad's a president!

116
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,440
My grandmother's a chairman!

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,300
You don't have a mom, right? I do.

118
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,120
Mom!

119
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,760
I heard that you lost your memory.

120
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,580
To be honest, we were more than friends.

121
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,010
What?

122
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,810
Do you know how shocked I was to run into you in the street, after losing you and having such a hard time?

123
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,270
But you just hung up on me, so I was really dismayed.

124
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,130
This may be impolite, but may I see you tomorrow?

125
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:47,090
Do you miss me that much? It's your freedom to like me, but I don't like you.

126
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,430
I'm not in a good mood, so don't call me.

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,970
Right? I did do that.

128
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,820
I... let Dad know right away and did my part in finding you.

129
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,060
In any case, thanks.

130
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,030
But I like Bok Sil now, so don't act like we're close.

131
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,420
And don't talk about weird things, like how we were more than friends.

132
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,310
Okay...

133
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,140
Do you have Maxim Gold?

134
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,800
Huh?

135
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,350
What gold? Oh, sure, sure.

136
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,960
Can you appraise this?

137
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,390
Ahjumma, where in the world would there be anyone with a diamond on his undershorts? It's probably a cubic zirconia.

138
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,590
Tell me after you take a look at them. Do you know what kind of underwear this is?

139
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,440
- It's Gold Group's—
- Shhh!

140
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,170
Look at this.

141
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,930
What is this?

142
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,020
It's real!

143
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,390
- No, I mean.. Then...
- How much is it?

144
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,270
But how did you handle this that there are so many scratches?

145
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,490
There are feathers inside, too. Do you have the diamond certificate?

146
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,860
No.

147
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,710
Then you won't be able to get much for it.

148
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,160
I'll give you 1,000,000 Won ($1000) for it.

149
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,540
What?!

150
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,230
- In Seong.
- Huh?

151
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,720
Are you sure there were two of them?

152
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,730
Of course. There should be two of them. It's strange to have just one.

153
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,870
Let's try and find it.

154
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,440
What is this?

155
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,530
- Why? What? What is it?
- Take a look.

156
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,530
Oh!

157
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,500
Ruby! WOAH!

158
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,710
Wait, but this seems familiar?

159
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,960
You've seen it?

160
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,630
- Ey!
- It's not here, it's not here.

161
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,710
- Go look in the washing machine.
- Yeah, I will.

162
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,990
How would we or Bok Sil have known it was a diamond?

163
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,260
Oh, what a waste. I can die it's such a waste.

164
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,370
The person who died instead of Louis was Bok Nam.

165
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,750
How long are going to keep looking after him?

166
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,450
Until I find Bok Nam.

167
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,280
What if you don't find your brother?

168
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,610
Why are you saying something so scary?!

169
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,410
What in the world have I said to her?

170
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,760
Headquarters Director!

171
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,700
Hello.

172
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,510
What is this?

173
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,350
Did you just speak formally to me?

174
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,530
I've heard that you will get your business administration training soon. Have you already started?

175
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,470
Back to informal, I see.

176
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,100
Well, do whatever makes you feel comfortable. Bok Sil is inside, right?

177
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,820
Wait.

178
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,160
She's away on a business trip, so don't look for her.

179
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,040
- Eh?
- Don't call her or text her either.

180
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,900
Why not?

181
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,730
Louis, do you remember what I told you before?

182
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,240
Knowing how to hide your own pain, lest the other person might worry, that is being an adult.

183
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,200
Knowing how to hold back and not to ask the question that is burning you up for the other person's sake. That, too, is being an adult.

184
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,280
Before the car accident, Bok Nan stole Louis' clothes and car.

185
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,440
It seems that when Bok Nam came to Seoul, he started getting involved with this bad gang.

186
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,020
But he really was unlucky.

187
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:09,590
The car exploded and burned his body.

188
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,970
Why did you do that, Bok Nam?

189
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,600
Why did you?

190
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,900
Go Bok Sil. This is Gold Group's chairperson.

191
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,260
Hello.

192
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,060
Agasshi. I'm sorry to disturb you but excuse me for a bit.

193
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,850
Did your grandson go somewhere?

194
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:07,350
I sent him far away to live a long happy life...

195
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,270
but he really did go far away.

196
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,700
Are you that Dongbaek Island girl?

197
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,620
Grandmother!

198
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:27,100
The friend you were talking about happened to be my Louis. What kind of fate is this?

199
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,170
Aigoo. Thank you.

200
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,450
Thank you so much for taking care of my Louis.

201
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,410
It's nothing.

202
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:42,630
If only Bok Nam hadn't done something so bad then Louis wouldn't have even had to go through this.

203
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,680
I am sorry.

204
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,070
Your younger brother died... What do you have to be sorry for?

205
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,920
- Grandmother...
- Yes?

206
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,680
To be honest, my heart hurts so much right now.

207
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,720
My one and only younger brother died, but

208
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,900
it's so bad that I'm in a position where the first thing I have to say is I'm sorry.

209
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,790
Bok Nam was really a nice kid. He really was.

210
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:32,130
No one knows better than I do the grief of losing your own flesh and blood.

211
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,240
First of all, don't think of anything else and just cry,

212
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:44,810
because regardless of the reason that it happened, there is no sadness in the world which is as great.

213
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,280
Grandmother...

214
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,070
That's right, that's right.

215
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,290
Agassi, don't hear what I am saying as harsh.

216
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:26,940
Being with Louis can be a big suffering for both of you.

217
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,970
You'll think of your brother when you see Louis and cry.

218
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:37,320
And Louis will feel sorry for you when he sees you and cry.

219
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,760
Nothing gnaws at the heart more than spending time together with someone

220
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,060
who the very sight of gives you pain and (the sight) of you hurts that person.

221
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,150
Do you understand what I am trying to say to you?

222
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,420
I know exactly how you feel, Grandmother.

223
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,400
I've been very happy thanks to Louis.

224
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:12,020
I didn't even know that my brother had died and I was too happy.

225
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,460
You're home? I heard Louis was at the company today.

226
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,640
I haven't had dinner so make me some food.

227
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,830
I am going to marry Ma Ri off to Louis so I just wanted you to know.

228
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,240
- Marriage?
- They have to get married sooner or later, it would be good if the two would get married to each other.

229
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,020
Hurry up and arrange it so we can do it while Mother is still alive.

230
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,120
No, don't do anything.

231
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,580
From now on, you are not to do anything. Absolutely nothing.

232
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,600
Honey!

233
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,780
Thank you, Ahjumma Geum Ja. I'm going back to my hometown.

234
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,490
Please keep this a secret from Louis.

235
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:30,750
Letter of Resignation

236
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:38,600
♬ heartlessly flows by in the night sky ♬

237
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,650
The director is someone to whom I am grateful to for recognizing I had talent for the first time.

238
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,580
I will never forget you. I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye before I left.

239
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:56,330
♬ When I walk on the cold street ♬

240
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,620
♬ The day which was warm... ♬

241
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,110
The very first desk I've had since I was born.

242
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,100
♬ enfolds and permeates ♬

243
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,280
Goodbye.

244
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,720
♬  You ♬

245
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:24,570
Goldline, which gave me the first paycheck I've ever received in my life... You, too, goodbye.

246
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,700
♬ I am not looking at you  ♬

247
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,090
Bok Sil: I'm going away for a while. Don't look for me and stay well.

248
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:41,110
♬ who are going far away ♬

249
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,350
♬ I feel empty ♬

250
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,480
Louis...

251
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,060
Good bye.

252
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,660
♬ The fragrance which is blowing in the wind ♬

253
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:14,300
♬ almost seems to be you ♬

254
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,440
The customer is not answering the phone. You will be connected to voicemail.

255
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,510
Please leave your message at the sound of the beep.

256
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,270
Go Bok Sil ... Where have you disappeared to?

257
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,530
Young Master, don't you have any appetite?

258
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,650
Bok Sil dumped me to go on a trip alone.

259
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,840
I have no appetite and

260
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,280
I just miss Bok Sil.

261
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,830
The beggar she took in and lived with

262
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,540
one day suddenly became the heir of the great Gold Group.

263
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,760
If so, then what girl wouldn't be surprised?

264
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,580
What an emotional burden for Bok Sil to bear,

265
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,240
even if she doesn't express it.

266
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,070
- Of course.
- Yes.

267
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,030
So what I'm saying is our young master should allow Miss Bok Sil

268
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,500
some time for thinking, for absorbing it, or something like that.

269
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,110
Bok Sil.

270
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,090
Let's just have one spoonful.

271
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,500
Wouldn't Bok Sil hate to see me like this?

272
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,410
Right!

273
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,710
That's great!

274
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,820
Audrey, your house is so nice.

275
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,050
Don't say, are you by any chance a chaebol madam or some such thing?

276
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,970
My husband is the president of Gold Group.

277
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,440
My goodness... But what kind of fate is this?

278
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,980
My son is the headquarters director for Goldline.com.

279
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,740
Goodness! Was Director Cha your son, Vivian?

280
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,450
My daughter is the team leader of the product planning department for Goldline.com.

281
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,770
I got my MBA from Harvard and

282
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,130
I was lucky to join Goldline shortly afterwards.

283
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,160
Is her name Baek Ma Ri?

284
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,100
Do you know our Ma Ri?

285
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,970
Oh My God!

286
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:48,030
Well, my husband said Louis should marry Ma Ri, but

287
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,820
I would like Ma Ri to marry someone she likes.

288
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,540
So, is that my son Joong Won?

289
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,970
Yes.

290
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,630
Then we can just let the two get married.

291
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,540
Oh, you said President Baek keeps looking down on you?

292
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,740
What seems to be the reason?

293
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,670
How did the detective know to look and come to your bookstore?

294
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,040
That ... I have no idea.

295
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,720
But that's the most important thing. What did you ask him, if not that question?

296
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,930
From that day on, he seems to be looking down on me.

297
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,250
I will resolve it for you!

298
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,240
How?

299
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,740
We can go and ask the detective directly. What's the big deal?

300
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,070
Go and pack some food. A ten-layer lunch box, full of food. Hurry. Go. Go.

301
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,150
Yes.

302
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,780
One two! One two!

303
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,490
Oh my G.O.D! My son!

304
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,080
Thank you, we'll enjoy the food!

305
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,180
- Delicious.
- Thank you.

306
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,080
There is even an ajumma fan club. Damn, I envy you.

307
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,340
What fan club ...

308
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,980
Ewww! So gross!

309
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,150
So beautiful. How could he be so handsome?

310
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,750
I really enjoyed it. But, why did you come with box lunches?

311
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,670
That is ...

312
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,740
Hurry up and ask!

313
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,610
Because we are grateful that you found our Louis,

314
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,890
I came to show my thanks.

315
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:57,440
But, that... How did you know to come to my bookstore?

316
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,100
Oh, Gold Department Store's

317
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,250
30th anniversary music box was written down in Louis's notebook of memories.

318
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,160
Just then, my colleague said that

319
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,370
he remembered seeing the music box at your bookstore, Miss Jae Sook.

320
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,980
Jae Sook. Jae Sook

321
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,280
Jae Sook. Jae Sook

322
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,440
Are you okay?

323
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,340
What? Oh ... yes ...

324
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,680
Of course, we just did our job but

325
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,980
you prepared even the lunch boxes for us. Thank you.

326
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,470
In exchange, if your bookstore ever needs my help, please call me.

327
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,780
I will do my best to help.

328
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,670
Mrs. Hwang Geum Ja, please move out of the way.

329
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,630
Move both of your butt cheeks out of the way, please.

330
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,180
Jeez. Please get over there.

331
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,240
Why did Bok Sil

332
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,410
have to crawl back onto that mountain which doesn't even have running electricity?

333
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,570
But why did she tell us not to tell Louis?

334
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,740
No matter how much I think about it, it is strange, huh?

335
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,980
When all she has to do now is walk the rosy path in front of her, why is she digging herself a hole?

336
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,980
Is Bok Sil your daughter?

337
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,480
You shouldn't be more concerned about her than your own son.

338
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,380
Bok Sil is ten thousand times better than you.

339
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:33,110
♬ I lost the way Far Away Far Away ♬

340
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:41,730

346
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,310
Why is this open?
♬ Fly away. ♬

347
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,680
Has someone been here?

348
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,830
♬ The space where memories fell asleep Your Space ♬

349

352
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,610
... is not answering. You will be connected with voice mail ...

353
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,810
Why isn't Bok Sil answering?

354
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,780
Isn't her trip too long?

355
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,930
Did something happen?

356
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:10,010
Young Maser, please eat something first ... You haven't had anything today.

357
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,420
Is food important now?

358
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,990
Then, please go to bed.

359
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,820
You haven't slept a moment this weekend.

360
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,890
Is sleep what's important now!

361
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,250
Why isn't Bok Sil answering ...

362
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:39,470
♬ It will explode in a few seconds. You can't stop me. Broken timer switch. ♬

363
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,920
♬ is running toward zero ♬

364
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,900
When have you ever been so fast?

365
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,160
Wait for me, Young Master!

366
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,060
♫  On the day I fought the sudden piercing shower  ♫

367
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,600
♬ I was trapped in cold air ♬

368
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,980
♬ What made me soar above was  ♬

369
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,100

00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:12,230
♬ My heart burning white hot white hot like a fire, fire ♬

♬  As if to melt passionately my love, Heart is a Time Bomb  ♬

373
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,270
You know, don't you?
♬ The sky's color is a dark red, dark red  ♬

374
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,610
Hurry and tell me where Bok Sil is! Quickly!
♬Like a fire.♬

375
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,110
Bok Sil told me not to tell you.
♬ The wait is over. ♬

376
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,240
Hurry!

377
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,420
♬  Don't gaze at me long. ♬

378
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,640
Young Master!

379
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,990
♬  Because my wings  ♬

380
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,830
♬  are shabby.  ♬

381
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,940
No! You can never drive!
♬ Yes I am Tiger Moth. ♬

382
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,790
I have to go to Gangwon Province. Bok Sil is there.

383
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,310
Young Master!
♬ Yes I am Tiger Moth. ♬

384
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:56,640
There is no way Bok Sil left me. Something has happened to her, for sure.

385
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,230
I will take you there. You don't even know the roads.

386
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,440
♬  Yes, I am a tiger moth.  ♬

387
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,900
♬  Yes, I am a tiger moth.  ♬

388
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:12,170
♬  I will live like the flame.  ♬

389
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,080
Headquarters Director?

390
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,830
But, how did you find this place...

391
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,880
I'm here to buy wild ginseng.

392
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,170
How much is everything in that backpack of yours?

393
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,470
But why would you insist on coming all this way to buy ginseng?

394
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,470
Have you forgotten I am the wild ginseng benefactor?

395
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:54,270
First, give me some food. I skipped lunch and I'm hungry. Hurry!

396
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,170
I don't have much to give you because there are no side dishes.

397
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,250
Why won't you eat?

398
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,570
I'm fine. Eat up.

399
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,140
I'm only going to eat if you're eating.

400
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,300
I'm going to starve to death here. Hurry up and bring your bowl, so I can eat!

401
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,580
But why did you really come all this way?

402
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,640
To see you eat. To keep tabs on whether you're eating well.

403
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,460
I've heard from Detective Nam.

404
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,840
Even if you're sad or suffering, you must eat.

405
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,790
That's right! You're doing a good job.

406
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,120
Eat a lot. Here...

407
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,800
Eat and cheer up, Go Bok Sil!

408
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,270
Thank you, Director.

409
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,310
Now, I'm getting some appetite.

410
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,100
Why does this doenjang jjigae taste so good?

411
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,950
Is it because the soybean paste was made well?

412
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,190
Aigoo...

413
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,230
The pepper is very fresh...it!

414
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,160
Director, I will do it. Sit over there and rest.

415
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,520
It's okay. I'm going to do it. You rest.

416
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,530
I'll do it.

417
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,710
I will do it!

418
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,190
I will see if there are extra pants.

419
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,410
Give me a fashionable pair with a cool design.

420
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,550
You're cool wearing even these.

421
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,400
Are you teasing me?

422
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,200
Step back. I will do it.

423
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,040
Headquarters Director!

424
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,640
Why is this thing so flimsy? Does water only come out of this?

425
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,840
You can use tap water from the kitchen.

426
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,810
You have to fetch water from the creek.

427
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,610
How is that a creek... It's practically a river...

428
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,160
I am going to go crazy!

429
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,380
Am I a Cinderella?

430
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,680
Are you done fetching water?

431
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,590
Of course.

432
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,490
You spilled all the water on the ground.

433
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:20,300
This axe is completely dull.

434
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,800
This is not done with physical force, but with know-how.

435
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,770
I don't know, I don't care.

436
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,190
Go Bok Sil, are you, by any chance, trying to lecture to me here?

437
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,820
Director, what on earth are you good at, anyway?

438
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,790
You... you... Are you scolding me right now?

439
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:41,700
No... it's just that...

440
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,980
you are such a poor worker.

441
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,620
I was a good student, an excellent one!

442
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,210
I guess you've forgotten who I am, but to introduce myself, I am the best merchandising director in this country

443
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,990
and reputed in the distribution field to have the Midas touch, with which I have created more than 100 "national" products!

444
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,510
Aren't you ashamed to toot your own horn?

445
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,640
I'm not ashamed, I am not!

446
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:07,060
When I look at you, you and Louis have a lot of commonalities.

447
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,920
What? Louis?

448
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,160
Umm, what more do you want me to do?

449
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,120
What do you need me to do?

450
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,040
Please peel the rest.

451
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,380
Why on earth did Bok Sil resign all of a sudden?

452
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,860
And why did the director take today off?

453
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,470
The designer brand Bok Sil was in charge of during the past Black Friday sale period,

454
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,210
Ferrigato Cozi's discount rates were suddenly changed.

455
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,700
So the customers are flooding the site and causing an uproar right now.

456
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,880
Are you saying she quit because of that? Because she didn't want to take responsibility?

457
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,570
Team Leader, isn't this as good as pulling a fast one?

458
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,370
I-I know, right?

459
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,900
Bok Sil is not a person who'd do that...

460
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,310
Anyway, we have to clean up after her.

461
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,450
Of all times, when even the director is not here.

462
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,620
It's my fault for having trusted Bok Sil and delegated the job to her.

463
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:21,890
For now, our company and the brand have decided to share the burden 50-50 and compensate the customers.

464
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:26,350
So contact the brand and get a list of the purchasers and amounts they spent.

465
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,100
Aish, Go Bok Sil...

466
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,630
why are you making me feel so uneasy?

467
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,120
So annoying, really...

468
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,750
Hello-lo-lo.

469
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,850
- Hi.
- Hi.

470
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,040
What brings you here, Team Leader?

471
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,390
Are you here, by any chance, to see Bok Sil, too?

472
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:25,160
Did anybody else come?

473
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,240
Jo In Seong, where is Go Bok Sil?

474
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,950
Tell me quickly where Bok Sil is, hurry!

475
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,080
But Bok Sil told me not to tell anyone, really...

476
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,970
If you keep insisting, I will become a blabbermouth.

477
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,820
It's because I have something to give to her.

478
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,710
In that case... would you like to go together?

479
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:49,120
It's because I'm curious how Bok Sil is doing myself.

480
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,420
Well, if you want to...

481
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,900
- Huh?
- Huh?

482
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,170
- Why?
- What?

483
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,960
I don't have a driver's license.

484
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,980
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

485
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,280
Go, go!

486
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,570
Aigoo, how do you get this to light up?

487
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,620
Aigoo, what do I have to do to get this fire going?

488
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,740
Headquarters Director!

489
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,490
What are you doing, not blowing together?

490
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,050
Yeah...

491
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,020
It worked!

492
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,530
You did well.

493
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,260
Stop!

494
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,210
Enough.

495
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,680
Louis...

496
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,010
Are you okay?

497
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,770
Why did you hit me?!

498
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,190
Just because, I got so mad.

499
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:00,480
If you're sorry, you shouldn't have hit me. If you hit me, you shouldn't say sorry.

500
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,910
I am sorry.

501
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,480
I continue to be angry... Anger... I'm sorry.

502
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,180
You said you were going on a trip, but how could you resign and come here

503
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,880
without telling me?

504
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,010
Sorry.

505
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:24,830
Do you know how much I missed you? I missed you so much that I couldn't even sleep.

506
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,490
Aren't you hungry?

507
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,840
A little.

508
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,930
Then, let's cook a meal together.

509
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,310
Bok Sil, you have to tell me later, okay?

510
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,280
Come in here.

511
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,450
How can Bok Sil live here?

512
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,660
Even cooking a meal takes a long time.

513
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,640
Sleep here tonight and let's go back to Seoul tomorrow.

514
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,940
I don't want to. I will take Bok Sil with me.

515
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,000
If you stay by Go Bok Sil's side, it will be very hard for her.

516
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,750
Are you afraid that I am going to slave-drive her?

517
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:23,310
I'm not going to bother Bok Sil, so don't worry.

518
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,140
I'm a bit hungry. Can't we stop by somewhere to eat?

519
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,370
- Well, if you want to...
- Yes.

520
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:43,760
- Ah, how about that place? You can park over there.
- Yes.

521
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,630
Turn on your signal, that's right...

522
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,530
Atta girl, doing so well...

523
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,150
So yummy...

524
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,540
You eat so well. It's delicious, isn't it?

525
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,040
Do you want to order one more portion for each?

526
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,400
I ate well.

527
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,100
Ah, so full...

528
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,810
Since we've got a long way to go, should we be on our way?

529
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,750
Yes.

530
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,550
- Here.
- Huh?

531
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,850
- What?
- Why?

532
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,890
- What?
- I mean...

533
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,680
Oh, I have no money.

534
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,380
Thank you for the meal.

535
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,140
- Butler Heo!
- Yes!

536
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:55,020
Where are Louis and Butler Kim?

537
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,160
They left a while ago, saying they were going to the company.

538
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,950
They were not at the company.

539
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,710
No way...

540
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:07,480
Jeong Ran, go find Louis right now. Hurry.

541
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,180
Yes! These kids, I'll just...

542
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,370
Did I eat too much? I'm getting a signal.

543
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,880
- Miss Ma Ri?
- Yes?

544
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,850
Can't you stop the car just for a second?

545
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,160
What?

546
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,900
All of a sudden, I have this urgent business to take care of.

547
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,180
What business?

548
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,100
Restroom, I mean. Hurry.

549
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,830
But it's hard to pull over here. Just look.

550
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:00,700
Then, take the next exit no matter what.

551
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,530
It's because this is an emergency.

552
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,260
This is my first time driving on this kind of road.

553
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,350
I'm gradually losing control.

554
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,570
Ah, o-o-over there!

555
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,140
Move into the right lane, hurry!

556
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,890
Right lane, you must take the exit, without fail.

557
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:29,260
Aish, what do I do?!

558
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,800
What do I do? Quickly...

559
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,600
What do you want me to do anyway?

560
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,470
If you keep doing this, I... really

561
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:39,220
might do something right here that I'll be sorry to you for.

562
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:42,950
Can you stop anywhere, anywhere...

563
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,710
Anywhere? Where?

564
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,560
- Aigoo, stop anywhere...
- Where?

565
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,160
Anywhere, anywhere!

566
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,040
Hold it in, okay? Hold it in no matter what!

567
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,830
I, what do I do, ahh!!! Dear Father, Father!!!

568
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:58,100
Aigoo, Father!

569
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,010
What do we do?

570
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:34,630
I'm going to sleep here, next to you, today.

571
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,140
I gave you a blanket. Go over to the other room and sleep there.

572
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,880
I don't want to! I'll sleep here.

573
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,110
You! Come out here.

574
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,160
Why?

575
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,150
A bit above that spot.

576
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,210
- Here?
- Yes, there.

577
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:21,610
Since I worked all day long, my body aches all over.

578
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:26,660
You mistreated me before, but you're in the same shoes now.

579
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,070
How dare you compare me to the likes of you?!

580
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:39,090
- Ahhh!!! Spider, spider, spider!!!
- Aish!!!

581
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,970
Miss Jeong Ran!

582
00:47:55,590 --> 00:48:00,050
Who do we have here? Kim Ho Joon, you're dead meat.

583
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:04,650
How dare you! Not answer my phone call all day long?!

584
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,350
I-I apologize.

585
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:11,190
Do you know how much... I worried about you?

586
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,270
Where is Chairwoman's precious gem?

587
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,900
I'm asking where Young Master is?!

588
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,890
Is he over there?

589
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,430
So he's over there.

590
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,910
Hey!!!

591
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,910
Miss Jeong Ran, let's just leave Young Master Louis be for today.

592
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:42,160
Let's leave him be with Bok Sil, just once, since he misses her so much.

593
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,950
Why don't you let me go first...

594
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,460
I don't want to. What is there to life, anyway?

595
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,620
I, too, will stay with you like this, Miss Jeong Ran!

596
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,730
Come here.

597
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,420
Come here.

598
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,250
The Road Ends Here

599
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,050
Louis...

600
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,750
Yes.

601
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,230
Sometimes, a person wants to look after her

602
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:52,950
exhausted self and recover strength in a lair of her own.

603
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:57,340
Even if you lost your memory, you know what that feels like, right?

604
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,200
Of course.

605
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,520
That kind of feeling... is very familiar to me.

606
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:10,420
Go Bok Sil is undergoing such a tough period right now.

607
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:15,420
So, let's give her some time.

608
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,590
Is it, by any chance, because I'm the Gold Group heir?

609
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,210
That can't be.

610
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:38,140
Bok Sil... After spending all her alone time, she is coming back to me, right?

611
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,950
Why aren't you answering me?

612
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,510
Hurry up and sleep.

613
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,990
Why don't you go to sleep...

614
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:59,440
I can't sleep at a new place.

615
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,440
Probably, I think tonight, too, will be sleepless.

616
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:11,200
So, you're such a sensitive type. You do look sensitive, though.

617
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,970
You sure are sensitive.

618
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:25,270
By the way, that spider from earlier... isn't coming down this way...

619
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:30,170
Hahhhh!!!! It's gone!!!

620
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,940
It's disappeared!!!

621
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,380
Ma Ri, Ma Ri, what's wrong?

622
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,470
Did something happen?

623
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,210
Mom!

624
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:51,960
I've... never met a man like this before in my life.

625
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,280
Who? Director Cha?

626
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,730
No...

627
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:01,410
Then, who? What kind of man is he, to put you in this state?

628
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:06,850
That man... In my car...

629
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,680
In my car...

630
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,150
What in your car? What did he do?

631
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:14,890
Mom!!!

632
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:24,100
Go to bed already.

633
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,720
Yes.

634
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,940
Mom.

635
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,770
Why?

636
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,980
Nothing.

637
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,620
Is something worrying you?

638
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,660
No.

639
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,200
Mom, I...

640
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,040
Even when I think about it myself...

641
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:06,540
♬ Won't I do, in this life  ♬
(Memories of Bali, Jo In Seong parody)

642
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,680
I think I'm too dirty.
♬  In the next life, will I be good enough? ♬

643
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,420
You realized it just now?

644
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,700
Enough with these wacky comments. Just go to sleep already.

645
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,490
♬  If you promise me, even if today is the last day of the world, I won't be afraid. ♬

646
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:21,110
- In Seong.
- Huh?

647
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:25,570
But hasn't it been smelling like poop in here for a while now?

648
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:30,410
♬  In the next life, will I be good enough? ♬

649
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:33,570
♬  If you promise me, even if today is the last day of the world, I won't be afraid. ♬

650
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:36,720
Why would it smell like poop?

651
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,800
No, it doesn't smell like that.

652
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,670
♬ I can't give you up. My Love. ♬

653
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:56,410
Being with Louis can be a huge suffering for both you and Louis.

654
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:05,980
Nothing gnaws on you like spending time with someone who the very sight of gives you pain and (the sight) of you hurts that person.

655
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:11,080
♬ Can it end someday? ♬

656
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:18,380
♬ The wound of the long long tears ♬

657
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:24,060
♬ I don't have the heart to  go by.  In the night sky ♬

658
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,420
Did you sleep well?

659
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,250
No.

660
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,880
Why not?

661
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,770
Because I was noisy last night?

662
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,370
No, because my heart was noisy.

663
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:42,840
♬ When I walk on the cold street ♬

664
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,920
Louis.

665
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,850
♬ The day which was warm  ♬

666
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:50,030
Please disappear from before my eyes.

667
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:54,510
♬  enfolds and permeates ♬

668
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:56,880
Bok Sil...

669
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,730
I...

670
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,580
dislike you so much.

671
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:06,520
I don't like seeing your face, hearing your voice.

672
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,300
I just don't like you next to me.

673
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,570
♬ It hurts to see you from behind like this ♬

674
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,000
Bok Sil...

675
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:19,040
Why are you doing this to me?

676
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,810
Don't ever come find me again.

677
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:28,590
♬ I am not looking at you who are going far away ♬

678
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,130
No!

679
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,340
I

680
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:38,980
like you so much, Bok Sil,

681
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,680
so I want to see you, hear your voice every day,

682
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,550
and I want to be with you every day.

683
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,830
♬ The fragrance which is blowing in the wind ♬

684
00:55:55,990 --> 00:56:00,890
I don't care about your heart because I have forgotten you already.

685
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:05,640
I have wiped clean of all the times I spent with you.

686
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:31,440
♬ It hurts to see you from behind like this ♬

687
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:39,570
♬ I am not looking at you who are going far away ♬

688
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:53,660
♬ Having gone away, gone away like that ♬

689
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:07,640
♬ I am not looking at you, I feel empty ♬

690
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,240
Mr. Kang Ji Sung, who is Gold Group's Chairwoman Choi Il Soon's heir,

691
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,840
and who supposedly died suddenly in September, returned alive.

692
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,080
The political and financial worlds' as well as the media's attention is turned to the news.

693
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,970
On September 19, right after returning from Paris, France, Mr. Kang

694
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:41,730
was reported dead after getting into a traffic accident.

695
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:45,230
However, recently, the news that Mr. Kang actually escaped the accident and was alive...

696
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,100
What is your name?

697
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,110
Go Bok Sil.

698
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,380
Bok Sil!

699
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,590
Bok Sil!

700
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:55,070
Bok Sil...

701
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:56,680
Don't cry, Bok Sil...

702
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,490
Bok Sil, cheer up, Bok Sil.

703
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:02,410
Bok Sil!

704
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:06,540
Bok Sil!

705
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,040
Bok Sil!

706
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,540
Bok Sil, I like you so much.

707
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,540
One day, Louis asked me,

708
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,170
"How much do you like me?"

709
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:30,540
Louis, even if you have nothing, not even a name that everybody has,

710
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,070
I like you.

711
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:39,990
♬  My love is true, that moonlight reflects my heart (in Chinese) ♬
(From Movie Comrades: Almost A Love Story)

712
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:44,430
Why has Bok Sil left me?

713
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:47,380
Do you think she disliked me from the beginning?

714
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:53,550
Or because my memory won't return,

715
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:59,590
does she not need me anymore for finding Bok Nam?

716
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,400
Do you want to know the truth?

717
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,360
What truth?

718
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:13,530
On the day you returned to Korea, the person who died in your place...

719
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:37,050
♬ l will explode in a few seconds, you can't stop me ♬

720
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:39,250
Take off all your clothes too.
♬ Broken timer switch  ♬

721
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:45,440
♬  running toward the opening. I will not stop anymore.  ♬

♬  Trapped in the cold air, what made me soar above ♬

724
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,740
Bok Nam...
♬  was your warm eyes  ♬

725
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,540
Are you okay?

726
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,940
Bok Nam died.

727
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:07,790
♬  Allow. Allow. ♬

728
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:09,850
In my place...

729
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,120
Bok Nam died. Right?

730
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,670
Yes, that's right.

731
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:22,520
♬  As if to melt passionately my love  ♬

732

♬  As if to melt, passionately, my love  ♬

738
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:05,330
It can't' be ...

739
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:11,110
♬  Yes, I am a tiger moth, yes I am a tiger moth. ♬

♬  I will live like the flame.  ♬
