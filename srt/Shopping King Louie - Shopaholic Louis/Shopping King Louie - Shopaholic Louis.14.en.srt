1
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,210
Ah, seriously. There's a separate office for the headquarters director and this office is so big.

2
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,500
Of all places, why did they have to put their desks there? Making other people feel uncomfortable.

3
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,130
Maybe, because Headquarters Director Lou is Bok Sil's boyfriend,

4
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,810
and Director Cha is an employee at Singsingline?

5
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,900
I told you Director Cha also likes Bok Sil.

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,470
Should I start liking Bok Sil too?

7
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,780
Seriously, wow. So you're saying that since you don't have anything else to copy him in,

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,160
you're going to even copy him by liking the same woman?

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,970
Omo, he said he likes it!

10
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,000
But if what Manager Lee said is true, Bok Sil must be so happy.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,720
She's getting tons of love from two really cool men!

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,550
Who should she choose?

13
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,060
Director Cha is manlier and more trustworthy.

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,230
It's definitely Headquarters Director Louis.

15
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,280
He's the heir to Gold Group, handsome, and kind. He's got it all.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,420
Right, Team Leader Ma Ri?

17
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,340
Stop saying frivolous things and get to work.

18
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,910
Work, work! Get to work!

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, you're here?

20
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,090
Hello.

21
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,150
Headquarters Director Kang Ji Sung.

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,250
I'm so annoyed!

23
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,960
The winner takes it all!

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,130
Episode 14
The Winner Takes It All

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,360
You don't have other copies somewhere, right?

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,270
Of course not.

27
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,660
I brought all the money I had on hand.

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,270
Thank you.

29
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,970
How are you going to get out of here?

30
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,270
There's a boat that I'll stow away on in a week.

31
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,990
You're saying it's leaving now?

32
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,240
That's different than what you told me before!

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,610
I got it. I'll meet you there in two hours.

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,250
Oh, please save me!

35
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,230
Grandmother, are you okay?

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,290
Buy me a bottle of water. Hurry!

37
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,920
What in the world is in that bag?

38
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,560
Please drink the water.

39
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,860
Aigoo, thank you.

40
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,880
Aigoo, if it weren't for you, I would have died.

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,450
Oh! Aigoo! You've got some gum stuck here!

42
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,920
- Gum?
- Yeah, gum.

43
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,630
Ah, what the heck is this?

44
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,620
Grandmother! Grandmother! Aish!

45
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,460
Aigoo, this old hag, seriously. Ah, seriously, the gum!

46
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,520
Aigoo, seriously!

47
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,730
Wait... This is all... m-money?

48
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,790
Welcome!

49
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,190
Is there a particular book that you're looking for?

50
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,100
We talked on the phone a while ago. I'm Secretary Goo.

51
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,520
Secretary Goo?

52
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,920
Ah, do you work with my husband?

53
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,900
Secretary Goo?

54
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,060
Ah, you said that you work with my husband, right?

55
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,990
Yes, well...

56
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,540
Come in!

57
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,150
Have a seat. Would you like a cup of Ceylon tea?

58
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,250
Butler Kim! Butler Kim!

59
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,560
What's going on, Young Master? You'll hurt yourself if you come down the stairs too quickly.

60
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,690
I remembered.

61
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,710
Remembered what?

62
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,490
The treasure box. I'm saying I remembered the treasure box.

63
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,320
Really?

64
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,260
Treasure chest?

65
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,490
Where is it?

66
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,120
In the attic at the house in Busan.

67
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,190
I searched that place dozens of times, though.

68
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,970
It's beneath the floorboards.

69
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,830
What in the world is in there?

70
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,530
What is this?

71
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,470
Go Bo Ssi.

72
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,260
Go Bo Ssi?

73
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,490
March 15, 1996 Mom, Dad and Ji Sung

74
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,560
It's not anything special.

75
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,830
But then why...?

76
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,630
Hello?

77
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,460
Honey, Secretary Goo came looking for you at the bookstore.

78
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,890
What?

79
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,400
I got it. I'll head over there right now!

80
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,970
He said he's coming right over. Wait for just a little while.

81
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,290
But, why did you come here

82
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,360
instead of calling him directly?

83
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,830
My bag got stolen.

84
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,120
My phone was in it.

85
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,160
I've come by the bookstore with the president once before.

86
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,930
Omo! How did your bag get stolen?

87
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,760
Oh, Bok Sil said that that happened to her when she first came to Seoul too, Ahjumma.

88
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,110
Really?

89
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,400
There are so many bad people in the world!

90
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,500
Excuse me, Secretary Goo.

91
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,440
Have you ever called Chairwoman Choi Il Soon's house before?

92
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,370
No. There's no way.

93
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,230
Oh yeah, Louis! Take a look at this.

94
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,760
This, I got this at a boutique I go to often, how is it?

95
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,770
Do you think it'll look good on Ma Ri?

96
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,860
Wow, the print is pretty.

97
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,790
What pants will she wear with it?

98
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,970
What would look good with it, Mr. Shalala Stylist Talk Talk?

99
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,390
You're making me feel embarrassed, Ahjumma.

100
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,200
Pair it with some jeans. Slim cut.

101
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,710
Alright.

102
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,260
She's been putting on a veritable fashion show, saying she'll go on a company outing in a few days.

103
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,390
She made a huge fuss about it.

104
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,830
Ma Ri seems to resemble you a lot, but she's also really different from you.

105
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,890
Well, she is my daughter, but she's also Mr. Baek Seon Gu's daughter.

106
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,320
It'll look really good on Ma Ri.

107
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,990
Hey! You—

108
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,910
Ah, honey, you're here?

109
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,850
Hello.

110
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,830
So J-Ji Sung was here too.

111
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,390
Let's go out and talk.

112
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,220
Honey, why are you being so rude to your hometown friend's little brother?

113
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,890
My friend's little brother?

114
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,530
I enjoyed the tea.

115
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,100
Yes.

116
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,850
Secretary Goo, stop by anytime!

117
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,490
He didn't say anything?

118
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,980
About what?

119
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,240
Nothing. Alright then, continue with what you were doing.

120
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,220
Ahjusshi.

121
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,860
That little brother of your hometown friend...

122
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,790
For some reason, he sounds like the person who called our house a little while ago.

123
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,370
Huh? Hey, that's nonsense!

124
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,120
Would that even be possible?

125
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,820
Alright, then.

126
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,760
Honey!

127
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,570
Have you lost your mind?! You're supposed to be in another country. Why are you here?!

128
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,410
What kind of trick is this?!

129
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:35,400
I lost the bag of money.

130
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,040
What?

131
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,810
Dad!

132
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,920
Hm? When did he leave?

133
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,200
March 15, 1996
Mom, Dad and Ji Sung

134
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,010
What is this? Is it Ji Sung's?

135
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,070
March 15, 1996
Mom, Dad and Ji Sung

136
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,320
What's recorded on this thing?

137
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,990
What the heck?

138
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,970
Is it broken?

139
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,620
Wait, what's wrong with this?

140
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,430
You're asking for money again?

141
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,940
You're the one who made the mistake and lost your bag, but you're asking for money again?

142
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,400
Then what do you propose? I can't leave Korea without money.

143
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,900
Hey, you bastard!

144
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,070
If you get the money again, I'll really disappear without even a sound.

145
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,460
So, don't worry and just get me the money.

146
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,480
Hey, is 1 billion won ($1M USD) something to sneeze at?

147
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,850
Oh my.

148
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,370
Where did he just disappear to?

149
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,420
I'm sorry for leaving without saying bye to him.

150
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,560
What are you sorry for? You see him all the time. Be careful on your way, Louis!

151
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,930
Okay.

152
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,670
Goodbye, Audrey!

153
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,700
Bye!

154
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,340
49 Nu 9604

155
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,540
Can I take a look at this one?

156
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,670
Yes, of course.

157
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,220
Are you looking for a man's ring?

158
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,850
Yes.

159
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,540
Bok Sil!

160
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,600
Oh!

161
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,900
Ah, you're here? I'm ready. Where should we go?

162
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,350
Uh... the warmest and happiest place in the world.

163
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,170
Where is that?

164
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,250
Bok Sil World!

165
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,510
- You're saying we're going to have a date here?
- Yeah.

166
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,660
I missed the time that I spent here with you so much.

167
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,490
I'm going to hang out with you the whole day right here.

168
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,650
What are we going to do?

169
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,890
It's time for them to get here...

170
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,160
- You've got a delivery!
- It's here!

171
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,240
This way please.

172
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,690
Thank you.

173
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,610
You've got a delivery!

174
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,020
- Oh, in here!
- Hello.
- Yes, thank you.

175
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,500
- You can leave it here.
- You've got a delivery!

176
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,340
In here!

177
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,430
Thank you!

178
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,980
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

179
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,170
- Perfect?
- Perfect.

180
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,740
Perfect.

181
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,060
Perfect.

182
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,620
This situation feels somewhat familiar.

183
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,040
This isn't the end.

184
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,070
Ta-da!

185
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,110
This is...

186
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,450
Perfect.

187
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:57,220
It's a bag that came into this world for you. It is "Bok Sil, Bok Sil".
(Bok Sil means fluffy in Korean)

188
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,220
But it's too expensive.

189
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,730
But I bought it with the money that I worked really hard to earn this time.

190
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,050
I can't. No. Never!

191
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,190
I'll never return it. Just accept it, okay? Okay? Please, okay?

192
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,230
Okay, I'll receive it gratefully.

193
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,560
In exchange, you'll have to return expensive items like this no matter what from now on. Don't ever buy them!

194
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,300
You, Daddy-Long-Legs punk, just clean! Hurry!

195
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,520
You're not hungry? Do you want to eat something? Ramyun?

196
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,920
Bok Sil, you stay still. I'll cook something tasty for you.

197
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,550
Ohhh, really?

198
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,540
Just trust me.

199
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,690
Bok Sil!

200
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,260
- Bok Sil!
- Ah!

201
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,610
Bok Sil!

202
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,110
You're definitely the one who did the cooking, so why am I the one that's tired?

203
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,620
Is it because you're hungry? Hurry up and eat. If you eat, then you'll get some energy.

204
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,290
- How is it? Is it okay?
- Yeah, it's the best!

205
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,730
- Really?
- Yeah!

206
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,160
- I'll have to keep cooking for you from now on.
- It's okay, though.

207
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,540
Hey, what do you mean, okay? Hurry up and eat.

208
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,680
Eat some more.

209
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:56,160
Oh, so this is what Grandmother meant when she said that she felt full, just by watching me eat.

210
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,190
I'm okay, even if I don't eat at all.

211
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,220
Why aren't you swallowing it?

212
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,960
Young Master.

213
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,270
You said that you knew your multiplication tables.

214
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,720
9 x 9! 9 times 9 equals?

215
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,880
Cone!
(There is a Korean ice cream cone product called 99 Cone)

216
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,450
Ho Joon? What's wrong with your face? Did something happen?

217
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,380
I have a feeling my lifespan is decreasing. For every hour I spend teaching Young Master Bok Nam,

218
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,040
I think I will lose one year of my life.

219
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,660
What did you say?!

220
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,150
This, this really won't do, seriously!

221
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,530
Give me your hands.

222
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,950
You worked hard.

223
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,160
Ta-dah! Since it won't be good,

224
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,610
if your hands dry out.

225
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,830
You should give me 500 won too.

226
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,930
Okay.

227
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,730
Just a second.

228
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,040
Mm, smells good.

229
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,030
Yes, Butler Heo?

230
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,210
Ah, really?

231
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,390
Ah, I'm sorry. I'll head over right away.

232
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,540
Yes!

233
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,640
What's going on?

234
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,020
It's because of our Narrow-Mouthed Toad.

235
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,760
- My brother-in-law?
- Uh huh.

236
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,230
Let's go!

237
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,900
Stay here for right now.

238
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,780
I'll give you the money tomorrow, so don't move even an inch from here until then! Got it?

239
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,420
Madame would come here though.

240
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,690
I'll make sure she won't come tomorrow. So, see what happens if you try to call Hannam-dong (Chairwoman's house),

241
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,660
or do something else. I won't just let it slide.

242
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,090
Don't worry.

243
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,320
Honey? Ma Ri?

244
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,550
Are they still not home?

245
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,430
It's the weekend. It would be so nice

246
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:31,300
if everyone got together and ate dinner as a family.

247
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,700
Why is that there?

248
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,020
Omo! Again, again, again!

249
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,170
Ma Ri thinks that if she just covers up a mess she's made, then it's all taken care of!

250
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,850
Who does she take after?

251
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,940
Huh?

252
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,310
Is it broken?

253
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:16,540
Sis, studying is so hard. Can't I not do it?

254
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,920
What else would a student do besides studying?

255
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,980
Should I quit being a student?

256
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,070
Hey, you got into that scuffle and you still haven't gotten your senses back?

257
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,620
Who cares? You didn't graduate from high school either and you still have a good job.

258
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,320
You really!

259
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,590
You, you. This little narrow-mouthed toad! Where are you trying to run away to?!

260
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,190
You! Was it not enough for you to put your sister through all that heartache?

261
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,740
Please give him a good scolding!

262
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,800
I heard everything outside.

263
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,010
Listen well, Bok Nam. You have two paths.

264
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,560
Either live like my son, In Seong, or live like Goldline's director, Louis. Who do you want to live like?

265
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,520
Like Hyung Louis.

266
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,430
That's right! Hey,

267
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,600
Louis didn't get into the position he's in now, just because he's a chaebol heir.

268
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,740
He studied his butt off in France.

269
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,470
He got into one of the most prestigious universities in Europe and he speaks ten languages.

270
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,530
Then I'd rather just live like Hyung In Seong.

271
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,500
I can work alternate shifts as a chauffeur with him.

272
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,910
Hey! I talked so elegantly for the first time in a long time, and this little rascal can't get what I'm saying?

273
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,860
I'm telling you to just study! Please!

274
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,230
Bok Sil, how come he's 180 degrees different from you?

275
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,260
I'm sorry.

276
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,500
I'm going on a company outing tomorrow, so please take care of Bok Nam while I'm gone.

277
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,470
Don't worry, I'll make him into a human being while you're gone.

278
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,510
What?

279
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,470
You little annoying-style rascal number 2!

280
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,890
Alright. Give the backscratcher.

281
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,410
Okay.

282
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,120
You're dead.

283
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,030
Open your textbook.

284
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,340
Are you sure you left that treasure chest there?

285
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,870
Yes. I left it under the floorboards.

286
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,030
Then where in the world did it go?

287
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,650
Hm?

288
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,440
Don't worry about it too much. You'll get wrinkles.

289
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,240
And who do you think is the cause for these wrinkles?

290
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,490
You're blaming me again?

291
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,290
I'll go with you to Busan to look for it when this company outing is over,

292
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,010
so don't worry too much.

293
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:08,440
I understand. It's late, you should go to sleep.

294
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,840
Good night.

295
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,480
Good night, Bok Sil.

296
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,410
I want to be with the real Bok Sil.

297
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,730
Then do I need to marry her?

298
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,160
♬ It's Fine Day ♬

299
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,340
♬ Hello Hello Hello ♬

300
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,260
Bok Sil, Bok Sil.

301
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,080
Why are you calling me instead of sleeping?

302
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,130
Should we... marry?

303
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,980
If we marry, we can be with each other all the time.

304
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,510
Do you like me that much?

305
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,420
Yeah!!!!!!!

306
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,370
He doesn't hesitate even for a second.

307
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,290
You like me too, right?

308
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:16,930
I'll tell you, if you make first place at the singing contest tomorrow.

309
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,010
Hmph...

310
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,930
I'll give you a present too.

311
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,430
Really? What present?

312
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,130
It's a secret. Don't get too surprised.

313
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,220
I'm so excited.

314
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,000
Hurry and go to bed. You'll be late tomorrow.

315
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,550
Bok Sil. Give me a kiss.

316
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,430
Hurry.

317
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,700
Why isn't she answering?

318
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,650

321
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,630
What now? I just did it!

322
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,890
When?

323
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,510
♬ Even if that star lose its shine someday ♬

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,860
Bok Sil, you didn't kiss your phone, did you?

325
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,450
♬ And I will shine my light on you ♬

326
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,920
Just go sleep. I'm hanging up.

327
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,230
♬ With shiny light of mine ♬

328
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,920
Wow, now she just hangs up.

329
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,290
You're really treating your Oppa so well.

330
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,490
♬ Hello ♬

331
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,660
This is how you give a kiss.

332
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,740
♬ Hello ♬

333
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,560
♬ Hello ♬

334
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,140
Wow!

335
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,880
It's so nice!

336
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,940
Aigoo, it's so nice. It would have been great if Jeong Ran had come too.

337
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:34,320
The friendly competition to celebrate the merger of Goldine and Singsingline will now begin!

338
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,010
Director Cha, I told you that I felt like I would have worn No. 1 for some reason, didn't I?

339
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,340
I feel like I would've worn Number One.

340
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,230
Ah, that's right. You bought number one, didn't you, Shopping King Louis?

341
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,350
Director Lou, you're so cool.

342
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,870
Director, when did you buy this?

343
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,370
You were definitely with us in the office.

344
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,970
That's right. Who am I?

345
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,660
There's a way.

346
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,030
Butler Kim, again...

347
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,940
Ah, about that. The Chairwoman...

348
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,620
Who's that?

349
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,020
Oh, he belongs to Director Lou's inner circle.

350
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,020
I think he invited him because he imposed on him quiet a lot lately.

351
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,150
Oh, I see...

352
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,580
But how do you know all of that important information, Team Leader?

353
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,190
Are you, by any chance, the daughter of one of the executives?

354
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,970
Well, think freely.

355
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,030
First, we'll pick teams.

356
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,200
Take one!

357
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,100
Oh! Team #1, gather!

358
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,510
Wow, I'm on the same team as Ma Ri!

359
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,340
100 Point Team, gather!

360
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,190
Yay!!!!

361
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,830
Ha! Ha! Ha!

362
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,420
The losing team will do the dishes.

363
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,900
Today's first competition is...

364
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,260
One!

365
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,960
There you go!

366
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,120
That's right!

367
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,840
Bok Sil!

368
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,200
Right now!

369
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,140
- Right now!
- Go!

370
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:23,690
♬ On Love Way which is moving like a snail whether due to traffic or an accident ♬

371
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,640
Go Bok Sil!

372
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,420
I would like someone to tell me the way to go to you ♬

373
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,660
Hurry up!

374
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:38,910
♬ And I Need a Navigation Takes Me Where  ♬

375
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,540
Louis's team wins!

376
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,730
Why is the rope in this shape?!

377
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,360
Go Bok Go Bok Go Bok Sil! Fighting!

378
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,730
Ma Ri Ma Ri, Baek Ma Ri! Fighting!

379
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,460
♬ If I rush, all the more I'll get caught violating the awkwardness speed limit. ♬

380
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,750
Ready, go!

381
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,500
Baek Ma Ri, yes!

382
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,290
- She won! She won!
- Woah!

383
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,290
Ready, go!

384
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:04,410
Kwon Mi Young! Kwon Mi Young! Kwon Mi Young!

385
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,130
- Big News, Big News, Big News!

386
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,200
One, two.

387
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,890
Go!

388
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:23,340
♬ And I Need a Navigation Takes Me Where  ♬

♬  Tell Me Where You Are ♬

391
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,780
Yes!!!

392
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,200
- Louis, Louis.
- Go!

393
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,350
Cha Joong Won!

394
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,970
Cha Joong Won, Cha Joong Won! Cha Joong Won!

395
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,580
♬ In a few seconds I am exploding, you can't stop me. ♬

396
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,030
♬ Broken Timer Switch ♬

400
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,380
The third competition is...

401
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,280
Fighting!
♬ Trapped in the cold air  ♬

402
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,400
♬ what made me soar above was your warm eyes ♬

403

404
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,390
♬ I am prepared to go all in ♬
♬ I know it is my fate. ♬

405
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,550
That's right, that's right!

406
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,980
Go, go, go!!!

407
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,590
- He'll be good, definitely.
- That's right.

408
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,610
There's nothing he can't do!
♬ You fill the inside of my heart and the inside of my head ♬

409
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,340
♬ Although the decalcomanie of tear fragments were drawn on my heart ♬

♬ A blank page ♬

412
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,950
Have you ever even played hacky sack before?
♬ Lock me in your cage ♬

413
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,740
You'll know if you just watch.

414
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,470
Victory!

415
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,690
We believe in you! Joong Won, Fighting!

416
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,850
Good, he's just the type that'll play it well.

417
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,260
♬ My heart is burning white hot white hot ♬

418
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,700

♬ Heart Is A Time Bomb ♬

421
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,720
Go, go!
♬ Dark red, dark red sky is like a fire ♬

422
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,210
Louis wins!!

423
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,680
This team has to do the dishes!

424
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,970
Wait...

425
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,830
How can you just play hacky sack with your words?

426
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,980
Director. Ah...

427
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,800
You played well, well, well!

428
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,790
It's okay.

429
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,900
What's oka—

430
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,160
Oh, I don't want to wash dishes!

431
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,420
Hey! It's a lie that you lived in France, isn't it?!

432
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,720
If my business goes belly up, I should just play hacky sack.

433
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,910
Bok Sil, I'm really good, right?

434
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,460
Louis, you said that it's your first time playing hacky sack, so why are you so good at it? You must be gifted.

435
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,970
- I must be.
- I'm amazed.
- Me, too.

436
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,470
Wait just a moment.

437
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:10,230
What is this? He called the cops?

438
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,060
Ah, is it a closed day?

439
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,740
Culture Voucher
(Can be used toward any "cultural" activities such as buying books, CDs, movie tickets etc.)

440
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,810
I was going to buy a book, but I guess I can't.

441
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,990
Secretary Goo. Secretary Goo!

442
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,010
Secretary Goo!

443
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,650
Where the heck did he go?

444
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:22,440
This little... After telling me to bring him money, is he, by any chance, up to something funny?

445
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,730
You've got a good personality.

446
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,900
Thank you!

447
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,510
You look like you will be good at driving, too.

448
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,230
- Everyone!
- Yes?

449
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,910
To our Goldline and Singsingline, cheers!

450
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,300
Cheers! Cheers!

451
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,080
- Thank you.
- It's so nice.

452
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,930
I'm going to enjoy this shot.

453
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,370
Ma Ri, do you want something?

454
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,060
- No, no. I'm okay.
- I thought you needed it.

455
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,140
No, I still have a lot.

456
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,830
Bok Sil, let me see you for a second.

457
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,930
Why? I'm busy.

458
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,050
Hurry up!

459
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,940
Do you possibly have a need for me?

460
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,510
You sure are fired up.

461
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,300
Sit down.

462
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,770
♬ I lost the way Far Away ♬

463
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,550
What is this?

464
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,030
What do you think? It's food I grilled. Hurry up and eat it.

465
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,500
Only Bok Sil can eat the meat that I grill.

466
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,970
I'm the only one who can eat the meal that Bok Sil makes, you know.

467
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,180
I'm so honored.

468
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,630
Hurry up and eat. Ah.

469
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,320
How is it? Is it good?

470
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,310
You eat some too.

471
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,200
It's good.

472
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,380
This is my first time going on a company outing in my life.

473
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,520
Me too.

474
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,620
It's fun, isn't it?

475
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,850
Do you think I'm having fun because I am with you?

476
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,190
It's fun because we're all together.

477
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,560
Right?

478
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,320
That's right.

479
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,580
- Then, should we hurry up and eat and head back?
- Yeah.

480
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,390
Ah!

481
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,710
- It's good.
- Yeah.

482
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,060
It was really good, wasn't it?

483
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,370
This is... I don't think we'll have enough meat.

484
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,930
- We already ate it all?
- Yeah.
- Hurry up and give that to me then.

485
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,100
I'll go and buy some meat.

486
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,610
No need to. Someone will show up with some meat.

487
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:42,150
It's time for him to get here. Why isn't he here yet?!

488
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,670
Should I help you with that?

489
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,820
It's a model. A model, a model!

490
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,000
Is he an athlete?

491
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,900
Model, my foot. He's just a detective. An ordinary detective.

492
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,170
He's a person who played a very decisive role in Headquarters Director Louis returning back to Gold Group.

493
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,630
Hello! I'm really late, aren't I?

494
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,970
- Detective!
- Detective!

495
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:04,960
Louis! Bok Sil!

496
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,100
He's really inviting every single person he knows to the company outing.

497
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,620
Anyway, he's not normal.

498
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,170
How could you hold this heavy thing?

499
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,800
Everyone, I'll introduce you to him. This is Detective Nam Joon Hyeok.

500
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,870
Hello!

501
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,960
Yes, hello. It's nice to meet you.

502
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,320
Detective! You can sit right here.

503
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,080
Shall I?

504
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,200
- Everyone, sit down.
- Okay!

505
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,590
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

506
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,100
I'm more thankful.

507
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,640
Since you're already here, why don't you participate in the remaining events before you leave?

508
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,610
Ah, if it's okay for me to do so, then I will. What's the next activity?

509
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,090
The highlight of the Goldline company outing!

510
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:47,530
We shall now start the mystery song challenge, King of Masked Singer!

511
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:55,920
A hellish competition fought by five masked singers!

512
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,930
I shall introduce the first challenger.

513
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:04,720
The very name is gruesome, CBRN (chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear) Gas, Gas!

514
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,170
I'm sorry, Ma Ri.

515
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:17,540
The Music Supervisor of Your Neighborhood beats CBRN Bruce Lee by one star and ascends the throne of the King of Masked Singer!

516
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:27,860
First, So Exciting A Man Called Me who sang "Nest" about middle-aged love is our Director Louis's eternal soul mate.

517
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,790
Our Butler Kim!

518
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:36,360
He came to deliver meat and ended up wearing a mask as well.

519
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,510
Detective Nam Joon Hyeok!

520
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,520
- You're so handsome!
- And Goldline's copycat,

521
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,370
Byeon Do Jin!

522
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,390
Woah, awesome!

523
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,220
The king of extreme charisma,

524
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,110
Director Cha Joong Won!

525
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,020
Here's Goldline's new mascot,

526
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:03,340
my dream, my hope, and my meal ticket, Headquarters Director Louis!

527
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,530
Thank you, everyone. It is a beautiful night.

528
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,540
Bok Sil, did you know it was me?

529
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,980
Of course I did. Did you think I wouldn't be able to recognize you just because you were wearing a mask?

530
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,090
Congratulations on becoming the Mask King. You were cool.

531
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:38,490
Really? Then I can get your answer and your present from yesterday?

532
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,910
Just wait!

533
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,320
Director!

534
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,130
Director, you were cool too!

535
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,890
Why's he acting like that? Is he mad because he lost to me?

536
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,720
Hey! Let me look, let me see.

537
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,180
It looks red.

538
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,290
Show me the coin.

539
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:48,800
- No!
- Hurry!
- Ah, it's embarrassing.

540
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:54,210
Ah, so embarrassing.

558
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,290
Director! I'll help you.

559
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:42,790
Forget it! I said that I would take responsibility as the team leader, so you should go and rest too.

560
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:46,220
We're family members from the same company on the same team. I can't leave you to do it alone.

561
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,740
Ah, seriously! I said it's fine!

562
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,820
Hello?
Mother

563
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:59,060
I came to your house, but I don't see you. Are you working overtime?

564
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,390
I came on a company outing. I'll go home tomorrow.

565
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,720
Really? But you have to take a look at this and quickly make a decision.

566
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,010
Look at what?

567
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,900
Oh, we got as many as three women for you to go on blind dates with.

568
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,180
Every girl looks so ritzy and pretty.

569
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,440
Ah, I told you that I'm not going to go on arranged dates! If you keep doing this, I'm going to just up and move!

570
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,370
I wanted to stop, too, you know?

571
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:26,330
But that Lady Jang Geum is dating the chairwoman's grandson Louis instead of you, so how can you not go on blind dates?

572
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:29,300
Let's talk later. I'm hanging up.

573
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,500
Hey, Joong Won!

574
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,170
Who just says what they need to say and then hangs up?

575
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,640
Well, for now, if I leave this here then he'll probably take a look at it.

576
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,680
What are you doing? You said you'd help me wash the dishes.

577
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,860
Ah! Yes, yes.

578
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,780
That... thing she just said didn't mean a whole lot, so don't worry about it.

579
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,620
Yes, sir.

580
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,300
- That ring is pretty.
- Ah...

581
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,480
Thank you.

582
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:12,090
It looks expensive. I'm guessing that Louis proposed to you?

583
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:18,730
No, that's not it. He just said that he promised to buy it for me before.

584
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:25,260
That guy Louis keeps his promises better than I thought.

585
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:31,820
Put these on. That ring is too pretty to get wet.

586
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,110
I can just take it off for a little bit. Director, you wear them.

587
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,740
You put them on! I gave them to you so you could put them on!

588
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,390
There's a proper order, even for who drinks water first. You put them on, Director. I will rinse these.

589
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:45,610
Am I cold water?! I told you to put them on!

590
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,370
That's why you should have listened to me.

591
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,940
Don't come here. Don't come.

592
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,630
- Wow!
- Welcome.

593
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:08,030
- Then, Mr. Jo In Seong, Detective Nam and I are in one room together.
- That's correct.

594
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,070
- Mr. Butler, do you snore?
- I grind my teeth.

595
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,600
It's Ma Ri's turn next! Ma Ri, be careful and cross over softly.

596
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,550
This isn't some type of bomb. Why are you telling me to walk over softly?

597
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,670
Of course, I choose #1.

598
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,940
What the heck?

599
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,440
I'm using the same room as Bok Sil?

600
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,510
I can't sleep when I'm with other people though.

601
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:43,210
It's okay. Bok Sil doesn't have any bad sleeping habits.

602
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,620
It's your turn this time.

603
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:51,170
Young Master has cold hands and feet, so he shouldn't sleep in a tent. I am worried.

604
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:55,750
It's okay. I'm a lucky boy. I've never lost at things like this before.

605
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,380
I'll pick number four.

606
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,260
Since you're a lucky boy, you won't catch a cold.

607
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,170
Then it's my turn. Oh, there's one tent spot left!

608
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,390
I'm going.

609
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,100
Assistant Manager, do you want to stay up and chat all night?

610
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,800
Sounds good!

611
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,980
Headquarters Director, no, I mean, Director Cha! Come to Room Number Four! Good luck!

612
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,720
Then I'll pick...

613
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,930
Number 2! Takeoff!

614
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,530
Director, nothing's working out for you today.

615
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:11,680
Ah, so then I'm using the same room as Do Jin?

616
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,570
Something went wrong with this. I'm going to do it again!

617
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,550
If you lose, then something went wrong.

618
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:24,480
Ai, stop it! You're being a sore loser.

619
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:35,430
Who drew this? The ladder was drawn wrong from the very beginning! Let's do it again! Do it again!

620
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:40,160
That's enough. Enough!

621
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:54,660
Aish... What kind of connection do you and I have that we're stuck together from beginning to end?

622
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,750
It's this kind of connection.

623
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:02,040
Aish, you leech-like punk, getting on my nerves!

624
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,940
Don't hang onto me so I can at least hate you as much as I want to.

625
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,760
Let's go.

626
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,020
Aigo, this is nice!

627
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,740
This is my first time sleeping in a place like this.

628
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,620
If it were back in the past, Butler Kim would have never let me sleep here.

629
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,450
That goes without saying, doesn't it?

630
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,520
Oh, it's cold! I'm cold.

631
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,910
I'm colder than you!

632
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,790
I have to sleep in a strange place, with someone clinging to my back.

633
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:48,120
I guess tonight, too, will be sleepless. Fudge!

634
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,930
That goes without saying, doesn't it?

635
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,330
Hey, Director...

636
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,570
Jeez.

637
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,410
Are you sleeping?

638
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:18,610
Of course not.
Bok Sil, do you miss me so much that you can't sleep?

639
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,210
Of course not.

640
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,300
Hmph.

641
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,090
Should we meet up for a minute?

642
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:40,000
Why? Do you want to give me the present?
Where should we meet?

643
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,530
At the bench under the wisteria tree.

644
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,000
I'll go there to pick you up.

645
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,960
No, it's fine. I can go by myself.

646
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,920
See you in ten minutes.

647
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:00,000
Where are you going?

648
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,920
Were you not sleeping?

649
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:08,350
Yes. I can't sleep in an unfamiliar place. I'm sensitive.

650
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,270
Ah, I see. I'll be going outside for a moment.

651
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:18,490
Perhaps, are you going to see Louis?

652
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:22,610
I have something to give him.

653
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:26,030
You see each other every day, and yet you can't hold back, but must see each other again?

654
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,710
♬ Which way is the place I used to be ♬

655
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:35,380
Oh yeah, that's right.
♬ Can I know the times like dreams  ♬

656
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,700
♬ Should I run the path light comes ♬

657
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:48,260
The weather is cold, how can you go outside wearing wet clothes?

658
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,430
I thought it would be better than not wearing anything.

659
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,730
If you wear mine and go out, I don't care.

660
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,640
It's okay though.

661
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:03,510
Just wear it! I'm getting annoyed even thinking about the image of Louis taking off his jacket for you!

662
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,640
Thank you.

663
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:20,060
♬ The time which I can't remember ♬

664
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:28,210
♬ That familiar scent enters and permeates. ♬

665
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:35,250
♬ The Time in my two eyes ♬

666
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,090
♬ The melody which stayed in my ear enters ♬

667
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:40,400
Why isn't she coming?

668
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,300
Ah, I can't wait anymore.

669
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:14,190
Bok Sil! Is this a present?

670
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:20,780
Are you trying to scare me by hiding? Are you trying to surprise me right now?

671
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:26,810
Bok Sil! Bok Sil!

672
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,820
Bok Sil!

673
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,720
Bok Sil!

674
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,430
Bok Sil!

675
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:50,120
♬ In a few seconds I am exploding. ♬

♬ won't stop anymore.  ♬

679

♬ The day I fought the piercing showers ♬

684
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,160
- Hello?
- It's me.

685
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,390
Where are you right now? I told you to stay in the bookstore and not to move an inch.

686
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,220
Is that why you sent the police?

687
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,640
What are you talking about? The police?

688
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,370
I'm not that easy. I will not die alone.

689
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:37,590
Secretary Goo. Where are you? Let's meet and talk.

690
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,750
I have your daughter.

691
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:41,800
What?

692
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:46,280
Come to the watch tower in Gold Plaza with money by tomorrow at noon.

693
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:50,840
I will tell you where your daughter is after I receive the money. 
If you report this to the police,

694
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,350
I can't guarantee what will happen to your daughter.

695
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,570
Hello? Hello?

696
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,710
♬ In a few seconds I am exploding. ♬

697
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:05,700
Bok Sil!

Bok Sil!

Bok Sil!
