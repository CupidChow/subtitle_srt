1
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:05,797
Because I'm pretty sure that
this pandemic will drag on.

2
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:07,591
Then I'll be stuck here with you.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,221
Stop laughing, Sophie.

4
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:16,072
What's so funny? It's so corny!

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,393
You're slipping!

00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,730
♪ Lulu-lalula-lulalulaley ♪

7
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:22,547
♪ Lulalu... ♪

8
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:25,359
Well, do you know what "Lulu" means?

9
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:30,287
That's the sound
when you're doing the thing.

10
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:31,406
What?!

11
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,436
When you're getting done.
That's how it sounds like.

12
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:40,791
It could work.

13
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,768
It's not going to work.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
"Lulu"

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,500
(Episode 4: Cold War)

16
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:41,329
Lululu-lululululu!

17
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:44,577
Lululu-lululululu!

18
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:48,164
Lulu!

19
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,235
Wake up! Breakfast is ready.

20
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,628
I made a smoothie.

21
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,988
Yeah, yeah. I'll be down later.

22
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:55,407
Okay.

23
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:57,734
Okay.

24
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:02,748
Sure thing…

25
00:02:06,055 --> 00:02:07,711
She's grumpy today.

26
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,213
I wonder why?

27
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:14,134
She likes me, she likes me not…

28
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:15,594
She likes me…

29
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:17,971
She likes me not…

30
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:22,298
What are you talking about, Sophie?

31
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,394
Making things up…

32
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:25,395
Get over yourself!

33
00:02:58,128 --> 00:02:59,680
Here we are…

34
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:03,225
It's not burnt! Check!

35
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:05,948
And of course…

36
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:08,438
ketchup,

37
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:09,815
butter,

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,982
jam…

39
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,996
And of course,
special smoothie by Sophie Babes.

40
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:26,915
"Babes"…

41
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:28,333
Who's “Babes”?

42
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:29,793
There!

43
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:32,045
Check!

44
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:49,562
Hi, Abi! Come on, let's have brunch.
I cooked for you. Have a seat.

45
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,900
Too hyper, Sophie. Sounds like...

46
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,804
"Hello, kiddies! Let's eat!" Cringey!

47
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:00,949
Abi.

48
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:02,409
I didn't see you there.

49
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:04,077
Brunch?

50
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:07,122
I cooked for you, no biggie. Have a seat.

51
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:12,919
Sophie, you think you look cool?!

52
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,379
Hi, Abi.

53
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:17,132
I cooked brunch for you.

54
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,218
Fortunately, I didn't burn it.

55
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,763
You want me to put some eggs on your plate?

56
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:29,102
You're such a poser, Sophie. Why so coy?

57
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:30,562
You're a flirt, Sophie.

58
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,370
What's taking so long?

59
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,999
What's she doing up there?

60
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:53,543
Why isn't she coming down?

61
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:32,624
Sophie,

62
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:34,292
I'm so sorry...

63
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,977
but I have to leave.

64
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,629
I'm moving to another B and B.

65
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,005
What?!

66
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:40,048
Why?

67
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:41,556
Don't you like it here anymore?

68
00:05:41,638 --> 00:05:43,593
No.. It's not like that.

69
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:45,328
Then what?

70
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:47,264
I don't like you anymore... No!

71
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:48,765
No, no…

72
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,600
It's not that I don't like you…

73
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,769
It's just I might develop feelings for you.

74
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,439
"Develop"?

75
00:05:57,145 --> 00:06:00,944
Oh my god. Abi, you are so lame!
Are you in high school?!

76
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,620
Sophie,

77
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:15,558
there are just certain things
I can't explain to you right now.

78
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,044
So it's better that we go
our separate ways for now.

79
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:20,429
Don't you want me anymore?

80
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:22,507
Aren't you happy with me?

81
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:23,550
No!

82
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,508
In fact, I'm very happy
when I'm around you.

83
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,263
Like my problems don't even exist.

84
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:31,558
I like that problems don't figure in
as much when I'm with you.

85
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:33,393
I like the way you…

86
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:35,329
I like the way you smile,

87
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,689
I like the way you're so chirpy,

88
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,982
I like how you're sensitive,

89
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,026
and very open about your feelings.

90
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,905
You never made me feel awkward.
Do you know that?

91
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,282
I like the…

92
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:49,659
I like the…

93
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:52,336
I like…

94
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:56,374
No...

95
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:58,209
No, no, no…

96
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:00,128
I do not like this!

97
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:00,962
No!

98
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,425
Kakie!

99
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:10,513
This is what I was afraid of!

100
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:11,556
Right?

101
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:14,476
We should have left at the onset.

102
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:15,977
How could I have known?

103
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:18,730
That this would happen?

104
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,814
Damn it!

105
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:24,527
It can't happen.

106
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:26,446
No, no, it can't happen.

107
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:28,265
It can't, it can't, it can't.

108
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:32,800
It can't happen, no, no…

109
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:35,080
It can't happen.

110
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:38,775
I really shouldn't.

111
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,036
Sophie.

112
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,048
Lulu.

113
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:31,344
I fell asleep waiting for you.

114
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:35,265
I ate some of the hotdogs
because I got hungry.

115
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:37,559
Oh no! It's dark?

116
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:38,893
What time is it?

117
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,217
It's 6:00 pm.

118
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:43,256
You shouldn't have waited for me, duh?

119
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,758
Go, just eat.

120
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,512
Sad that the smoothie just melted.

121
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:51,906
And the bread.

122
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:53,992
Look, it's a perfect toast.

123
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:55,243
I made sure it wouldn't get burned.

124
00:08:55,808 --> 00:08:58,705
But it automatically pops out
when it's done toasting.

125
00:08:58,865 --> 00:08:59,914
There's even a timer.

126
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:03,293
The eggs, though. They're perfect circles.

127
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,336
Because you used a mold.

128
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:08,131
What about the hotdogs?

129
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:09,466
They're perfectly cooked.

130
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:11,926
Semi-cooked.

131
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,011
Just heat them up.

132
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:15,847
The smoothie.

133
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:20,769
Go, dig in.

134
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:27,609
It's officially lockdown.

135
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:29,027
Yeah…

136
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:32,659
So, are you sure you're
going to be staying here?

137
00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:34,324
What choice do I have?

138
00:09:38,473 --> 00:09:40,350
What's our agenda for today?

139
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,873
Agenda?

140
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,375
We had a deal, right?

141
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,670
We're going to tidy things up,
then we're going to throw out the trash…

142
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:49,172
Okay.

143
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:51,424
Don't you want to?

144
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,259
But it's late.

145
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:57,564
Tomorrow, then.
We can do it tomorrow anyway.

146
00:09:58,054 --> 00:09:59,782
Let's clean up the things then...

147
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,852
repair the broken stuff upstairs.

148
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,521
Don't you want to?
It's okay, you can tell me.

149
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:08,799
No, it's okay. Really.

150
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:11,194
Okay, here's what we're going to do.

151
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:15,156
The broken tables upstairs, and the chairs,

152
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,952
we can put them back together.
I have some nails in here somewhere.

153
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:24,733
Then we can mop, vacuum,
and sort out some things and organize them…

154
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:31,214
Hey!

155
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:35,982
Didn't you say we're going to deactivate
your IG and FB?

156
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,818
Let's do it now.

157
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:40,516
Hey!

158
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,156
Hm? Huh?

159
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:45,812
Let's deactivate your IG and FB.

160
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,022
Or did you change your mind?

161
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:52,986
Okay.

162
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:55,780
Here's the FB.

163
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,992
When you swipe here, there's IG.

164
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:00,326
Alright, sure, sure.

165
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:04,184
Huh?

166
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:06,264
Oh my god.

167
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:08,877
What?! Oh my god!

168
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:09,836
What is it?

169
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,840
You have 50,000 followers on IG!

170
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:15,508
- My gosh.
- And you have...

171
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:16,342
G...

172
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:19,971
Abi, you have 100,000 followers
on Facebook.

173
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:21,405
Who are you?

174
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,957
I thought it was something important.

175
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:25,310
And there's more…

176
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:29,268
You're a member of a band.
What is this? What band?

177
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:31,332
Nothing, it's just some indie band.

178
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,426
Small time. It's nothing at all.

179
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:37,853
This is wild! And you're a Chef!

180
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,407
Sous chef.

181
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:41,367
Assistant Chef.

182
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,329
You're Assistant Chef to…

183
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:47,749
Damn, Chef Lazaro. The celebrity chef?

184
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,712
I watch his shows!
Why have I never seen you there?

185
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,756
Because I'm always wearing a mask.

186
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:58,051
Wow! That's why I thought to myself,

187
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,752
I noticed the Chef's assistants
always wearing a mask.

188
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:02,742
I don't like the limelight.

189
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:04,307
I prefer working in the background.

190
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,976
And for sanitary purposes.

191
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:10,470
Oh no, Abi. Let's just forget about
deactivating your accounts.

192
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,497
It'll be a waste!

193
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,983
You know what, you're right.
Let's not deactivate them.

194
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:15,360
Just delete them.

195
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,718
The heck? What's your problem?

196
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:19,489
I think you should reconsider…

197
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:23,184
Look at all you have to lose.
I didn't know you were an influencer.

198
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,429
So I have 50k, 100k followers...

199
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,747
what does it matter?

200
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:32,980
Wow. Compared to me
who only has 500 followers on IG.

201
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:37,590
And on Facebook, maybe around... 1,500?

202
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,985
And I even accept
all friend requests just so...

203
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,289
I can up the numbers on my list.
I don't even know most of those people.

204
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,132
Just please delete it.

205
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:49,310
Are you kidding?

206
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,297
If only I could transfer
your followers to my account.

207
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:57,860
So what if I have that many followers?

208
00:12:58,592 --> 00:13:00,488
Do they have a hand in my life?

209
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:02,824
Can they change my destiny?

210
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,827
They're just there to make
you feel good about yourself!

211
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:08,012
You're always fishing for compliments.

212
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,581
You have so many followers, so many likes…

213
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,668
So what? Does that mean you're famous?

214
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:14,168
That you're relevant?

215
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:16,154
You mean something to the world?

216
00:13:17,032 --> 00:13:18,589
What you don't know is,

217
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:21,092
nobody truly cares about you!

218
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,304
In the middle of battle,
they'll just abandon you!

219
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:25,555
In the end,

220
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:27,999
you'll face it all alone.

221
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,333
Abi…

222
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,955
Is it your time of the month?

223
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,290
- You're so cranky.
- What?

224
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,043
Think what you want, Sophie.

225
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:58,153
Hey, Abi! There's sanitary napkins
from the cabinet! Don't be shy!

226
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:00,281

253

Abi.

254
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,852
Are you mad at me?

255
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,714
Not really.

256
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,343
"Not really", so just a little?

257
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,096
It means I'm not.

258
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:36,389
I'm not mad at you.

259
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,643
Did I say something wrong?

260
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,273
Was it something I did? Did I offend you?

261
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:46,566
Nothing like that.

262
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:49,360
So you're just not in the mood?

263
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,119
I just don't understand.
What's your problem?

264
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:00,371
I have a lot of problems.

265
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:04,417
Well, then maybe I can help.

266
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:06,294
No, you can't.

267
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:10,600
So we'll just stay like this
for the entire lockdown?

268
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:14,427
If you want, I can just go.

269
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,637
Is that what you want?

270
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,556
Whatever you want.

271
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,309
That's not what I asked.

272
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,835
You know what, I'm so confused.
I don't know what's happening to you.

273
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,318
But I just want to say

274
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:32,278
that in the short period
of time we spent together,

275
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:34,689
we got to know each
other, you changed my life.

276
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,909
I want you to know that maybe…

277
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:42,522
…just maybe, even in some small way,
I could be useful to you.

278
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:48,653
But if I'm just in your way,

279
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:51,280
then it's fine. I'll try to understand.

280
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:56,744
I'll just take the trash out.

281
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:02,683
Sophie.

282
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,369
So...

283
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:21,869
You could just tell me
instead of acting like a baby.

284
00:19:26,157 --> 00:19:27,241
The hell's her problem?

285
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,795
Sophie.

286
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,660
Another bag of trash.

287
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:43,140
♪ I don't know if I'll come close or not ♪

288
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:46,727
What's important is that
I get you back to Manila.

289
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:50,648
What else is there to talk about
when we're done?

290
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:52,817
I realized that you're still
the one I love.

291
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:53,984
"Love"?

292
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:56,195
Then why did you hurt me?

293
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:58,614
Don't I deserve a second chance?

294
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:00,641
Ah, if you ever need a second chance...

295
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,910
I meant, second serving of coffee…

296
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,120
just let me know.

297
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:06,205
All that pent-up anger, fear, sadness…

298
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,457
Just shout them all out to the sea!

299
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:11,447
Lulu!

300
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:16,799
What is Love?

301
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:18,592
Love is not blind.

302
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:20,469
Really now?

303
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:22,096
What about you?

304
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:23,806
Love is…?

305
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:25,349
You.
