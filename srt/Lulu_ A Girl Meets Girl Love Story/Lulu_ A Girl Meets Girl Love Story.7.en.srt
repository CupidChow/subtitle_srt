1
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:04,418
Abi?

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,395
Tricia, this is Sophie.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,883
Sophie, this is Tricia.

4
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:10,232
Abi, what's happening to you?

5
00:00:10,257 --> 00:00:12,012
I deactivated all my accounts.

6
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:15,867
What's so great about that girl
that you gave up all of your good luck?

7
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:17,322
She has a name, okay?

8
00:00:17,347 --> 00:00:18,560
Her name is Sophie.

9
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:20,379
What happened?!

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,190
There you go.

11
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:25,984
- There's something I want to tell you!
- There's something I want to tell you!

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,758
Abi!

13
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:29,613
Hey! Hey! Abi!

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,073
Hey!

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,200
"Lulu"

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,700
(Episode 7: Love, Live)

17
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,134
I thought it was heatstroke.

18
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:34,219
Or...

19
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:35,887
food poisoning…

20
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:38,654
Or maybe you got bit by a mosquito.

21
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:39,529
Dengue.

22
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:40,559
Stress,

23
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:42,019
anxiety…

24
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:42,824
But then...

25
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:44,434
I don't want to talk about it.

26
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,632
So I was right.

27
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,675
It's overfatigue.

28
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:52,317
But when I found out
why you're overfatigued...

29
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:53,972
Sophie, please.

30
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:55,699
Stage two?

31
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:57,601
Breast cancer?

32
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:00,370
So what was your plan all along?

33
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:01,747
Hide it from everyone?

34
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:02,873
Just leave it alone?

35
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:05,234
What do you care about my plans?

36
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:07,694
Ever since I met you,

37
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,128
you did nothing
but help me sort my life out.

38
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,717
You even told me, "There's more to life!"

39
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:15,160
That I shouldn't give up...

40
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:17,471
Blank canvas…

41
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,885
That I should get to know myself

42
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:20,262
and take out all my baggage,

43
00:02:20,262 --> 00:02:21,888
that I should know my truth...

44
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:22,906
You know nothing.

45
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:24,391
You're right, I don't.

46
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:26,034
I don't know anything.

47
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:28,231
Because I'm nothing but a useless idiot.

48
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:31,718
You don't know what my mother
went through when she was ill.

49
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:35,193
We did everything so she could survive.

50
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:37,182
But she just suffered.

51
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:39,242
In the end, it was all for nothing.

52
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:43,994
She could have been enjoying
the last few months of her life.

53
00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:46,149
You know, doing whatever she wanted.

54
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:49,278
Or spending time in this beautiful place.

55
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:50,945
But that's not what happened.

56
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,490
She died miserable in the hospital.

57
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:02,179
Isn't it more important than
both of you put up a fight?

58
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:05,515
That you did all that
you could until the end?

59
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:08,769
You think your mother
would be happy to hear

60
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:12,189
you've decided to give up fighting
for your life?

61
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:13,760
I didn't give up.

62
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,168
What do you think you're doing?

63
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:18,223
I've accepted that this is my life now.

64
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:20,655
I don't get it!

65
00:03:20,655 --> 00:03:23,825
You don't get it
because my life isn't your life.

66
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:27,829
Is it so wrong for me
to just do anything I want

67
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,914
for the last, what...

68
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:30,919
six months?

69
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:33,488
Four or three months of my life?

70
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:35,754
Is it so wrong to try and live longer

71
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:36,880
so you can do anything you want

72
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,136
if only you didn't stop fighting
for a chance?

73
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:41,343
There are things in life
that you should fight for,

74
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:43,432
and there are things
you should simply accept.

75
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:45,055
And this is it!

76
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,246

Don't die?

95
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:03,777
Needs more oil.

96
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:09,616
There we go.

97

What's this?

98

You can't die!

Where the heck is my bra?

102
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:20,603
I just left it here.

103
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:24,624
The heck.

104
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:30,155
Oh my god.

105
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:38,872
I told her I'll do my own laundry.

Sophie?

110
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:38,570
Hi.

111
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:39,699
Hi.

112
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:42,699
Lulu party?

113
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,622
Yes, sure.

114
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,255
I got it.

115
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:55,757
Thank you.

116
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:00,383
Let's go?

117
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:01,301
Okay.

118
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:19,110
Wow, these noodles are perfectly cooked!

119
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:22,447
Sure hope so. I've been cooking that
since elementary school.

120
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:24,744
It'd be sad if I still messed it up.

121
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:29,499
Abi…

122
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:31,255
Yup?

123
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:36,030
Can we sit and talk calmly this time?

124
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,005
I guess we can.

125
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:40,885
You're the one who's never calm.

126
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:43,054
Wow, you're one to talk.

127
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:44,986
See? It's starting.

128
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,332
You're raising your voice.

129
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,686
That just happens
when I'm proving a point.

130
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:50,770
Cut me some slack.

131
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:51,729
Yeah, right.

132
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:54,757
Okay, let's start.

133
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:00,405
What is the meaning of life to you?

134
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:03,741
My god! Are these slam book questions?

135
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:08,037
Please. My question is too deep
for slam books.

136
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:12,705
Can't we just eat and enjoy
our Lulu Pajama Party?

137
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:14,432
Let's not talk about that!

138
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:15,086
Hey.

139
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,251
You said I'm raising my voice.

140
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:18,489
Listen to yourself.

141
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:21,117
Relax. We're just talking.

142
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,264
Sophie…

143
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:30,501
Since I found out that I have cancer,

144
00:13:30,682 --> 00:13:33,146
I've thought very carefully
about what I'm going to do.

145
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:36,215
My decisions weren't done on a whim.

146
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:41,984
Is there really nothing
to change your mind?

147
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,195
What for? I have no one here.

148
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:46,200
To tell you the truth,

149
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:47,757
I don't live to work.

150
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:49,158
I work to live.

151
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:52,148
I'm always looking forward to
what life will bring me next.

152
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:53,346
But I guess,

153
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:54,288
this is it for me.

154
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:55,693
It's the end of the line for me.

155
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:56,666
So...

156
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,948
Might as well make the most
out of what's left.

157
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:10,541
Sophie…

158
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,265
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:15,004
Sorry for what?

160
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:16,936
For this.

161
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:19,192
What's "this"?

162
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,302
That we became close.

163
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,888
I didn't even want to, but...

164
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:25,056
here we are.

165
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,071
Then the pandemic hit.

166
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:28,618
Do you regret it?

167
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:30,645
No, it's not that.

168
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:34,053
I just don't want to gain any more
important people in my life

169
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:34,691
because...

170
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:36,709
I'll just end up hurting
them at this point.

171
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:40,446
You're important to me, too.

172
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:45,631
That makes this so hard.

173
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:47,717
You didn't answer my question.

174
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:51,291
You see,

175
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,334
ever since my mother died,

176
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,545
and I found out I was sick too,

177
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,977
I gave up puzzling over
the meaning of life.

178
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:00,788
It seems we're just living and suffering.

179
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,385
But we're still going to die.

180
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:04,358
It's just a matter of who goes first.

181
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:07,653
I'll just go ahead.

182
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,195
Well, you're not wrong.

183
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,613
Life itself is meaningless.

184
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,506
Because we are the ones
to assign meaning to it.

185
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:28,800
Nothing is permanent in life.

186
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:32,081
The only constant in life is change.

187
00:15:33,221 --> 00:15:34,892
Where did you pick those up?

188
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,060
Google?

189
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:38,312
For real?

190
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:40,022
Wasn't it you who said,

191
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:42,605
"Google can explain anything."

192
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,708
"If you're down and out,

193
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,655
Google will always be there for you."

194
00:15:50,905 --> 00:15:52,643
But I just want to tell you,

195
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,272
that you don't need Google.

196
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:58,858
Because I'm right here

197
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,818
to answer all of your questions.

198
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:03,601
Not all of them, obviously!

199
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:05,545
Google's still smarter than me!

200
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:09,423
- Shot!
- Yeah.

201
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,204
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

202
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,302
Watch out! You spilled some!

203
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:14,053
Oh, sorry!

204
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,488
- Sorry, wait.
- Shot! Shot! Shot!

205
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:16,197
There you go.

206
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:17,418
Okay.

207
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:20,338
Damn, Sophie.

208
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:24,480
Cheers!

209
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:32,200
Hey.

210
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,102
Hold your emotions, okay?

211
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,770
I'm being serious.

212
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:38,064
There's something else I want to tell you.

213
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:41,651
Whatever you're about to say,

214
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:43,277
forget it.

215
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:00,770
I like you.

216
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,306
What?

217
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:14,725
What do you mean 'what'?

218
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:18,396
Aren't you even going to answer?

219
00:17:19,678 --> 00:17:21,482
You didn't ask a question.

220
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:24,360
Okay, fine, here.

221
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,293
Here goes.

222
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:31,117
Do you like me?

223
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:35,413
Sophie, we already talked about this.

224
00:17:36,218 --> 00:17:38,499
I know you care about me.

225
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:41,269
I care about you, too.

226
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:42,795
But this is so hard.

227
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:50,107
Are you listening to me?

228
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:52,930
What about you,
did you hear a word I said?

229
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:55,892
I asked you a question.

230
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,227
I was thinking,

231
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:06,332
"What is life really for, Abi?"

232
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,587
Life only seems to matter
when we want someone,

233
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,632
or when we love something.

234
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:17,847
Sophie.

235
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:20,833
I was hoping that

236
00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:23,961
maybe, even just a little bit,

237
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:27,965
you might want to fight this.

238
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:33,179
I was hoping that maybe you would
find purpose in your life because of me.

239
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:37,488
In case we're feeling
the same way for each other.

240
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:44,106
Please fight this so we can
make more memories together.

241
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:49,111
I also want you to know that…

242
00:18:50,138 --> 00:18:51,297
I'll stay by your side.

243
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:53,337
I will not go anywhere,

244
00:18:53,337 --> 00:18:55,201
and I will never leave you in that fight.

245
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,136
But if I'm not relevant
to your life after all,

246
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:03,918
then you're right.
What's the use?

247
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:05,795
That's okay.

248
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:09,478
I'm just someone in your way.

249
00:19:23,757 --> 00:19:27,833
Mom might be able to get a permit.

250
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,001
So...

251
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,420
Since my address is in Manila,

252
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,230
I don't really know why I opened
this B and B in the first place.

253
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:38,090
I'll probably just close it for now.

254
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:41,469
For sure, there are a lot of
other lodges open still.

255
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:43,137
You'll find one in no time.

256
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:46,852
Or...

257
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:49,355
you could stay over
at Tricia's, your best friend.

258
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:50,981
Right?

259
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:52,817
Is that what you want?

260
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:55,069
No, Abi.

261
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,239
This is what you want.

262
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,952
I'm just going with what you want.

263
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:15,895
I think I'm drunk, yeah.

264
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,924
I also feel like...

265
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:19,215
I'm getting sleepy.

266
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:21,178
Anyway, just clean up, okay?

267
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:22,304
You'll be okay?

268
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:24,515
I'll go ahead.

269
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:04,597
Hey, what happened?

270
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,015
Ma.

271
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:09,435
Nothing, I just thought I should go home.

272
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:11,770
Don't you have a tenant?

273
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,162
I just told her to transfer
to another place.

274
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:17,343
I told her I'm leaving.

275
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:19,487
Do you have a permit for the checkpoints?

276
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:21,697
What, you said you'd get me one!

277
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:23,949
It's hard to move around these days.

278
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:26,907
Maybe they'll make an exception
for Manila residents.

279
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:29,288
I'll just give the soldiers
a wink at the border.

280
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,166
Hey, not everything can be solved
by acting cute.

281
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:34,251
What really happened?

282
00:21:35,676 --> 00:21:37,171
Is this about Jun?

283
00:21:37,418 --> 00:21:38,878
Sorry, I told him you were there.

284
00:21:38,878 --> 00:21:40,799
I didn't know he would come to see you.

285
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:43,803
No, that's all settled.

286
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:46,555
You guys are okay?
So you're back together?

287
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:51,811
No, I meant I've settled things
between us. We already talked.

288
00:21:51,836 --> 00:21:55,856
I've moved on, and he's on the road
to moving on as well.

289
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:57,733
Well, that's good.

290
00:22:00,441 --> 00:22:01,195
Then...

291
00:22:01,483 --> 00:22:02,847
why do you look sad?

292
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:04,403
What?

293
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:06,408
I'm okay, Ma.

294
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:08,978
I'm just thinking about the stuff
I need to pack.

295
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:12,356
You didn't get into a quarrel
with your tenant, did you? That Abi.

296
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:13,791
Is she bullying you?

297
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:16,126
No, Ma.

298
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:18,112
She's nice.

299
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:21,257
A little moody sometimes, but...

300
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,925
she makes up for it.

301
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:25,511
And Ma, did I tell you?

302
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:28,664
She's a great cook
because she's a chef, apparently!

303
00:22:29,345 --> 00:22:33,102
And she helped me
fix a lot of things at the B and B.

304
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:35,559
She put away the stacks of wood outside,

305
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,882
she patched up the ceiling,

306
00:22:37,978 --> 00:22:39,146
she painted the walls,

307
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:42,261
and she fixed up the bedframe
in the other room.

308
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:47,641
And she can play the guitar, Ma!
Because she's in a band!

309
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:50,352
Yeah, it's been fun.

310
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:53,063
We played some games, went swimming,

311
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,732
we drank,

312
00:22:54,912 --> 00:22:56,288
and we danced…

313
00:22:57,915 --> 00:22:59,211
So you're best friends?

314
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:02,878
Hey! Sophie!

315
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:04,049
What?

316
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:05,785
What did you say, Ma?

317
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,788
I said, you must be best friends
with that Abi!

318
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:11,432
Best friends?

319
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:13,751
No, we're not best friends, Ma.

320
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:15,686
I should go.

321
00:23:16,117 --> 00:23:18,214
I'll call you when I'm about to leave.

322
00:23:19,103 --> 00:23:20,729
Okay. Take care.

323
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:21,567
Have a safe trip!

324
00:23:21,897 --> 00:23:22,610
Bye!

325
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:24,066
Bye!

326
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:46,425
Let's go swimming.

327
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:48,969
What?

328
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:52,681
I already confessed to her.

329
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:56,426
I'm going back to Manila
and she's transferring to another B and B.

330
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,814
We're just going for a dip.
You're all dressed up.

331
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:02,232
Why, does it look bad?

332
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:04,593
No! It's pretty.

333
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:06,236
You're very pretty.

334
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:09,069
Sophie, I want to thank you because...

335
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:11,892
you always make me smile.

336
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:13,644
And somehow,

337
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:17,439
being with you has helped me forget
the things I'm going through.

338
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:21,502
You literally saved my life.

339
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:22,599
Twice.

340
00:24:22,624 --> 00:24:25,739
You helped me piece myself together.
