1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:05,072
Ever since I met you,

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:08,133
you did nothing
but help me sort my life out.

3
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:11,286
You don't get it
because my life isn't your life.

4
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:13,330
Hi.

5
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:14,665
Hi.

6
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:17,416
Lulu party?

7
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,752
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

8
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:22,814
I like you.

9
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:24,800
Aren't you even going to say anything?

10
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:27,176
What, you didn't ask a question.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,928
Do you like me?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
"Lulu"

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,500
(Episode 8: Ending, Beginning)

14
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:16,852
Hey.

15
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,435
Good morning!

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,895
I cooked.

17
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:21,899
Brunch for us.

18
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:22,898
Have a seat.

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,029
There's so many food!

20
00:01:27,736 --> 00:01:29,279
No, you can bring the rest later

21
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:31,407
on your way back to Manila.

22
00:01:34,632 --> 00:01:36,245
Also, I brewed some coffee,

23
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:38,624
because I'm not great at making smoothies.

24
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:42,419
Let's eat.

25
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,658
So, will you be staying at Tricia's?

26
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,536
No, I have a friend
who recommended a B and B.

27
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:18,841
It's nearby.

28
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,119
I already booked.

29
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,072
It's right in the next town.

30
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:31,245
Will you be taking all the groceries?

31
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,613
We'll split them. Let's divide it later.

32
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:35,846
Alright.

33
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:37,890
I won't be bringing much with me.

34
00:02:38,182 --> 00:02:39,950
Just the canned goods and noodles.

35
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:41,143
For emergencies.

36
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:44,480
You can have all the meats
and the fish in the freezer.

37
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:48,114
Because I'm sure they will be serving meals
where I'm going.

38
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:49,336
Okay.

39
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:50,130
Yeah.

40
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:53,851
I'll help you bring your things to the car.

41
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,659
Okay, thank you.

42
00:02:56,612 --> 00:02:57,905
Are you staying with your mom?

43
00:02:58,342 --> 00:02:59,262
Yes.

44
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:01,014
I'll crash there for now.

45
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:03,210
I see.

46
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:15,429
Let's go swimming.

47
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,224
What?

48
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,517
Just because.

49
00:03:21,053 --> 00:03:22,638
We won't be leaving until later, anyway.

50
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:26,267
And loading the stuff
in the car won't take long.

51
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:27,316
It's just the groceries.

52
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,277
Let's go for a swim before we part ways.

53
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:32,529
Okay, I guess.

54
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,464
Yeah.

55
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,908
Let's check out the spot at the far end.

56
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:38,112
For a different view.

57
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:39,803
Okay.

58
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:44,750
Hang on.

59
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:46,251
Damnit.

60
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:49,582
Okay, wait. Here.

61
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:54,009
That's it.

62
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,094
I got it! That's it.

63
00:03:56,881 --> 00:04:00,265
Sorry, bestie. Signal is weak around here,
as you know.

64
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:02,428
Girl, what happened to you?

65
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:04,346
Your mom said you're going back to Manila?

66
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:05,812
Yes.

67
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:07,898
What happened?

68
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:09,749
Nothing.

69
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:12,444
I'll just stay there during the lockdown.

70
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,214
What the hell. I wouldn't mind being stuck
in that place during lockdown.

71
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,341
You have the beach, fresh air…

72
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:21,261
And you want to rush into
the toxic city of Manila?

73
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:22,329
Seriously?

74
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:23,532
What really happened?

75
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:26,750
Did you have a fight with your tenant...
what's her name?

76
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:27,726
Abi?

77
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:29,311
It's not that.

78
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:30,706
She's cool.

79
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:32,756
It's just…

80
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:34,049
I don't know.

81
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:35,586
But she's very nice.

82
00:04:36,962 --> 00:04:38,178
Caring,

83
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:39,882
moody, but…

84
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:42,301
she can be very sweet
when she's making up for it.

85
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,727
And I learned a lot from her.

86
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:47,412
So you like her?

87
00:04:47,807 --> 00:04:49,398
How could you possibly know that?

88
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:50,582
How can you tell?

89
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:55,189
It's so fun to catch you!

90
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:58,907
You're so fun to pick on.
Woo! My best friend's a lesbian now!

91
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:01,737
Stop teasing me.

92
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,495
I hate you.

93
00:05:03,864 --> 00:05:05,866
What's wrong with that?

94
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:09,036
Nothing, it's just…

95
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:10,788
Because she's a girl?

96
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:12,706
No, it's not that.

97
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:14,708
It's totally that.

98
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:15,982
Hold on.

99
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:17,294
Have you guys had sex?

100
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,636
What is wrong with you!

101
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:21,404
Of course not!

102
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:23,050
Damn, we're in trouble.

103
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:24,260
What do you mean?

104
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:27,018
It doesn't sound like a casual thing.

105
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:32,226
Stop. You're totally wrong.

106
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:35,229
So what if turns into something serious?

107
00:05:35,855 --> 00:05:37,022
You're single.

108
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:38,566
Is she single?

109
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:40,526
Yes.

110
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:42,820
Well then, that's all that matters.

111
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,990
You don't have to overthink
when it comes to love.

112
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,747
Let it flow, okay?

113
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:51,620
These days, love is genderless.

114
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:54,479
If you fell for her,
then there's no question about it.

115
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:56,606
That's just how it is.
So relax.

116
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:57,899
Enjoy the ride.

117
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,628
That's the thing.

118
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:02,673
I already confessed to her.

119
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:03,667
Now, look at you.

120
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:06,798
I'm here spouting
advice like some Love Guru,

121
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:08,738
but you guys are moving along nicely.

122
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:10,370
What did she say?

123
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:12,205
Well. Here we are.

124
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:13,684
We're parting ways.

125
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:17,897
I'm going back to Manila
and she's transferring to another B and B.

126
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:19,648
So you're not her type?

127
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:21,775
I don't know.

128
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:23,569
Maybe...

129
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:25,446
just as a friend.

130
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:29,909
So you're going home
because she turned you down.

131
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:33,810
Too bad. She would have been
your first girlfriend, but you got dumped.

132
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:35,581
Not exactly.

133
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:37,333
She just has her reasons.

134
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,001
It's not because she doesn't like me.

135
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:40,252
Then what?

136
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:43,130
She's going through some stuff.

137
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:45,841
What are you keeping it in suspense for?

138
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:47,801
Never mind! Never mind that.

139
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,236
Well,

140
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:51,388
if you truly care about someone,

141
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:53,766
you wouldn't just leave them like that.

142
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,643
Just try.

143
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:57,519
If it doesn't work, then fine.

144
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,812
At least you tried.

145
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:01,232
It's her loss, not yours.

146
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,692
Oh, well.

147
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:04,777
Wait.

148
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:06,987
I thought you were leaving.

149
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:08,656
Are you going for a swim?

150
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,492
My trip's not until later.
Abi and I are going swimming.

151
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:14,954
Then why are you wearing makeup?
Is that makeup?

152
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:15,685
What?

153
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:19,381
It's just lipstick and a little blush-on.

154
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,336
Okay, fine. You're right,
I put on some eyeliner, too.

155
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:23,985
You're unbelievable!

156
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,613
You'll look like a zombie
when you get out of the water!

157
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:28,509
Come on. I'm wearing waterproof.

158
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:30,177
Okay, I'll see you later! Let's talk later.

159
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:31,660
She's waiting for me.

160
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:32,721
Okay.

161
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:35,808
Enjoy your last day with her with a bang!

162
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:38,185
As in bang! Bang! Bang!

163
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:41,188
Yeah, whatever. I have to go retouch.

164
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:42,779
Retouch?!

165
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,067
- Don't you think it's too much?
- Whatever you say.

166
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,568
Bye!

167
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:53,033
What are you even doing, Sophie?

168
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,203
Let me just retouch.

169
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:16,438
Abi.

170
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:21,401
Abi.

171
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:25,399
Abi.

172
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:29,159
Hey! Abi!

173
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:37,411
What happened to you?

174
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:38,309
What?

175
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:41,062
Where are you off to, Madame?

176
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,357
Why are you teasing me? Don't I look great?

177
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:47,052
We're just going for a dip.
You're all dressed up.

178
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:48,803
Why, does it look bad?

179
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:50,472
No. Not really.

180
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:53,110
No, tell me! Is it ugly?

181
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:55,268
No! It's pretty. It is.

182
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:56,645
It's pretty.

183
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,023
You're very pretty.

184
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:08,067
Ready to go?

185
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,908
Let's go.

186
00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:16,998
I got a pedicure!

187
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:19,250
Little ginger toes!

188
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:21,169
You're mean!

189
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,049
Wow! This place is beautiful!

190
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:28,927
I haven't been here before.

191
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:33,515
This is the place I was asking
the lady over at the alley about.

192
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:41,600
Maybe you shouldn't
drink too much because...

193
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:43,811
you'll be driving, right?

194
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:45,974
It's just one bottle.

195
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:48,363
And we have plenty of time.

196
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:49,942
Okay.

197
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:56,037
Sophie…

198
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:57,038
What?

199
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:58,909
Thank you.

200
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:01,126
For what?

201
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,377
For everything.

202
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:05,547
For letting me stay at your B and B.

203
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,007
You do pay rent.

204
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:11,177
For cooking food for me.

205
00:10:11,672 --> 00:10:12,881
They don't even taste good,

206
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:14,007
and they're already covered in the fees.

207
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:18,143
For mixing those drinks,
cocktails, the cool drinks.

208
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:20,848
It's the least I could do
since you provided the alcohol.

209
00:10:21,306 --> 00:10:23,350
For doing my laundry.

210
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:28,313
Well, you sorted my medicine and put
a bunch in every corner of the house.

211
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,152
Sophie, I want to thank you…

212
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:35,660
because you always make me smile.

213
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:37,364
And somehow,

214
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:41,374
it has helped me forget
the things I'm going through.

215
00:10:45,414 --> 00:10:47,416
You literally saved my life.

216
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,876
Twice.

217
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:50,335
When...

218
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:52,051
I almost drowned,

219
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:54,339
and when I couldn't breathe.

220
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:58,391
And you helped me take out the trash.

221
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:03,563
You helped me piece myself together.

222
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,851
I discovered who I was.

223
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:10,522
So if I happen to make you smile,
I don't know that I do.

224
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,025
All I want is,

225
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:15,825
for you to be happy, too.

226
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:19,698
You saved my life, Sophie.

227
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,082
No…

228
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:24,495
I tried saving your life.

229
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:27,122
But I failed.

230
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:35,678
That's enough of that!

231
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:38,515
Luuuululululu!

232
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:40,552
Come on! That's enough!

233
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,771
Luuuululululu!

234
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:48,393
Luuuululululu!

235
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,814
Luuuululululu!

236
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:12,459
Luuuululululu!

237
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:15,045
Luuuululululu!

238
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:18,090
Luuuululululu!

239
00:12:33,272 --> 00:12:34,863
I'll miss you!

240
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:38,819
I'll miss you, too.

241
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:44,408
Luuuululululu!

242
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:58,277
Here.

243
00:12:58,297 --> 00:12:59,214
For the road.

244
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:01,466
This is a lot.

245
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:03,825
These aren't our leftovers from earlier.

246
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:06,763
No, I made some quick-fix food for you.

247
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:08,037
Where's yours?

248
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:08,955
What?

249
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:12,035
I don't need them. I'm sure
they'll serve food where I'm staying.

250
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,818
It's just in the next town.

251
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:15,169
Okay.

252
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,047
Oh, wait.

253
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:24,053
Surprise!

254
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:26,514
Wow!

255
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,093
What is this?

256
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:29,125
Go on, open it!

257
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:39,344
Where did you get this?

258
00:13:39,713 --> 00:13:41,106
Somewhere in town.

259
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:43,383
When I saw that, I was reminded of you.

260
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,267
Actually, Abi...

261
00:13:46,553 --> 00:13:49,014
I want to confess something.

262
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:54,609
Since we're parting ways anyway…

263
00:13:55,604 --> 00:13:57,320
I know you're going to get upset.

264
00:13:57,623 --> 00:14:00,125
But what can go wrong? We won't be
seeing each other anymore, right?

265
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,842
But I hope you don't hate me
for this, please?

266
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,255
Just get to the point.

267
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,747
What else are you going to tell me
apart from you like me?

268
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,243
- Ouch.
- Get over yourself!

269
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:11,453
But it's true!

270
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:12,412
Even so.

271
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:14,295
So what were you going to say?

272
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:21,421
I was the one who killed Kaki.

273
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,695
What?

274
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:23,882
Well, I thought…

275
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:26,677
I thought she had to be watered everyday.

276
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:29,388
That's what you do to plants, right?
Water them regularly?

277
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:32,563
I didn't know the rules
were different with cactuses.

278
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:34,248
Sorry about that.

279
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:35,666
Is that it?

280
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,695
Go on, then. Get mad at me. I'll take it.

281
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:39,690
No, I'm not mad.

282
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:42,176
I thought you were going to
confess something else.

283
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:43,800
Like what?

284
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,093
I don't know…

285
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:47,161
That you changed your mind...

286
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,747
That you can't get me out of your head…

287
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:52,077
That you can't bear to let me go after all.

288
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:54,852
The nerve! Get over yourself!

289
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:57,213
You're so sensitive!

290
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,217
What's going to happen to your B and B?

291
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,814
My mom hired a caretaker to take over.

292
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,981
I'll just hand them the key.

293
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:05,816
I'll take care of it.

294
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:06,983
You sure you're going to be okay?

295
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:07,734
Yes!

296
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,183
I got it covered.

297
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:10,310
Okay.

298
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,830
It's getting late.

299
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,164
We don't want go beyond the curfew.

300
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:16,149
Okay. Let's go.

301
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,416
Let's go.

302
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:21,904
Thank you, Abi.

303
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:23,281
Thank you, Sophie.

304
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,403
- Okay.
- Let's go?

305
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:05,233
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

306
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:08,128
Let me help you.

307
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:09,869
Alright. Thank you.

308
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,042
Bye, Lulu.

309
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:23,627
Bye, Lulu.

310
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:28,965
Thank you.

311
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:44,529
Sophie, don't cry, Sophie.

312
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,615
Please, don't cry.

313
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,453
I told you not to cry.
You're such a crybaby, Sophie.

314
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:10,257
I already miss you, Lulu.

315
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:45,083
It's a shame you never met Kakie.

316
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:49,546
What should I name you?

317
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:55,218
I know.

318
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:57,143
Lulubel.

319
00:17:58,388 --> 00:18:00,390
Hi, Lulubel.

320
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:09,482
You know what, Sophie will be glad
when she learns your name.

321
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:12,944
Who's Sophie?

322
00:18:13,945 --> 00:18:15,322
She's your mom.

323
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:19,951
Well, yes, I am your mom.

324
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:24,956
Hey, she's not a grouch.

325
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,501
She's actually really fun to be with.

326
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,379
She's funny,

327
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:34,633
and a crybaby.

328
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:39,804
Who, me?

329
00:18:40,513 --> 00:18:41,264
About to cry?

330
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,891
Of course not.

331
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:45,310
There's just dust in my eye.

332
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:53,360
I haven't even left and I miss her already.

333
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,042
I already miss you, Lulu.

334
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,905
Oh, Abi.

335
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:35,741
What should I do now?

336
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:39,406
Sure, I'm a loudmouth…

337
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:42,450
I'm annoying…

338
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:48,212
But I won't give up.

339
00:19:53,712 --> 00:19:55,720
I won't give up on you, Abi.

340
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:00,099
Abi.

341
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:01,200
Sophie.

342
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:02,512
Are you back in Manila?

343
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:03,911
That was quick.

344
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:05,871
No. I'm not yet in Manila.

345
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:07,439
What? Where are you?

346
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,394
Is there a problem?
Did your ride break down?

347
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:10,776
No, no, no.

348
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:12,987
Then what happened?

349
00:20:13,314 --> 00:20:15,358
I'm still here at the B and B.

350
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:17,116
I didn't leave.

351
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:21,948
I know you've arrived at your new lodging.

352
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,408
But don't worry about it, okay?

353
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:26,411
I just wanted to let you know that
I didn't really leave.

354
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:27,687
Why?

355
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:31,380
Abi.

356
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,443
I know you've made up your mind.

357
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:38,596
But I've also decided,

358
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:40,114
that I'll be here.

359
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:42,533
I'll support whatever your decision is.

360
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:44,577
Really?

361
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:46,662
Why are you doing this?

362
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:48,516
I'm not really sure either.

363
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:49,559
All I know is,

364
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,978
I want to be here for you until the end.

365
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,654
Even if you get hurt?

366
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:57,323
Pain will always be there.

367
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:59,241
It's not going anywhere.

368
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:04,282
But wouldn't it be nice if you had someone
with you as you go through it?

369
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,625
Can I be with you?

370
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:17,629
That was fast. How did you get here?

371
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:19,672
Bonfire?

372
00:21:20,374 --> 00:21:21,280
Do you want to?

373
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:23,474
Barbeque?

374
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:25,470
Camping?

375
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,686
Slurp, slurp?

376
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:37,446
Let's go.

377
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:39,734
Come on.

378
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:45,615
Wow, I see the effort. Love the lights!

379
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:47,617
Of course. So it looks special.

380
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:53,206
What are we watching?

381
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:56,292
Just wait for it. It's a surprise! Relax.

382
00:21:57,877 --> 00:21:58,878
Wait, wait, wait.

383
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:02,340
How did you know that I didn't leave?

384
00:22:03,091 --> 00:22:04,634
I didn't.

385
00:22:07,512 --> 00:22:08,930
I just wanted to come back.

386
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:11,188
Come back to you.

387
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:17,939
You ready?

388
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:20,108
Game!

389
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:25,071
What's that?!

390
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:27,323
Oh my god! You don't remember this?

391
00:22:39,711 --> 00:22:41,135
What is this? Why did you...

392
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:43,715
I took a video of you
while you were sleeping.

393
00:22:56,769 --> 00:22:58,235
You always have saliva dripping
from your mouth.

394
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:15,336
Oh my god!

395
00:23:23,713 --> 00:23:25,721
So wasted!

396
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:29,767
What's this?!

397
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:33,270
Watch this!

398
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:37,733
Just when you thought you can leave
everything behind...

399
00:23:39,854 --> 00:23:42,404
When you thought you were drowning...

400
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,492
Oh my god!

401
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:50,031
Somebody comes along to save you.

402
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,494
That was you, Sophie.

403
00:23:58,206 --> 00:24:01,000
You're the one who gave meaning to my life

404
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:03,836
just when I thought it was ending.

405
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:07,805
When in fact, it was just beginning.

406
00:24:09,592 --> 00:24:11,844
This is the start of our life together.

407
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:29,326
Yes!

408
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:33,116
Thank you.

409
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:35,994
I'm glad you liked it.

410
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:37,620
Of course!

411
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:50,008
Sophie.

412
00:24:54,053 --> 00:24:55,138
I like you.

413
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:22,332
Are you okay?

414
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:25,685
Hey.

415
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,926
Are you having an attack?

416
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:30,930
Drink this.

417
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:37,978
Why did you throw it?

418
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,177
So, what do we call this?

419
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:18,686
A quaranfling?

420
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:21,282
Or...

421
00:26:21,307 --> 00:26:22,564
Quaranthing?

422
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:24,268
Quarantungs!

423
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:31,526
Luuuuululululu!

424
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:33,861
Luuuuululululu!

425
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:36,239
- Luuuuululululu!
- Luuuuululululu!

426
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:50,336
I'll undergo chemotherapy first
to shrink the tumor.

427
00:26:51,963 --> 00:26:53,464
Then I'll undergo operation.

428
00:26:56,717 --> 00:26:58,052
So?

429
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,346
I'll do it.

430
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,192
Sophie, I'm scared.

431
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,107
Don't be.

432
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:15,325
I'm here. We're going to face it together.

433
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,821
You're not alone.

434
00:27:22,285 --> 00:27:24,579
Just promise me that you'll fight, okay?

435
00:27:26,622 --> 00:27:27,582
For you.

436
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:30,251
No!

437
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:33,296
