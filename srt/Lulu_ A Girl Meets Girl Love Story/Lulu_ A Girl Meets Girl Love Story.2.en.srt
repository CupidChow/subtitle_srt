1
00:00:02,942 --> 00:00:03,754
Ma,

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:07,299
I'm going to deactivate
my social media accounts, alright?

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,552
It will be harder for me
to move on if I stay online.

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,762
Chef, I'm resigning.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,599
I want to travel.

6
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:17,893
What?

7
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:22,439
Help!!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,571
Miss?

9
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:30,822
Are you okay?

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,200
"Lulu"

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,600
(Episode 2: Happy Birthday to You!)

12
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:19,454
Are you okay?

13
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:27,671
Are you okay?

14
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:37,097
Ouch.

15
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:39,091
Are you okay?

16
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:42,102
Shofie.

17
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:43,395
Huh?

18
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:47,608
Sophie.
That's my name.

19
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:49,693
Abi.

20
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:53,238
Aren't you going to…

21
00:01:58,547 --> 00:01:59,703
CPR?

22
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:03,040
No need.

23
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:05,542
Ah, right.

24
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,143
Looks like I'm all good.

25
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:07,919
Ouch.

26
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:09,212
Ouch.

27
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,090
Thank you.

28
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:13,467
Sorry.

29
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:15,969
It's my first time drowning.

30
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,264
That's what usually
happens in the movies, right?

31
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,682
When somebody saves you.

32
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,188
That's called, uh… "meet cute".

33
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,729
"Meet cute!"

34
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,483
Because they met and it's cute!

35
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,859
- Cute!
- Huh?

36
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,323
Sorry.
I'm a little out of it.

37
00:02:37,117 --> 00:02:41,177
Must be the seawater I swallowed earlier.

38
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:41,995
Maybe.

39
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:44,456
Anyway.

40
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:46,583
Wanna go in first?

41
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,226
You're soaking wet.

42
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,444
You should get changed.

43
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:50,905
Huh?

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,924
Over there.

45
00:02:54,923 --> 00:02:55,967
Is that yours?

46
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:56,968
Yep.

47
00:02:57,153 --> 00:02:58,095
It's a B and B.

48
00:02:58,273 --> 00:03:01,848
Sounds great! I've been looking for
a B and B around here.

49
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,102
I'll go get my things.

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,186
Okay.

51
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:12,442
You okay?

52
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,860
Yes, of course!

53
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,986
Can you walk?

54
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,488
Yes, I can do it.

55
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,031
- Sure?
- Go straight. Yes!

56
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:18,824
Alright.

57
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:19,825
I'll follow you.

58
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,786
Ouch!

59
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,747
No, go ahead! Yeah.

60
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,468
Let me help you with that.

61
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:40,303
Okay, sure. Thank you.

62
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,015
Can you take this?

63
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,226
- Oh! This is so cute!
- Yup!

64
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:54,985
Welcome to my B and B!

65
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,365
- Come in.
- Okay.

66
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:03,160
Sorry about the mess.

67
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:05,537
There's another room.
Upstairs.

68
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:06,980
- It's clean.
- Ah, okay. Sure!

69
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:07,748
Alright.

70
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:08,999
This way.

71
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:14,421
Don't judge me, okay?

72
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:15,964
I'm not messy.

73
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,007
Though it's not obvious.

74
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:17,992
Of course.

75
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,052
Oh, and by the way. Ouch...

76
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:25,156
It's a bit heavy to lift, but it opens.

77
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,182
It just needs a little push.

78
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,809
I'll help you. I'll open it.

79
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,726
- Really?
- Yeah.

80
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,436
Okay, then.
Let me hold that for you. I will...

81
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,380
Alright.

82
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:35,108
Ouch.
You poked me.

83
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,109
Oh, sorry!

84
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,028
I meant your cactus.

85
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,029
Ah, okay.

86
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,030
Sorry.

87
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,617
Excuse me.

88
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:48,955
Lift that up.

89
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,598
It really is heavy.

90
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,749
I told you.

91
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:55,320
Ah! Not bad.

92
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,463
Ouch.

93
00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:58,131
Oh, sorry.

94
00:04:58,445 --> 00:04:59,382
Thank you!

95
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,367
Thank you.

96
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:10,060
What did I tell you?

97
00:05:10,403 --> 00:05:13,104
- There's a decent room up here.
- Yeah.

98
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:14,439
That's nice.

99
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,568
I forgot your towel.

100
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:21,321
Is it okay if I go get it downstairs?

101
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:22,781
Then I'll run back up.

102
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:23,598
Yeah, sure.

103
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:24,658
Okay.

104
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,136
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Here, take this back.

105
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,079
Your prickly cactus.

106
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,888
Okay.

107
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,290
- Stay there, yeah?
- Yeah.

108
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:34,125
Enjoy.

109
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,296
Ouch.

110
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:00,902
Kakie,

111
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:04,014
this is our new adventure.

112
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,141
Are you ready?

113
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,351
Because I'm ready.

114
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:47,626
Abi, I've brought you the...

115
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:49,008
Ah, boobies!

116
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,202
You left the door open, so…

117
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,579
I let myself in.

118
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,747
Here's your towel.

119
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,852
Relax.

120
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,693
We're both women.
We both have boobies.

121
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:07,510
Alright.

122
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:09,554
Hey, thanks.
Thank you for this.

123
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:11,234
You're welcome.

124
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:20,023
You alright? Need something?

125
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,985
I was just going to show you
where the restroom is.

126
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,695
You must've been holding it
in the whole day.

127
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,113
Oh, okay.

128
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:27,989
Alright, then.

129
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:28,807
Let's go.

130
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:35,480
By the way, if you need tissue…

131
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,307
toothpaste, toothbrush, soap…

132
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,059
It's all in there.

133
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,403
- Yes.
- Okay.

134
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:46,091
Extra towels!

135
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:47,008
Yeah.

136
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:49,219
As you can see…

137
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,221
If you need something,

138
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:52,931
- just get some from here.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,557
- Feel at home.
- Okay.

140
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,604
And uh…ouch!

141
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:02,857
And over here.
That's the laundry basket.

142
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,110
Put all of your dirty clothes in there.

143
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:06,194
Okay.

144
00:08:06,765 --> 00:08:08,071
Alright.

145
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:11,157
And of course, the toilet.

146
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:14,619
Shower, heater…

147
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:16,804
If you want to use it,

148
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,499
turn it clockwise.
And when you're done,

149
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:21,167
just turn it off.

150
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,669
Yes. Okay.

151
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,229
You might need to poop.

152
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,971
Here, I have an air freshener.

153
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:33,054
Candles and matches, too.

154
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:34,681
Okay.

155
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:36,099
Got it.

156
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:37,016
Noted.

157
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:39,394
Oh! Okay.

158
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,666
I'll cook dinner for us,
by the way.

159
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,611
For your welcome meal,
and also my way of saying thank you.

160
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:50,155
Sure! Thank you.

161
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:55,326
Wanna take a shower?

162
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:56,786
Huh?

163
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,621
Together?

164
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,623
No, I meant after me.

165
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:01,483
Ah! Yes!

166
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,375
Of course.

167
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,543
Of course.

168
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:04,711
Yes…

169
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,796
- Yes.
- Yeah, so…

170
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,340
Because you're soaked.
You might get sick.

171
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,801
I'll go get changed.

172
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,653
- Yeah.
- Okay.

173
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,971
So, I'll see you later.

174
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,140
Yes. Later.

175
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:18,641
- Okay.
- Okay.

176
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,185
Enjoy your shower.

177
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:22,520
Yeah. Okay. Thank you!

178
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:23,897
Thank you. Bye!

179
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,989
What the hell was that, Sophie?

180
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:35,867
Enjoy your shower?

181
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,411
What do you think this is?
Some five-star hotel?

182
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:40,079
With a bath tub?

183
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:41,623
Rose petals?

184
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:43,458
What is wrong with you?

185
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,210
You're so tactless.

186
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,717
In fairness,

187
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:56,221
I think I got lucky
with the tomato salad.

188
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:02,894
Wow!

189
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:04,312
Thank you!

190
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:05,913
I hope you don't mind.

191
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,233
This is all I could manage.

192
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,318
No, it's okay!
I'll still eat all of it.

193
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,278
I even burnt the porkchop.

194
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,430
- That's okay.
- Sit down!

195
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:50,942
Let's eat?

196
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:52,777
Sure! You go first.

197
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:02,912
How is it?

198
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:06,958
Is it good?

199
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,045
You can never go wrong
with fried porkchop.

200
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:19,637
It's too salty!

201
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,641
You said it was okay.
You said it was good.

202
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,810
It's horrid!

203
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:27,312
It's because you burnt it.

204
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:30,231
And you over-seasoned it with salt.

205
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,649
Really? Sorry!

206
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,234
Just leave it.

207
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:35,195
It's okay!
I can fix this.

208
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,113
I just have to neutralize the salt.

209
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:39,574
Yeah. We can still eat that.

210
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,202
Oh! Where are your condiments?

211
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:44,595
In the cupboard.

212
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,330
Alright.

213
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:46,831
Hold on.

214
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:47,649
Yes.

215
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:55,882
Hello, Ma?

216
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,762
Sorry, Ma. My phone died.
I just charged my phone.

217
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:04,515
Thank you, Ma.

218
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:06,893
Yes, Ma.

219
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:09,687
A guest checked in earlier today.

220
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:13,107
A woman.

221
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:16,110
Okay, Ma.

222
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:17,237
Alright.

223
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:18,780
Okay. Bye.

224
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:23,201
Here you are.

225
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:25,539
Let's eat.

226
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:34,712
Answer it. It's okay.

227
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:36,673
It's not important.

228
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:40,843
No, really.
It's fine, you can take the call.

229
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:49,394
Hello, Tricia.

230
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,271
Yeah.

231
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,481
Ah, thank you.

232
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,941
Yes, yes.

233
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,169
I'll send you the address later.

234
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,696
Okay? Are we done?

235
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:02,072
My god.

236
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:03,789
I will.

237
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,576
Alright. Thank you!

238
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,577
Bye!

239
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:14,877
Oh my god!

240
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,046
Delicious!

241
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,715
The saltiness is gone!

242
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:21,525
It's not bitter anymore.
What did you do?

243
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,803
For real. That is so good.

244
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:26,305
That's just vinegar and garlic.

245
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,020
Want dessert?

246
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:33,146
Sure!

247
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:36,290
You mean I can serve it now?

248
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,525
Cause I'm like that.

249
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,486
Sometimes I have some dessert,
then I have something else, then...

250
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:41,654
Really?

251
00:13:42,216 --> 00:13:43,406
Me, too!

252
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,049
Really?

253
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,036
What I do is, I have something sweet first,

254
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:50,913
and then I shift to something salty.

255
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,499
Then I go back to the sweetness.

256
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:55,142
- Really?
- Yeah.

257
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,435
Okay, I'll go get it.

258
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,503
Yeah. Go ahead.

259
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,629
Please make space for it.

260
00:13:58,654 --> 00:13:59,655
Okay, sure.

261
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:11,559
Here it is.

262
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,190
It's my birthday, by the way.

263
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:18,274
Huh?

264
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:19,650
Really?

265
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:21,235
Why?

266
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:22,904
It's my birthday, too!

267
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,798
No way?!

268
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,824
Really?

269
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,534
I'm serious!

270
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:30,911
We have the same birthday!

271
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,914
Oh my god! Are you sure?

272
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,249
What about you?
Have you met anyone with the same birthday?

273
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,250
I've met some people.

274
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,418
Back in High School,

275
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,322
there were two of us
and then another one in College.

276
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,466
I share the same birthday
with one of my workmate.

277
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:47,553
Did you turn 25, too?

278
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:49,055
No, I'm 30.

279
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:51,490
- Thirty!
- Yeah.

280
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,409
Come on, let's eat cake.

281
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,227
Let's go.

282
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:03,069
Happy birthday to you…

283
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,945
To us!

284
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:12,662
Yum!

285
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,038
It's delicious!

286
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:15,331
Yummy.

287
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,165
It's good!

288
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:19,493
Okay, moving on to the second bottle.

289
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,212
Yes!

290
00:15:21,597 --> 00:15:23,548
More alcohol!

291
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:25,133
Yes!

292
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,801
I'm surprised you brought your own drinks!

293
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,637
Yes, I have more in the car.

294
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,222
Wow.

295
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:32,765
Are you an alcoholic?

296
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,558
Wow! Just because I have a stash,

297
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,893
you think I'm an alcoholic?

298
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:37,520
Why do you have so many?

299
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:39,397
No reason. Supplies.

300
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,899
Liquors are expensive in resorts, so…

301
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,445
So, how long do you intend to travel?

302
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,905
Maybe… a month?

303
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:52,285
For as long as I
and my wallet will let me.

304
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,844
Wow, a month?

305
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,787
Yeah!

306
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,040
I'm planning to stay here
with you for a week.

307
00:15:58,496 --> 00:16:01,210
Then I'll drive to the next cities…

308
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:04,547
No plan,
wherever the road takes me.

309
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:08,176
Yes! For people who don't have plans!
Cheers!

310
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:15,367
Yes!

311
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,188
What about you, what's your plan?

312
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,624
Hey, what's gotten into you?

313
00:16:40,536 --> 00:16:41,375
Hey...

314
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,754
Honestly?

315
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:49,383
I haven't made any plans for myself.

316
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:52,512
I planned to leave the city…

317
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:54,847
Leave everything behind!

318
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:58,601
To start my new life here at this...

319
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,868
B and B…

320
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,354
Be a Manager!

321
00:17:02,406 --> 00:17:03,439
But I've got nothing.

322
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,316
Every single one of my plans is a failure.

323
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:09,303
Is that it?

324
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,881
A little fixing will do
and this place will look great.

325
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,199
Wait.

326
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:15,368
I have a question.

327
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:18,537
Both this hut
and that building over there...

328
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:19,914
will you be renting them out?

329
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,877
So, here's the thing.

330
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,588
Where I'm staying…

331
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:31,092
I really want to make it
into a dorm-type accommodation.

332
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:38,032
And this hut will serve as
the premium lodge or something!

333
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,850
That can be the common area...

334
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,394
You can do your own cooking…

335
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:44,021
Then you can just chill
and hang out over there at the gazebo.

336
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,439
Something like that.

337
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,050
But nothing. It's all just stupid plans.

338
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,363
Cheers! Yes!

339
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,449
Cheers! Stand up! Drink up!

340
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,867
Yes! Cheers!

341
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,703
Cheers! Cheers!

342
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:04,458
Oh, god.

343
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:09,380
So.

344
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,049
So, these two buildings…

345
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:13,801
They're your properties?

346
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:14,844
Ah, no.

347
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:17,387
They're owned by my mom and her siblings.

348
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,015
They inherited it a long time ago.

349
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,890
But...

350
00:18:20,296 --> 00:18:22,059
no one's managing it anymore.

351
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:23,727
Some of them are now living abroad.

352
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:26,755
My aunts and uncles
are too old for this, so…

353
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:28,357
It's down to me, Miss Good-for-nothing!

354
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:31,027
I'll help you.

355
00:18:35,992 --> 00:18:37,407
But you're my tenant!

356
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,119
You should be relaxing!

357
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,288
I can't possibly make you work.

358
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,373
I have nothing to do anyway.

359
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,460
And I'm not chasing deadlines anymore.

360
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:49,946
Don't you have a job waiting for you?

361
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:51,672
I already resigned.

362
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:56,260
My life is well-planned.

363
00:18:57,257 --> 00:18:59,305
Now I plan to break all of my plans.

364
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:05,144
So, yeah. No plans.
I'll spend a couple of months unwinding.

365
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:07,730
That's my decision.

366
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:08,564
Cheers!

367
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:10,524
Cheers!

368
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,738
Decisions, decisions...

369
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,698
No plans in life.

370
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:22,119
That's where all our problems come from:
our life decisions.

371
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,746
So for tonight?

372
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:30,836
My decision is to get wasted as fuck!

373
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,008
I'm a heavy-drinker!

374
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,176
- You are?
- Mm-hm.

375
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,821
I only drink hard liquor, do you know that?

376
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,015
With gin lapad and the like!

377
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,905
Squeeze in some lime juice in there!

378
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,996
And ever tried that
orange juice drink you mix it into?

379
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,564
- Uh-huh?
- The sickly orange drink?

380
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:55,277
The one that makes your pee orange, too?

381
00:19:55,617 --> 00:19:56,612
Drinks like that!

382
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,905
And rum-coke…

383
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,048
I'm good with simple choices.

384
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:03,376
My taste got elevated

385
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:05,371
was when I met my ex.

386
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,790
Ex-boyfriend.

387
00:20:08,222 --> 00:20:09,792
Ex-fiancé.

388
00:20:10,203 --> 00:20:13,687
I started going for red wine, white wine,

389
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,523
whiskey, cognac...

390
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,716
"Cognac."

391
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,552
Cognac!

392
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,429
And I'm sorry.

393
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,681
Don't be. That's okay!
I don't mind!

394
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:26,183
Why should you apologize?

395
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:28,089
Why?

396
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,312
Are you my ex?

397
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:33,357
Were you the one who proposed to me?

398
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:34,817
Huh?

399
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:38,670
Were you the one who proposed
but fucked me over?

400
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,613
Was that you?

401
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:41,490
And then what?

402
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:45,459
You'll say sorry, try to win me back?

403
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:46,929
Then after that,

404
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,956
just when I'm about to fold,

405
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,750
you'll disappear!

406
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:55,504
That's it? Then out of the blue,
you're with somebody else?

407
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:57,339
And then… That's it!

408
00:20:58,395 --> 00:20:59,450
That's it, then.

409
00:21:03,668 --> 00:21:05,289
Yes! Cheers!

410
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,499
My gosh.

411
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,445
Cheers, Abi! Cheers!

412
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:13,898
Holy smokes.

413
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,733
Is there a hole in your tummy?

414
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,469
Why aren't you even a little bit tipsy?

415
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:23,140
I think I've met my match.

416
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:26,143
I've got an idea.

417
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:27,453
Let's play a game.

418
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:28,746
Huh?

419
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:31,499
Let's play something?

420
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,069
You know me.

421
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:34,001
I tend to get leg cramps.

422
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,420
My legs are going numb from
sitting too long. Let's play!

423
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:41,441
Ever heard of the game
Cross, Mary, Shake! Shake! Shake?

424
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,801
- I know that game!
- You know that game?

425
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,554
- Yes, I do.
- Okay, okay. Come on, game, let's play.

426
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:51,460
Cross, Mary, Shake! Shake! Shake!

427
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,022
Shot! Woo!

428
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,398
Oh, sorry! Woo!

429
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,258
Your turn!

430
00:21:58,113 --> 00:21:59,093
You're cheating!

431
00:22:03,518 --> 00:22:05,825
This girl's wasted as hell.

432
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,602
But she's attractive.

433
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,831
Annoying. Chatty.

434
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,624
Overfamiliar.

435
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,377
Annoyingly persistent!

436
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,755
Every trait I dislike in a girl...

437
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,007
she has all of them.

438
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,301
But...

439
00:22:24,832 --> 00:22:26,637
she makes me smile.

440
00:22:27,257 --> 00:22:28,389
I don't know.

441
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:30,391
Abi, behave!

442
00:22:31,748 --> 00:22:34,645
You're not here to look for love.

443
00:22:35,544 --> 00:22:36,647
Be cool.

444
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:43,904
My turn! Hang on.

445
00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:48,258
Hoo! Abi! Abi!

446
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:52,037
Cross, Mary, Shake! Shake! Shake!

447
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:54,748
You're batshit drunk.

448
00:22:56,452 --> 00:22:58,085
She's cute, I guess.

449
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,504
Actually, she's not cute.

450
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:02,089
She's pretty.

451
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:04,592
Handsome, I should say.

452
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,303
I'm getting confused.

453
00:23:07,328 --> 00:23:08,762
What's happening to you, Sophie?

454
00:23:09,732 --> 00:23:12,099
Her sultry eyes…

455
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,852
they seem to whisper:

456
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:18,188
"Sophie, be my girlfriend."

457
00:23:19,153 --> 00:23:21,358
Please, not me!

458
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,193
But they say,

459
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,155
that when you smile every time
that person is talking to you,

460
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,657
it means you like them, too.

461
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:32,161
Calm down, Sophie.

462
00:23:32,973 --> 00:23:34,455
You're not smiling.

463
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:36,707
You're not smiling!

464
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,761
Abi, you're drunk!

465
00:23:49,982 --> 00:23:52,739
You're weakshit, Abi.

466
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,142
That was a good one. Oh, sorry!

467
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,352
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

468
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,997
At least we got to burn what we ate
and sweat out the alcohol.

469
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,008
Yeah. True, true, true.

470
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,069
Yes!

471
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,073
What a champ!

472
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:11,700
Are you religious?

473
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,204
No, but I'm faithful.

474
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:17,998
How does that work?

475
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:23,892
I do believe in God,
but I don't go to mass religiously.

476
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:26,920
Or do, you know, Catholic stuff.

477
00:24:27,502 --> 00:24:28,467
What about you?

478
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:30,679
Are you Catholic?

479
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:35,015
Yes. I'm religious.

480
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:36,852
Used to be.

481
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:43,524
My ex loved attending church events.

482
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:46,610
Events like these.

483
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:50,322
Events like hoo! But he's a cheater!
He'll just lead you on!

484
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:53,867
Sorry, sorry!

485
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,578
I brought up my ex again. Damn it.

486
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,205
No, it's fine. Feel free.

487
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,248
No worries.

488
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,335
You're unfair!

489
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,127
Why?

490
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:09,132
I noticed I'm the only one talking
about her ex. Let's hear your story!

491
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,717
Are you going to let me rant
the whole night?

492
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:11,885
What for?

493
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:15,681
That's why they're called your 'ex'.
They shouldn't matter anymore.

494
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:17,808
They're in the past, right? So…

495
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,811
Well, then, my bad.

496
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,246
No, I mean I've moved on.

497
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,774
That was like, what, four years ago?

498
00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:29,734
Four years? It's been that long.

499
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:36,577
Do you have something to ask me?

500
00:25:36,847 --> 00:25:38,412
Well, not really.

501
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:42,166
What's there to ask when you
obviously haven't moved on yet.

502
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:43,667
Hey!

503
00:25:44,057 --> 00:25:47,963
Moving on from someone
is different from forgiving them.

504
00:25:48,736 --> 00:25:51,383
- Mmm…
- I know that I've moved on.

505
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,178
But forgiveness is tough, Abi.

506
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:58,086
80%.

507
00:25:58,522 --> 00:25:59,975
What's 80%?

508
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:03,312
You've only moved on by 80%.

509
00:26:04,252 --> 00:26:07,900
Because if you've moved on 100%,

510
00:26:07,974 --> 00:26:10,360
then you should have forgiven him already.

511
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:12,905
Do you like me?

512
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,866
Honestly.

513
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,118
I think you like me.

514
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,846
The way you've been looking at me…
I think you have a thing for me.

515
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,041
The way you move,

516
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:26,210
while you're looking at me.

517
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,879
I don't mind it.

518
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:30,714
It's just that,

519
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:33,842
that sort of thing's
not on my mind right now.

520
00:26:34,285 --> 00:26:35,260
Besides,

521
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:37,638
you're a lesbian

522
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:39,264
and I'm straight.

523
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:40,974
You are so drunk!

524
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,268
No, seriously!

525
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,212
Are you going to ask me out?

526
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,857
You know what the problem is,
with straight girls like you?

527
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:52,486
When you meet someone like us,

528
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:55,989
you immediately assume we're into you.

529
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,242
You think we like you.

530
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:00,077
Let's take you for example.

531
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:01,270
Since you're straight,

532
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:04,748
does that mean you just
fall in love with every guy?

533
00:27:07,383 --> 00:27:09,878
Cheers, Abi! Yes!

534
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:14,883
Good point!

535
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,595
That's why I chose a co-ed school.

536
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:21,098
There's a lot of lesbians.

537
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:23,100
They'll just ask me out for sure.

538
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:25,644
What's wrong with that?

539
00:27:26,248 --> 00:27:29,064
I'll tell you what's wrong.

540
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:31,275
I'm worried I might give in!

541
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,782
Sorry, sorry, Abi.
Oh my god, I'm drunk.

542
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:41,810
Fine, Abi. You win, Abi.

543
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:47,300
You know what, you're cute.

544
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,737
But it's not happening.

545
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:56,592
Happy birthday, Abi!

546
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:04,349
Thank you for saving my life today.

547
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:07,936
Hang on, hang on.

548
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:09,730
Wait.

549
00:28:10,595 --> 00:28:12,399
I can do this.

550
00:28:12,636 --> 00:28:13,817
Wait, wait.

551
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:16,194
Let's fix you up. Lie down.

552
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:17,696
There, much better.

553
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,451
Okay.

554
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:32,502
You're not so bad yourself.

555
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,341
But it's not happening.

556
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,632
Where's my phone?

557
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:29,643
Here.

558
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,061
Ouch.

559
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:33,355
- Your phone.
- Your phone.

560
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:41,405
Ma.

561
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:43,452
Morning.

562
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:47,160
Trish, it's ridiculously early for a call.

563
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:48,704
Huh?

564
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:51,748
E.C.Q.?

565
00:29:52,522 --> 00:29:53,709
E.C.Q.?

566
00:29:53,906 --> 00:29:55,002
What's going to happen?

567
00:29:55,338 --> 00:29:57,671
I have a week to decide where I'm going?

568
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:58,547
Why?

569
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:04,636
If I can't decide within a week,
I'll get stuck there?

570
00:30:05,015 --> 00:30:06,346
What am I going to do?

571
00:30:07,475 --> 00:30:10,600
So I better decide if I'm going home?

572
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:11,727
Or else what?

573
00:30:12,484 --> 00:30:14,521
I'll be in lockdown for a month?

574
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:17,357
Or longer?

575
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,235
Okay, Ma. Alright, I'll think about it.

576
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,864
Okay, Thanks, Trish. I'll think about it.

577
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,124
Lockdown.

578
00:30:35,005 --> 00:30:36,043
Lockdown.

579
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,883
Coffee?

580
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:44,634
Coffee.

581
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,767
You got wasted!

582
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,435
Your drool dried up!

583
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,354
Where?

584
00:30:56,664 --> 00:30:58,164
- You're not joking?
- Right there.

585
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,250
Oh, no. I'm embarrassed.

586
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,693
You were all over the place.

587
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:03,236
You were so rowdy last night.

588
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,322
My head is throbbing.

589
00:31:05,723 --> 00:31:07,366
Drink some water.

590
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,590
"E.C.Q.?" What's going to happen?

591
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,510
Okay, Ma. I'll think about it.

592
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:29,734
Because I'm pretty sure that
this pandemic will drag on, like...

593
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:31,681
Then I'll be stuck here with you.

594
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,228
You can put up a bar!

595
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:38,563
Huh? No way!

596
00:31:38,662 --> 00:31:41,691
I'm no good at those things! Look,
I can't even manage simple shit like this.

597
00:31:42,064 --> 00:31:46,071
You shouldn't be too hard on yourself
and trying to be perfect all the time.

598
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,323
Look how gross my feet are!

599
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:49,408
They're so veiny!

600
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:50,617
You think they're pretty?

601
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:53,954
Stop laughing, Sophie.

602
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:56,773
What's so funny? It's so corny!

603
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,042
You're slipping!

604
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,558
Well, do you know what "Lulu" means?

605
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,936
Do you know how it evolved into "Lulu"?
