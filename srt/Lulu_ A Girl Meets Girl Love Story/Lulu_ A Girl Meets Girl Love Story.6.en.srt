1
00:00:03,097 --> 00:00:05,280
What's important is that
I get you back to Manila.

2
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:08,394
I realized that you're
still the one I love.

3
00:00:08,894 --> 00:00:09,718
"Love"?

4
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:11,513
Don't I deserve a second chance?

5
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:15,417
If you need a second chance-
I meant second serving of coffee,

6
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:16,475
just let me know.

7
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:18,794
Just shout it all out to the sea!

8
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:24,525
What is Love?

9
00:00:24,577 --> 00:00:25,261
What about you?

10
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:26,318
Love is?

11
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:27,888
You.

12
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:29,123
You know…

13
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:30,180
God is Love.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,200
"Lulu"

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,500
(Episode 6: As a Friend)

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,860
Who's your first kiss?

17
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:10,404
Parents?

18
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:11,714
You?

19
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:12,864
Mom.

20
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:15,784
When was your last kiss?

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,786
And I mean your last serious kiss.

22
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:20,205
Two years ago?

23
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,081
You?

24
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:31,466
Are you okay?

25
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:34,761
Oh my god,
are you having an attack?

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,247
Where's your medicine?

27
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,986
Cabinet.

28
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:43,073
Bedroom.

29
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,465
Oh my god, Sophie!

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,282
Here comes the flashback.

31
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:36,291
Happy Birthday to you,

32
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:37,683
to us!

33
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:42,172
Ouch, you pricked me.

34
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:42,980
I'm sorry!

35
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:44,856
I meant,

36
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:46,124
the cactus.

37
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,693
We're close.

38
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:51,797
What the heck?

39
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,949
Why does my flashback look like this?

40
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:56,326
Why is it all Abi?

41
00:02:58,355 --> 00:02:59,413
Abi...

42
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:01,358
please save me…

43
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:02,818
…again.

44
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:05,252
Dammit, Sophie!

45
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:12,859
Oh my god.

46
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,195
Oh my god.

47
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:20,951
Yes.

48
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:22,102
This is it.

49
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:28,469
Oh my god.

50
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:29,803
Sophie.

51
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:31,028
Take this.

52
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:32,295
Take this.

53
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:48,920
Don't leave me.

54
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:52,618
Let's watch the sunrise together.

55
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:54,192
Okay, yes.
We'll do that.

56
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:55,277
Hush now.

57
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:56,778
Lie down.

58
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,077
Abi,

59
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:06,037
you're right.

60
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,664
Life is short.

61
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,749
What if...

62
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:12,669
What if I tell you now…

63
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:14,296
…that I like you?

64
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:35,859
Abi?

65
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:39,488
Abi!

66
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:41,907
Abi, is it sunrise yet?

67
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,328
Hi!

68
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:49,748
Abi.

69
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:51,917
Abi.

70
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:53,627
Abi!

71
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:58,507
Tricia?!

72
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:04,648
Tricia, this is Sophie.

73
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,164
Sophie, this is Tricia.

74
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,141
Abi, what are you doing here?

75
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:13,338
Let's go inside?

76
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:15,674
I'll prepare some refreshments.

77
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,439
Cool down, guys…

78
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,121
Ah, I mean,

79
00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:48,206
you want some coolers?

80
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:51,180
Thank you, Sophie.

81
00:06:06,376 --> 00:06:07,628
So?

82
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,103
We'll just stare at each other.

83
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:11,948
You don't wanna...

84
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:13,233
talk to me?

85
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:13,832
Or…

86
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:17,027
What's the matter?
What do you want to know?

87
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:18,461
And also,

88
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:20,822
how the hell did you get here?

89
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:22,491
Isn't it lockdown already?

90
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:24,493
My uncle has a place here, remember?

91
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:26,094
Two hours away.

92
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:27,704
The next town?

93
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:30,415
You already forgot, didn't you?

94
00:06:31,777 --> 00:06:33,001
Okay, fine. Yeah.

95
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:34,603
Oh, so, what's your plan?

96
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:37,255
Well, I plan to spend my lockdown here.

97
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:39,691
You can stay at our place.

98
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:40,525
If you want to.

99
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,902
So that's your plan?

100
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:43,428
Yeah! Why?

101
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:44,738
What's your problem?

102
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:45,739
What?

103
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:47,935
I don't need a nanny, okay?

104
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,534
Are you keeping an eye on me?

105
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,202
Please stop that.

106
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,371
You? What's your plan?

107
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,232
This is my plan.

108
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:56,942
I'm staying here!

109
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,471
Abi! What is happening to you?

110
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:01,390
You're not answering any of my calls,

111
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:03,475
you block me out of your social media…

112
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:04,476
I didn't block you.

113
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:05,269
Just what?

114
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:07,244
I deactivated all my accounts.

115
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:10,247
That's even worse!
Why would you do that?

116
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:22,133
Too sweet!

117
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,878
Abi, what is going on with you?

118
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,107
You should be enjoying your good luck.

119
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:37,524
You're the next big thing as a chef,

120
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:40,277
and your band's getting famous.

121
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:42,514
You had a nice flat then

122
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:44,556
I find out you've put it up for sale.

123
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:45,784
You said you were just renting it out.

124
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,117
You just ruined everything and...

125
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:49,160
And you still think this is a good plan?

126
00:07:50,022 --> 00:07:52,205
Well, that's my plan, not yours.

127
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:53,608
So why worry?

128
00:07:54,026 --> 00:07:56,209
So your plan is to disappear.

129
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,255
From the world. At your age?

130
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,504
At our age?

131
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:01,241
You're already very accomplished.

132
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,357
You're just going to
walk away from all that?

133
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:03,800
What kind of a plan is that?

134
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:26,475
Hey.

135
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:29,384
Did you run into trouble?

136
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:33,096
We can talk about it.

137
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:37,208
You should just come with me.

138
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:39,796
We can go to
my uncle's house. It's huge.

139
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:41,646
There's a guest house in the back

140
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:43,606
if you want some alone time,
you know what I mean?

141
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,952
And there's a swimming pool, and...

142
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:48,094
I'm not coming with you.

143
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:50,791
So, what now?

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,059
You'll stay here with your woman?

145
00:08:57,547 --> 00:08:59,314
What? It's true.

146
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:03,637
If I knew you were just fooling
around out here with that girl,

147
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:05,070
I wouldn't have come here.

148
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:07,614
I'm not fooling around.

149
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:10,060
Don't mock me.

150
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,134
Don't.

151
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:14,581
What's so great about her

152
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:16,665
that you gave up all your good luck?

153
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,625
She must be bad luck to you.

154
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,294
Bad luck?

155
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,545
Really, now.

156
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:25,340
This woman must be out of her mind.

157
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:28,578
Hey.

158
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:30,178
In the first place,

159
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:32,057
she has a name, okay?

160
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:33,306
Her name is Sophie.

161
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,850
And she's not a scourge.

162
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:37,035
In fact,

163
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:40,438
she's the reason why I'm surviving
these past few days!

164
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:41,967
Awww…

165
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:44,359
Abi…

166
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:45,862
So what am I?

167
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:47,278
Pretend girlfriend?

168
00:09:47,931 --> 00:09:49,072
You're annoying.

169
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:52,686
That's not what I'm trying to do.

170
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:54,771
Then, you know, stop acting like one!

171
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:56,832
Stop being such an asshole!

172
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:57,514
Tricia...

173
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:58,567
Abi!

174
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:01,278
We've been friends since high school.

175
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:03,363
We've been through so much together.

176
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:05,630
Who was by your side
when you had a problem?

177
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:08,049
Who was with you...

178
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:09,926
when your mom died?

179
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,247
Who was with you when you had nothing?

180
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:13,430
Did you forget?

181
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:16,766
I never expected you to be there for me

182
00:10:17,252 --> 00:10:19,644
but still, I kept being here for you!

183
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:23,150
And all I ask for in return
is a little bit of appreciation.

184
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:26,234
And you can't even give me that
after everything we've been through?!

185
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:30,784
Abi…

186
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,787
Do what you want.

187
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,162
Hey! Trish.

188
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:38,288
What?

189
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:40,348
I'm so sorry, okay?

190
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:41,708
I'll make it up to you.

191
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,862
I just need my alone time here!

192
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:44,769
"Alone time."

193
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:46,396
Alone time with that girl?

194
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:47,365
Well...

195
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:48,400
Whatever.

196
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:52,360
You and your drinks can suck it.

197
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:54,220
Trish!

198
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,217
You'll do your laundry, too?

199
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:17,260
Yes.

200
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,495
Put those in with mine.

201
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:21,483
It's okay, I'll do it.
I'll wash my own laundry.

202
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:23,516
Okay.

203
00:11:43,814 --> 00:11:45,399
Go on. Spit it out.

204
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:46,940
What?

205
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,983
I don't know what you mean.

206
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:51,861
Right. I'm sure you've been itching
to say something.

207
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:54,364
Not at all!

208
00:11:54,432 --> 00:11:56,966
I'm giving you your space
and your alone time.

209
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:58,603
I'm sure you won't be
able to help yourself.

210
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:00,470
So go ahead, just let it out.

211
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,190
Look, I'm busy.

212
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:03,692
Okay.

213
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:08,186
You know, I also have a best friend.

214
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:09,548
I knew it.

215
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:10,880
Here it comes.

216
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,844
Hey, I'm just telling a story.

217
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:17,389
But if you don't want to chat

218
00:12:17,414 --> 00:12:19,213
and if you need your space,

219
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:20,208
it's fine.

220
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:21,960
Go ahead.

221
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,988
No, really!

222
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:26,131
Okay. Suit yourself.

223
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:30,984
Okay, fine. Since you keep insisting,
I'll tell you.

224
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:34,112
So, here goes.

225
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:38,059
When I was in college,
I met my best friend Jayla.

226
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,063
We were inseparable. You'd see us
talking all the time.

227
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:44,706
But when I got a boyfriend,

228
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:46,082
Jun,

229
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:49,629
we spent less and less time together…

230
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:52,046
That's what usually happens
once you get a partner, right?

231
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:54,117
They sort of become your best friend,

232
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:56,776
because you talk to them
more often and all that.

233
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,999
But every time I have a problem,
I would still run to Jayla.

234
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,658
When something
significant happens in my life,

235
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:04,993
I would still update him.

236
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:07,203
Okay.

237
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:09,289
That's all.

238
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:11,416
Are you done?

239
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:14,068
My laundry's done spinning.

240
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,923
This is just spin dry.

241
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:21,394
The clothes will still be a little wet.

242
00:13:21,394 --> 00:13:22,562
So you have to

243
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:24,679
hang them up to dry.

244
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,290
Put your laundry in here.

245
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:34,339
Oh, wow! Is that your bra?

246
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:36,466
Of course, whose else?

247
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,844
It's so cute! It has a rainbow!

248
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,809
Hey, no! Don't throw that in there!

249
00:13:44,834 --> 00:13:45,616
Why?

250
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,202
It's handwash only.

251
00:13:48,463 --> 00:13:49,648
It's fine.

252
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:51,608
I'm too lazy to handwash.

253
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,093
Abi, come on. Let me do it.

254
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,334
I'll do them along with mine.

255
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:55,528
I don't want to.

256
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:59,047
Oh! Don't! It might...

257
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,466
The rainbow embroidery might fray.

258
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:02,717
I'll wash it.

259
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:05,078
Forget it. I'll handwash my own bra.

260
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:06,512
Okay.

261
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:16,130
The rainbow-it's a symbol
for being gay, right?

262
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:19,258
Gay, happy, a lot of things…

263
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:25,473
It's also the symbol the LGBT…

264
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:27,894
LMNOPQ…

265
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,202
what was it?

266
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:30,995
Well,

267
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,649
it has a lot of meanings.

268
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,482
Every color means something.

269
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:39,197
Really? So it's like the Philippine flag.

270
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:40,849
Every color has its own meaning.

271
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:44,911
Sun, stars, red and blue.

272
00:14:44,936 --> 00:14:46,803
Well, naturally. That's
what symbols are for.

273
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:50,206
People don't just pick something out
randomly to be their symbol.

274
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,166
Jayla's gay, by the way.

275
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:54,002
Okay?

276
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:57,839
Aren't you surprised?
You haven't even met the person.

277
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:01,067
Well, what kind of guy is named "Jayla"?

278
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:03,736
There we go. I see how it is.

279
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:08,126
Whenever I show curiosity about the LGBT,

280
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:10,076
you make it sound like
I'm being discriminatory.

281
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:11,755
Now, you're the one being presumptuous.

282
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:15,248
What if his mother
just named him Jayla?

283
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:18,318
Or his aunt, or his grandmother…

284
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:19,804
You just assumed he's gay?

285
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:22,171
I'm sorry. You're right.

286
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:26,467
His full name is Jayson Adela.

287
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,636
He shares the name
"Adela" with his grandmother.

288
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,679
Okay.

289
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,956
And well, yes, he is gay.

290
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,042
And hey.

291
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:37,822
There are a lot of straight guys
who have female-sounding names

292
00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:39,365
and it's not their fault.

293
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:41,966
I didn't say anything.

294
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,736
I'll just do this later.

295
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:49,073
Where are you taking that?

296
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:51,701
I'm going to hang them.

297
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:53,244
Just hang on for a sec.

298
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:55,538
Why, shouldn't we hang these?

299
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:57,707
Yeah, but...

300
00:15:57,732 --> 00:16:00,001
I'm not done with my story yet.

301
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,847
Oh my god! Aren't you done?

302
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:04,822
Let's just hear the rest of it
while hanging these.

303
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:09,771
Goodness.

304
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:13,389
It's tough being around someone this moody.

305
00:16:15,193 --> 00:16:16,476
Or am I too chatty?

306
00:16:17,872 --> 00:16:19,061
Am I chatty?

307
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:21,564
Just a little.

308
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:03,422
So, what's next?

309
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:07,161
I thought you weren't
done with your story.

310
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:09,497
I don't want to say anymore.

311
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:11,222
Why?

312
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,211
Because you probably think I'm too chatty.

313
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:17,630
Well, you are.

314
00:17:18,256 --> 00:17:20,857
I just wanted to bond with you.

315
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:25,096
Chat with me,
bond with me, it's all the same.

316
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:31,686
You won't be able to
hold it in. Just say it.

317
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:34,537
I know where you're trying to get at.

318
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:37,123
What are you talking about?

319
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:40,460
I'm just telling you
about my best friend Jayla

320
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:43,880
and how he never got jealous
even when I already had a partner.

321
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:45,673
Okay.

322
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:48,150
But, I mean…

323
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:53,097
I would understand if he got upset if say,
one day, out of the blue…

324
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:56,601
I just left and changed my life
without telling him.

325
00:17:57,922 --> 00:17:58,811
Because, you know?

326
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:01,439
You're important to them.

327
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:03,608
They were there for you
when you needed them.

328
00:18:03,843 --> 00:18:06,627
Then one day, they just
stop hearing from you.

329
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:08,097
No updates, no nothing.

330
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:11,824
Take note: I'm talking
about major life updates.

331
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:15,745
Of course it will hurt them.
It's going to be painful for them.

332
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:18,748
Because it's like you were cast out
by someone you care about.

333
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:22,195
Are you done?

334
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:25,131
Yes.

335
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,923
Okay.

336
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:32,121
You can hang the rest of these.

337
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:36,918
Man, there's so many.

338
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,008
That's what you get
for running your mouth.

339
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:45,374
You couldn't just keep it in.

340
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:47,470
You should just shut up next time.

341
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,763
You're so annoying.

342
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:49,889
You talk too much...

343
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:10,910
Kakie, what happened to you?

344
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:26,067
Kakie.

345
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:27,176
My god.

346
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:43,040
Kakie…

347
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,523
Abi? What's...

348
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:34,884
Are you crying? What happened?

349
00:20:36,383 --> 00:20:37,820
It's Kakie…

350
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:39,739
Oh, no!

351
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:41,709
What happened?

352
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:44,310
I did notice that in your room.

353
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:53,527
Three years.

354
00:20:56,474 --> 00:20:59,852
It's just me and Kakie
for the past three years.

355
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:03,679
Every time I come home,

356
00:21:03,815 --> 00:21:06,025
she's the only one waiting for me.

357
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:10,546
When...

358
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:13,214
She listens to all my angst.

359
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:15,633
Good or bad, she stays with me.

360
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:19,136
Well,

361
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:23,349
Tricia's always there for me, too, but…

362
00:21:24,252 --> 00:21:28,464
there are things that I want
only Kakie to know about.

363
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:33,886
There are things I can't tell anyone else.

364
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:39,142
I have secrets that I
want to keep to myself.

365
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:43,521
I wonder what happened?

366
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:44,245
Maybe…

367
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:46,732
she had to be watered more often?

368
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:48,916
I don't even know.

369
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:53,337
You're not even supposed to
water a cactus all the time.

370
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:57,466
That's how they die, sometimes.

371
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:58,943
And...

372
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:02,596
I don't even water her that often.

373
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:04,584
Is that so?

374
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:07,655
So that's how it works.

375
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:09,714
Abi.

376
00:22:14,093 --> 00:22:16,095
You're so cute!

377
00:22:18,222 --> 00:22:20,224
But why do you look all dried up?

378
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,393
Are you thirsty?

379
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,190
Is your owner neglecting you?

380
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:33,321
There you go.

381
00:22:34,947 --> 00:22:36,240
Drink up, okay?

382
00:22:38,117 --> 00:22:39,677
Don't you worry.

383
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:42,052
I'll take care of you.

384
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,096
There we go…

385
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:46,459
What the heck.

386
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,279
There.

387
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:54,217
Sorry, sorry.

388
00:22:54,735 --> 00:22:55,483
Hey.

389
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,720
This is our secret, okay?

390
00:22:58,221 --> 00:23:00,780
I really want to surprise your parent!

391
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:03,684
Well, see, she's such a grouch!

392
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:04,936
Always in a bad mood!

393
00:23:06,562 --> 00:23:08,454
So I wish you would grow faster.

394
00:23:10,316 --> 00:23:11,734
Here, I'll help.

395
00:23:18,034 --> 00:23:18,881
There you go!

396
00:23:21,953 --> 00:23:23,010
There.

397
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,838
You will grow.
You will grow. You will grow!

398
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:37,333
You will grow.
You will grow. You will grow!

399
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:39,335
Sorry, sorry.

400
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:42,112
Abi, I...

401
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,114
Sorry, I'm being dramatic.

402
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:46,535
No, it's okay.

403
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,063
I understand, Abi…

404
00:23:50,147 --> 00:23:51,857
- It's just that…
- My god.

405
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:53,609
You know,

406
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,904
cactuses are so low-maintenance.

407
00:23:58,072 --> 00:24:00,032
You don't need to water them.

408
00:24:01,117 --> 00:24:02,883
With the right amount of sunlight…

409
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:08,541
Did you know that they
can live up to 100 years?

410
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:16,605
Abi, there's something...

411
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:18,315
But that's life, I guess.

412
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:23,362
The ones you least expect to leave

413
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:26,198
will still be gone from
your life in the end.

414
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:30,870
When it's your time to go, it's time to go.

415
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,834
Goodbye, Kakie.

416
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:53,961
Thank you for everything.

417
00:24:57,923 --> 00:24:59,064
Abi!

418
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,418
Abi.

419
00:25:03,596 --> 00:25:05,264
Kakie, rest in peace.

420
00:25:06,942 --> 00:25:07,881
Abi!

421
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:14,888
Hey, Abi…

422
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,235
Abi.

423
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:19,236
Sophie.

424
00:25:19,737 --> 00:25:21,614
- There's something I want to tell you.
- There's something I want to tell you.

425
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:23,157
What is it?

426
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:25,883
No, you go first.
What were you going to say?

427
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,829
Sophie, you see...

428
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:32,097
You see…

429
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:33,724
You see…

430
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:34,977
Abi!

431
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:35,743
Abi?

432
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:37,186
Hey! Hey, Abi!

433
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:38,954
Hey.

434
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:39,913
Abi?

435
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:42,207
Hey, Abi. Wake up! Oh no.

436
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,250
Abi!

437
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:44,553
Abi!

438
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:45,881
Oh no...

439
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:51,936
Ever since I met you,

440
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:55,314
you did nothing
but help me sort my life out.

441
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,585
I don't get it!

442
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,670
You don't get it
because my life isn't your life.

443
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,563
Hi.

444
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:05,856
Hi.

445
00:26:07,618 --> 00:26:08,859
Lulu party?

446
00:26:10,913 --> 00:26:11,680
Yes, sure.

447
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:12,529
Cheers!

448
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:13,597
Cheers!

449
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:20,896
I like you.

450
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,404
Do you like me?
