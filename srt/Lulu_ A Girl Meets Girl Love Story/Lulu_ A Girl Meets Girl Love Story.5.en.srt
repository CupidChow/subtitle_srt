1
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,007
Why?!

2
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:08,592
Don't you like it here anymore?!

3
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,485
No, it's not like that.

4
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:11,653
Oh my god!

5
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:13,847
You have 50,000 followers!

6
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:15,999
What's the big deal?

7
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,602
Can those followers change my life?

8
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:23,982
Abi...

9
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:25,859
are you mad at me?

10
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:29,488
Sophie!

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,200
"Lulu"

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,600
(Episode 5: Toxic Waste)

13
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:20,889
Sophie.

14
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:26,003
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:28,313
I'm taking you home.

16
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:29,497
What?

17
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:30,449
Sophie!

18
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,963
- Abi, this is Jun.
- Hi.

19
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:38,123
Jun, this is Abi.

20
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,033
I'm her tenant at the B and B.

21
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:40,892
She's my friend.

22
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:42,519
We're close.

23
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:43,729
"Close"?

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,288
How close?

25
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:47,549
We're close.

26
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,060
It's lockdown. How did you get here?

27
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:08,940
Connections.

28
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:11,690
Of course.

29
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:13,508
Why am I not surprised.

30
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:15,719
You're the complete package.

31
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:16,820
Good for you.

32
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:19,072
Sophie, come with me.

33
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:21,016
Why should I?

34
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,726
Pandemic.

35
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:24,619
You don't know what can happen.

36
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:27,356
That's not my concern.

37
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,066
I'm asking

38
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:30,901
why would I go with you?

39
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,736
Sophie, that is enough.

40
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,505
We'll talk about this when
we get back to Manila.

41
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:38,492
What's important is that
I get you back to Manila.

42
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:40,857
What else is there to talk about

43
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:42,371
when we're done?

44
00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:44,139
And besides,

45
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,959
why are you even controlling
me when we've split up?

46
00:02:48,926 --> 00:02:49,762
Look,

47
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,163
I'm not trying to control you.

48
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:53,674
I still care about you.

49
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,176
I know it's going to be hard,

50
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,345
and I don't know if you'll ever forgive me.

51
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,556
But with everything that's
happened to us, I realized…

52
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:02,891
that...

53
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:05,005
you're still the one I love.

54
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,420
I love you.

55
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:07,646
"Love?"

56
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,773
Then why did you hurt me?

57
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:11,066
I know.

58
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,027
I'm not...

59
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:15,987
denying what I did.

60
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:18,490
But I hope, I really do hope that

61
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:20,325
you'll give me another chance.

62
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:23,011
You lied to me for a whole year.

63
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,989
"Will you marry me?"

64
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:28,667
"Because I love you."

65
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,336
More like "will you be my pet?"

66
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,771
Some animal to care for,
cage, keep on a leash…

67
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:35,048
while I,

68
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:39,044
get strung along all-smiles,
lying at peace in our bed.

69
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,696
All the while, you're lying
in someone else's bed!

70
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,630
Scumbag!

71
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,598
My god.

72
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,517
Your words. What happened to you?

73
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:47,602
The way you speak, you're different!

74
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:48,685
Please.

75
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:50,814
Let's just calm down, huh?

76
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:52,691
How am I "different"?

77
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,276
It's still me, Jun.

78
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,736
I just wised up ever since
you fucked me over.

79
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:59,272
I'm so sorry, Sophie. Please.

80
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:01,591
We've been together for five years.
Let's not put that to waste.

81
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:02,653
"Waste".

82
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:04,127
Waste, waste!

83
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:05,431
You're the fucking waste, moron!

84
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:07,164
You're a colossal drum of toxic waste.

85
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:11,188
Did you think about our relationship
when you acted on your boner?

86
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,461
My God!

87
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,795
Your words!

88
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:18,992
Tell me, please. What do I have to do?

89
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,928
Leave me alone.

90
00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:23,889
Just let me be.

91
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,016
That's what you should do.

92
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:28,435
For five years, I took
you into consideration.

93
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,137
Five years, my world revolved
around our relationship.

94
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:33,315
It's time I thought about myself.

95
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:35,859
Sophie, have you forgotten about us?

96
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:39,838
Have you forgotten how it felt like
when we were together?

97
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,282
Don't I deserve a second chance?

98
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,944
Third chance, fourth chance,
infinite chance…

99
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:48,763
Even if it's the chance of a lifetime,
I can no longer let you have it.

100
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:51,958
Hey, guys! Excuse me.

101
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:54,920
Care for some snacks?

102
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,630
Coffee...

103
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,340
and biscuits.

104
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:02,360
- Thank you, Abi.
- Yeah.

105
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:08,767
If you ever need a second chance-
Ah! I meant, second serving of coffee…

106
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,976
just let me know.

107
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:12,312
Ah, no need. Jun was just leaving.

108
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:13,188
Ah, okay.

109
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:15,132
Bye, Jun! Nice to meet you.

110
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:23,031
Sophie.

111
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:25,742
Jun.

112
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:28,787
Have you forgotten about us?

113
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,816
Have you forgotten how it felt like
when we were together?

114
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:36,211
You forgot about everything!

115
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,922
I'm the one who deserves a chance now!

116
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:41,717
I deserve the chance
to take care of myself,

117
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,411
to heal, and to forget you!

118
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,079
Please leave.

119
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:02,587
Sophie?

120
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,448
What?

121
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:06,950
Sophie?

122
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:10,066
Are you okay?

123
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,889
It's okay. Just let it out.

124
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,166
It's okay.

125
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:16,626
Come here.

126
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,638
Please don't be mad at me anymore?

127
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,101
Whatever you are going through-
I may not understand it now,

128
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:35,545
but I'm here for you.

129
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:40,567
Please. Stop being mad at me...
Please speak to me again.

130
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,068
Please, enough.

131
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,194
Please?

132
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:44,446
Please stop.

133
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,157
That's enough.

134
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,199
That's enough.

135
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:49,367
It's over.

136
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:56,416
You're right.

137
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:58,685
That's enough.

138
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:00,921
It's over.

139
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:10,347
Come, let's go for a swim.

140
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:11,442
What?

141
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,642
Come on.

142
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:15,034
Let's go.

143
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,506
Damn.

144
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:29,674
He totally deserved that!

145
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:31,634
I know, right? I didn't
know it was that bad!

146
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:33,428
Drink up, Abi.

147
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:34,621
Yes!

148
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:36,973
To all the cheaters!

149
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,935
Whoa, look at you go!

150
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,947
So good!

151
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:47,775
It's high noon.

152
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:48,860
- Abi.
- Yeah?

153
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,719
Can you maybe...

154
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:52,097
apply sunblock on my back?

155
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:53,473
Sure.

156
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:08,863
Ouch.

157
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:10,715
Hey! Take it easy. Can you be gentler?

158
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:12,175
Do you hate me or something?

159
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:14,411
But it's hot, right? You'll burn!

160
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:17,163
I need to go fast or you'll burn.

161
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:19,541
There you go.

162
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:20,533
That hurts.

163
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:22,419
Okay, that's fine.

164
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:26,881
Want me to put some on you, too?

165
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:28,174
Okay, yeah.

166
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,911
Hey! Can you go faster?

167
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,180
- Hurry up, will you?
- Huh?

168
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,056
You're tickling me!

169
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,266
- You're going so slow.
- I need to spread it out evenly!

170
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,560
Can you do it faster?

171
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,321
You're so fussy! Fine, you're good.

172
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:08,064
Thank you.

173
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,236
I'll take out all the trash, Abi.

174
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,658
But I think I want to shake off all
the remaining dirt, know what I mean?

175
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:21,344
They say that seawater

176
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:24,964
is effective in cleansing all dirt,
and curing any ailment.

177
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:29,135
Actually, seawater is believed
to have healing properties.

178
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:32,605
It can relieve all the pain you're feeling.

179
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,449
All that pent-up anger, fear, sadness.

180
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:36,993
Just shout them all out to the sea.

181
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:38,069
Shout?

182
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:39,162
Okay, sure.

183
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:50,089
Hey!

184
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,633
What are you doing?

185
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:53,093
Getting naked!

186
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,285
Why?

187
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:56,446
Well, to make sure everything's cleaned,

188
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,556
you've got to go butt-naked!

189
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:00,133
That way you don't leave out anything!

190
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:02,811
That's a waterfall, Sophie.
It's not the sea.

191
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,620
They're both bodies of water, duh.

192
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,649
They'll wash off grime
and bad luck just the same!

193
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,768
Here I thought you were conservative!

194
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:12,145
So, what,

195
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,655
now you're judgmental?

196
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:15,898
You think straight people
are conservative by default?

197
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:17,358
- Come on!
- That's not what I meant.

198
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,661
Come on! Get naked!

199
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:21,121
Get up here!

200
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:22,805
Get naked, Lulu!

201
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:27,143
You're crazy, Sophie!

202
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,253
Come on!

203
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:30,338
Just do it!

204
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,456
It's cold!

205
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:32,449
Okay, okay.

206
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,736
I'll be right there!

207
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:38,930
Ouch.

208
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:42,450
This is the life!

209
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:45,453
Lululululuuuu!

210
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,587
Lulu!

211
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:56,598
Jump in!

212
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:01,969
Lululululuuuu!

213
00:11:06,405 --> 00:11:08,866
Lululululuuuu!

214
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,951
Cheers, Abi!

215
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:29,422
Cheers!

216
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:36,427
- This is strong.
- Yeah.

217
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:40,809
This is on another level.

218
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,095
The grilled pork belly
and the tomato salad are amazing.

219
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:45,950
This might be the best grilled pork belly

220
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:47,857
and tomato salad
I've tasted in my whole life.

221
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:49,000
Flatterer.

222
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,851
No! I'm serious!

223
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:53,154
Here, I'll give you an honest review.

224
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,782
The meat is so tender.

225
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:58,076
And the skin on this meat,

226
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,136
it has the perfect crispiness.

227
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:01,346
And this fish…

228
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:03,056
it's incredible.

229
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:05,975
I feel like your marinade
is the clear star of the show.

230
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:07,018
And that?

231
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,452
That chicken…

232
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:10,230
it tastes really good even if

233
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,747
it has burnt bits.

234
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:14,592
But it's no big deal.
I'm used to burnt food.

235
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:18,170
They're all perfect, actually.

236
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,257
I think the magic's in your marinade.

237
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:21,950
It's like...

238
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:24,902
it has the perfect blend of sweet

239
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:26,554
and sour…

240
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,081
You put ketchup in it, didn't you?

241
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:28,864
Yeah.

242
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:32,335
It also has Wor-ces-shire…

243
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:34,754
and pepper, and soy sauce…

244
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:36,147
"Worcestershire".

245
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:37,674
Worcestershire!

246
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:39,634
Wow, great job.

247
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:40,835
Right?

248
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,012
And this salad... The tomato salad…

249
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,323
It has balsamic vinegar,

250
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:48,184
a dash of ginger, and sesame oil.

251
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:50,812
You know what,
you'd make a good food critic.

252
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,939
Nah, I don't even know how to cook.

253
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,175
I just really love to eat.

254
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,527
That's the point.

255
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:00,255
That's the point.

256
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:06,786
Your passion for eating will make you
a more credible critic.

257
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:10,823
You were able to tell apart
the ingredients just by tasting it.

258
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:13,501
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about,

259
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:16,214
but you're probably right.

260
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:18,189
All I know is…

261
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:19,565
we're perfect for each other.

262
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:20,766
Perfect?

263
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,135
Ah, I meant,

264
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,463
the grilled meat is perfect
with the tomato salad.

265
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:26,339
Yeah, perfect.

266
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:28,115
Perfect for each other.

267
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:29,367
Yes, so yummy.

268
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,078
Tomorrow I'll buy some oysters

269
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,665
because it might be a while before we
get a hold of fresh seafood.

270
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,067
How are you going to do that
in this lockdown?

271
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,193
Trust me!

272
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,013
I cut a sweet deal with one of the locals.

273
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:44,532
I'll just text him and he'll leave
the goods out for us to pick up.

274
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,658
That's awesome.

275
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:47,560
Do you have allergies?

276
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:49,470
Yes.

277
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,406
But I can't really tell for sure.
As with all things about myself.

278
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,351
I get it from random food.
Suddenly, I'd have rashes all over

279
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,603
and my throat would close up.

280
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:00,006
What, anaphylactic shock?

281
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:03,025
Sometimes it's from seafood.

282
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:06,846
Sometimes it's not from seafood.
Sometimes it's from dust.

283
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:10,950
But it usually acts up
whenever I'm stressed out, or nervous…

284
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,078
then I'd get rashes
and my throat would close up.

285
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:15,563
That's scary!

286
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:17,957
I just really need to take my medicine

287
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,584
and it goes away
on its own after a few minutes.

288
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,013
I don't get it consistently.
Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.

289
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,282
At least you'll be able to slurp.

290
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:28,493
What do you mean?

291
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:29,368
Slurp.

292
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,620
The oysters.

293
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:32,988
You know what "slurp" is?

294
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:34,281
- You know oysters?
- Sure.

295
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,942
That's how you eat oysters. This way.

296
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,005
Open your mouth wider!

297
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:44,175
There you go.

298
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:45,802
Slurp.

299
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,073
I'm full!

300
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,494
I think I'm tipsy. I'm drunk.

301
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,630
We've been drinking since this afternoon.

302
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:00,833
I sobered up a bit after we ate.

303
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,927
Let's wait for the sunrise, okay?

304
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:05,296
Wow. Are you going through something?

305
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:06,848
That's the thing.

306
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:09,992
That's exactly it!
It's because I don't have a problem!

307
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:13,354
I feel like a brand new person right now,
know what I mean?

308
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:17,275
I feel like now I know what I'm doing,
I know where I'm going…

309
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,168
Thank you.

310
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:20,002
For?

311
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,155
Thank you, because...

312
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,034
you believed in the things I can do.

313
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,369
You already have what it takes.

314
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:30,596
You just needed a little smack in the head

315
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:33,249
to see who you really are.

316
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:35,493
Oh, no.

317
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,994
Wait, the food on the grill.

318
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:43,025
You know what, we're not that rich.

319
00:15:44,148 --> 00:15:45,511
We're not poor, either.

320
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,255
But I realized,

321
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,883
that I was born lucky.

322
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:54,579
I didn't have a lot of struggles
growing up.

323
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:56,539
We had a pretty nice life.

324
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,657
And then,

325
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:00,159
when I was in college,

326
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:02,712
I met a wealthy boyfriend.

327
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:04,688
He was the type that would
give you everything.

328
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:07,149
Laid down and served on a silver platter.

329
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,534
So when I lost that,

330
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:13,498
I was like a rabid dog running around
all over the place.

331
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:18,452
Happiness really isn't permanent.

332
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,372
Neither is luck.

333
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,801
Well, ever since I was born,

334
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,779
luck has eluded me.
And I've accepted that.

335
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:29,680
Yeah.

336
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:32,016
It's a good thing I had my mom around.

337
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,061
She was my mother, father,
and best friend-all in one.

338
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:38,475
I miss her.

339
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,368
You know the thing about struggles?

340
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:43,936
They don't always have to be about money.

341
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:47,256
Trying to gain acceptance
from society, into workplaces…

342
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:49,408
The entertainment industry…
you know, it's everywhere.

343
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:52,962
It's a constant struggle
to always have to prove yourself.

344
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:55,781
That's why I don't rely on luck.

345
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,142
You need to work for the things you want.

346
00:16:58,419 --> 00:16:59,343
And happiness?

347
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:00,661
You need to work hard for that, too.

348
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:04,148
I hope I become like you when I grow up.

349
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,566
You're stuck in that height.

350
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,434
You are so mean to me!

351
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,310
Okay,

352
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:09,436
let me rephrase that.

353
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,397
I hope when I get older,

354
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:12,615
I'll be just like you.

355
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:15,885
How dare you call me "old".
We're only five years apart!

356
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:16,861
So in short,

357
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:18,279
you're old, too!

358
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,189
Whatever. Hand me that plate.

359
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,943
Give it here.

360
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:30,383
Abi!

361
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:33,928
Are you still mad at me?

362
00:17:34,945 --> 00:17:38,048
I already told you! I'm not.

363
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:40,593
Then why were you acting all grouchy?

364
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:42,761
I wasn't grouchy!

365
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:43,688
Yeah, right.

366
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:45,631
I know where you're getting at.

367
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,552
There's just some things that
are hard to explain.

368
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:52,104
When I'm ready, I will tell you.

369
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:53,797
So I hope you understand.

370
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,992
Okay!

371
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,903
But how come...

372
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:01,689
I knew it! Just drop it.

373
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:03,474
Okay, okay, fine.

374
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:07,945
Abi.

375
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:11,424
What is your favorite sport?

376
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:12,883
Why do you ask?

377
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:14,702
No reason. Just so we have

378
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:17,555
a formal
"getting-to-know-each-other" stage.

379
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:19,089
Are you serious?

380
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:20,625
Just answer it.

381
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,603
Well, I'm not sporty.

382
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,562
But...

383
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:25,730
I can swim.

384
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:27,356
Obviously.

385
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:30,109
Okay, fine!

386
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,193
What about you?

387
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:36,375
Well, I used to play volleyball
back in grade school

388
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,075
but I didn't pursue it.

389
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:40,703
What's your strangest talent?

390
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:43,814
Actually, I don't have talent at all.

391
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:46,083
Isn't that strange?

392
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,027
Smartass.

393
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,645
What about you?

394
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,230
Well, I can cook,

395
00:18:51,355 --> 00:18:52,782
I can play the guitar…

396
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,758
And well,

397
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,844
that's not something strange.

398
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,281
Alright, well,

399
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,126
if, say, you're 16 again,

400
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,921
what would you do and tell yourself?

401
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:08,606
Don't plan!

402
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,541
Enjoy life, go with the flow.

403
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,777
You?

404
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,311
Plan, plan, plan!

405
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:16,180
Like that Build, Build, Build project.

406
00:19:16,714 --> 00:19:17,807
You'll waste time if you don't.

407
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:25,998
So what's your plan now?

408
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:31,328
I'll focus on the B and B,

409
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:32,980
expand the business,

410
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:37,543
and of course, I should come up with
more ideas for the cocktails,

411
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:39,704
think up new alcoholic drinks…

412
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:43,574
And maybe, I could start
a food review blog.

413
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:45,884
How about starting a YouTube channel?

414
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,537
Something like travel with food.
That sort of thing.

415
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:51,799
- Yes! Sounds good, right? I can do that.
- Yeah!

416
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:53,526
Oh, man...

417
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:56,345
All of a sudden,
I want to do so many things!

418
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:59,323
It's because you finally know yourself.

419
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:01,191
Cheers to that!

420
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:02,843
Game, game, game, game!

421
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:06,346
Cheers! Cheers!

422
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:09,483
We've drank a lot.

423
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,127
But that's alright.

424
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:14,964
Tipsy, Abi?

425
00:20:15,522 --> 00:20:16,907
Are you drunk already?

426
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,537
I won't try to ask

427
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,074
what your plans are anymore
because I know what you're going to say.

428
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:27,293
"To have no plan at all."

429
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,962
But how about this:

430
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:35,834
How were you able to leave your fame,
fortune, and career behind

431
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:39,989
and go with the decision
to have no plan at all in life?

432
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:44,018
You're exaggerating. You talk as if
I left behind some grand mansion.

433
00:20:44,802 --> 00:20:45,928
It's just a condo unit,

434
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:49,598
and I played guitar for a band
that's not so well-known.

435
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,485
And I was assistant to a celebrity Chef.

436
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,004
Smartass.

437
00:20:55,813 --> 00:20:59,441
Maybe because that's when I realized
how short life is.

438
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,903
Planning has kept me from enjoying life.

439
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,681
Really? Why, have you
experienced that moment

440
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:07,383
when your whole life
flashes before your eyes?

441
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:08,158
I have.

442
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:12,412
It's the same whenever I go
into anaphylactic shock.

443
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:13,789
I get flashbacks of my life.

444
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,141
It happened to me before I came here.

445
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,302
Before I finally decided on things.

446
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,462
Really? What happened?

447
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:24,325
There you go again! I know where
you're leading all this talk.

448
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:26,985
Don't push it if you don't want
to piss me off again.

449
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,230
Okay, fine, fine. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

450
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,333
What is "Love"?

451
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,110
Love is not blind.

452
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:35,894
Really now?

453
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,505
It's true.

454
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:41,200
Love is something pure.
It gets into our feelings.

455
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,469
It's the people
in the relationship that are blind.

456
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,779
How profound!

457
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,598
What about you?

458
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:49,166
"Love" is?

459
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:50,726
You.

460
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,730
You know…

461
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:55,981
God.

462
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:57,274
God is Love.

463
00:21:57,697 --> 00:21:58,943
Really, Sophie?

464
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:04,306
Who's your first kiss?

465
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:07,368
Parents?

466
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:08,494
You?

467
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:09,787
Mom.

468
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:13,624
When was your last kiss?

469
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,626
I mean a serious kiss.

470
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,087
Two years ago?

471
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:19,505
And you?

472
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:38,691
Are you okay?

473
00:22:40,351 --> 00:22:42,027
Oh my god!
Are you having an attack?

474
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:44,488
Where's your medicine?

475
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,956
Abi?

476
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:58,477
Trisha, this is Sophie.

477
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,045
Sophie, Trisha.

478
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:01,755
You want some cool drinks?

479
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,816
Abi! What is happening to you?

480
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:08,429
What's so great about her
that you gave up all your good luck?

481
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:09,988
She has a name, okay?

482
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,265
Her name is Sophie.

483
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:13,667
And she's not a jinx.
