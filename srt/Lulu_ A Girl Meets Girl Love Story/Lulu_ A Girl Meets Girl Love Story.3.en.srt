1
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:05,506
Want to take a shower?

2
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:06,840
Huh?

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,383
Together?

4
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:10,416
No… I meant after me.

5
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:13,597
Here's your-Oh god! Boobies! Boobies!

6
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:16,266
It's my birthday, by the way.

7
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:17,715
Mine, too!

8
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:20,801
Cross Mary Shake!
Cross Mary Shake! Shake!

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,564
Do you like me?

10
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:26,568
You know what the problem is
with straight girls like you?

11
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,530
You immediately assume we're into you.

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,200
"Lulu"

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,600
(Episode 3: Stuck with you)

14
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:10,112
E.C.Q.? What's going to happen?

15
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:13,270
I have a week to decide where I'm staying?

16
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:14,313
Why?

17
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:20,069
If I can't decide within a week,
I'll get stuck there?

18
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:21,987
Yikes, what am I going to do?

19
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:25,861
So, I better decide now if I'm going home?

20
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:29,239
Or else what? One month lockdown?

21
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:31,408
And it might get extended.

22
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:34,124
Okay, Ma. Alright, I'll think about it.

23
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,556
Okay, Thanks, Trish. I'll think about it.

24
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:50,010
Lockdown.

25
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,820
Lockdown.

26
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:57,826
Coffee?

27
00:01:58,732 --> 00:01:59,733
Coffee.

28
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:05,709
You got wasted!

29
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:08,545
Your drool dried up!

30
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,880
Where?

31
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:11,465
You're not joking?

32
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,342
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

33
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:15,636
You were all over the place.

34
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:19,139
You were so rowdy last night.
Drink some water.

35
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:21,625
Cross, Mary...

36
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,518
- Shake! Shake! Shake!
- Shake! Shake! Shake!

37
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:26,343
Shake! Shake! Shake!

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,606
Cut it out!

39
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:28,715
Ah jeez.

40
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,343
My head hurts.

41
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,420
So, what's your plan?

42
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:52,047
What's yours?

43
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:54,486
I don't know yet.

44
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,051
You know what…

45
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:58,600
I had this planned for so long.

46
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:02,099
I thought long and hard about
staying here at this B and B.

47
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:03,480
Then I'll fix things up nicely…

48
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:05,382
but it hasn't been two weeks
and look what happened!

49
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:07,270
That's what happened! Look at it.

50
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:12,609
I waited so long to have a "me-time..."

51
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,863
Well, I'm not really alone!

52
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,615
You get it.

53
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:22,102
I feel like all of my plans never work out.

54
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,480
You think it's funny, don't you?

55
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:30,360
Well, I had my condo rented out.
So I really have nowhere else to go.

56
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:34,673
If you plan to leave and close this,

57
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:37,331
I'll just look for another B and B.

58
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:40,309
You really don't plan on going back?

59
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:41,371
What for?

60
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:43,953
I've decided to move forward.

61
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:47,336
You think I'd let this pandemic
get in the way of that?

62
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:50,714
I don't know what to do, Abi!

63
00:03:52,471 --> 00:03:55,321
Because I'm pretty sure that
this pandemic will drag on.

64
00:03:55,346 --> 00:03:57,910
Like, it will go on for months…

65
00:03:57,935 --> 00:03:59,239
Ha! You'll be stuck here.

66
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:02,225
Then I'll be stuck here with you.

67
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:08,946
Unless… that's going to be
a problem for you?

68
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:14,279
You are full of shit, Abi.

69
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,134
Then let's go grocery shopping!

70
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,124
Really?

71
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:25,813
Always the little flirt, Sophie.

72
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:26,480
Huh?

73
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:27,356
Huh?

74
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:28,477
You were saying something?

75
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,753
Nope.

76
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:33,028
No, I was just thinking about
what we'll buy.

77
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:34,065
Ah! Yeah.

78
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:35,364
Let's list them down.

79
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:36,193
Okay.

80
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:37,235
Okay.

81
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:39,613
What should we buy first?

82
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:40,989
Canned goods?

83
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:43,080
Canned goods.

84
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:45,315
Sure, for emergencies. Oh, and then?

85
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,517
What do you need in a...

86
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,997
No, we have to buy fresh meats also.

87
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:49,873
Yeah.

88
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:53,298
God, it's so hot!

89
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:54,085
Yeah.

90
00:04:54,672 --> 00:04:55,629
So hot.

91
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:09,184
Let me do that for you.

92
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:13,939
I'll just throw these away.

93
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,280
Alcohol.

94
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:36,002
Your turn.

95
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:44,427
Thank you.

96
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:45,637
Welcome.

97
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:53,061
Here.

98
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:55,903
Should we disinfect these, too?

99
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:58,733
I don't think so.
We might get poisoned if we do.

100
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:00,026
Probably.

101
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:03,644
Damn, this sucks, huh?

102
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:10,036
How about fixing this whole place for
a whole week and it just falls apart?

103
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:12,484
Then I almost drowned, and then...

104
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,124
You're still alive, though, aren't you?

105
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:16,001
Uhm, thanks to you.

106
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:17,961
It's not the end of the world.

107
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:19,337
Come to think of it...

108
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:22,883
Isn't that a good thing? We'll have
more time to spruce up your B and B.

109
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,594
You're really serious
about helping me, huh?

110
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:27,829
Not like I have anything else to do.

111
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:31,625
I'll just drive myself crazy if I don't
busy myself in this lockdown.

112
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:33,877
For how long do you think this will go on?

113
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:37,172
Three weeks? Months?

114
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:40,233
Crap, I hope it doesn't last for a year!

115
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:43,720
Maybe by that time,
your B and B will look amazing!

116
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:56,066
Ah, so, what would you like
for dinner later?

117
00:06:56,488 --> 00:06:59,277
Let's consume the fresh ones first.

118
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:03,256
Then save the canned goods for emergencies.

119
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:04,930
Ah, yes. Makes sense.

120
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:08,308
Let's eat the ones that spoil more quickly.

121
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,524
The vegetables-you do eat veggies, right?

122
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:11,831
Huh? Sure.

123
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:22,531
You can answer it, okay?

124
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:23,824
If you want, I can step out for a while.

125
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:25,387
No, it's fine.

126
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:33,203
There.

127
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:34,537
I switched it off.

128
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:35,997
Why'd you do that?

129
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:38,416
He's being a pest.

130
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,506
Are you on social media?

131
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:49,828
Yeah. Just on FB, IG…

132
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,581
I'm not that active anyway. What about you?

133
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,730
FB, IG…

134
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:55,892
You're active?

135
00:07:56,048 --> 00:07:58,019
Yes! Super active.

136
00:07:58,091 --> 00:07:58,775
Nice.

137
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,965
Sometimes I'm on my phone
for the whole day.

138
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:05,051
Wow, okay.

139
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,561
But I already deactivated my account.
I think for about a week now…

140
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:11,435
Or more?

141
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,393
Mm, why?

142
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,485
I thought I'd only last
two days without it.

143
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:19,339
Then as the days passed, it wasn't so bad.

144
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:23,175
I got so productive. No distractions...

145
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,739
As for me, I don't care much
for social media.

146
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:29,492
I just use it for work
and to promote myself.

147
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:32,120
Why? What do you do for a living?

148
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:35,724
Oh no!

149
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:38,643
The gazebo's down again!

150
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:40,603
Let's go straighten it up.

151
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:44,941
Hey. Are you alright?

152
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,095
Yeah, I'm okay.
Could you hand me the gun tacker, please?

153
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:51,848
- Hang on.
- Okay.

154
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:53,324
Here.

155
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:10,550
Sophie.

156
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:14,888
Sophie.

157
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:16,269
Hey, Sophie!

158
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,646
Huh? Yeah? What is it?

159
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:18,855
I said I'm done here.

160
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,606
Ah! Sorry.

161
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:21,733
I might step on your fingers. Watch out.

162
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:23,521
- Alright. Climb down.
- Okay.

163
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:27,484
Great job! Awesome. Awesome.

164
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:31,034
Now that's over with…
Come on, let's have some snacks.

165
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,906
Okay. I'll just put this away.

166
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:33,698
Okay.

167
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:38,495
Here it is!

168
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,169
Wow! What is this?

169
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:42,999
Sophie's cooler.

170
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:44,959
Love the presentation!

171
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:47,962
Try it!

172
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,966
- Go.
- Let me taste.

173
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:55,720
What do you think?

174
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:56,888
Oh my god.

175
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:59,599
What? Did I mess it up again?

176
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:04,754
No! It's so good! Like, I haven't had
a cooler that tastes as good as this!

177
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:06,923
What did you put in here?

178
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,843
Man, finally! I got something right.

179
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,138
I swear, your concoction's super yummy.

180
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:18,101
Well, you know how bad I am at cooking.
Lucky I get to make up for it this way.

181
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:20,734
Luck? Of course not.

182
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:22,814
I'm sure you put thought into this.

183
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,233
The thing is,

184
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:28,601
I love mixing different kinds of drinks.

185
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:34,451
From simple juices, from alcohol
to mocktails, cocktails… Things like that.

186
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:37,036
You can put up a bar.

187
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,597
- Not really!
- No, you can!

188
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:42,709
I'm not good at that.
I can't even manage this simple thing.

189
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,394
Why are you like that?

190
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:45,562
Like what?

191
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:48,256
You always put yourself down.

192
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:52,010
You know what, things happen.

193
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:56,645
You shouldn't be too hard on yourself
and trying to be perfect all the time.

194
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,225
Learn from your mistakes.

195
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:01,650
Nobody's perfect in this world anyway.

196
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,856
Your feet are perfect.

197
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:06,149
Huh?

198
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:07,984
Nothing.

199
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:11,446
I heard you. I was just surprised.

200
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:13,965
Why, do you have a foot fetish?

201
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,806
Hey, I do not!
What's wrong with you? No way.

202
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:19,935
Look how ugly my feet are!
They're so veiny!

203
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,811
You think that's pretty?

204
00:11:21,836 --> 00:11:24,523
I swear your feet looks really nice
even if they're veiny.

205
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:27,092
Look at my feet. They're so ugly.
They look like ginger.

206
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:32,344
Ah. You're right.

207
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,778
You're so mean!

208
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:37,155
It's true!

209
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,539
Actually, yeah. Your feet aren't pretty.

210
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:42,332
And you're the one who said
they look like ginger roots.

211
00:11:42,357 --> 00:11:44,454
Well, I inherited them from my mama.

212
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:47,398
I inherited mine from my mom, too.

213
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:50,001
Where's your mom, by the way?

214
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:51,336
She's gone.

215
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:54,380
Sorry.

216
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,049
Don't be sorry.

217
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:59,410
We all die in the end.
Some people just get to go first.

218
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,569
May I ask how she died?

219
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:02,764
Breast cancer.

220
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:06,543
She died like, five years ago?

221
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:11,214
My father passed on seven years ago.

222
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:14,342
Lung cancer. He was a chimney.

223
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:17,676
My father left us for his mistress.

224
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:19,113
When I was still a baby.

225
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,494
Your fault for using
such deep words. "Passed-on".

226
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,543
Seriously?

227
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:28,456
I think the other word would be too harsh.

228
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,543
I'd rather it sound poetic, right?
Not "dead', "killed', "died"…

229
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:35,171
Is there anything harsher than “dead”?

230
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,762
Killing is so rampant these days.

231
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:40,551
We keep hearing those words in the news.
"Died", "will die", "murdered"…

232
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:45,331
Besides, life's so short! Imagine, if you
get infected by the Covid virus,

233
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,851
after two to three days, you're dead!

234
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:51,880
God, Abi. That's so heavy!

235
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,012
Aren't you scared of dying?

236
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:55,858
No.

237
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,068
Are you?

238
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:02,573
Well, it's not that I'm scared
of dying, it's just…

239
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:04,075
You know what I mean? When…

240
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:07,996
If I'll be gone anytime soon, it's like…
it wouldn't be too bad.

241
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:11,541
I didn't even achieve
or do much for the world.

242
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:14,419
It wouldn't matter.
Just one less bag of meat. Irrelevant.

243
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:17,964
Now, that's heavy.
You think you're some superhero.

244
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:18,965
Don't be silly.

245
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,804
You know, it's not important that
you become relevant to the world.

246
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:27,640
What's important
is to be relevant to yourself.

247
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,644
Why did we start talking about
death all of a sudden anyway?

248
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:33,396
Because your toenails are dead.

249
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,096
I hate you!

250
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:41,070
They're really gross!
But never mind, look at your toes!

251
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,203
They look like they've been through hell.

252
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:47,702
Hey! You're too much. Did it even occur
to you that I might be a ballerina?

253
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:48,703
No!

254
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,205
With your carelessness?

255
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:52,957
More of…

256
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,400
Crazyrina.

257
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:57,617
You're so mean.

258
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:00,214
Man, my tummy hurts.

259
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:03,593
Your juice is making me
want to poop. My god.

260
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,595
I just need to use the toilet.

261
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,913
Go on.

262
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:09,396
Clean your toenails while I'm gone.

263
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:11,506
- Whatever. Have your fun.
- We can grow yams out of them.

264
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,681
Stop laughing, Sophie.
Nothing's funny. It was so corny…

265
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:26,896
You're in a danger zone.

266
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:30,061
Just focus on your feet.

267
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:31,867

It's okay. Sorry...

289
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:33,868
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I went to get some things from the car.

290
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:35,745
I fell asleep.

291
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:36,787
Yup.

292
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:39,796
Looks like it was a nice siesta.
You were asleep for a long time.

293
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:43,544
But good thing you woke up
or you'll be up all night.

294
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:45,113
Why, what time is it?

295
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,262
Ah, 3:00 pm.

296
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:48,007
What?!

297
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:48,913
Yeah!

298
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:50,932
You were out for three hours!

299
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:52,517
Why didn't you wake me?

300
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,003
Why would I? You
looked so peaceful.

301
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:56,849
Your snore could be
heard all the way to Manila.

302
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:58,481
Yeah, right!

303
00:16:58,506 --> 00:16:59,627
I'm telling you!

304
00:17:01,134 --> 00:17:03,361
Oh! I wasn't able to cook lunch!

305
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:04,214
Don't worry about it.

306
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:07,866
I got us grilled intestines,
papaitan, and sisig over at the alley.

307
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:09,617
Wow! Those look delicious!

308
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:11,452
Yeah!
I'll just go prepare them.

309
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:12,448
Okay. Oh!

310
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:15,248
Oh! I'll mix Aloe Cocktail for us.
Want me to? You still have vodka, right?

311
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:17,620
Yeah! Knock yourself out.
Okay, okay, okay.

312
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,206
Let's eat over there! Up there at
my veranda. Outside my room.

313
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:22,333
Oh, yeah, sure. I'd love a different view.

314
00:17:22,614 --> 00:17:23,840
Okay. I'll just take a shower.

315
00:17:23,865 --> 00:17:24,835

To...

327
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,900
To Lulu!

328
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,968
Cheers!

329
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:19,265
That is strong!

330
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:25,880
Do you know what "Lulu" means?

331
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:28,719
Sure I do.

332
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,526
What does it mean, then?

333
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:32,929
Really, Sophie?

334
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:37,016
Well, you never know.
Maybe we have a different definition.

335
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:42,121
Lulu. Lesbian. Tomboy. There.

336
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:43,205
Tungril...

337
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:44,874
Now you know.

338
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:47,918
Well, do you know why
it evolved into "Lulu"?

339
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,629
Huh. Nope, I don't know.

340
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:55,801
That's the sound when
you're doing the thing.

341
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:57,011
What?!

342
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:01,140
When you're getting done.
That's how it sounds like.

343
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:03,148
Doing what? What do you mean?

344
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:05,478
For Christ's sake! When you're being...

345
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:16,947
Get it now?

346
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:19,492
Oh my god!

347
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:25,411
So when did you realize you were boyish?

348
00:19:26,244 --> 00:19:27,500
"Boyish"?

349
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:29,710
Fine, then, "Lulu".

350
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,907
Maybe when I was three or four years old?

351
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:38,062
Ah, that young?

352
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:39,963
Yeah! Well.

353
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:44,834
I've had an idea of my identity as soon as
I started being aware of things.

354
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:50,339
My mom used to say, it's not important
what you were when you were born;

355
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,094
what's important is who you become,
what you are, and what you want.

356
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:57,638
"Identity"?

357
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:01,826
Okay, start with a blank canvas.

358
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,062
Erase all that's unnecessary.

359
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,024
Then tidy up all the mess.

360
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:10,568
Throw out the trash.

361
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,865
I'm only now starting to realize that…

362
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:20,953
since my ex and I broke up,
I don't think I know who I really am.

363
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:24,807
Like, "Hey! It's Sophie, Jun's girlfriend."

364
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,727
"Hi, I'm Sophie! Jun's Girlfriend!"

365
00:20:27,752 --> 00:20:29,103
Oh, that…

366
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:31,194
Don't let your relationships define you.

367
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:34,508
Don't let your past define you.
Don't let the world define you.

368
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:38,304
Because you're you.
So focus on your personal journey.

369
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:41,351
Wow… Damn! Love Guru!

370
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:44,143
More like, Life Guru.

371
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:46,788
Did your mom teach you that?

372
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,164
No, Google did.

373
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:49,248
Ouch.

374
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,129
Stop messing around.

375
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:51,901
What, it's true.

376
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,696
All the quotable quotes in life...
you can find them on Google.

377
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,833
Google can explain anything.

378
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:02,500
So if you have no one in your life,
Google will always be there for you.

379
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:05,706
What do you desire in life?

380
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:07,166
You.

381
00:21:08,131 --> 00:21:10,920
I mean... You!
What do you want out of life?

382
00:21:11,425 --> 00:21:15,274
Well, while you want
your whole life to be planned out,

383
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:17,385
I'd rather break all my plans.

384
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:19,278
Why?

385
00:21:20,157 --> 00:21:23,369
Because! I already planned for and
did everything I wanted to do in my life.

386
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:25,520
This time, I want to feel the thrill!

387
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:29,961
Of letting the Universe
make the decisions for me.

388
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:31,732
I want to take more risks.

389
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,501
We should switch lives.

390
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,194
No need for that.

391
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:38,464
You can just help me
deactivate from social media.

392
00:21:38,578 --> 00:21:41,706
Sure! As long as you help me
clean up my mess.

393
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,721
My messy life, and the literal mess
I make of things.

394
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:46,764
Game!

395
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,265
Cheers!

396
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:50,584
Cheers!

397
00:21:56,304 --> 00:21:58,259
You do it! Do it.

398
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:04,265
Again…One, two, three.

399
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:24,927
Sophie...

400
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:41,933
Abi…

401
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:44,363
Abi.

402
00:22:45,394 --> 00:22:46,229
It could work.

403
00:23:21,597 --> 00:23:22,932
Sophie.

404
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:26,347
It's not gonna work.

405
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:41,879
Hi, Abi.

406
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:44,548
I cooked brunch for you.

407
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:46,722
Wake up! Let's have breakfast!

408
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:47,974
Holy shit!

409
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:49,136
What, what happened?

410
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,097
You have 50,000 followers on Instagram!

411
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:54,308
What's the big deal about
having that many followers?

412
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:56,936
Do they have a hand in my life?

413
00:23:57,258 --> 00:23:59,271
Can they change my destiny?

414
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:02,191
In the middle of battle,
they'll just abandon you!

415
00:24:02,471 --> 00:24:03,509
In the end…

416
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:06,011
you'll face it alone.

417
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:11,895
Abi.

418
00:24:12,442 --> 00:24:13,827
Are you mad at me?

419
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,747
If you want, I'll just go.

420
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:18,821
Is that what you want?
