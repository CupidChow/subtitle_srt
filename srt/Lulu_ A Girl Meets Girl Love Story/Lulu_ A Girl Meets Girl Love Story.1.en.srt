"Lulu"

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,900
(Episode 1: Meet Cute)

3
00:00:36,457 --> 00:00:37,496
Sometimes,

4
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:40,411
no matter how much you plan your life,

5
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,888
time comes

6
00:00:42,888 --> 00:00:44,473
when it all falls apart.

7
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,461
I'm having leg cramps.

8
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:45,951
My life has been full of cramps.

9
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:48,800
This cramp will finally end it all.

10
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,250
I can't do this anymore.

11
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:55,599
It's too late.

12
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:58,602
Goodbye to everything.

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,400
(10 DAYS AGO)

14
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:40,797
Ouch!

15
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,884
What the heck?

16
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:48,138
What happened here?

17
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:54,783
What the hell…

18
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,745
What happened to this place?

19
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:10,827
This is crazy.

20
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:26,023
What the heck happened here?

21
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:28,926
Wait...

22
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,564
Ma…

23
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,808
Hey,

24
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:09,117
how are things over there?

25
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,855
Ma, the whole place is trashed.

26
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:17,484
What did you expect?
It's been closed for a year.

27
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,278
Are you alright?

28
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:22,923
Hey, your birthday's coming up.

29
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,741
Celebrate with me, okay?

30
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:25,867
Ma.

31
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,412
I'll deactivate from
my social media accounts, okay?

32
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:31,363
What for?

33
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:34,709
It'll be harder to move on if I don't.

34
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,421
So,

35
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:40,200
I can focus on our business.

36
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:42,884
Hire someone to help you!

37
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:43,928
Ma!

38
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,680
No need.
I can handle this.

39
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:47,780
I'll handle this, Ma.

40
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,479
And to distract myself from overthinking,

41
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:52,256
I'll just tidy things up.

42
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:56,401
Alright.
Just call me if you need anything, okay?

43
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:57,649
Okay!

44
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:00,402
Okay, Ma. Bye!
Be safe. Thanks!

45
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:02,912
Okay! Bye!

46
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,243
Deactivate FB.

47
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:09,786
Done.

48
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:13,915
Deactivate IG.

49
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,625
Done.

50
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,671
Deactivate TT.

51
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:21,298
Done.

52
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,182
Deactivate self from everyone.

53
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:31,516
Done.

54
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,900
(8 DAYS AGO)

55
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,861
- Ah, let's see!
- Hi, Chef.

56
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:05,943
I'm excited for this.

57
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:06,635
Alright.

58
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:10,805
So, this is my grilled chicken salad
with honey balsamic vinaigrette.

59
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,999
Let's try this.

60
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:21,514
So moist.

61
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,127
- Nice.
- Dressing is perfect.

62
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:27,597
This is my Creamy Pumpkin Soup
with a dash of cinnamon.

63
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,347
Well seasoned.

64
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,807
With a hint of something…

65
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,602
Some secret that you're not gonna...

66
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,020
- Yeah.
- You're gonna tell me later.

67
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:41,812
Later on.

68
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:42,587
Last!

69
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:48,760
And this is my Classic Ribeye Steak
with veggie sides and a simple sweet glaze.

70
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:53,932
It's like butter.

71
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,317
Perfect.

72
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,400
Right amount of glaze, too.

73
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,526
Great plating.

74
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,568
Awesome.

75
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,213
You never fail to amaze me.

76
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:08,446
Of course!

77
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,242
I will include this in our menu.

78
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:14,911
- Yeah?
- Thank you, Chef.

79
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:17,414
Prepare the mise en place.

80
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:18,515
- Yes, Chef.
- Okay.

81
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,420
All on you.

82
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:20,709
- See you later.
- Yes, Chef.

83
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,518
Let's have a drink!

84
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,669
- Yeah!
- Alright.

85
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:32,846
Hello?

86
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,556
Yes?

87
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:39,936
Yes, Doc.

88
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:43,481
Yes, Doc. Thank you.

89
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,448
Where is that vase?

90
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:54,409
Oh! My, sorry! Hang on.

91
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:55,911
I just saw that earlier.

92
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:56,912
Pretty sure I placed it here.

93
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,497
Give me a break!

94
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,541
Wait, wait.

95
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,294
I know I put it here.

96
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,005
Ouch!

97
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:12,761
Ouch!

98
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,137
Crap, wait.

99
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,514
Wait! Wait! Wait!

100
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:17,849
I can do this.

101
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:18,975
I can do this.

102
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:20,977
Sophie!
This weighs a ton.

103
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,215
Goodness! Wait!

104
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:31,529
Give me a break!

105
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,657
I'm tired!

106
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,993
Hey!

107
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,537
Whoever you are!

108
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,831
Just leave me alone.
Don't play with me.

109
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,084
I'm begging you!

110
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:47,545
Just let me have this day.

111
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,450
I'll come back for you.

112
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,937
I'll go ahead and start on the gazebo.

113
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,163
Excuse me, Chef.

114
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:29,170
Oh, Abi.

115
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,274
There's something I'd like to say,
if that's okay.

116
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,056
Ah, that's perfect.
I also have something to tell you.

117
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,302
Have a seat.

118
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,536
Abi, me first, yeah?

119
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:39,472
Yes, Chef.

120
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:41,583
You've been my sous chef for two years.

121
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:45,754
And I'm very impressed with your work.

122
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,607
Sometimes your dishes are better than mine.

123
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:51,376
That's too generous, Chef.

124
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,653
I'm not flattering you.
It's the truth.

125
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,738
And I have a proposition for you.

126
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,824
What is it, Chef?

127
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:02,520
I want you to be
the Head Chef in this hotel.

128
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,584
I have to give up some work.

129
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:09,712
My wife will soon give birth.

130
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,546
I also want to spend time
with our child.

131
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:12,922
I mean, it's not like

132
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,441
I won't have work anymore.

133
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:18,428
I still have three more hotels
and two more restaurants under my turf.

134
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,512
Hey.

135
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:21,472
What do you think?

136
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,603
Chef, I'm resigning.

137
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:31,758
You're kidding, right?

138
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:35,974
Don't you want to work here anymore?

139
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:40,617
Chef, this has been the best experience
I've ever had in my entire career.

140
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,160
Then, why resign?

141
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:43,828
Because…

142
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:49,250
I want to deactivate myself from everyone.

143
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:50,793
Huh?

144
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:53,588
Chef, I want to travel.

145
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,381
What?

146
00:12:04,154 --> 00:12:05,767
What is with all this mess?

147
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:11,689
So dirty!

148
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,233
So dusty!

149
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:23,201
Where is it?

150
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,607
Where did I put it?

151
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:33,753
Oh, I left it on the bed.

152
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,091
Ouch!

153
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,116
Hey, girl!

154
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:04,199
What's up?

155
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:06,094
How are you?
What happened to you?

156
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,379
I swear to God.

157
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:09,163
Good thing I rang your mom.

158
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:10,957
Sorry!

159
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:13,334
So?
What's going on?

160
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,545
You mean what's going on with you?

161
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:16,913
You didn't even tell us

162
00:13:16,938 --> 00:13:19,191
you were plucking yourself
out of the city and into the province.

163
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,951
You even deactivated
your social media accounts.

164
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:24,787
You talk as if you live here.

165
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,098
As if I we always see each other.

166
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:28,867
Doesn't matter.

167
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,127
I'm worried about you.

168
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,422
No distractions.

169
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,424
Not bad.

170
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,843
I thought I wouldn't be able to do it.

171
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:40,595
But it's not that hard.

172
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:43,197
Glad it's going well for you.

173
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:48,411
Because I saw Jun's commenting
in one of our friend's post.

174
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:50,855
It looks like he's hitting on a new girl.

175
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:57,253
What are you doing?
What's with that look?

176
00:13:58,136 --> 00:13:59,846
Stop moping around.

177
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,174
Move on.

178
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,385
I don't know what
you're talking about.

179
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,220
I've moved on, for your information.

180
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:09,032
But, of course, when I remember…

181
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,291
it still hurts.

182
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:14,379
Then it means you haven't moved on!

183
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:17,786
Anyway! That's enough.

184
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:18,896
I'll call you back later.

185
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:19,942
I still got a lot to do.

186
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,231
Hey, wait...

187
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:22,278
Sophie!

188
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:23,633
- Bye!
- We're not yet done...

189
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:19,275
I will never fall in love again.

190
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:21,963
Oh, come on!

191
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:25,091
But not anytime soon.

192
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:28,029
Flirting?

193
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,096
Maybe.

194
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:14,640
Fuck, so annoying.

195
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,743
What the hell, Abi.
Why aren't you answering my calls?

196
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:35,848
What the hell, Tricia.

197
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:37,079
Are you my girlfriend?

198
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,573
If...

199
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,307
you want to.

200
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,459
Whoa!

201
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,710
I don't want you,
do you understand?

202
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:44,545
I really don't.

203
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:46,464
Ouch!

204
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:47,858
I'm making the first move.

205
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,467
And I'm backing up.

206
00:16:51,683 --> 00:16:53,597
But seriously, Abi.

207
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:55,640
You can't just disappear like that.

208
00:16:56,631 --> 00:17:00,498
I heard that you resigned from your job
and your apartment's up for rent.

209
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:01,812
What's going on with you?

210
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,858
Look, Abi.
I know that I'm not…

211
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:07,773
your best choice.

212
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:11,468
But as a friend,
you should update me now and then.

213
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:13,680
Just so I know where you are.

214
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:14,498
Yeah?

215
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:15,535
Tricia.

216
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:18,037
Can you please just let me be?

217
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:19,696
That's all I'm asking from you.

218
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:20,998
I just want to be left alone.

219
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:23,709
Hello?

220
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:24,745
Abi.

221
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,796
You've been alone for half of your life.

222
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,256
Tricia.

223
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:29,882
Okay.

224
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:30,967
Okay.

225
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,051
Just

226
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:33,795
take care of yourself.

227
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,524
And...

228
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:37,139
please, just update me
once in a while, okay?

229
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,100
Okay, Trish. Thank you.

230
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,620
Though you should start
looking for a partner already.

231
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,563
At this point in your life, right?

232
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:46,773
Oh my gosh, here we go again!

233
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:48,401
You're talking to her!

234
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:50,736
Bye, Trish!

235
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:57,215
I will never fall in love.

236
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,203
Not anytime soon.

237
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:01,205
Not even in the future.

238
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,832
Been there, done that.

239
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,292
Flirting?

240
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:05,793
No way.

241
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,800
(PRESENT DAY)

242
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,441
Ouch.

243
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,801
Oh no!

244
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,750
What the hell is wrong with you?

245
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,424
Fine.
Nothing wrong with that.

246
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:25,850
Let's eat, Kakie.

247
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,096
I put too much salt.

248
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,475
That's okay.

249
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:01,202
Maybe it tastes better
on the second bite.

250
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:13,413
I'm sorry, Kakie.
I can't take you with me.

251
00:22:14,451 --> 00:22:16,402
Be nice to your new owner, okay?

252
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:30,332
Perfect!

253
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:35,479
The centerpiece…

254
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,718
Right there.
Stay like that.

255
00:23:09,907 --> 00:23:13,375
Sometimes, hard work
and planning are not enough.

256
00:23:13,645 --> 00:23:15,586
Sometimes, you need a bit of luck.

257
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:18,363
This is what luck looks like.

258
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:20,107
I'm still lucky.

259
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,135
I get to stay in this beautiful place.

260
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:25,422
Gorgeous!

261
00:23:33,757 --> 00:23:34,925
Sometimes,

262
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:39,568
leaving something behind
is the only way to move forward.

263
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:44,990
You must let go the old things,
to create more luck.

264
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,442
Love it!

265
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,698
Happy birthday, Sophie.

266
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,533
You're 25.

267
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:13,327
All you do is plan.

268
00:24:13,622 --> 00:24:14,912
But you're still a failure.

269
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:22,729
You thought I'd leave you behind.

270
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:23,671
Of course not!

271
00:24:24,987 --> 00:24:26,674
Do you know that
it's my birthday today?

272
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:27,658
It's true!

273
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:28,701
It is my birthday!

274
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,922
Happy birthday, Abi!

275
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:37,251
You're on your own!

276
00:24:39,527 --> 00:24:41,213
I've planned out my whole life.

277
00:24:43,206 --> 00:24:44,592
But this time, it's all gone.

278
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:45,901
Nothing.

279
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:50,280
Sorry, I dragged you into this.

280
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:53,684
You see, sometimes
it's better to just wing it.

281
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,730
You'll just wait on
what's going to happen to you.

282
00:25:02,254 --> 00:25:03,944
You just have to trust the Universe.

283
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:35,559
It's tough to look for
a B and B in these parts, Kakie.

284
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,124
Why is it so messy?

285
00:25:44,538 --> 00:25:45,903
It's so dirty.

286
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,088
Help!

287
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:51,700
Help!

288
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:55,329
Help!

289
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,585
Help!

290
00:26:04,874 --> 00:26:07,066
When you find yourself drowning,

291
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,985
somebody comes along to save you.

292
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,989
Just when you thought it was the end,

293
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:43,335
but it's actually a beautiful beginning.

294
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,501
Lip-bite.

295
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:13,204
Oh, my!

296
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:16,051
She did lip bite too.

297
00:27:23,506 --> 00:27:25,269
I got wet.

298
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,990
Who are you?

299
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:42,828
Miss?

300
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:44,037
Are you okay?

301
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,247
Ouch.

302
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:49,685
Shofie.

303
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:50,752
Huh?

304
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:55,132
Sophie. That's my name.

305
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,177
Abi.

306
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,512
Hi, Abi.

307
00:28:01,672 --> 00:28:02,806
Hi, Sophie.

308
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:06,184
Here we are.

309
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,936
That look.

310
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:09,688
This is how it starts.

311
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,399
All dangerous things start…

312
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,610
flirting.

313
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,995
Shofie.

314
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:26,788
Huh?

315
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,751
My name's Sophie.

316
00:28:31,485 --> 00:28:32,743
Ah. Abi.

317
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:33,795
That's yours?

318
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,796
Yep.

319
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,757
Welcome to my B and B!

320
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:40,236
Ouch! You poked me.

321
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,053
Oh, sorry!

322
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:45,849
Kakie,

323
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:48,936
our new adventure begins here.

324
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,021
Are you ready?

325
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,148
Cause I am.

326
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,860
Shower, heater…
if you need to use it, just...

327
00:28:58,704 --> 00:28:59,803
Want to take a shower?

328
00:29:00,436 --> 00:29:03,016
Huh? Together?

329
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:04,768
No, I meant after me.

330
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:06,453
Boobies! Boobies!

331
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:07,996
Today's my birthday.

332
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:09,164
Huh?!

333
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,832
Mine, too!

334
00:29:14,978 --> 00:29:16,255
Do you like me?
