00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,012
#FREE-SPIRITED

00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,513
#GIRLCRUSH

00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,181
#VOLUNTARILY SINGLE

00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,725
#IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,667
-What's your relationship with Eun-o?
-We're roommates.

8
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,252
No, to be precise…

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,547
Just roommates. We live together.

10
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,342
When I first met her?
Back in kindergarten. We're best friends.

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,636
-Me too.
-I have my own place.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,305
I rented this room as my workshop.

13
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,141
You misunderstood? Why?

14
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,520
I told you it's been over two years
since I slept with a woman.

15
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,982
This isn't something to brag about,
so why am I rambling?

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,488
Are you okay with your lover
having guy friends or female friends?

17
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,242
If my girlfriend has guy friends?

18
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,828
No, I'm not.

19
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,663
No man would understand.

20
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,332
If any guy says he does,

21
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,209
he's lying.

22
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,002
The same goes for women.

23
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:31,216
Let me tell you what it means
that my man has a female friend.

24
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,345
It means you have a potential rival
who could take her from you anytime.

25
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,223
I may trust my man,
but not his female friend.

26
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,059
"My man"?

27
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,856
He may pretend to be her friend
with an ulterior motive.

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,608
I know such a guy.

29
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,319
He won her over
after eyeing her for over ten years.

30
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,364
He's definitely something.

31
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,410
Kyeong-jun and me?

32
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,751
DON'T DEMOLISH THE PLAYGROUND,
THE LOCALS' REST AREA

33
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,839
Do not demolish the playground!

34
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,006
PROTECT OUR REST AREA

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,885
We don't have enough
nature-friendly rest areas as it is,

36
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,513
so how dare you try to demolish it?

37
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,893
How dare you think of getting rid
of these beautiful trees and flower beds

38
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,812
in order to build a building?

39
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,398
For our children and for all of us,

40
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,236
let's protect our rest area ourselves!

41
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,446
We must protect it!

42
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:40,368
We object to the demolition
of the rest area in Seongsu-dong!

43
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,579
We object!

44
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,416
How dare you try to build a building
over this one and only playground?

45
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,835
-How dare you?
-How dare you?

46
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:52,964
We object to the demolition
of the rest area in Seongsu-dong!

47
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,049
-We object!
-We object!

48
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,760
SEONGSU GAENARI CHILDREN'S PARK

49
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,263
-Do you live around here?
-No.

50
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,057
-I live in Bundang.
-Bundang?

51
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,352
Then why are you demonstrating
over our town's issue?

52
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,938
I like this playground. I come here often.

53
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,607
All the way from Bundang?

54
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,483
I'm interested in the environment.

55
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,527
So am I.

56
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,824
It's absurd how they want to tear down
the park to build a building.

57
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,662
Don't you remember me?

58
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,541
We were classmates in second grade.

59
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,087
I'm Choi Kyeong-jun, and you're Suh Rin-i.

60
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,258
I guess you don't remember
since I moved soon after.

61
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,561
We object to the demolition
of the rest area in Seongsu-dong!

62
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,396
We object!

63
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,525
How dare you try to build a building
over this one and only playground?

64
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,110
How dare you?

65
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,239
A BOY AND A GIRL PROTECTED
THE SEONGSU-DONG PLAYGROUND!

66
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,490
Here.

67
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,201
I'd never met anyone
who clicked so well with me.

68
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,245
I was exhilarated.

69
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,206
Guess what's even more fascinating?

70
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:12,085
We kept running into each other.

71
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,716
YOUTH GREEN BAZAAR

72
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,345
Hello. Feel free to look around.

73
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,639
The clothes are all worn-out.

74
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,016
-Would you wear this?
-No one would.

75
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,729
Sure, new outfits are great.

76
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,357
But throwing these away would be
a waste of resources.

77
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,900
It pollutes the environment.

78
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:40,154
If you don't understand
the purpose of bazaars, go somewhere else.

79
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,408
How about you hang out with us

80
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,034
instead of wasting time here?

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,248
Guys, I'm in high school.

82
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,542
How much is that?

83
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,419
This one looks nice.

84
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,172
I'll buy everything here.
I wanted to donate some money anyway.

85
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,635
But they're all for women.

86
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,637
I know. They're for my mom.

87
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,392
If you don't have an eye for such things,
you should just leave.

88
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,353
Rascals.

89
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,233
This is so pretty. What is this?

90
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,568
Is this an ornament?

91
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,320
-Like this?
-It's a sponge.

92
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,032
I have lots of dishes to wash at home.
I can use this.

93
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,744
This will make it easier. Like this.

94
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,208
How did you know I was studying here?

95
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,002
My friend goes to your academy.

96
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,171
I came here to give this to him.

97
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,591
But strangely enough, you came out.
That's why I'm giving it to you.

98
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,468
-What about your friend?
-My friend?

99
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,845
He said he already went home.

100
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,972
I see.

101
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,642
-Thanks.
-Good luck tomorrow.

102
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,688
Thanks for the rice cakes.
I'll make sure I pass.

103
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,774
Okay, good luck.

104
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,567
-You can do it.
-I can do it.

105
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,871
What's even funnier is,

106
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,582
I texted him
every time I had a blind date.

107
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,628
"Can you tell me what you think
about this guy?" Like this.

108
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,353
Gosh, the weather is terrible. It is.

109
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,816
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

110
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,331
Do you like paintings?

111
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,166
Yes, I do.

112
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,960
I don't know much about them.

113
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,254
I see.

114
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:08,136
I like it.
Today's exhibition is quite nice.

115
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,556
By the way, who painted that?

116
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,892
Would you like to grab a meal?

117
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,228
Sure.

118
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,231
-Good. Let's go, then.
-Okay.

119
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,623
Something urgent came up. I'm sorry!

120
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,754
I had more fun doing those secret missions

121
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,631
than going on the blind dates.

122
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:51,137
I think that's why I stopped going on
blind dates after he joined the military.

123
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,680
Since it wasn't fun anymore.

124
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,811
Even when Kyeong-jun came out on leave,

125
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,105
he took care of my ill grandmother.

126
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,191
I'm just saying.

127
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,407
Kyeong-jun.

128
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,492
Hey.

129
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,498
She just fell asleep.
Did you do well on the exam?

130
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,043
I don't know. I just hope I pass.

131
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,920
Are you sure you want to be here?

132
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,215
It's okay. I don't have much to do anyway.

133
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,800
-Sit here.
-Thanks.

134
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,805
That fool is just useless.

135
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,558
-Why is he here?
-He couldn't write at home.

136
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,101
No.

137
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,103
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,276
Here's your Americano.

139
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:48,986
Wait.

140
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,240
Could you give me your number?

141
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,617
You know I've been coming here, right?

142
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,494
Not today.

143
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,873
Salute. Sergeant Choi Kyeong-jun.

144
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,709
I have been discharged.
Reporting as ordered.

145
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,129
-You've been discharged?
-That's correct, ma'am.

146
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,384
#AUTUMN NIGHT

147
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,677
#DEOKSUGUNG STONEWALL WALKWAY

148
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,803
#CIVILIAN

149
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,971
#W/RIN-I

150
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,305
What are your future plans?

151
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,474
I have a lot to do.

152
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,186
I have to graduate from university
and get a job.

153
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,357
But most importantly,
I'm going to ask someone out.

154
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,735
I've had a crush on her
for a very long time.

155
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,654
What? Really?

156
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,532
Why didn't you tell me?

157
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,534
Who is she? What does she do?

158
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,579
So can you give me some ideas?

159
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,334
Let's see.

160
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,630
I think a surprise event
would be too much.

161
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:55,219
Just say, "I like you.
Want to go out with me?"

162
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,305
Isn't that good and simple?

163
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,766
Right. You like simple things.

164
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,270
I'm not sure if she would, though.

165
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,273
I like you.

166
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,899
Want to go out with me?

167
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,070
Hey, that voice tone was great.

168
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,074
I've had a crush on you
for a very long time.

169
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,369
That's so romantic.

170
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,580
I hope she says yes.

171
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,625
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I pondered about it.

172
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,917
One second.

173
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,386
Let's each grow one.

174
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,432
Sounds fun. Growing matching plants.

175
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,558
Rin-i.

176
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,268
Will you

177
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,354
go out with me?

178
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,111
What?

179
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,364
Go out with me.

180
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,622
Please.

181
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,209
What?

182
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,337
Are you serious?

183
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:15,925
Seriously?

184
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:20,971
Look at me.

185
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,695
Look at this. Didn't it grow so big?

186
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,782
The guy who won her over
more than a decade later?

187
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,866
That's me.

188
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,577
None of that was coincidental.

189
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,746
He searched far and wide on the internet

190
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,664
to find Rin-i.

191
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,335
Anyway, you'd expect her to catch on,

192
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,129
but she had no idea.

193
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,632
What's so special about love?
He wasted 20 years.

194
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,676
So I went through a lot.

195
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,928
But

196
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,597
I could bear it because she was pretty.

197
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,185
Come on, stop it.

198
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,981
When in love…

199
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,652
keep your cool.

200
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,363
Nonsense. Look who's talking.

201
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,699
You only dated two months
and ruined your life.

202
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,819
Hello, sir.

203
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,946
I just wanted to let you know

204
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,824
some woman printed a bunch of photos here.

205
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,661
And you were in the photos.

206
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,580
What?

207
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,420
Hello?

208
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,506
What?

209
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,841
-Marketing agency O3?
-O3.

210
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,676
Sorry, wrong number.

211
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,553
Hey!

212
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,892
DILIGENCE AND PERSISTENCE

213
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,393
Hey, pushover.

214
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,646
How many times have you done this?

215
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,731
It was a mistake.

216
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,107
A mistake?

217
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,278
Let me make a mistake as well.

218
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,739
-No!
-Come here!

219
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,491
Wait a minute!

220
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,034
Wait. Calm down.

221
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,161
Hear me out.

222
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,041
It wasn't an important call.

223
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,668
It probably wasn't.

224
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,296
"Probably"?

225
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,299
Is it not important, you moron?

226
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,302
-Hey, come here.
-My head hurts!

227
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,762
The fact that they called

228
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,682
means it was one of the companies I--

229
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,146
They must've called again.

230
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,523
-Pick it up.
-Damn it.

231
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,071
Hello, this is marketing agency O3.

232
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,616
What? An order?

233
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,744
Hey, kid. Check the number--

234
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,206
Did you hang up?

235
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,088
I was still talking,

236
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,842
but this little boy just hung up on me.

237
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,144
Hey. Open the door.

238
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,188
-She wasn't always like this.
-I won't hit you. Open it.

239
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,773
Open it!

240
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,946
Look at her. She looked so kind.

241
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,740
She really was.

242
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,826
But a year ago, she disappeared
for a few months and…

243
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,997
-You're slow.
-You're dead meat.

244
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,965
It's over. You've done well, Geon.

245
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,343
It's all over.

246
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,937
Did you forget that this is my house?

247
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,689
SAFETY FIRST

248
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,525
-Don't kill me!
-You dodged me? Come here.

249
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,862
Hey, you're dead.

250
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:53,619
-Hey!
-I'm sorry.

251
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,414
PHOTO STUDIO

252
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,893
-Jobless! Are you sleeping?
-Jobless! Are you sleeping?

253
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,561
-Get up!
-Get up!

254
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,688
What took you so long?

255
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,273
Do you know how long I've waited?

256
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,150
What's wrong?
Did you fight with Eun-o again?

257
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,071
This is too exhausting.
She needs more work.

258
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,865
Kyeong-jun, does your company
have any tasks to give her?

259
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,076
-Why did you provoke her?
-Why would I?

260
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,870
-Seriously?
-Hey, guys.

261
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,499
Why aren't you coming in?

262
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,422
Hey, I'm going to beat you all tonight.

263
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,257
You two better not team up.

264
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,093
-How did she know?
-Plan B.

265
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,219
Got it.

266
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,181
She's having pomegranate juice again.

267
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,226
She's going to set up a honey trap again.

268
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,937
We should brace ourselves.

269
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,408
All right. 12,500 won per person.

270
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,910
All right. 50,000 won will be mine.

271
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,121
Look at those eyes.

272
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,581
Is this how you make money?

273
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,791
-Shut it. Just beat me then.
-Okay.

274
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,251
One hundred won per round.

275
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,086
Pay up after each round.

276
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,796
No IOUs between us.

277
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,506
-Got that?
-Okay.

278
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,433
Let's begin. Hold your ears.

279
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,644
Right hand on the card.

280
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,730
-Left hand--
-Wrong hand and you're out.

281
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,898
Let's get on with it.

282
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,484
Ready or not. Rock, paper, scissors!

283
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,280
I'll go first. Here I go.

284
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,203
Five.

285
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,163
-Come on.
-She's right.

286
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,249
Pay up. Let's hurry. The night is short.

287
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,584
It's only the beginning.

288
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,755
EUN-O WIN

289
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,684
-Why?
-Give me.

290
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,438
-I'm sorry.
-Come on.

291
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,689
Never mind.

292
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,358
There.

293
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,486
RIN-I, KYEONG-JUN, GEON, EUN-O

294
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:34,947
Pay up.

295
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,456
-Rin-i.
-It's just a game.

296
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,083
-I love you.
-Okay.

297
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,584
Be careful.

298
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,549
Hurry up.

299
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,717
Got it. Here I go.

300
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,014
I hit it! I did it!

301
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,850
Five plums. The money's mine.

302
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,563
What? There are five plums. What's wrong?

303
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,652
-What are you doing?
-Goodness.

304
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,742
He only has cards and no chips.

305
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,953
-Geon's out!
-Geon's out!

306
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,291
Don't worry, Geon. I'll beat Eun-o today.

307
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:38,760
With this 100 won,
I'll take all of her money.

308
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,220
Kyeong-jun, give me power!

309
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,559
Defeat that gambling demon
with the power of love.

310
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,940
I didn't know I had 100 won.
One more round?

311
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,693
How dare you? Put that back.

312
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,780
All right, then.

313
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,200
I'll take her money.

314
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,868
Good. Let's do that.

315
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,077
Do it.

316
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,037
Bring it on.

317
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,288
RIN-I VS EUN-O

318
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,206
Here we go.

319
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,176
Fantastic job.

320
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,470
Let's hurry.

321
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,180
Here we go.

322
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,231
-I'm on a roll.
-You did great, baby.

323
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,608
-Hand, what's wrong with you?
-What are you doing?

324
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:47,120
-What's wrong with me today?
-You suck. How did you win those?

325
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,372
EUN-O
RIN-I

326
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,331
Hey.

327
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,125
-Yes!
-You're doing so well!

328
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:56,630
EUN-O
RIN-I

329
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,513
All-in?

330
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,230
Deal.

331
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,900
Let's do this.

332
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,486
-I'll start now.
-Okay.

333
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,921
You and I

334
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:42,175
-Are here holding hands
-Are here holding hands

335
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,260
Stop right there.

336
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,638
It's not over yet.

337
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,352
You just hit the bell
with your right hand.

338
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,896
The bell should be rung
with your left hand.

339
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,194
Wrong hand, and you're out.

340
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,993
It's okay.

341
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,078
You did great.

342
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,914
I have to say, it was a great match.

343
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,374
That was intense.

344
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,294
Great job.

345
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,171
THE END

346
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,648
I'll keep the cameras.

347
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,402
No. I stole them from you.

348
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,572
That was my plan from the start.

349
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,453
If she still has them,

350
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,082
it means she didn't steal them
to sell them.

351
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,753
When I recognized your face,
she paid and left in a hurry.

352
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,256
And here. She left one behind.

353
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,008
Damn it.

354
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,096
I just don't get it.

355
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,892
If she was going to print all of them,
why did she leave me the message?

356
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,853
Give me 12,500 won each.

357
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,855
-Do you have 500 won?
-Give it to me.

358
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,607
I wired you the money.

359
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,695
I should report her as a gambler.

360
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,155
Hi, is this the police station?

361
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,241
We're in trouble. Come here quickly, sir.

362
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,034
Help us. I beg you.

363
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,204
The second reason I broke up with Jae-won…

364
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,249
was them.

365
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:41,253
They have no idea
that I'm the Yoon Seon-a.

366
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,587
JAE-WON

367
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,506
It's Jae-won.

368
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,509
Hey, what is it?

369
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,970
Yes, I'm near Rin-i's place.

370
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,763
The studio? Why?

371
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,765
I'm busy right now.

372
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,184
-I'm playing cards.
-Tell him to come over.

373
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,936
Yes, we'll play again.

374
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,480
Do you want to come if you're nearby?

375
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,649
Really? Should I?

376
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,276
-I'll send you the address.
-Okay.

377
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,319
-Is it okay?
-What?

378
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:10,240
Will I finally get to meet the Jae-won
I heard so much about?

379
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,163
Two hundred meters until your destination.

380
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,631
You've arrived at your destination.
The navigation has ended.

381
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,050
It must be around here.

382
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,320
Yoon Seon-a?

383
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,992
Hey, Seon-a.

384
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,786
Seon-a.

385
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,914
Yoon Seon-a!

386
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,005
Seon-a!

387
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,015
Where did she go?

388
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,187
It was her.

389
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,357
I definitely saw her.

390
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,326
Hey, Kyeong-jun.

391
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,913
No, I'm nearby.

392
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,665
I saw Yoon Seon-a…

393
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,460
Never mind. I don't think I can go.

394
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,712
No, something came up.

395
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,464
Sorry.

396
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,643
Why do you think I stole the cameras?

397
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:07,315
It's because I found out
the Park Jae-won I'd met in Yangyang

398
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,902
was Kyeong-jun's cousin
when I came back to Seoul.

399
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,656
Those cameras were full of my photos.

400
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,450
I couldn't give them back to him.

401
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,747
I must find Seon-a.
And the cameras as well.

402
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,874
I…

403
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,670
I can forget her, but not my cameras.

404
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,382
They're really precious to me.

405
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,905
TAEPYEONG-RO POLICE BOX

406
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,494
Catch the thief.

407
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,829
The camera thief.

408
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,458
I… A camera thief.

409
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,336
She

410
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,505
stole my cameras.

411
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,508
Her name is Yoon Seon-a.

412
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,095
I'd like to report

413
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,806
this heinous camera thief.

414
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,187
-Hi.
-It's a small world.

415
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,106
It's smaller than you think.

416
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:15,360
We may not recognize each other,
but we might have crossed paths.

417
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,446
We could have met in an alley.

418
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,867
Or we could've drank at the same bar.

419
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,998
Or we could run into each other
in the future.

420
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,469
