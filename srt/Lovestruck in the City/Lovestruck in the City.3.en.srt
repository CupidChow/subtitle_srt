#VOLUNTARILY SINGLE

#IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,651
HOW IS YOUR LOVE?

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,248
-Bye.
-See you later. Bye.

8
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,775
Hi.

9
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,568
Oh, hi.

10
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,071
-Let's go eat breakfast.
-But--

11
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,572
Dog, I bet you're hungry, too.

12
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,832
Did you sleep well?

13
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,877
I woke up and saw you
sleeping like a baby.

14
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,379
I stared at your face for a while.

15
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,424
You looked cute.

16
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,711
I saw you talking to Gyeong-gu earlier.

17
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,839
-What did you talk about?
-What?

18
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,801
Oh, Gyeong-gu and I are
going to the movies tonight.

19
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,264
They're reshowing one of
Christopher Nolan's movies.

20
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,890
I love his movies, you know.

21
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,725
So does Gyeong-gu.

22
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,519
So we're going to watch it together.

23
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,107
I like Nolan's movies, too.
Christopher Nolan.

24
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,275
Who on Earth doesn't?

25
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,820
HOW WAS THE DAY AFTER?

26
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,780
The first thing I thought was…

27
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,993
"Did I mess up last night?
Didn't she want me last night?"

28
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,245
She realized you weren't it
after sleeping with you.

29
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,329
That's not true.

30
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,920
I'm good, you know.

31
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,172
I can't explain how good I am here,

32
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,883
but I'm good at it. Okay?

33
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,887
I'm good. You don't have to tell me that.

34
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,307
Why didn't you think
it could've been a one-night stand?

35
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,602
Aren't you that single guy
who hasn't dated for two years?

36
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,646
Are you making fun of me with that?
This is ridiculous.

37
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,107
I used to be quite popular.

38
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,902
How strange. We never agree.

39
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,487
If we ever meet,
I'd like to share a piece of advice.

40
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,282
Don't think about dating
when you don't understand women.

41
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,659
That's why I was dumped. So what?

42
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,329
It's all right. I got dumped, too.
It's no big deal.

43
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,706
Isn't it because
he told her that he loved her?

44
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,375
What's wrong with saying that?

45
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,419
It could've been too much.

46
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,755
Sleeping together doesn't mean
you're in love.

47
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,298
I know that.

48
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,633
I do think I took it a bit too far.

49
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,593
She just wanted to sleep with the guy,

50
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,553
but he said, "I love you."

51
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,097
I would've run away, too, if I was her.

52
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,058
I wouldn't sleep with you
if you were a girl.

53
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,809
Yeah, me, neither.

54
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,812
Seriously…
I really want to meet you in person.

55
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,565
Why would we meet?
It's clear that we can't get along.

56
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,568
Do you really need me to spell it out?

57
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,947
Kissing each other the next morning
like a long-term couple.

58
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,906
That's weirder.

59
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,242
Why? It's not bad for a start.

60
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,702
I guess she didn't want to start anything.

61
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,956
Focus on your love life.
You've been single for two years.

62
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,084
I'm staying single voluntarily. Okay?

63
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,961
It's not that I don't want to. I can't…

64
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,713
It's not that I can't date.
I choose not to.

65
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,300
There is a solution
to this kind of problem.

66
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,636
What can you do? She doesn't want him.

67
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,681
If she treats it like a one-night stand,
you do the same.

68
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,224
-What do you think?
-Hold on.

69
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,726
What? Have you ever done it?

70
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,436
No.

71
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,690
Right.

72
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,568
But why would you say that?

73
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,446
I would've forgotten her
if she wasn't around. But she was.

74
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,283
And you know what she did?
She drove me crazy.

75
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,791
Gyeong-gu and I are
going to the movies tonight.

76
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,051
Darn it.

77
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,157
Hey, Seon-a. Did you watch…

78
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,991
What's with her?
Am I invisible or something?

79
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,495
-You're here.
-Hey.

80
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,165
Did Mr. Kang In-su pick up his board?

81
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,584
He can't come today.
He'll pick it up tomorrow.

82
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,172
Seriously? It's like she's ignoring me.

83
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,310
Jae-won, you can play the guitar?

84
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,980
Of course. And I'm pretty good at it.

85
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,610
Are you learning the ukulele?

86
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,320
Yes.

87
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,160
Rather than the ukulele,
I think learning the guitar…

88
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,955
Learning the guitar might be…

89
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,083
better.

90
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,135
-Nice! There it goes!
-Hey.

91
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,220
-Hey!
-We got it.

92
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,022
One more time.

93
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,865
Sorry!

94
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,951
It's okay.

95
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,789
Damn it.

96
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,630
Here's your ramyeon.

97
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,842
I heard you went roller-skating
with Gyeong-gu.

98
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,512
-Yes.
-Are you good at roller-skating?

99
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,805
No. I fell a lot yesterday.

100
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,017
So that's why you're limping.

101
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,071
The pain relief patch.

102
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,323
Patch…

103
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,619
Damn it. What am I doing?

104
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,579
Forget it. Don't do it.

105
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,289
I won't help her.

106
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,292
Why should I?

107
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,968
I take back that
I'm attracted to strange women.

108
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,554
Now, I like normal women.

109
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,597
Rational, ordinary women.

110
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,225
A plain Jane who's ordinary and typical.

111
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,936
Someone predictable
who behaves as expected.

112
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,521
I don't want to be toyed with.

113
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,606
A WOMAN WHO HANGS OUT
AT HER WORKPLACE ON HER DAY OFF

114
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,902
So what does it mean to be normal?

115
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,114
There are countless women in the world,

116
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,991
and all of them are normal.

117
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:39,412
I really wish men could broaden
their imagination.

118
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,663
Every woman is different.

119
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,043
That's why it's fun.
I can have a variety of experiences.

120
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,590
5 YEARS AGO

121
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,014
Oh, gosh!

122
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,268
What's this?

123
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,541
Damn it.

124
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,847
Hi.

125
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,314
Hi.

126
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,704
By the way,

127
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,666
-how did we end up here?
-What?

128
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,002
-You don't remember?
-I didn't remember.

129
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,129
But I couldn't say so.

130
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,964
"What if she gets offended?"

131
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,342
I just didn't want to hurt her.

132
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,718
It's still a mystery to me.

133
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,679
I was definitely drinking
with my friends that night.

134
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,765
How did I end up there,

135
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,226
why was she wearing my T-shirt,

136
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,394
and who…

137
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,396
took off my clothes?

138
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,526
Do you want to grab a bite?
What do you like?

139
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,572
Well, I… What about you?

140
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,658
Ox blood hangover soup.

141
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,328
-What about you?
-Well, yes.

142
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,122
I love it.

143
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,207
Oh, right.

144
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,000
What's your name?

145
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,379
Kang Geon.

146
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,971
I'm Oh Seon-yeong.

147
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,483
If you're not hungry…

148
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,238
Shall we leave a bit later?

149
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,204
Open your heart.
You'll be able to enjoy your life more.

150
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,665
I'm always ready to throw myself
into the sea of adventures.

151
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,797
Here's what hurt me the most.

152
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,841
-Thanks, man.
-Okay.

153
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,301
-Leave it there.
-Really?

154
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,261
-Okay. Eat up.
-Thank you.

155
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,180
-What's that?
-Look at this.

156
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,348
Wait. That's…

157
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,601
Gosh. She's just amazing.

158
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,979
I went surfing with Seon-a yesterday.
She can do a bottom turn now.

159
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,064
-Really?
-Yes.

160
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,232
-Already?
-Yes.

161
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,442
Did you teach her?

162
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,320
No.

163
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,656
Someone else must have taught her.
See you.

164
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,326
BIN'S SURFING & RA-RA'S RAMYEON

165
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,911
She's incredible.

166
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,998
Who taught her how to surf? It was me.

167
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,626
Who should have taught her
the bottom turn?

168
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,586
It should've been me, of course.

169
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,046
Damn it.

170
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,229
I guess I can't surf today.
The waves are too calm today.

171
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,941
Since when did you like waves so much?

172
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,279
I should just take a nap.

173
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,587
Hey, Seon-a.

174
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,676
I heard you can do a bottom turn now.

175
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,804
Yes, I can.

176
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,145
I was going to teach you how to do it.

177
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,481
But since it's pretty dangerous,
I was worried you might get hurt.

178
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:04,653
So I've been checking the waves
for the right day.

179
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,072
Well, but…

180
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,158
you already know.

181
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,069
You're angry with me, right?

182
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,033
Sorry.

183
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,247
Yes. You did disappoint me--

184
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,999
Can I go over to your trailer later?

185
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,052
Yoon Seon-a, get up.

186
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,645
What's the deal with you?

187
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,898
Are you toying with me?

188
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,652
Okay. I won't come over, then.

189
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,166
Is that all you have to say?

190
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,969
Unbelievable.

191
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,642
You didn't go surfing, right?

192
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,936
The waves are quiet today.

193
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,146
Tell me about it.

194
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,025
-Going somewhere?
-Yes, to the movies.

195
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,611
I see. To the movies.

196
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,073
You must love movies.
You go to the movies so often.

197
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,576
I mean,

198
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,413
I know you went to the movies with Seon-a.

199
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,082
Christopher Nolan's films.

200
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,001
That? I couldn't go that night.

201
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,879
-Why not?
-We were going to watch it together,

202
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,672
but she said she'd watch it with you.

203
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,216
So I'm watching it alone today.

204
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,467
You didn't go with her?

205
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,678
See you.

206
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,139
Enjoy your movie.

207
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,776
The weather is damn beautiful.

208
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,863
NICE TO MEET YOU, NO HONORIFICS
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS

209
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,866
-It says, "no honorifics".
-We can't use honorifics here.

210
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,784
Interesting.

211
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,995
Welcome.

212
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,081
What do you want? That's the menu.

213
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,961
RAMYEON

214
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,921
-Ramyeon?
-Ramyeon?

215
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,048
I see. I knew it.

216
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,676
People who aren't adventurous
always order that.

217
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,637
Then, can you read everything here?

218
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,847
Of course.

219
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,683
I was perfect from day one.

220
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,560
Hong Kong, wonton mein.

221
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,272
-What about this?
-Cambodia, kuy teav.

222
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,523
Then, what's this?

223
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,817
Myanmar, mohinga.

224
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,362
-What about this?
-Germany, spätzle.

225
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,241
The noodles will get soggy.
So, what will you have?

226
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,910
This one. Wonton mein.

227
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:22,870
-Wonton mein.
-Wonton mein.

228
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,664
Wonton mein.
Okay. Two bowls of wonton mein.

229
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,466
Does your offer to come over
to my trailer still stand?

230
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,683
It will rain tomorrow.

231
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,311
Let's go to a field and wait for the rain.

232
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,774
-My Seon-a!
-Hey.

233
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,484
I got an octopus.

234
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,612
Put it in a big bowl.
I'll prepare it right away.

235
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,780
-Okay, I will.
-Thank you.

236
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,437
If you don't come by 6 p.m.,
I'll take it as an "I don't like you."

237
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,232
How could I go?

238
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,777
My shift ends at 10 p.m. today.

239
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,227
If you don't come by 6 p.m.,
I'll take it as an "I don't like you."

240
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,732
I thought if I left it
as a mere one-night stand,

241
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,859
it might be better.

242
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,511
I knew…

243
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,848
that I'd hurt him.

244
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,919
I did that on purpose.
I pretended to be clueless.

245
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,925
I thought it might be better
if I left it as a one-night stand.

246
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:26,887
But…

247
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,558
when I was lying down in the shade
he made for me,

248
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,603
this suddenly crossed my mind.

249
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,238
"Think about what made you
come all the way to Yangyang."

250
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,453
I came here because I hated myself.

251
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,790
I hated myself, Lee Eun-o.

252
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,626
Bye. Come again.

253
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,503
-We will.
-Promise me.

254
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,712
-Okay.
-Sure.

255
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,506
You startled me!

256
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,800
Ra-ra, can I get off early today?

257
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,885
-Why?
-To go to Jae-won.

258
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,471
-Jae-won?
-No. I'll go now.

259
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,265
-Fire me if you want to. Bye.
-What?

260
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,371
I decided to become Yoon Seon-a

261
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,748
and leave the coward Lee Eun-o behind.

262
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,543
I decided to do everything
I ever wanted to do,

263
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:43,797
rolling with the punches
and following my heart.

264
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:50,095
I always thought that I would live
as if every day was a party.

265
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,521
I don't need to hold in my feelings.

266
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,203
6:48 P.M.
OCTOBER 2, WEDNESDAY

267
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,793
This is humiliating.

268
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,672
Damn it.

269
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,592
I won't wait for an hour. Never.

270
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,040
Hey, Seon-a.

271
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,292
I thought you weren't coming--

272
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,817
Be it one night, ten days,
or several years.

273
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,279
I just thought it'd be okay
as long as I was with him

274
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,824
because he never asked me "why."

275
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,496
See? He's not asking me even now
why I ran and hugged him,

276
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,581
or why I'm being fickle.

277
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,255
I'm glad you didn't get too far.

278
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,883
I should've waited longer.

279
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,386
-So you didn't have to run.
-No.

280
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,513
I got you, so it's okay.

281
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,895
Do you know that you're really weird?

282
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,275
Yes. I am weird.

283
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,030
But why do I…

284
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,578
like you so much?

285
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,871
RA-RA'S RAMYEON

286
