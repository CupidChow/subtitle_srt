00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,262
=Episode 6=
(Encountering Zhong Kui)

4
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,440
You're really good-looking.

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,800
Even more than him,

6
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:57,959
him,

7
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,319
and him.

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,460
All of you are good-looking.

9
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,820
If you agree to be my wife,

10
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:05,480
I'll let you go.

11
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,220
Otherwise,
when Zhong Kui catches ghosts tonight,

12
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,720
you'll all die.

13
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,399
Scholar Zhong Nan
has hair standing on end.

14
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,960
He wears green robe, belt,
and wide black boots.

15
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,520
Big ghosts jump, while small ghosts cry.

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,240
Bloodied mouth
devours hearts and livers.

17
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,390
Summoning ghosts is easy.
Getting rid of them is hard.

18
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,600
Close the doors, stay safe.

19
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,639
Stay safe.

20
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,399
(This person seems hysterical.)

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,320
Do you have something to tell me?

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,000
Will you be my wife?

23
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,320
Dear.

24
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,080
That song you just sang was so creepy.

25
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,559
We also worship Zhong Kui,

26
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:48,880
but why does he eat people?

27
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,039
Because this mountain is full of villains.

28
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,279
Zhong Kui wants to eat them all up.

29
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,679
Stomach first,

30
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,440
then the skin,

31
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,919
and the bones.

32
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,720
And

33
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,320
the head.

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,919
Summoning ghosts is easy.
Getting rid of them is hard.

35
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,160
Getting rid of them is hard.

36
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,279
Dear.

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,199
You said

38
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,039
you wanted me to be your wife,

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,800
but you haven't even told me your name.

40
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,839
Me?

41
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,520
My name is...

42
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,639
My name is Huang Baotian.

43
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,160
I'm the king

44
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,600
here.

45
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,839
Your dear.

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,639
You said your surname is Huang.

47
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:30,679
Did your family run a funeral shop?

48
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:33,800
(Huang Family Shop)
In the back streets of the market.

49
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,759
How do you know?

50
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,880
Before my brother and I
went up the mountain,

51
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,880
we ran a shop in the city.

52
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,279
Baotian.

53
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,679
Light the lanterns.

54
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,679
Xuezhao Residence's

55
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,079
Divine Lady Thrush.

56
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,200
You recognize me?

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,600
I've seen you

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,200
at Xuezhao Residence.

59
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,959
You fool.

60
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,839
You two, follow me.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,160
Please

62
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,279
resolve the ghost problem
on this mountain.

63
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,640
You mean Zhong Kui summoning ghosts?

64
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,359
Since I'm here,

65
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,040
I can't just stand by.

66
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,239
I'm Divine Lady Thrush's...

67
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,560
This person is named Lu Yanchong.

68
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,480
He's the new magistrate
of Huachang County.

69
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,959
He's here to hunt bandits.

70
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,190
I pretended to lead him up the mountain
to help you eliminate this major threat.

71
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,720
If you don't want trouble,

72
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,160
you'd better tie him up

73
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,000
and feed him to Zhong Kui.

74
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,320
Sir.

75
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,839
You're two-faced,
harbor treacherous intentions,

76
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,410
and have repeatedly plotted against me.

77
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,559
You don't think

78
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,880
I'll just let it go, do you?

79
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,875
(Midnight)

80
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:17,720
Summoning ghosts is easy.
Getting rid of them is hard.

81
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,000
Lose the head, stay safe.

82
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,160
Lead into the basin, expose it to sun.

83
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,600
Share the same tides and humidity.

84
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,079
As expected,

85
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,200
it's poisonous.

86
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,690
This is the layout
of the mountain stronghold.

87
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,719
You're skilled.

88
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,690
That's why you dared
to go up the mountain alone.

89
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,320
You're not greedy for credit
or colluding with bandits as we thought.

90
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,479
Even if I followed,

91
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,440
I couldn't remember
such a complex stronghold layout

92
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,960
so clearly.

93
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,760
Hurry down the mountain

94
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,440
and bring men to wipe out the bandits.

95
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,760
There seems to be poison on the claws.

96
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,440
I have a bezoar pill.

97
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,760
Please take it, Sir.

98
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,180
You even changed the way you address me.

99
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,880
I misjudged you.

100
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,440
Once we deal with these bandits,

101
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,440
I'll apologize to you properly.

102
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,700
(Officiated
By Huang Baocheng and Huang Baotian)

103
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,562
(Spirit Tablet of Huang Agen, Officiated
by Huang Baocheng and Huang Baotian)

104
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,599
(Spirit Tablet of Huang Agen.)

105
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:56,475
(Died in the Third Month
of the Jihai year)

106
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,280
The third Month of the Jihai year.

107
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,719
(It's the same month
the Thrush Case occurred.)

108
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:04,320
Who?

109
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:17,050
(Spirit Tablet of Huang Agen)

110
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,350
(Died in the Third Month
of the Jihai year)

111
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,719
(I'm really curious)

112
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,479
(what in this world could scare you.)

113
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:40,320
Sir.

114
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,159
You don't think

115
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,320
I'll just let it go, do you?

116
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,119
(Jiang Chun is Outside.)

117
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,359
Speaking of which,

118
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,239
County Magistrate Jiang
is my subordinate.

119
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,559
Now,

120
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,280
you two are getting more in sync.

121
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,080
I almost wish
that County Magistrate Jiang

122
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,400
hadn't arrived in time yesterday,

123
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,640
so you would have died
under Zhong Kui's hands.

124
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,760
Do you hate me that much?

125
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:09,679
I have a chronic illness.

126
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,119
I need traditional acupuncture
every day at dusk.

127
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,599
Yesterday you tied me up,

128
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,919
making me miss the time.

129
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,080
I almost died in the countryside.

130
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,760
I didn't know.

131
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,880
Yes, you didn't know.

132
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
If you really
had ill intentions toward me,

133
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,760
I wouldn't be alive now.

134
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,760
But I can't let my guard down

135
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,640
around you.

136
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,760
You tied me out of the city.

137
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,960
I used you to go up the mountain.

138
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,080
We're even.

139
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,559
After going down the mountain,

140
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,280
we'd better separate completely

141
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,200
and have nothing to do with each other.

142
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,200
I just took a walk outside

143
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,880
and gathered some news.

144
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,760
It's said that

145
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,679
Huang Baotian dug up
several jars of wine

146
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,799
in the forest a few days ago.

147
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,719
All the people who drank with him
that night ended up dead.

148
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,520
And all of them lost heir heads.

149
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,559
Huang Baotian went mad from then on.

150
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,559
Later,

151
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,239
anyone left alone after midnight

152
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,000
would easily lose their head.

153
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,520
Tell me.

154
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:09,000
Who could this head-eating Zhong Kui be?

155
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,039
Huang Baotian.

156
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,359
I guess you have many questions for him,

157
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,400
so I deliberately captured him.

158
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,159
Consider it

159
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,719
an apology for my rashness yesterday.

160
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,612
(Died in the Third Month
of the Jihai year)

161
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,479
In the sixth month of the Jihai year,

162
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,200
did you and your brother

163
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,080
bury a head

164
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,919
at Qili Slope outside Huachang County?

165
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,280
A head?

166
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,719
Qili Slope.

167
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,320
Yes, Qili Slope.

168
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,400
Whose head was it?

169
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,239
Father suddenly died.

170
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:08,880
Baocheng cut off the head.

171
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,080
Head.

172
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,799
Why did you put

173
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,080
Li Ji's seal on that head?

174
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:19,280
Lead into the basin, expose it to sun.

175
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,479
Share the same tides and humidity.

176
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,719
Someone paid money.

177
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,280
A lot of money.

178
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,960
Someone took the head.

179
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:30,000
He's too crazy.

180
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,239
We can't get anything from him.

181
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
To get solid evidence,

182
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,440
you need to subdue
his superstitious older brother.

183
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,799
Head.

184
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,080
Head.

185
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,520
Head.

186
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,400
What did you do?

187
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,760
The fake evidence back then

188

Teach me.

Insert downward.

202
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,840
Use a bit more force.
