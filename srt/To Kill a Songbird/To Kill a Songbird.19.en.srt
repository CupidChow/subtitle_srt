00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

00:01:11,012 --> 00:01:14,325
=Episode 19=
(How to Foresee A Bird Killer?)

4
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,879
So,

5
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:20,040
that is how you intend to do this.

6
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:21,279
Very well.

7
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,720
The young are truly formidable.

8
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:25,959
But...

9
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,599
A weight has been lifted off my chest.

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,360
You knew we would act today,

11
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,400
so you deliberately...

12
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,639
You want us to reveal our cards.

13
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,800
What a clever lady.

14
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,599
So you're striking now

15
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,199
to...

16
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:51,959
Exactly.

17
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,040
As long as everyone here dies,

18
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,680
no one will gossip again.

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,839
Official Liang.

20
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,680
You can't...

21
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,319
Murder.

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,479
He's dead.

23
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,199
There's no hurry.

24
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,279
One by one.

25
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,839
Take it slow.

26
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,880
But I must thank you, Miss Li.

27
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,080
Your thrush illusion

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,320
is famous in Huachang County.

29
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,039
So these people dying

30
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:26,399
under your uncontrolled illusion

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,240
isn't exactly strange.

32
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,839
Don't you agree?

33
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,279
I'm here.

34
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:47,720
You...

35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,720
(I knew you wouldn't involve me.)

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,399
(How could I not be alert?)

37
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,160
(Bound as husband and wife,)

38
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,279
(we share life and death.)

39
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,919
(At a time like this,)

40
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,800
(don't think of abandoning
the husband you just wed.)

41
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,759
Do you think

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,639
I'm a villain?

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,720
I was born a commoner

44
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,839
with no ancestral protection,

45
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,199
nor noble patronage.

46
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,399
If I followed the rules,

47
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:16,759
serving as a minor county magistrate,

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,320
how long until I get promoted?

49
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,960
How long to help more people?

50
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,199
After leaving
and taking office elsewhere,

51
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,559
how many achievements did I gain?

52
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,800
How many people

53
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,000
truly thanked me as their magistrate?

54
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,479
How many

55
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:41,800
capable officials without backing
did I promote?

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,559
How much did I do
for this overstaffed court?

57
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,960
Did you ever know?

58
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:53,080
Yet now you condemn my past mistakes.

59
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,360
Aren't you shortsighted?

60
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,520
A fine couple.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,039
What a pity.

62
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,360
A bright moon over a gutter.

63
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:05,440
You're like Li Ji.

64
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,639
You lack that fortune.

65
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,119
Kill them.

66
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,119
The evidence is here.

67
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,650
(Master Jiang.)

68
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,480
(Liang Andao knows I learned the truth.)

69
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,990
(Leave the city as per your plan
and lure out the hidden scouts.)

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,519
(Then help me find one person)

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,679
(as my final gamble.)

72
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,959
Tell them

73
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,000
who you are.

74
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,640
My surname is Huang.

75
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,440
I'm Inspecting Envoy Zhai Lu's wife.

76
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,040
Liang Andao.

77
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,839
You captured me and my children.

78
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:44,239
You forced my husband to die for you

79
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,839
and planned to kill us all.

80
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,359
How vicious.

81
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,679
I have household records.

82
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,160
My identity can be verified.

83
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,079
Liang traitor, what can you say now?

84
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,440
This is your so called evidence?

85
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,160
The evidence is here.

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,160
(Mr. Cui San.)

87
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,760
(You know the truth best.)

88
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,959
(This chance is rare.)

89
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:15,040
(I ask you to feign death)

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,959
(to help expose this darkness.)

91
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
This letter

92
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,440
was taken from a hidden compartment
in Fan Jili's home.

93
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,519
It's the anonymous letter you used

94
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,320
to have him
slander Li Ji and fabricate evidence.

95
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,519
You guard gentlemen
but not against villains.

96
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,119
You invited Fan Jili to the wedding

97
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,600
to silence him as well.

98
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,279
And if I went to his house,

99
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,279
his family would naturally hand
his lifesaving trump card over to me .

100
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,959
Though this happened over ten years ago,

101
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,880
the incident was sudden back then.

102
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,990
There was no time to find someone
to write this letter.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,920
This handwriting

104
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,279
is yours.

105
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,200
The proof is right here.

106
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,399
(Mrs. Shen.)

107
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,279
(Yexin and Huiyi are with me.)

108
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,590
(Their lives may be in danger.)

109
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,880
(I've verified Liang Andao's men.)

110
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,679
(They're all mountain bandits.)

111
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,799
(They only want payment.)

112
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,600
(Now,)

113
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,320
(you may reunite with your two sons.)

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,440
This is my husband Shen Xiu's real head

115
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:29,119
and Zhao Chengxi's confession letter.

116
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,160
It details how you once ordered him

117
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,559
and the Huang brothers
to kill Li Ji through Shen Xiu.

118
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,920
It was written back then
for self protection

119
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,440
and hidden in the tree hollow
with the body.

120
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,720
Official Liang.

121
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,000
This evidence
cannot be called unreliable, right?

122
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,000
We must thank Zhai Lu for this.

123
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,359
If he hadn't deliberately reminded us,

124
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,720
we would never have thought

125
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,880
of that thrush.

126
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,799
Unexpectedly,

127
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,559
the little thrush

128
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,880
we released back then

129
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,279
turned out to be

130
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,799
the key to breaking the case.

131
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,839
That Mofeibai was my husband Xiu's bird

132
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,079
for many years.

133
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,480
It knew the way home,

134
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,760
so it flew back on its own
after the murder.

135
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,559
Since it knew the way home,

136
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,880
it wasn't hard to find the crime scene.

137
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,839
Though the head had turned to bone,

138
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,279
unexpectedly,

139
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
the letter was intact.

140
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:27,839
It's a miracle, or perhaps fate.

141
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,720
Even so,

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,519
I could kill you all.

143
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,640
Let's see who could convict me.

144
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,279
Liang Andao.

145
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,600
Official Liang.

146
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,600
You're the imperial censor,
patrolling on behalf of heaven.

147
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Local officials cannot judge you.

148
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,399
But I, Vice Censor-in-Chief,

149
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:54,679
should still be able to question you

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
and take charge of this matter.

151
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,519
You fell off a cliff days ago

152
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,640
and alarmed Master Lu.

153
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,920
He insisted
I urge Official Liang to come.

154
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,839
Official Liang,
you worked with Official Cen for years.

155
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,679
You must have recognized him long ago

156
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,959
and thus had misgivings.

157
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,359
Otherwise,
Master Lu and I would be dead.

158
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,600
Because you feared Official Cen

159
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,359
and knew this couldn't be ended lightly,

160
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,200
you coerced Zhai Lu

161
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,959
to take the blame and close the case.

162
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,559
I've reviewed
all evidence Jiang Chun sent.

163
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,839
I have also detained your men.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,799
So be it.

165
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,320
Didn't you...

166
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,440
Didn't I already leave?

167
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,000
That's because someone

168
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
stopped me halfway

169
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,799
and told me the whole truth.

170
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,440
Sorry.

171
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,790
I couldn't tell you
the truth this morning.

172
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Why do you smell so strongly of dew?

173
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,880
I slept poorly last night

174
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,359
and went out for a walk.

175
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,919
I was the one
who invited Official Cen back.

176
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,679
I lost.

177
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,799
- But I don't...
- You don't understand how?

178
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,200
Please enlighten me.

179
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,080
Official Liang once asked Zhai Lu

180
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,200
where the minor official

181
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,440
who spoke for the people went.

182
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,559
Official Liang.

183
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:25,280
Were you not also speaking of yourself?

184
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,280
Now that you have become this,

185
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:30,239
how will you face
your wife and children?

186
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,320
Sir.

187
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,640
You shouldn't ask me how.

188
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,080
The official world is unstable.

189
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,840
Pure and tainted are one.

190
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,520
The career path is perilous.

191
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:44,159
It's not yet time for you to understand.

192
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,039
Official Liang.

193
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,559
We could have avoided pursuit

194
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,400
by hiding our tracks

195
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,000
and avoided this disaster.

196
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,719
But we all came back anyway

197
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,080
and took part in this.

198
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,479
Do you know why?

199
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,440
If you don't remember,

200
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll tell you a case.

201
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,799
In the first year of Chongning,
a wealthy household was robbed.

202
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
An old man was named as the culprit.

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
He was flogged 40 times

204
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,000
and died in the courtroom.

205
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,479
There was no solid physical evidence.

206
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,090
Neighbors only claimed
he got rich suddenly

207
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,580
and bought several jars of fine wine.

208
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,559
They declared him guilty of theft.

209
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
His son was originally a coroner.

210
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,359
Due to this case, he could no longer
serve at the magistrate's office.

211
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,159
With no other methods to make a living,

212
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:34,599
he buried his father
and jumped into the river that night.

213
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,039
Sir.

214
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,880
That young coroner was my predecessor.

215
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,760
This case was doubtful, was it not?

216
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,520
Official Liang.

217
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,039
I also have a case.

218
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,200
There was a scholar surnamed Shen

219
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
who argued with someone
and pushed him by accident.

220
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,559
Unexpectedly, that person

221
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,119
mysteriously died that evening.

222
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,919
The scholar was thus convicted

223
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,479
and thrown into prison,

224
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,919
where he soon died of illness.

225
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,840
This scholar surnamed Shen

226
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,200
was my father-in-law.

227
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,200
Because of his crime,

228
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,440
my husband Shen Xiu lost the qualification
for the provincial exam

229
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,400
and made a living
by raising birds from then on.

230
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,280
This case is questionable,

231
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:16,080
was it not?

232
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,320
Sir.

233
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,799
These two cases

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
were all recorded
by Li Ji in the petition.

235
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,119
48 case files.

236
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,200
48 sentences
stating "this case is doubtful."

237
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,840
When you read them back then,

238
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,840
did you feel any awe

239
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,960
or a hint of guilt?

240
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,719
You have probably forgotten by now

241
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,239
what Li Ji wished to tell you

242
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,559
behind these case files.

243
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,039
Today, I wish to

244
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:44,359
say it to you once again.

245
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:50,479
There are three essentials
in legal matters.

246
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,159
First, evidence must be solid.

247
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,640
Solid means

248
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,159
there must be verification
by two or more people.

249
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,039
(Second, verify carefully
at the appointed time.)

250
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,960
(With multiple people present,)

251
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,239
(examine the terrain)

252
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,840
(and record it properly.)

253
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,799
(Use written, oral, and case records.)

254
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,719
(These form the three records.)

255
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:16,640
Yet the essence of judgment
lies in the people, in the common folk,

256
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,200
and depends on justice and fairness,

257
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,960
not on merit or fame.

258
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,719
I heard that you

259
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,559
were once a good official
who petitioned for the people.

260
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,880
May you never forget
your original intent.

261
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,440
(Petition to Official Liang Andao)
Reflect on old ambitions.

262
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:40,000
Hence this petition today.

263
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,239
I hope you review old cases,

264
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,359
redress the wrongs,
and separate the pure from the corrupt.

265
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,159
Serve the people for the people,
and uphold the name of Justice.

266
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,640
You may not wish to be this clear wind,

267
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,679
but there will always be
someone who does.

268
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,679
And someone will always remember

269
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,400
what he has done

270
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,159
and the paths he has taken.

271
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:06,125
(Pure And Righteous Mind)

272
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:06,919
(Pure And Righteous Mind)
(Official Liang.)

273
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,200
(Each word of this petition)

274
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,359
(Pure And Righteous Mind)
(expresses my concern.)

275
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:15,119
(I earnestly request
you take time to read it.)

276
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,200
(If you accept a suggestion or two,)

277
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,479
(Petition to Official Liang Andao)
(it will be a blessing to all.)

278
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,359
(And I will have no regrets.)

279
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,599
Don't blame the clear wind
for dispelling my filth.

280
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,799
Li Ji.

281
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,000
