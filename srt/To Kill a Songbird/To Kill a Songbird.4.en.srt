(Jiang Saw Only Black and White)

4
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,160
If I must leave,

5
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,080
I can stand anywhere.

6
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,760
But I have things I must do.

7
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,000
I cannot leave.

8
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,319
Thank you for your guidance.

9
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,160
Can you speak a bit closer?

10
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:55,160
Master Jiang, look here.

11
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,440
How many blue strands

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,160
and red strands are there?

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Blue.

14
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,680
- Red.
- Yes.

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
Count them carefully.

16
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,399
When you're done, close your eyes.

17
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,039
I have something to ask you.

18
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,720
You have something to ask me?

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Blue.

20
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,360
Red.

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,880
No blue.

22
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,119
No red either.

23
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,000
Why?

24
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,160
Why are there no blue or red?

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,399
You're not very skilled.

26
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,119
You even failed at confusing the mind.

27
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,000
It can't be my fault.

28
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,279
Then whose fault is it?

29
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,880
It's his eyes.

30
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,639
Jiang Chun.

31
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,600
Yes.

32
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,199
13 years ago,

33
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,199
you lived in Huachang County, right?

34
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:05,479
Yes.

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,759
How old were you then?

36
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,039
14.

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,000
You picked up a severed head,
didn't you?

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,880
Yes.

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,360
How did you come across that head?

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,479
I didn't pick it up myself.

41
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,320
I...

42
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,479
I went to fetch it.

43
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,600
That night,

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,960
it rained heavily.

45
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:30,000
My father slipped on duty
and broke his leg.

46
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,360
The magistrate's office
didn't want to rehire him.

47
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,759
I wanted to ask
my father's colleagues again

48
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,399
to put in a good word for him.

49
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,440
But I think I got lost.

50
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,000
The rain was heavy,

51
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,880
and it was dark all around.

52
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,800
I took shelter under a random eave.

53
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,199
Coincidentally,

54
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,520
I heard two people
talking inside a house.

55
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,800
It's nearly ruined.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,390
Take it to the magistrate's office
tomorrow for the reward.

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,839
And the reward money from that gentleman

58
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,380
should be able to let us
live comfortably for a few years.

59
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,320
Is the location safe?

60
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,679
Qili Slope is a place no one goes to.

61
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,279
I didn't understand
what they were saying at the time,

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,839
only that there was reward money.

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,119
If there was money,

64
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,960
I could hire a physician
to heal my father's leg.

65
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,679
I feared they would dig up the treasure

66
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,480
the next day,

67
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
so I ran to Qili Slope that night.

68
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,160
From the slope,

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,600
I dug up the long-missing head

70
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,480
of Shen Xiu, the murder victim.

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,119
I think I heard about this case too.

72
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,799
You did all this just to investigate?

73
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,160
What's your connection to it?

74
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,239
Could it be

75
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,440
that you're a victim?

76
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,760
Alright, I get it.

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,880
No more questions.

78
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,000
Stay away and be a dog.

79
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:55,679
Do you have a problem with your eyes?

80
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,559
Yes.

81
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,519
I'm colorblind.

82
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:02,799
I can only see black and white.

83
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,000
Some people made a fuss,

84
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:07,519
insisting on blue and red.

85
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,959
Yet he cannot see them at all.

86
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,799
Who did you

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,079
go to for help?

88
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,959
Do you remember where they lived?

89
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,799
The first person I went to
lived on Yuehua Street.

90
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,920
East of the county magistrate's office.

91
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,679
There were many alleys. I got lost.

92
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:28,160
But the general direction was correct.

93
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,239
You want to find

94
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
the house that hid the head?

95
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,119
If you follow his directions,

96
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,519
you probably won't find it.

97
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,399
In the fifth year of Chongning,

98
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:40,760
there was a fire around Yuehua Street.

99
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,959
The 5 lanes and 19 streets

100
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,679
were all rebuilt.

101
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,359
Locations, sizes, and residents

102
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,679
were all very different
from 13 years ago.

103
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,279
How do you know?

104
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,040
Since I came to Huachang County,

105
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,320
I would check the local county records

106
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,640
and other case files.

107
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,000
Coincidentally,

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,640
I also have a photographic memory.

109
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,920
So don't bother

110
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,959
trying to scare me
with your so-called poison.

111
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,760
If I get scared,

112
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,239
I might forget everything.

113
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,799
How could I do that?

114
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,519
I still

115
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,480
have to rely on you.

116
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,160
Come over.

117
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,600
Get to work.

118
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,640
Me?

119
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,480
You've been called here too?

120
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,679
Who is this old man?

121
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:00,839
Why is he so fierce?

122
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,359
Mr. Cui San is the county coroner.

123
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,040
You can offend the county magistrate,

124
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,959
but never offend

125
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,119
Mr. Cui.

126
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,079
This old man

127
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,640
tricked us into doing labor.

128
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,959
Where did he go?

129
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,880
This young lady

130
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
is extremely bold.

131
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,920
Are you sure he won't remember this
when he wakes up?

132
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,640
Normally, he wouldn't.

133
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,720
And if he does?

134
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,399
Then I'm doomed.

135
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,480
And

136
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,440
I'll take you down with me.

137
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,839
Give him

138
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,720
one of your Don't Defy.

139
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,119
You think it's a jujube cake

140
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,040
that's always available?

141
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,160
It's the only one,
and it's been used on you.

142
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,640
We might as well go all in.

143
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,799
How about

144
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,559
locking him up with Fan Jili?

145
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,640
No need to test me.

146
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,990
No need to get this close either.

147
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,260
County Magistrate Jiang.

148
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,359
Sorry for knocking you out earlier.

149
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,520
But you have to understand me.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,280
Suddenly seeing a man

151
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,039
break into my fiancée's room,

152
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,559
it's normal that I didn't react gently.

153
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,599
Fiancée?

154
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,840
She...

155
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,039
She's Divine Lady Thrush
of Xuezhao Residence.

156
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,400
What's with Divine Lady Thrush?

157
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,440
I fell in love with Yuan Yuan
at first sight.

158
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,440
Yuan Yuan

159
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,440
also agreed to be with me forever.

160
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:58,599
Besides, when I fell into the water
a few days ago,

161
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,750
it was Yuan Yuan who saved me.

162
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,559
Since then, I kept thinking of her.

163
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,280
Ms. Li.

164
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:05,960
You...

165
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:07,679
Thank you for understanding.

166
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,919
Shi is the fate I cannot escape.

167
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,159
I voluntarily stayed here

168
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,960
to marry him.

169
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,119
In that case,

170
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:21,919
I acted unnecessarily.

171
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,640
Farewell.

172
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,919
Yuan Yuan?

173
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,960
(Gathering Auspiciousness With the Sun)
Fate I cannot escape.

174
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,025
In terms
of being cheesy and exaggerated,

175
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:07,960
you're no worse than me.

176
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,239
This guy is quite strong,

177
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,400
but he's not very clever.

178
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,679
We actually fooled him with nonsense.

179
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,479
Still not as good as you.

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,280
Extremely cunning

181
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,840
and full of lies.

182
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,479
You lied.

183
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
What do you mean?

184
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,640
You were just talking nonsense.

185
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:29,840
Tell me.

186
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,320
What did you do to me?

187
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,239
Jiang Chun, don't forget

188
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,039
I'm your superior.

189
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:36,520
You speak,

190
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,280
or you speak.

191
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,599
How dare a mere county magistrate...

192
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,440
Don't yell.

193
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:45,840
Don't you want to know
how the head came about?

194
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,039
I'm a warrior,

195
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,840
not a fool.

196
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,719
Fan Jili had just died,

197
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,679
and you came for me.

198
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,679
How could it be so coincidental?

199
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,039
I had no dealings with Fan Jili.

200
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,440
The only connection is the Thrush Case.

201
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:03,760
You're investigating it.

202
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,039
Since seven or eight years ago,

203
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,640
I run down this street daily.

204
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:20,000
Why?

205
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,119
A child of ten

206
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,520
may indeed understand nothing,

207
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,679
but does one remain clueless forever?

208
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,640
When I grew older,

209
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,239
I figured out the key points

210
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,239
and understood the mystery of that head.

211
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,799
I could no longer find peace.

212
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,640
You want to find
the people who talked that night.

213
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,200
Investigate every doubt.

214
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,520
But many years have passed.

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,440
I need solid evidence

216
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,210
to continue the investigation.

217
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,990
The people who talked that night
are solid evidence.

218
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,200
But the fire on Yuehua Street

219
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,640
changed everything.

220
00:11:58,359 --> 00:11:59,840
Finding them again after so many years

221
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,359
would be extremely difficult.

222
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,320
Yes.

223
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:06,039
But with the county magistrate
from Bian Jing here,

224
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,559
things are very different.

225
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,359
I have a feeling

226
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:16,880
that you two

227
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:18,640
are even more closely linked.

228
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,039
Since our goals align,

229
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,440
why did you attack us just now?

230
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,760
Because I was a bit upset earlier.

231
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:30,960
I...

232
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,000
Since Magistrate Lu
has seen the original maps,

233
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,200
we might as well compare on site.

234
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,790
Helping County Magistrate Jiang recall
is easy,

235
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,000
but

236
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:48,640
to survey and pinpoint locations
on the spot

237
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,119
won't be easy.

238
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,280
Yuehua Street ran east-west,

239
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,679
about 1.5 li long and 2 zhang wide.

240
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,119
What lay to either side,

241
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,239
and how far away?

242
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,239
To the north lay Yongquan Lane,

243
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,359
one zhang away.

244
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,239
To the south was the market,
two zhang away.

245
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,359
The street had 126 households,
shops, and land plots.

246
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,280
Arranged systematically.

247
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,559
Each about 1.5 zhang wide.

248
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,640
That day I walked toward higher ground.

249
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:30,400
it should be due east.

250
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,599
I ran
for half a tea session's time at first.

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,440
I passed dozens of houses

252
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,200
before coming across a fork in the road

253
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,000
and got lost.

254
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,280
But I felt the direction was right.

255
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,200
The direction was right,

256
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,520
so the two forks weren't straight paths.

257
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,359
Probably with a small angle in between.

258
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,039
The path going in one direction
should be

259
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,239
Chunxing Street.

260
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,559
The fork branched into a crossroad.

261
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,359
You could see
a white pagoda in the distance

262
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,960
from one side.

263
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,559
That night's hut

264
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,559
should be right here.

265
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:25,587
