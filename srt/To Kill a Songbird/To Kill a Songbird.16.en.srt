(Let True Heart Be Laid Bare)

4
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,440
Only if the two of you die together

5
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,519
will this case be sealed beyond doubt.

6
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,519
Besides,

7
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,199
he prepared the tung-oil fuse.

8
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,080
It has nothing to do with me.

9
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,400
Human affection

10
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,199
is as thin as water.

11
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,680
From this day forth,

12
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,000
may you be like a kite with wings,

13
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,919
free to soar any sky as you please.

14
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:50,959
Stop right there!

15
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:19,440
Imperial Censor,

16
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,160
Official Liang Andao, is here.

17
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,639
Zhai Lu.

18
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,759
I have read all the evidence
Jiang Chun submitted.

19
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,119
I have restrained your men.

20
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,360
More than ten years ago,

21
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:37,320
I met you on my way
to the capital to report for duty.

22
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:40,279
You were gravely ill on the road,

23
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,919
yet you refused to turn back.

24
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,240
Only then did I learn the reason.

25
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,800
A powerful official had
seized common land,

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,559
ruining an entire family.

27
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,240
You were a mere court clerk,

28
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,960
yet you carried the written charge

29
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,679
to the capital to accuse them.

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
When I was in my early twenties,

31
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,160
I was not the man I am today.

32
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,520
Now that you have become a monster,

33
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:09,000
how can you face your family again?

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,880
So be it, then.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,880
Back then,

36
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,839
when Zhao Chengxi sent me silver,

37
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,800
and I agreed to settle that case,

38
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,440
I already knew this day would come.

39
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,479
My Lord,

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,880
there is no need to ask
how I feel about it.

41
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,440
In officialdom,

42
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,080
integrity and corruption flow together.

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,080
Even had I refused his silver,

44
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,800
I would only have taken someone else's.

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,520
Had I refused to join their ranks,

46
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,240
I would never have become so powerful.

47
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,080
The east wind wrongly holds
the power over blossoms.

48
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,479
A single quiet tune outweighs
a thousand in gold.

49
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,279
When you dared to write such verses

50
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,720
at Tunhai House
to mock the Chancellor,

51
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,080
you knew you were risking your life.

52
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,839
Judging by what you have done today,

53
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,839
you no longer fear death.

54
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,759
But those with great courage

55
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,639
do not always meet a good end.

56
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,880
Who would have thought,

57
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,079
that the small thrush
spared all those years ago

58
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,119
would become the key
to breaking the deadlock?

59
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:34,359
This is truly

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,839
the workings of fate

61
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,119
that mere mortals can never fathom.

62
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,679
(The eighth year of Zhenghe,)

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,160

Take the box out at once.

I tricked him into pressing
his fingerprint onto the testimony.

Official Liang

71
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,720
clearly does not stand with him.

This case

73
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,200
can be won.

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,200

As for the Thrush Case,

I had already looked into it in secret.

138
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,600
The facts are largely clear.

139
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,559

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
Hiding it from you

144
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,760
was because of the prophecy.

145
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,280
I did not wish to involve you.

146
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,359
Now,

147
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,080
none of it matters anymore.

148
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,400
I am from Luoyang.

149
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,520
My family had some means,

150
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,159
but I was sickly.

151
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,559
So I was raised dressed as a girl.

152
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,960
I was the second son.

153
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,599
I had an elder brother,

154
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,000
and a youngest brother

155
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,719
everyone doted on.

156
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,359
There was never
much place for me at home.

157
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,239
At the time,
a cousin lived in Huachang County.

158
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,440
So my family used that as an excuse

159
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,359
to send me there to recover.

160
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,080
I saved a little money in secret,

161
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,599
and asked my cousin

162
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,799
to find someone
to teach me my letters.

163
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,080
After looking around,

164
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,400
he chose Li Ji.

165
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,159
His fees

166
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,880
were lower compared to others,

167
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,880
and more importantly,

168
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,479
he was willing to teach poor girls.

169
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,919
That was why.

170
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,520
I studied there
only six or seven months,

171
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,520
yet every day from that time

172
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,080
is still clear to me.

173
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,200
I know.

174
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,200
You remember everything you see.

175
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,599
Yes.

176
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,280
In those hundreds of days,

177
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,440
every book, every painting,
every manuscript

178
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,599
still lives clearly in my mind.

179
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,599
My teacher

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,039
only taught me for a few short months,

181
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,520
yet what he gave me went
far beyond that time.

182
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,119
Things I did not understand back then

183
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,200
only made sense

184
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,679
after I grew older.

185
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Only then did I know

186
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,359
what true clarity

187
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,559
and real intelligence meant.

188
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,559
Back then, I was playful,

189
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
never fond of studying.

190
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:34,159
I hardly ever went to the academy.

191
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,440
Did we ever meet?

192
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,919
But everyone said

193
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,200
the Second Young Lady was
a little tyrant,

194
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,440
a troublemaker.

195
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,159
Every time I saw you,

196
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,719
I would keep well out of your way.

197
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,400
And after that?

198
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,400
And then,

199
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,880
when the Thrush Case broke out,

200
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,679
we children were all dismissed.

201
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,679
All the academy's books

202
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,799
(Pure And Righteous Mind)
were confiscated.

203
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,960
I heard the teacher
had been convicted,

204
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:03,840
and I was heartbroken.

205
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,679
But I was still just a child,

206
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,559
what could I possibly do?

207
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,400
Later on,

208
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,119
I heard the teacher
took his own life in prison.

209
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,799
A month passed,

210
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,080
(Marginal Notes to the Book of Songs)
and my cousin

211
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,559
was heading
to the capital on business.

212
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,840
He took me with him.

213
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,119
I thought I would return
to the academy once more,

214
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,440
I still had

215
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:24,679
a few scraps of silver,

216
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,719
enough to give
to the teacher's family.

217
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:27,450
(Pure And Righteous Mind)

218
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,280
And that day,

219
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,640
I saw how tragic it was.

220
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,919
I devoted myself to my studies.

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,039
I became an officer.

222
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,320
Everything I did

223
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,000
was for the sake of returning here.

224
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,440
I wanted to know the truth

225
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:51,159
of what really happened back then.

226
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:53,119
I never believed

227
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,440
that my teacher,

228
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,440
your brother,

229
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,359
could ever have been a murderer.

230
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,960
Fortunately, Official Liang has agreed

231
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,200
to reopen the case soon.

232
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,960
Set your mind at ease.

233
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:09,080
Years of hardship

234
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,719
will one day fully melt away.

235
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,200
Good morning, Mr. Cui San.

236
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,599
Mr. Cui San,

237
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,599
you did know my brother, didn't you?

238
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,740
In the fifth year of Chongning,

239
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,239
there was a severe locust plague.

240
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,599
Many county records and documents

241
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,039
were damaged by insects.

242
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,799
Your brother helped repair

243
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,679
and copy the files
at the magistrate's office

244
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,119
In that time,

245
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,039
we worked together for three months.

246
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,080
When he was convicted,

247
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,559
I should have spoken up for him.

248
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,760
But back then,

249
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:03,119
I did not have the courage.

250
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,880
Justice Liang truly
lives up to his name.

251
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,000
In just a few days,

252
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,679
with the files Mr. Cui preserved

253
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,479
and the evidence from the Thrush Case,

254
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,880
everything has been sorted.

255
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,200
Only the hearing remains.

256
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,960
Official Liang learned
of our background

257
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,159
and sympathized with us.

258
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,679
He restored our household status

259
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,940
and returned our principal funds.

260
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,599
I plan to leave
Haining County with Huiyi

261
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,200
to start a small business in the capital.

262
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,000
Official Liang mentioned

263
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,320
that Bianjing is flourishing.

264
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,679
I would like to see it.

265
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,239
I hear you may be promoted.

266
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,190
I may be transferred
to the Guard Command.

267
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,440
My mourning period has ended,

268
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,400
and I will soon depart for the capital.

269
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:40,960
Uncle Cen Zhong,

270
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,239
you are an official too?

271
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,239
Once you all leave,

272
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,500
it will just be the two of us.

273
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,760
You have only just taken office.

274
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,760
Stay here and be

275
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,760
a good county magistrate.

276
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,400
Keep an eye on him

277
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,840
so he does not lose
his mind and set fires again.

278
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,919
Father, Mother, Brother,

279
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,039
the mist have finally cleared.

280
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,479
This time,

281
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
I am no longer
a fledgling waiting to be saved.

282
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,599
I am a falcon,

283
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,599
a hunting hawk.

284
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,640
Magistrate Lu.

285
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,719
Miss Li.

286
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,200
You are

287
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,919
Official Liang's personal guard?

288
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,239
He asked me to deliver

289
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,880
some fine medicinal salves to you.

290
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,100
Much obliged.

291
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:30,880
He also has

292
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,840
a message for you.

293
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:33,840
What message?

294
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,210
The next time you court death,

295
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,080
ask yourself whether
your skin is thick enough.

296
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,159
Thank Official Liang for me.

297
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,640
