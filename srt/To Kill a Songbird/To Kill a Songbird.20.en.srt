(If you hadn't persisted until now,)

10
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,639

have seen the light of day.)

00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,959
(Both Li Fuyuan and Li Yuan'er)

18
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,639
are now without regrets.

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,760

20
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,119
It's time to think of our own matters.

21
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,180
Let's pick an auspicious day

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
and hold again

23
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,520
a lively wedding banquet.

together

28

we'll renovate this courtyard again

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,160

Thank you for waiting.

You're back.

101
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,359
Master.

102
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,119
Do you understand what it means
to "perish when meeting a stone"?

103
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,760
After leaving the mountain,

104
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:29,359
I indeed encountered
the person you mentioned

105
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,839
that's relevant to "stone".

106
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,559
Every time I see him,

107
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,760
I feel a bit uneasy.

108
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,039
I thought I would die by his hand,

109
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,000
but unexpectedly,

110
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,119
just seeing the stone marrow he wears

111
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,320
reminds me of my brother in prison,

112
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,400
having his fingers broken

113
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,359
and tongue cut off.

114
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,119
That's why the pain is so unbearable.

115
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,880
Thank you for your guidance.

116
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,359
I realize now what you said

117
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,400
was not a prophecy or curse,

118
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,239
but a lesson
on how I should act in the end.

119
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,159
If my actions

120
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,559
involve him,

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,799
he would fail as a county magistrate

122
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,440
seeking justice for the people.

123
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,239
Dying by his hand

124
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,799
is the best outcome.

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,799
"Perish when meeting a stone"
doesn't mean death is fixed.

126
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,760
Heaven and earth are one;
life and death are intertwined.

127
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,919
The stone is a trial,

128
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
a barrier,

129
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,640
a turning of energy.

130
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,679
If you cling to obsession,

131
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,359
death is real.

132
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,400
If you go with the flow,

133
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,400
death may mark a new beginning.

134
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,000
People think
I transformed into a celestial being,

135
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,359
but I just used an illusion to escape.

136
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:46,760
You said before that all of this is just
the beginning of a long journey.

137
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,799
So this is what you meant.

138
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,520
(Now I understand)

139
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,119
(death is the end of the setup.)

140
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,239
(Living)

141
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,159

Come take a look
at folding fans and bead baskets.

145
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,640
Aged wine.

146
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,679
Which lady is that for?

147
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,280
Don't even mention it.

148
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,719
It was returned when I gave it away.

149
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,400
Where are you going?

150
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,119
I got a few seeds.

151
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,880
I'm going back to the courtyard
to plant some melons for my wife.

152
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,039
(Tea)
The book says,

153
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,559
"There's a tale of the thrush
with seven lives, astonishing all."

154
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:45,239
The world will always see bright days.

155
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,840
Keep a loyal heart and let it guide you.

156
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,280
We have all kinds of silks and fabrics.

157
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,679
Miss, come take a look.

158
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,679
New rouge and powders.

159
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,320
These are the latest styles
from the capital.

160
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,250
I'll take a few of each.

161
