(Fake Death Reveals Sincerity)

4
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,400
The water route map
you gave is fake.

5
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:41,720
You used Jiang Chun
to draw off Zhai Lu's men,

6
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,160
so that you could find
Liang Andao yourself.

7
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:47,239
Why didn't you tell me
your plan in advance?

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,360
You seem really angry.

9
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,000
You could send Jiang Chun away
with one word,

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,199
keep me in the dark,

11
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,599
and act on your own.

12
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,480
Li Fuyuan.

13
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:02,480
You seem to have no trust.

14
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,400
No matter what Jiang Chun and I did,

15
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,360
you treat us as strangers,

16
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,679
ready to discard at any time.

17
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,880
I didn't tell anyone about my plan.

18
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,160
Not because I don't trust you,

19
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,639
but because I know

20
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,880
only I can overturn my case.

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,679
It concerns no one else.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,880
No one else?

23
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,039
(I'm a witness.)

24
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,279
(Today, from the Hour of Si
until a quarter-hour ago,)

25
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:31,320
(Divine Lady has stayed by my side,)

26
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,600
(not leaving at all.)

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,559
(All marriage documents are here.)

28
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,880
(Please examine.)

29
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:44,320
(You have my pregnant wife)

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,399
(detained here.)

31
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,240
(Can I not come see her)

32
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,800
(and seek justice?)

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,399
No one else.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,839
Forget it.

35
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,679
Your heart is as cold as ice and iron.

36
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:13,279
It has no trace
of ordinary human feeling.

37
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,759
I shouldn't have helped you.

38
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,080
I need no one's help.

39
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,600
Nor do I need anyone to save me.

40
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,559
You say start, and it starts.

41
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,559
You say end, and it ends.

42
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,639
How domineering.

43
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,160
I will follow you.

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,180
What are you going to do?

45
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,119
I need no one's help either.

46
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,880
Nor do I need anyone to save me.

47
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:56,960
I'm Huachang County's magistrate.

48
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,360
Who dares block my way?

49
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,839
I'll kill you.

50
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,800
Don't let this person

51
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,720
reach Official Liang!

52
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,160
(Why are there two groups?)

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,839
It's that demoness.

54
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,330
Chase her!

55
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,959
No matter which divine lady you are,

56
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,440
today will be your death day.

57
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,480
Don't let her escape!

58
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,480
Don't run! Chase!

59
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:39,959
Let's see what you can do.

60
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,399
Accept your death.

61
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Report this immediately.

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:51,959
Go!

63
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,119
Li Fuyuan!

64
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Dead?

65
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:09,839
Yes.

66
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,799
Another group appeared.

67
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,839
That woman jumped off the cliff herself,

68
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,959
leaving no trace.

69
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,079
Another group?

70
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,279
Come here.

71
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,000
Send a few more inside tonight.

72
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,079
Strengthen patrols.

73
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,239
If anyone comes,
take them down on the spot.

74
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:30,079
Yes.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,959
Magistrate.

76
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:39,100
The county magistrate office's officers
have all been sent to find Miss.

77
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,880
Yexin and Huiyi went too.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,720
So far,

79
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,239
she's still not found.

80
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,119
Noted.

81
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,519
Tonight is long.

82
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:15,679
I've been waiting a long time.

83
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,320
I have personal debts
to settle with you.

84
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,519
Swords have no eyes.

85
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
If you don't want to die, step aside.

86
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,640
Bold assassin.

87
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,510
You broke into the central magistrate's
office at night and spoke boldly.

88
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,720
Take them down.

89
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,239
Then so be it.

90
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
You want to die?

91
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,359
Then none shall live.

92
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,480
Lunatic.

93
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,000
Kill him!

94
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,880
Hurry over.

95
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,000
Have you lost your mind?

96
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,799
Go.

97
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,760
Chase him. Don't let him escape!

98
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,590
Split up and search.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,440
You all go over there.

100
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,079
Alright.

101
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,399
You're insane.

102
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,119
Li Fuyuan is dead,

103
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,880
and you still want to die with her?

104
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,519
I'm clear-headed.

105
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,160
I've never been this clear-headed.

106
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,600
There are so many of Zhai Lu's men.

107
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,880
He's already prepared.

108
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,320
You definitely can't kill him tonight.

109
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,920
I know.

110
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,910
You know, yet you still...

111
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,160
She died for me.

112
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,720
She's always so icy,

113
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,440
never giving her heart to anyone.

114
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,399
Only I can overturn my case.

115
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,320
It concerns no one else.

116
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,959
She's also sharp-tongued.

117
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,920
But if it weren't
to draw those men away for me,

118
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,200
she wouldn't have fallen.

119
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,320
How strange.

120
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,119
If I approach her,

121
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,359
she suffers.

122
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,679
If I avoid her,

123
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:30,920
she still suffers.

124
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,640
No matter what I do,

125
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,599
heaven is never satisfied.

126
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,960
Since that's the case,

127
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,880
whether she dies

128
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,400
or survives...

129
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,880
What do you want to do?

130
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,359
Can I ask you a favor?

131
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,599
What is it?

132
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Lu Yanchong.

133
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,760
I was gone for just half a day.

134
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,239
Why is it empty?

135
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,200
Don't light a lamp.

136
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
You have a fever.

137
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,080
Have you returned to my dream?

138
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:45,880
If I light the lamp, you'll leave, right?

139
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,400
Why did you say those things
to me during the day?

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Master Lu.

141
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:54,280
Honestly, I only wanted
to use you at first.

142
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,760
I want to use your influence.

143
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,799
The path I take

144
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,760
has never been yours to choose.

145
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,479
Only I

146
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,840
can protect myself.

147
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,799
And now,

148
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,880
my identity is exposed.

149
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,400
Whoever is behind this

150
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,520
won't spare me.

151
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,679
I said I don't want to drag you down.

152
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,599
I mean it sincerely.

153
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,479
The more sincere you are,

154
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,239
the more frustrated I become.

155
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,320
Do you know why?

156
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,320
Because I want you
to be selfish with me.

157
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,559
I want you to demand more from me.

158
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,320
I want you

159
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,840
not to see me as just anyone else.

160
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:40,039
I've said many harsh things to you.

161
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,280
I regret them.

162
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
I thought if I stayed far from you,

163
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,000
that prophecy of dying
from meeting a stone

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,559
would never come true.
