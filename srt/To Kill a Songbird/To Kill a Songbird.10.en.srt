00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

=Episode 10=
(to Expose the Guilty)

5
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,120
You know who she really is.

6
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:21,519
It was your husband, Zhao Chengxi,

7
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,839
who led you here to kill her.

8
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:26,199
What if your husband deceived you?

9
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:28,199
My husband would never lie to me.

10
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,839
Back then, I was struck by the epidemic

11
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,120
and confined to my bed.

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,879
He stayed by my side without rest,

13
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,519
caring for me day and night.

14
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,639
How could he ever deceive me?

15
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,959
Li Ji killed the one I loved most.

16
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,080
That is the truth.

17
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,879
He would never lie to me!

18
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:51,519
The Li family deserved their fate.

19
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,919
His brother murdered my husband.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,720
My two children died in the epidemic.

21
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:01,440
How is my Shen family any different
from being wiped out entirely?

22
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,800
You said it to my face

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,399
that you hated her,

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,720
hated her for being a murderer's sister.

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
You said you would abandon her,

26
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,919
leave her to die alone and miserable.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,639
Whether I said those words or not,

28
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,360
you never intended
to let me leave alive.

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,600
Since death was inevitable,

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,080
I chose not to say them.

31
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,399
- You...
- Shang Jin.

32
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,440
Do not let them deceive you
and turn you into a pawn.

33
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,600
Interesting.

34
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:45,800
How easy it would be to say
a few gentle words.

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,119
Why would you not do it?

36
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,880
Why did you refuse so stubbornly?

37
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,119
Because she is nothing like
what you imagine her to be.

38
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,720
Even when she was framed and wronged,

39
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,919
she still risked her life

40
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,199
to seek the truth.

41
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:04,399
Even when she

42
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,960
was adrift like floating weeds,

43
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:10,080
with her family destroyed
and nothing to rely on,

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,759
she was still willing
to take in another's child.

45
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:18,600
She is someone

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,880
people like you,

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,000
who blur right and wrong
for personal revenge,

48
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,440
will never be able to understand.

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,199
He is dead. Now it is your turn.

50
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,960
Who lives and who dies

51
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,919
is not for you to decide.

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,839
Fine. Then we die together.

53
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,119
It has gone quiet.

54
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:04,175
(Misty Peaks and Clouded Ridges)

55
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:06,362
(In Mourning)

56
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,600
You killed Shen Xiu,

57
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,839
framed another man,

58
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,519
then took his wife for yourself.

59
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,200
Now you incited Shang Jin to kill me,

60
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
to bury the past once and for all.

61
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,239
Do you have proof?

62
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
To lure us into your trap,

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,399
you had Shang Jin place this object

64
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:37,399
(Ji)
beside Mo Feibai's cage,

65
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,959
then coated it with a numbing poison.

66
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:44,040
The forged mark
on the severed head back then

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,959
(Ji)
was made using Li Ji's seal.

68
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,150
(Ji)

69
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,799
Enough with these tricks.

70
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,100
Shen Xiu was nothing more than a servant
who raised birds for me.

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,480
And he dared to compete with me
for the woman I loved.

72
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,239
So what if I killed him?

73
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,640
Since you are here,
do not expect to leave alive.

74
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,239
You included.

75
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:13,320
So you finally admit it.

76
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
Dear.

77
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,519
Thirteen years ago,

78
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,839
you were the one who killed him.

79
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,720
Dear.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,290
All these years, I treated you...

81
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,359
You respected me and cared for me.

82
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,480
You granted every request I ever made.

83
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,490
And just because of that,

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,480
you thought I would believe
everything you said

85
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,880
and kill someone for you?

86
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,799
Do you not find that terribly naive?

87
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,440
The invitations were sent long ago.

88
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:43,119
All these years,
I pretended to be mad and foolish,

89
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:46,200
waiting to see
when you would finally slip.

90
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,440
That was the safest way.

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,359
Played along with my act.

92
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,959
In my view,

93
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,519
hesitating at every step
only lets others control you.

94
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,799
A sudden move may be the only way
to break through.

95
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,760
And how do you plan to do that?

96
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,000
Shang Jin,

97
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,160
do not let villains deceive and use you.

98
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,359
Sir, there are ears beyond the wall.

99
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,720
Play along with me.

100
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,720
He is dead. Now it is your turn.

101
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,279
You probably never realized

102
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,880
that the one you loved
has been poisoning you for years.

103
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,160
The toxins have built up in your body.

104
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,799
You do not have long to live.

105
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,200
This incense is called Lovesickness.

106
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,880
It draws the mind into illusion,

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,990
letting one see
the happiest moments of their life,

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,440
lost in longing.

109
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,270
After that,
there is no strength left to act.

110
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,079
Zhao Chengxi, confess your crimes.

111
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:02,839
Jin,

112
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,640
you have forgiven me,

113
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,480
haven't you?

114
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:21,600
You think I forgot?

115
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,359
I was only waiting for you to die.

116
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,640
No!

117
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,040
(The eighth year of Zhenghe,)

118
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,880
(The first day of the sixth month.)

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,559
(Clear skies.)

120
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,799
(A breeze in the air.)

121
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,090
(Grudges and debts laid to rest.)

122
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:35,359
(Flowers broken and fallen.)

123
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:37,612
(Seven days remain
until the seventh of the sixth month)

124
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,600
You cannot die.

125
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:00,320
You must live

126
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,279
and speak the whole truth.

127
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,679
Why?

128
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,359
Why?

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If a murderer
was never judged back then,

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,200
do you think time can make it right?

131
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,399
I trust no one but myself.

132
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,440
Only by killing him with my own hands
can I face death without regret.

133
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,959
Are you dead?

134
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,600
Are you dead?

135
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,919
You...

136
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,440
The day I saw Yexin and Huiyi,

137
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,520
I knew at once

138
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,520
they were my children.

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,760
A mother's instinct
is frightening, isn't it?

140
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,919
Thank you for watching over them for me.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,520
Huiyi.

142
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,080
You have taken such good care of them.

143
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,479
Their eyes are still clear and innocent.

144
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
I do not have much time left.

145
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:03,239
There is one more thing.

146
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,119
That Mo Feibai

147
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,840
is the very bird

148
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,960
Xiu raised back then.

149
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:11,520
After the murder,

150
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,640
it flew back on its own.

151
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,719
I lied to Zhao Chengxi
and said I bought it at the bird market.

152
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,679
Here, take my handkerchief.

153
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,960
As long as you hold it,

154
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,320
it will follow you.

155
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,919
In this world, it is easy to die,
but hard to go on living.

156
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:31,119
I am about to take that shortcut myself.

157
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,159
I hope you will keep walking
a little longer.

158
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,840
Let's get out first. Go.

159
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,475
(Misty Peaks and Clouded Ridges)

160
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,000
(Meeting stone in water.)

161
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:18,039
(This person stands
in a place of power,)

162
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,919
(yet will still drag you down
into the mire.)

163
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,000
(Are you truly not afraid?)

164
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,599
(If the price of vengeance
is only one life,)

165
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:28,440
(then I have already gained
more than enough.)

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,880
(Why would fear still have a place?)

167
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:37,612
(Born as a sparrow,
to perish upon striking stone)

168
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,239
To perish upon striking stone.

169
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:50,080
(Shi Lang is the trial fate
never meant me to escape.)

170
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:51,679
(Yesterday you bound me)

171
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,159
(and made me miss the right moment.)

172
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,159
(I nearly died outside the city.)

173
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,359
(You tied me
and took me out of the city.)

174
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:57,540
(I used you to reach the mountain.)

175
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,719
(That makes us even.)

176
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,880
(After we come down the mountain,)

177
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,720
(it is best that our paths
be kept separate.)

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,690
(From then on,
we owe each other nothing.)

179
00:11:10,612 --> 00:11:15,812
