=To Kill a Songbird=

00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

3
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,212
=Episode 9=
(Feasting Together, Yet Hearts Hide Dark Designs)

4
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,120
Just past midnight last night,

5
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,279
they were all strangled to death.

6
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,440
Each killed by the other's hands.

7
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,720
It defies common sense.

8
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,760
The human world is vast.

9
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:32,839
There is much you have yet
to see or understand.

10
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:34,599
Know when to stop,

11
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,080
and you may live longer for it.

12
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,400
Clean this up.

13
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,360
Then send the bodies
to the charity morgue.

14
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,990
If you said the brothers turned on
each other, I could believe that.

15
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,120
But if there was truly a confrontation,

16
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,839
how could there have been
no noise at all?

17
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,399
To kill without alerting the guards,

18
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,119
the murderer must be highly skilled.

19
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,260
And with the fire
at the Document Building,

20
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:15,880
someone is trying to stop us
from digging further.

21
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:22,919
Sir.

22
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,279
Someone delivered this.

23
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,800
An invitation?

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,225
(Invitation)

25
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,399
The twenty-second, at mid morning.

26
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:32,880
Flowers in full bloom,
birds vying in song.

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,600
Inviting neighbors to share a seat,

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,390
calling across the fence
to finish the wine.

29
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,039
Luofu Manor beyond the city walls.

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,639
(Zhao Chengxi)
My home is swept clean, awaiting your presence.

31
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,080
Zhao Chengxi.

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,320
The man who once paid for fake heads,

33
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,720
Zhao Chengxi, the influential magnate.

34
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,759
He is the one you are after.

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,919
(So you are finally
stepping into the light.)

36
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,839
Sir.

37
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,559
All the invitations have been sent?

38
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,119
Yes.

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,000
Every last one.

40
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,260
Everyone knows my wife suffers
from sudden bouts of madness.

41
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,600
Using her as the blade

42
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:09,759
to remove them

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,559
leaves no trace behind.

44
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,199
To cross us like this

45
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,360
means they are far too bold
for their own good.

46
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:20,312
(Luofu Manor)

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,600
(Luofu Manor)
I arrive with my household

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,199
to accept Mr. Zhao's invitation.

49
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,600
Master Lu, please come inside.

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,800
(Luofu Manor)

51
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,759
Here they come.

52
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,119
(Fated Apart, Zhao Chengxi)
Master Lu, thank you for sparing the time to attend.

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,740
Your presence
truly honors my humble home.

54
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,479
(Purplish spots inside the lips.)

55
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,800
(He appears to be suffering
from severe poisoning.)

56
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,039
Mr. Zhao.

57
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,519
This is Sir Zhai
from the prefectural office.

58
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,000
We have met before.

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,440
Inspecting Envoy.

60
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,239
The former magistrate
of Huachang County.

61
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,239
(Yu Prefecture Inspecting Envoy)
Mr. Zhao, you certainly have influence.

62
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:25,812
(Former Huachang County Magistrate Zhai Lu)

63
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,160
I know him.

64
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:35,119
Zhai Lu.

65
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,320
The Thrush Case
was handled under his watch,

66
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
and hastily closed.

67
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,480
An incompetent official.

68
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,279
So or later,
I will settle accounts with him.

69
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,320
Isn't this Master Lu
who once wrote verses

70
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,720
at Tunhai House
to mock the Grand Chancellor?

71
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,959
Allow me a word of advice.

72
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:52,720
This is not the capital.

73
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,320
Those unruly habits of yours, Master Lu,

74
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,320
best not surface here.

75
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,160
If you fall into my hands,

76
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,720
the ending may not be a pleasant one.

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,959
Could the information I bought be wrong?

78
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,239
What exactly did you write
at Tunhai House?

79
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,920
I'll tell you later.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,320
This must be your wife.

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,760
Indeed.

82
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,359
Truly elegant and refined.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,880
My wife is entertaining
the families inside.

84
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,720
Shall I have a maid escort you there?

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,600
Very well.

86
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,440
This way, young lady.

87
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,239
Proceed with care.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,640
Master Lu.

89
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,600
Please.

90
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,880
Young lady,
please wait here for a moment.

91
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,799
(Mo Feibai?)

92
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:00,399
(If it truly is that Mo Feibai
from back then,)

93
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,799
(he should be thirteen
or fourteen by now.)

94
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,679
(How could he possibly be here?)

95
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:19,962
(Misty Peaks and Clouded Ridges)

96
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,959
You finally showed up.
You deserve to die most of all.

97
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:38,040
Mrs. Zhao.

98
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,559
Young lady.

99
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:41,760
Madam.

100
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,320
Young lady.

101
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:42,760
Madam.

102
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:45,000
(Zhao Chengxi's wife, Mrs. Zhao)
Let go of my lady, you madwoman.

103
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,399
(Zhao Chengxi's wife, Mrs. Zhao)
Let go. Let go.

104
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,079
Let go.

105
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,079
Please calm down, Madam.

106
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:48,839
Let go!

107
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,320
Mrs. Zhao.

108
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,799
Is this how Luofu Manor
treats its guests?

109
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,799
Get out of here.

110
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,440
Get out!

111
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,839
Dear.

112
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,160
I was told there was some friction

113
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,679
between you and Ms. Li.

114
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:17,640
Friction?

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,640
Your maids saw it clearly.

116
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,320
Your wife was plainly trying
to kill someone.

117
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,820
A misunderstanding.
All of it is a misunderstanding.

118
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,720
My wife has been gravely ill of late,
her mind not entirely clear.

119
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,920
She offended our honored guest.

120
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,140
I will first escort my wife
back to her room to rest.

121
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,900
At the banquet tonight,
we will make amends.

122
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,679
How is it?

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,540
Does it hurt?

124
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,119
I just saw Mo Feibai.

125
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,760
(Misty Peaks and Clouded Ridges)
Things have grown complicated.

126
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:55,430
Zhao Chengxi is connected to people
under Master Jiang's protection.

127
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,720
When the Thrush Case occurred,

128
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,399
he was in the north trading ginseng.

129
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,960
No one expected he was the one

130
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,990
who bribed the Huang brothers
to supply fake heads.

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,160
Mo Feibai was supposed to be

132
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,850
the key evidence
found beside the victims.

133
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,720
(Misty Peaks and Clouded Ridges)
Now that it has surfaced in the Zhao residence,

134
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,839
it directly ties Zhao Chengxi
to the murders.

135
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,839
As for Zhao Chengxi's wife,
no one knows what has possessed her.

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,990
She keeps targeting you.

137
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,760
The maids in the manor say

138
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,440
their mistress has episodes of madness.

139
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,910
And then there is Zhai Lu,
who showed up here for no clear reason,

140
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,500
doing nothing but making trouble for me.

141
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:24,720
In my view,

142
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,480
hesitating only lets others
hold us back.

143
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,399
A sudden move may be the way through.

144
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,800
And how do you plan to break it?

145
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,159
Steal the thrush.

146
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,400
When?

147
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,719
After nightfall,

148
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:40,760
before the banquet begins.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,100
The banquet starts at 7:30.

150
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,559
We have roughly half an hour.

151
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,880
Yexin and Huiyi
learned my ventriloquism.

152
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,190
They will stay in the room

153
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,890
to keep outsiders
from getting suspicious.

154
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,919
Yuan.

155
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:05,599
Are you still feeling unwell?

156
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,719
As long as you stay here with me,

157
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,320
I feel perfectly fine.

158
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:11,640
Did today frighten you?

159
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,560
Have some more tea to calm yourself.

160
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,310
There's movement over there.
Let's go take a look.

161
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,660
Alright.

162
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,640
(Ji)
(Li Ji's seal.)

163
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,080
(It is actually here.)

164
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,080
You are finally awake.

165
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,919
Today, I will kill you,

166
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,239
and use your blood as an offering

167
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,159
to the wronged souls crying out below.

168
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,760
One walks first down the road
to the underworld,

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,799
the living are left
to drink grief alone.

170
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,320
If you die,

171
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:26,840
how heartbroken

172
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,960
will Magistrate Lu be?

173
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,960
I am not my brother's shadow,

174
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,239
nor am I Master Lu's weakness.

175
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,119
I do this for no one.

176
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,980
First and foremost, I do it for myself,

177
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,520
for the blood-soaked path
I have walked these thirteen years,

178
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,919
for the suffering
I have endured these thirteen years.

179
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,960
Are you any different,

180
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,599
Mrs. Shen?

181
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,890
I once found a book called
Spring Food Records in the small tower.

182
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:53,562
(Spring Food Records)

183
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,039
In the corner was the character Jin,

184
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,280
as if it were a signature.

185
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,039
Back then,
the Thrush Case shocked everyone.

186
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,239
The victim was Shen Xiu.

187
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,919
His wife was from the Shang family.

188
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,440
(Jin)
Her given name

189
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,039
was also Jin.

190
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,440
What a coincidence.

191
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,200
Isn't it?

192
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,119
This is indeed that same thrush.

193
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,200
It's only a lookalike bought
from the bird market.

194
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,400
Now,

195
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:21,559
since someone

196
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,719
has taken an interest in this thrush,

197
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,640
it must be tied to the old case.

198
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,679
Can your wife really go through with it?

199
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,559
If anything goes wrong,

200
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,719
you know the consequences.

201
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:35,080
Yes.

202
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,760
Li Ji's sister
will not last much longer.

203
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,679
Next, it will be your turn.

204
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,080
You know her true identity.

205
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,760
It was your husband, Zhao Chengxi,

206
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,119
who led you here to kill her.

207
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,400
What if your husband has deceived you?

208
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,760
Shang Jin.

209
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,520
Do not let villains
mislead you and use you.
