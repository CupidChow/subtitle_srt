Bird Kills Seven People)

(Miao Clinic)

5
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:20,839
That night's hut

6
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,599
should be right here.

7
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,400
Able to fight and run.

8
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:33,199
Such a darling

9
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,559
is now a county magistrate.

10
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,639
He's indeed stubborn

11
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,879
and not very sharp.

12
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,037
(Huang Family Shop)

13
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
You're always hunting,

14
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,960
and now your prey pecked your eye.

15
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,160
You've been poisoned by that young lady.

16
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,960
Interesting.

17
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,160
This medicine is for taming animals.

18
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:50,240
It's not lethal.

19
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,399
Did you find anything?

20
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,930
She probably changed her name,
so it took some effort.

21
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,559
But we figured it out.

22
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
She's the culprit in the Thrush Case.

23
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,479
Li Ji's younger sister,

24
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,839
Li Yuan'er?

25
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,279
Can you run fast?

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,399
Why is it so clean here?

27
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,850
Take it to the magistrate's office
tomorrow for the reward.

28
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,520
And the reward money from that gentleman

29
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,800
should be able to let us
live comfortably for a few years.

30
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,350
There should still be some left.

31
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,960
Don't chase.

32
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,890
Stop investigating.

33
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,690
Leave this place.

34
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,320
(Meeting stone in water.)

35
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,320
(A small bird meets a stone and dies.)
(This person holds a high position)

36
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,359
(and will inevitably involve you.)

37
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:18,880
(You're saying)

38
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,880
(if I insist on seeking the truth,)

39
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,679
(I will die at the hands)

40
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,119
(of someone connected to Shi.)

41
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,519
Quick, put out the fire!

42
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,239
The case files are inside. Hurry.

43
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,640
(Document Building)

44
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,090
Over there.

45
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,279
- Bring water.
- Hurry!

46
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,359
- Quick.
- More water!

47
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,399
(Zhenghe 8th year,
27th day of the 5th month)

48
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:45,519
(Rain stopped, wind ceased.)

49
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,519
(Waves stretch for miles.)

50
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,040
(Hidden behind clouds.)

51
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:53,112
(11 Days
Until the 7 Day of the 6th Month)

52
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,320
Once I settle accounts with your master,

53
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,600
I'll come back for you.

54
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,079
(I was unconscious yesterday)

55
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,320
(and didn't apply acupuncture.)

56
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,679
(Has it come to this?)

57
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,320
(What a killer.)

58
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,679
(Tea)
Let me see this.

59
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,640
Good eye.

60
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,399
A bowl of tea, please.

61
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,399
Here.

62
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,320
Wet your throat first.

63
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,959
Miss, what's

64
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,119
the rush?

65
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,679
Thank you.

66
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,679
I have an important matter to handle,

67
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,839
but there are obstacles.

68
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,210
Friends and foes are unclear.

69
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,959
I'm close to failing.

70
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,760
There's nothing in this world
that can't be done.

71
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,200
Only...

72
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,559
Only what?

73
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,920
Only things that can't be finished.

74
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,279
Thank you.

75
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,359
How about this one?

76
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,440
Take a look.

77
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,990
Here, I'll put it on you.

78
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,160
- Is it pretty?
- Yes.

79
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,079
This one's nice too.

80
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,279
Take another look at this one.

81
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,480
(You're obsessed with blood revenge,)

82
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:33,960
(so you can't grow up
like an ordinary girl.)

83
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,239
(Is it worth it?)

84
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,200
Why don't we
take these two home for Mother?

85
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,119
Alright.

86
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,320
We'll take these two.

87
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,239
Sure.

88
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,719
Master Jiang.

89
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,520
You didn't leave.

90
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,280
Lu said
you already left Huachang County.

91
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,880
What you said yesterday is right.

92
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,440
Lu Yanchong and I

93
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,880
aren't the same kind of people.

94
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,280
I'm an orphan.

95
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,140
I received a great favor from Li Ji,
the mastermind behind the Thrash Case.

96
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,520
That's why I want to uncover the truth.

97
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,960
Between the two of you,

98
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,479
I trust you more.

99
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:13,640
By the way,

100
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,799
what exactly happened last night?

101
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,239
When I chased halfway,

102
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,590
that person suddenly threw
the gold ingot back to me

103
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,039
and disappeared.

104
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:25,799
It has been recast.

105
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,919
We can't tell much.

106
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,960
For now,

107
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,280
we can only check

108
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,200
the household registry
of that shop back then.

109
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,919
Who was the lease registered under?

110
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,200
What is it, Master Jiang?

111
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,719
Document Building caught fire yesterday.

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,990
All the household records
were completely destroyed.

113
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:43,090
The original case files
of the Thrush Case

114
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,280
were also lost in the flames.

115
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,919
I'm afraid all the leads are gone.

116
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,039
Where did Lu Yanchong go?

117
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
He only appeared once at dawn,

118
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,760
said a few words to me,

119
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:53,960
and then left.

120
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,799
No.

121
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:11,612
(Mount Changyun)

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,990
Why do you say the lead isn't lost
if we follow him?

123
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,479
At first, Lu Yanchong

124
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,400
didn't refuse to act with us.

125
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,080
But once we checked the shop,

126
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,280
he immediately turned hostile.

127
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,239
He didn't even enter the house with us

128
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:47,400
and see the box of gold,

129
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,990
but he immediately sent someone
to steal the ingots and distract you.

130
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,119
What does that mean?

131
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,880
He had seen Huachang County's
household registry records,

132
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,559
knew who owned the Huang Family Shop,

133
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,440
and guessed the identity
of the person hiding the gold ingots.

134
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,119
(Mount Changyun)
So the lead is at Mount Changyun.

135
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,090
There are two leaders
of the Mount Changyun bandits.

136
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,760
I heard they're brothers.

137
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:09,400
The two people we spoke with
at Huang Family Shop

138
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,239
must be connected
to the Mount Changyun bandits.

139
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:14,919
Everyone.

140
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,590
The medicine has arrived.

141
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,479
Looks like he's disguised
as a pharmacy staff.

142
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,440
Could someone on this mountain be sick?

143
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,559
The chance
to enter the mountain is fleeting.

144
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,840
Meet me outside.

145
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,119
I'll head over first.

146
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,000
I want to enter the mountain stronghold.

147
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,640
Daqiang.

148
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,200
It's not safe on Mount Changyun lately.

149
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,919
How dare you go alone?

150
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Who's this?

151
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,080
My wife.

152
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,479
Mr. Feng sent me to deliver medicine.

153
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,830
Why aren't you filling prescriptions
behind the counter?

154
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,990
Why come here in broad daylight?

155
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:56,599
I...

156
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:58,479
Also from the pharmacy?

157
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,119
Our second-in-command

158
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,479
happens to need treatment.

159
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:04,840
Here.

160
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
