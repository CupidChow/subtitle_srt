8
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,919
We used to sit right here.

9
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:13,240
The teacher's desk was always a mess,

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,240
but three things never changed.

11
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:16,559
Bird feed.

00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,679

(Autumn Moon)

15
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,520
Come here.

16
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,000
Now that you mention it,
this chalcedony pendant

17
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,800
was a gift from the teacher.

18
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
You recited well.

19
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,800
I have a reward for you.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,039
Why give me a stone roller?

21
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,279
I liked the color of the stone.

22
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,360
And your name has "stone" in it.

23
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,679
So I rounded it for you.

24
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,800
And the other one?

25
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:01,440
This is

26
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,880
for my little sister.

27
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,720
What is it?

28
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,399
That pendant was from my brother?

29
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,759
Was something wrong with it?

30
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,360
So that was
what he was trying to tell me.

31
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,160
My brother's tongue was cut out,

32
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,880
and all ten fingers were broken.

33
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,440
He could neither speak nor write.

34
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,399
Yet he kept clutching that stone.

35
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,320
He was trying to tell me

36
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,880
that you were the key to everything.

37
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:45,919
Me?

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,240
But if you truly are the key,

39
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,759
then something still does not add up.

40
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,790
You have pursued this case for years,

41
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,240
and read countless records and files.

42
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,800
How could you have noticed nothing?

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,919
Unless that clue was hidden very well.

44
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,000
Back then in the study,

45
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,199
there were 17 or 18 children.

46
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:09,600
Why was it me, of all people?

47
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,440
That is what we need to consider.

48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,960
What was different

49
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,320
between you and the others?

50
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,399
Anything I have seen or read,

51
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
I rarely forget.

52
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,440
In those days,

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,440
or rather, those months,

54
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,600
what exactly did you do?

55
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,839
Or perhaps,

56
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,480
was there any chance

57
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,359
you saw something out of the ordinary?

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,000
The lessons were engaging,

59
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,279
never dull.

60
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
But it seems unlikely

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,559
that he would speak
to children in class

62
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,160
about a murder case.

63
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,359
Aside from lessons,

64
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,239
what else did you do?

65
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,359
I slept.

66
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,239
Why not go out and play?

67
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,320
It was boring.

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,640
Indeed.

69
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,359
I can find something
more interesting for you.

70
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,239
If you are not going out,

71
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:13,480
copy texts instead.

72
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,040
Copied texts?

73
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,359
What did you copy?

74
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,679
Some of the teacher's own poems,

75
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,359
(Marginal Notes to the Book of Songs)
and essays discussing the miscellaneous.

76
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,359
Not those.

77
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,480
What else was there?

78
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:26,912
(Marginal Notes to the Book of Songs)

79
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,119
There was one document

80
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,640
I never finished copying,

81
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,480
but I did read it.

82
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,559
What was it?

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,799
You need not copy that.

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,200
It was not an essay.

85
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,160
It was

86
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,440
a letter of remonstrance.

87
00:05:56,337 --> 00:06:00,359
(Letter of Remonstrance to Liang Andao,
submitted by the commoner Li Ji.)

88
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,550
So this letter of remonstrance

89
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,320
was written to him.

90
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,600
Then thirteen years ago,

91
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,480
the reason he was
falsely accused and died

92
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,880
was this very thing.

93
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,950
(Pure And Righteous Mind)

94
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,559
(He wrote advice
for all under heaven,)

95
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,679
(yet you buried them in silence.)

96
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,000
(All my life of hardship and wandering)

97
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,000
(was not fate.)

98
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,160
(It was you.)

99
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,399
(It was your greed)

100
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,200
(that wrote my life in blood.)

101
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,679
(From this moment on,)

102
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,480
(I will rewrite it myself.)

103
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,359
Someone's here.

104
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,200
My Lord.

105
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,320
I have

106
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,200
returned from Li Fuyuan.

107
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,839
That Li Fuyuan

108
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,880
has likely noticed you.

109
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,799
You are a clever man.

110
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,399
Handle it yourself.

111
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:30,839
Official Liang.

112
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,920
Are your injuries improving?

113
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,440
They were only minor wounds.

114
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,079
Today, Fuyuan and I

115
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,559
have come to thank you.

116
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,160
So, when can I attend

117
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
your wedding banquet?

118
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,519
That is precisely

119
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,119
why Fuyuan and I are here today.

120
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,279
Shi's parents and remaining kin

121
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,450
are far away in Qinghe County.

122
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,519
I no longer have elders in my family.

123
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,000
So I take the liberty

124
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,519
of asking you to serve as our officiant.

125
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,160
Why should I refuse?

126
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,640
Say, once we reach Bianjing,

127
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
what should we do then?

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I have no idea.

129
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,360
We will see when we get there.

130
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,079
Hyah!

131
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,000
Hyah!

132
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,760
That would be wonderful.

133
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,940
Three days from now,
the seventh of the sixth month,

134
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,519
is my brother's death anniversary.

135
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,370
We shall wash away the sorrow with joy,

136
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,039
and leave the past behind
to begin anew.

137
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,400
My Lord,

138
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,719
what do you think?

139
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,119
Miss Li, this is brilliant.

140
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,280
I think

141
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,159
it is a good idea.

142
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,159
That is Magistrate Jiang's horse.

(All remains uncertain.)

155
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:11,200
When will those gone ever return?

156
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,159
Those people have vanished.

157
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,640
Have Lu Yanchong and that woman

158
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,479
shown any reaction?

159
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,599
None, so far.

160
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,479
Word from the magistrate's office

161
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,239
is that Cui San has taken leave,

162
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,280
and County Magistrate Jiang is
away on duty.

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,760
Rest assured,

164
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,479
we have kept watch daily.

165
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,679
They appear unaware of those men.

166
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,159
They seem fully occupied
with wedding preparations.

167
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,719
(If you were to stop here,)

168
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,280
(and stop digging any deeper,)

169
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,479
(the teacher's name could be cleared.)

170
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,679
(Would that be enough?)

171
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,080
(But if I were to let it go,)

172
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,159
(would you truly stop as well?)

173
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,559
Why do you smell of morning dew?

174
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,290
I did not sleep well last night.

175
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,440
I went out for a walk.

176
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,960
I meant to tell you not to be afraid,

177
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,679
but it seems you have no fear at all.

178
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,440
What I do now

179
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,679
is not for power,

180
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,159
nor for fame,

181
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,599
nor for gain.

182
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,400
It is so that those who die wronged

183
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,719
need not suffer as my brother did.

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,320
And so that those who were wronged,

185
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,840
need not live as I have.
