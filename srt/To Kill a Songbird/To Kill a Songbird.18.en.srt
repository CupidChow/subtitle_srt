00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,239
- How lively it is.
- So wonderful.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,919
Such a joyous occasion.

9
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,160
Please assist the bride from the sedan.

10
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,319
Bride, mind your step.

11
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,279
She is gorgeous.

12
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,559
A match made in heaven.

13
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,959
Proceed.

14
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,160
May you enter the Crimson Hall together,
pure, auspicious, and safe.

15
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,759
May your years be long
and your days auspicious.

16
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,839
Mount the saddle.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,479
One horse, one saddle.

18
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:44,080
May the couple pass
evenly and in harmony.

19
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,639
Bind the ceremonial cloth.

20
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,960
May wealth and honor
endure for a hundred years.

21
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,720
Take your seats
beneath the canopy.

22
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,559
May husband and wife
remain united in harmony.

23
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,440
Come, come, drink.

24
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:49,360
Cheers.

25
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,839
Wonderful!

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,199
A toast. Another toast.

27
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:32,187
(A Match Made in Heaven)

28
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,720
This is my wedding gift
to the two of you.

29
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,559
Congratulations.

30
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,720
Official Liang,

31
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,799
the wine of union?

32
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,399
Why now?

33
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,040
Cultivation may refine the body,

34
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,799
yet if practiced improperly,

35
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,760
it can harm the flesh,

36
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,399
and trouble the mind.

37
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,200
Miss Li may well have
suffered such an imbalance.

38
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,559
Thus, on her wedding night,
she lost her senses,

39
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,559
killed her newlywed husband,

40
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,480
and then took her own life.

41
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,600
Such a thing

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
is not beyond reason.

43
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,000
Official Liang.

44
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,480
What you said just now was quite right.

45
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,760
When it comes to cultivation
and arcane arts,

46
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,880
you are indeed no match for me

47
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,399
in terms of immobilizing a target.

48
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,519
You came prepared.

49
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,720
Li Fuyuan.

50
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:45,880
No. Li Yuan'er.

51
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:47,320
What are you planning to do?

52
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,519
Everyone present today

53
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,160
is to stay where they are.

54
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,760
No one leaves.

55
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,959
You will all remain to hear this case.

56
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:04,399
Everyone,

57
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,320
I ask you all to bear witness

58
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,519
to what I am about to do next.

59
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,519
I can finish it

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,200
all by myself.

61
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,119
That you would die with me

62
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,480
is your devotion.

63
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,119
But if I let you die,

64
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,839
then I would no longer be Li Fuyuan,

65
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,119
only my brother's shadow,

66
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,959
a puppet of this broken world.

67
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,480
- On the wedding night?
- Lady Lu...

68
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:47,119
You wanted me to be silent.

69
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,480
You wanted me dead.

70
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
So be it.

71
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,480
You branded me

72
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,399
a demoness, a bandit, a traitor.

73
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:54,600
So be it.

74
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,359
I know my own innocence.

75
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,320
I owe none of you absolution.

76
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,320
Lady Lu.

77
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:00,600
Miss Li.

78
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,399
A commoner accusing
an official is already a grave crime.

79
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,720
To set up a court like this

80
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,920
is punishable by death.

81
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,000
That no longer matters.

82
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:13,720
Over these past days,

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,359
you have surely already heard

84
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,720
the truth of the Thrush Case.

85
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,320
Here and now,

86
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:20,000
we will lay the entire matter out

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,480
without concealment.

88
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:23,760
Thirteen years ago,

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,359
the merchant Zhao Chengxi

90
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:28,119
coveted the wife of the bird keeper
Shen Xiu, Shang Jin.

91
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,799
He devised a plan of extreme cruelty,

92
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,679
lured Shen Xiu
to the outskirts and murdered him.

93
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,160
Fearing the truth would surface,

94
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,839
he bribed the county magistrate
of the time, Zhai Lu,

95
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,079
and forced through a false conviction.

96
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,519
He framed my brother Li Ji as the killer.

97
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,359
That is the truth you have all heard.

98
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,359
But what I have just said

99
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,760
is still not the whole truth.

100
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,959
My brother, Li Ji

101
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,920
did not die because of Shen Xiu.

102
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,239
On the contrary,

103
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,119
the bird keeper Shen Xiu

104
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,079
died because of my brother Li Ji.

105
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,920
- How could that be?
- Impossible!

106
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes, how could that possibly be?

107
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,359
Miss Li,

108
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,959
have you taken some sort of elixir?

109
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,239
You seem rather unsteady of mind.

110
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,000
First, you confined us here,

111
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:18,440
and now you speak utter nonsense.

112
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,959
Your brother was nothing more
than an ordinary licentiate,

113
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,279
never an official.

114
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,559
If you say he was
simply unlucky and framed,

115
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,959
that at least makes sense.

116
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,519
But to claim

117
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,359
that someone murdered another man

118
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,440
solely to bring him down,

119
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:33,960
this…

120
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,919
This is beyond belief.

121
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,840
Unless the one framing him
held great power,

122
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,880
and dared to do anything.

123
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,840
The weather that year was damp,
with little sun.

124
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,500
Bookworms infested
the archive buildings,

125
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,440
and many records
and case files were damaged.

126
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,280
(Because my brother Li Ji had
exceptionally fine handwriting,)

127
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,679
(he was hired as a temporary
clerk for several months.)

128
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,559
(It was during those months)

129
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,039
(that he began to notice)

130
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,520
(things others overlooked.)

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,400
He was a mere scholar.

132
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,200
What could he possibly see?

133
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,080
From the second year of Yuanfu
to the second year of Chongning,

134
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,719
(Huachang County recorded
sixty-seven major criminal cases.)

135
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,320
(Not one was left unresolved.)

136
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,359
(Of these, forty-two cases)

137
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,960
(were closed within three days.)

138
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:22,960
(For that reason,)

139
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,880
(the magistrate
in office at the time, Official Liang,)

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,400
earned the title "Justice Liang".

141
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,320
(Yet among those forty-two cases,)

142
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,479
(every single one
contained inconsistencies.)

143
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,960
(Some lacked sufficient evidence,
others showed subtle contradictions.)

144
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,359
(My brother did not dare suspect)

145
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,679
(that Justice Liang's reputation)

146
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,799
He had his doubts.

147
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Miss Li, are you suggesting
that all those cases

148
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,840
were fabricated by Official Liang?

149
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,310
That is exactly what I am saying.

150
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,200
Impossible. That cannot be right.

151
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,760
After discovering this,

152
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,640
my brother did not try to expose him.

153
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,599
(Instead,
he wrote a letter of remonstrance,)

154
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,200
(hoping to warn his superior.)

155
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,559
(And it was precisely that letter)

156
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,760
that cost him his life.

157
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,599
Liang Andao

158
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,559
went to Zhao Chengxi.

159
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,919
That was how Shen Xiu was killed,

160
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,200
and how the Thrush Case began.

161
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,559
Empty words.

162
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:17,280
This all happened
more than ten years ago.

163
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,799
For the moment,

164
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,599
I cannot produce hard evidence.

165
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,280
But My Lord,

166
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:25,880
I know that by law and procedure,

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,760
a mayfly like me cannot
shake a towering tree.

168
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,559
But keep in mind that

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,440
public opinion is a fearsome thing.

170
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,799
There are guests, gentry, wealthy
figures, merchants, and soldiers alike.

171
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,290
All walks of life are present.

172
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,440
I have copied my brother's letter
of remonstrance countless times.

173
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,159
There are mouths

174
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,599
and eyes here.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,719
With my crime today
of holding a people's court,

176
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,840
Official Liang,

177
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,200
do you truly believe

178
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:56,840
you can walk away unscathed?

179
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,960
So,

180
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,119
that is how you intend to do this.

181
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,320
Very well.

182
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,559
Very well indeed.

183
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,799
The young are truly formidable.

184
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,919
But...

185
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,880
A weight has been lifted off my chest.

186
00:11:46,362 --> 00:11:50,399
♪A thrush's song
pierced the endless night♪

187
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:57,587
