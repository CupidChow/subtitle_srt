=To Kill a Songbird=

00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

3
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,300
=Episode 8=
(No Honor Among Bandits)

4
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:19,120
If you came to investigate this case,

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,080
you're looking for the wrong man.

6
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,639
The one who paid for a fake head

7
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:26,800
was Zhao Chengxi.

8
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,680
Zhao Chengxi.

9
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,800
He's who you should be after.

10
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,319
Too bad

11
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:32,400
you won't live to see another day.

12
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,680
Die!

13
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,559
(In the third month)

14
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:28,600
(of the fifth year of Chongning,)

15
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,110
(Huang Baocheng starved
his father Huang Agen to death,)

16
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,679
(severed his head,)

17
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,399
(branded it with a false mark,
and buried it at Qili Slope.)

18
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,440
(He acted under orders)

19
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,479
(from a man named Zhao Chengxi,)

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,240
(who paid him in silver)

21
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,759
(to do it.)

22
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,960
He won't wake up
for another six to ten hours.

23
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,119
Keep the confession with you.

24
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,800
Why did you rush out?

25
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,039
You saw me signal you to stop.

26
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,660
Were you trying to get yourself killed?

27
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,600
I saw it.

28
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,440
But I don't take orders from you.

29
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,119
Indeed.

30
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,570
You're the last person
who needs to listen to me.

31
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,440
You prefer
County Magistrate Jiang over me.

32
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,679
You only listen to him.

33
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:24,990
Well, now look at us.

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,790
We're stuck at the foot of the mountain.

35
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,410
We'll have to wait for the rain to stop
before we can go back up.

36
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,320
(You and her)

37
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,960
(were poisoned.)

38
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,199
(You risked your life
to feed her the antidote,)

39
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,440
(yet she didn't appreciate it at all.)

40
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,559
Why did you give me the antidote?

41
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:57,759
You deliberately used yourself as bait

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,730
to lure Huang Baocheng out and trick him
into confessing, didn't you?

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,559
This is my case.

44
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,240
You didn't have to go that far.

45
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,440
You have a blessed life.

46
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,199
You're the disciple of the chancellor.

47
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,440
You have a brilliant future ahead.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,839
Yet you risked your life for this case.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,320
Don't tell me

50
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,640
you've taken a liking to me.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,990
I favor well-bred ladies

52
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:28,359
from respectable families,

53
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:31,480
as well as gentle, soft-spoken women.

54
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,720
However, I've no interest
in temperamental lunatics.

55
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,119
Investigating cases
and eradicating criminals

56
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,600
are my duties.

57
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,359
Don't overthink it

58
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,320
and make trouble for yourself.

59
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,279
And one more thing…

60
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,160
What are you doing?

61
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,959
I'm testing whether you meant

62
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,399
what you just said.

63
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,200
And what's the verdict?

64
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,440
Your breathing's steady.
Your heartbeat's normal.

65
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,600
You were telling the truth.

66
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:34,839
Good.

67
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,519
Where'd you learn such a lowly trick?

68
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,279
Don't go trying it on anyone else.

69
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:46,799
You might just…

70
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,440
I'm fine.

71
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,559
Tomorrow, I'll…

72
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,040

Within a quarter of an hour,
it'll stir certain thoughts and desires,

76
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,799

Stay still.

95
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,200
Don't touch me.

96
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:39,640
The Blended Harmony incense is meant
to make you feverish, sweat,

Why isn't it working?

99
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,440
I need you
to follow your heart right now.

100
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,079
Is there anything you want to do?

101
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,160
All

102
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,839
you want to do is comb my hair?

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,190
It looks like a pile of straw.

104
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,760
Hurts my eyes just looking at it.

105
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,120
Anyone can tell
you don't bother taking care of it.

106
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,640
You're nothing like the other ladies.

107
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,200
You should've been like them.

108
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,440
We found them!

109
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,280
They're here!

110
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,080
Get the carriage up here!

111
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,640
Master Lu's badly injured!

112
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:05,237
(Gathering Auspiciousness With the Sun)

113
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,359
Once there were two brothers,

114
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,960
both greedy for money and power.

115
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,400
The elder brother,
for the sake of wealth,

116
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,719
could even starve
his own father to death.

117
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,200
What he didn't know was that

118
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,440
his younger brother,

119
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,880
who appeared indecisive and harmless,

120
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,119
had an even more vicious heart.

121
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,679
Their father hadn't died of starvation.

122
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,880
He was poisoned by the younger brother.

123
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,320
That's why his face turned

124
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:37,080
that terrifying shade of purple
when he died.

125
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,400
Years later,

126
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,760
someone in the stronghold
was poisoned the same way.

127
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,799
When the elder brother saw it,
he came up with a plan

128
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,679
and chopped off those men's heads.

129
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,280
The younger brother saw this
and came up with a plan of his own.

130
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,679
He played the madman

131
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,960
and set up
the Zhong Kui tale of devouring men,

132
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,679
all so he could later

133
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,960
frame his brother for the killings.

134
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,880
Once that happened,
the entire stronghold

135
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,479
would fall
into the younger brother's hands.

136
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:12,239
Then, the authorities arrived.

137
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,520
He planned everything with great care.

138
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,799
Meticulously,

139
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:19,479
he pinned the crimes

140
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,239
and fake evidence on his brother.

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,559
He had gone mad, after all.

142
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,039
At worst, he'd be an accomplice.

143
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,880
Isn't that right, Huang Baotian?

144
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,719
Huang Baotian.

145
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,559
You set me up!

146
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,080
(It was the eighth year of Zhenghe.)

147
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,390
(The 29th day of the 5th month.)

148
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,159
(It was drizzling.)

149
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,479
(No sun in sight,)

150
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,559
(yet life bloomed silently.)

151
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,162
(Nine days until
the seventh day of the sixth month)

152
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,559
(To die by your greed)

153
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,599
(is the ending you deserved.)

154
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,880
I knew you'd go looking
for those brothers.

155
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,000
Watching them go through questioning

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,280
so numb and painless

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
didn't sit right with me.

158
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,039
I only told a few truths.

159
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,400
I didn't kill anyone.

160
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,440
That's hardly a crime.

161
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,039
If I ever killed someone,

162
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:15,840
would you take me in?

163
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,000
Where are you going?

164
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,320
To find Master Jiang

165
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,760
and ask him
to help me look into Zhao Chengxi.

166
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,020
Sir, a hatred that cuts to the bone

167
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,430
is something you've probably
never experienced in your life.

168
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,760
You wouldn't understand
why I'd risk everything

169
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,080
just to fight for the truth.

170
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,159
I see you've disregarded
all propriety with me.

171
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,039
You don't trust me,
and you've no interest

172
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,719
in a madwoman like me.

173
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,840
What do I have to fear?

174
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,159
Does your maid

175
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,359
not know about your condition?

176
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,210
Why don't you have her
perform the acupuncture for you?

177
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,200
No one knows about it except you.

178
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,880
Brother…

179
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,390
(A hatred that cuts to the bone.)

180
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,479
(I have one as well.)

181
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,599
(I favor well-bred ladies)

182
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,359
