(Xuezhao Residence)

5
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,559
Zhai Lu's acts of murder and arson

6
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:21,599
(The Sun Rises, The Moon Endures)
are a bit too high-profile.

7
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,639
We have old evidence and witnesses.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,959
He's just
a prefectural inspecting envoy.

9
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,040
Does he really think
he can do as he pleases?

10
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,990
I heard Official Liang is about
to take office as imperial censor.

11
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,680
He will soon return to Haining.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,519
He is known as Justice Liang.

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,120
If he presides over this case,

14
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,879
the chances of winning are higher.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,519
(I have spent so much effort,)

16
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:43,040
(just waiting for him.)

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,839
Now it depends on whether Zhai Lu

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,279
takes the bait.

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,480
You're Li Fuyuan?

20
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,030
You're from the central
magistrate's office?

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
We're ordered to arrest
the kidnapper of Fan Jili

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,720
and the murderer
of official Zhao Chengxi.

23
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,360
It's her.

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,239
It's this demoness.

25
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:06,400
Back when Zhai Lu
was magistrate of Huachang County,

26
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,479
he had frequent dealings with Fan Jili.

27
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,600
You mean...

28
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,600
Sir.

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,199
Please save my lady.

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Fan Jili somehow got out

31
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,620
and brought the central
magistrate's office to capture her.

32
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,279
She has now been taken back
to the magistrate's office.

33
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,520
Where are you going?

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,919
County Magistrate.

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,160
You're an official,

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,600
so we can only
temporarily detain you here.

37
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,880
I advise you not to act rashly.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,600
Or you may be accused of misconduct.

39
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,800
Suffer a bit.

40
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,180
We'll go to the central
magistrate's office to investigate.

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,000
Mr. Cui.

42
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,800
Please intervene.

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,559
When Document Building caught fire,

44
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,240
I know you preserved the old case files.

45
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,080
(Document Building)
Bring water.

46
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,839
Quick, put out the fire!

47
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,240
The case files are inside.

48
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,559
It shows you didn't
turn a blind eye to everything.

49
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,320
The victim is right in front of you,

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,559
yet they suffered misfortune.

51
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,000
If you don't act now,

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,000
this wrongful case

53
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:20,839
will never see justice.

54
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:34,362

00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:35,712

57
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,839
Enter.

58
00:03:56,559 --> 00:04:03,800
Be in awe.

(Mirror of Justice Hangs High)

60
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,080
Who kneels?

61
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,160
I'm Li Fuyuan

62
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,440
from Qinghe County.

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,239
I long resided at Huachang County's
Xuezhao Residence.

64
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,640
You bear three cases.

65
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,239
Kidnapping and imprisoning Fan Jili.

66
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,519
And recently,

67
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,000
burning and killing
Zhao Chengxi and his wife Shang Jin.

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,119
All have witnesses.

69
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,640
You cannot deny it.

70
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,279
Then what is the third case?

71
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,320
13 years ago,

72
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,640
the Yuehua Street fire

73
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,959
burned down all five lanes and 19 streets.

74
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:44,959
That fire didn't happen without reason.

75
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,480
You're the arsonist.

76
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,480
(Pure And Righteous Mind)
(Zhai Lu.)

77
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,119
(You're indeed involved)

78
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,160
(in the whole matter.)

79
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,359
What did you say?

80
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,119
Since you deny it outright,

81
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,600
we'll verify each case one by one.

82
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
Bring Fan Jili.

83
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,160
Fan Jili of Haining County.

84
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,359
Greetings, Sir.

85
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,399
Fan Jili.

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Look carefully at the woman beside you.

87
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,079
Who is she?

88
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,040
What connection
does she have with your lawsuit?

89
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,040
This person is called Li Fuyuan,

90
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,720
who claims to be Divine Lady Thrush.

91
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,920
The other day,

92
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,200
she lured me to the outskirts,

93
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
imprisoned, and tortured me.

94
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,200
This finger was cut off
by this demoness.

95
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:36,600
If not for your wisdom and rescue,

96
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,760
I would have died inside.

97
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,799
When I came out, I learned

98
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,000
that this demoness
had used a corpse to impersonate me.

99
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,239
Li Fuyuan.

100
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,440
What else do you have to say?

101
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,720
Sir.

102
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,920
I have no connection with Mr. Fan.

103
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,119
There's no need to harm him like this.

104
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,160
You clearly hate me to the bone

105
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,920
and want to kill me.

106
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,200
How so?

107
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,000
Because she's not

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,679
Li Fuyuan, some sorceress from Qinghe.

109
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
She's the youngest sister of Li Ji,

110
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,750
the real murderer in the Thrush Case
of Huachang County over ten years ago.

111
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,000
Li Yuan'er.

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Sir.

113
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,959
Mr. Fan's hysteria has gotten worse.

114
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,399
He even claims

115
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,760
that I'm someone I don't know.

116
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,640
I have my ways.

117
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,359
Sir.

118
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,519
Li Yuan'er should have
a mark on her body,

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,119
not only proving her identity,

120
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:29,600
but also linking
to a major case from years ago.

121
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,200
Explain it in detail.

122
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,440
After Li Ji was executed,

123
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,200
I took pity on the Li family,

124
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,079
so I went to visit

125
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,519
to help support them.

126
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,119
But I saw Li Residence on fire.

127
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,920
A little girl stumbled out,

128
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,079
terrified,

129
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,920
with large burns on her arms.

130
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,760
You mean I was that little girl?

131
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
Judging by looks,

132
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,799
it's naturally impossible to tell.

133
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,559
But you tied me up,

134
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,839
forcing me to admit I harmed Li Ji.

135
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,880
You said you weren't Li Yuan'er.

136
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,600
Who else could it be?

137
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,480
Dare you roll up your left sleeve

138
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,200
and show us your arms

139
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,359
to see if there are burn marks?

140
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:12,440
Even if there are,

141
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,000
it cannot prove it was from that fire.

142
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,520
If I have accidentally

143
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,540
injured my arms
while lighting a lamp last month,

144
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,920
I could become Li Yuan'er too.

145
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,399
Then in this county,

146
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,480
there could be hundreds of Li Yuan'ers.

147
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,720
Master Zhai.

148
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,480
There's no such a coincidence.

149
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,040
Please have her roll
up her sleeve and show us.

150
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,839
You're scared to do so.

151
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,600
Could it be guilt?

152
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,119
Somebody.

153
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,679
Yes.

154
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,519
Examine.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,119
I can prove

156
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,760
she's not Li Yuan'er.

157
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,519
(Mirror of Justice Hangs High)

158
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,359
Mr. Cui.

159
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:51,920
I'm Cui San
from the Cui family of Chenzhou.

160
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,160
Greetings, Master Zhai.

161
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,920
You say this woman is not Li Yuan'er.

162
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
What is the proof?

163
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,519
After the fire
at Li Residence on Yuehua Street,

164
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,000
I went to handle the bodies.

165
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,239
There were two corpses in the backyard.

166
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,920
They should be the elderly Li couple.

167
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,399
There are marks under the jaw
but no dust in mouth or nose.

168
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,880
They must have hanged themselves
before the fire.

169
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,239
In front was a child's corpse,

170
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,359
suffocated by thick smoke.

171
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,160
About the same age as Li Yuan'er.

172
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,320
This package

173
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,920
contains items
from the corpse back then.

174
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,880
(Autopsy Records)
Please examine.

175
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,640
Mr. Cui, how dare you speak nonsense?

176
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
She's clearly
the Li Yuan'er from back then.

177
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:34,119
Mr. Fan.

178
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,840
(Yuan)
What do you mean by that?

179
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,599
This is an autopsy record

180
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,119
I wrote over ten years ago.

181
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:40,799
It even has the magistrate office seal.

182
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,640
Could it be

183
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,039
that I colluded with this woman

184
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,840
to falsify records back then?

185
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,990
- You...
- Enough.

186
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,440
Thank you

187
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,919
for speaking a fair word for me.

188
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:50,960
Mr. Fan.

189
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,119
You're confused.

190
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,479
You probably really think I'm a villain.

191
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,799
I don't blame you.

192
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,719
Since you insist on seeing my arms,

193
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,000
then look.

194
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,799
Sir.

195
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,320
Do you still suspect me?

196
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,679
Perhaps you really aren't Li Yuan'er

197
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,440
and unrelated to the old Thrush Case.

198
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:34,000
But for the deaths of the Zhao couple
at Luofu Manor the other day,

199
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,440
I was present at the scene.

200
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,640
You cannot escape responsibility.

201
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,039
Do you perhaps still have evidence?

202
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,000
After the scene is cleared,

203
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,840
I will find the evidence.

204
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,119
Someone, take this woman away

205
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,119
for trial later.

206
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,520
You cannot detain her.

207
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,679
Master Lu.

208
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Instead of serving in Huachang County,

209
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,320
why come here?

210
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:12,440
How can you say this?

211
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,359
You have my pregnant wife

212
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:15,280
detained here.

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,440
Can I not come see her

214
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,679
and seek justice?

215
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,820
What nonsense are you saying?

216
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,440
My dear.

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,960
(Marriage Contracts)
All marriage documents are here.

218
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,280
Please examine.

219
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,440
Bring them here.

220
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,599
Three months ago,

221
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,919
(Engagement Contract)
I married my wife in Qinghe County.

222
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,880
Now she has been pregnant
for over a month.

223
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,080
She stayed

224
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,440
at Xuezhao Residence to rest.

225
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Being an official's wife,

226
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,580
she cannot stay
at the magistrate office.

227
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:52,200
Moreover, she's pregnant.

228
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,960
She cannot endure travel or toil.

229
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:55,640
(Eternal unity, forever together, Vow)
If you worry,

230
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,640
find a place
near the county magistrate office

231
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,840
for us to rest temporarily.

232
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,860
Just so we're clear,

233
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,880
it must be by water,

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,880
have a good view,

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,520
and have north-south ventilation.

236
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,520
- Best if secluded.
- Insolent!

237
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,919
I dare not.

238
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,159
If you find it troublesome,

239
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,280
you can let us
return to Huachang County first.

240
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,280
When you have proof,

241
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,239
you can summon us back.

242
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,679
Or do you

243
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,119
fear we might escape?

244
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,679
I suppose you wouldn't dare.

245
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,039
Let's go.

246
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,239
My dear.

247
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:52,599
Sir, you're letting them go
just like that?
