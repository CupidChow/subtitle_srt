(Gathering Auspiciousness With the Sun)
Mr. Cui.

5
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,639
Do as I instructed yesterday.

6
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:17,360
Split up and keep searching.

7
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Leave this place empty.

8
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:19,919
Not a single soul?

9
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm counting on you.

(Gathering Auspiciousness With the Sun)

11
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,000
(Official Liang is not staying
at the courier station.)

12
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,760
(None of the main routes show
any sign of him either.)

13
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,279
(A high official of the second rank)

14
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,480
(cannot simply vanish without a trace.)

15
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,599
Miss Li.

16
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
What brings you here?

17
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,520
Why are you in such a hurry?

18
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,199
You?

19
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,039
I came across some excellent tea today.

20
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,479
Sit down and share a cup with me.

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,720
Ah, yes.

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,240
I have yet to introduce myself.

23
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,639
My name is Liang Andao.

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,080
There is no need for formalities.

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,479
You arrived in Huachang County long ago
in plain clothes.

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,080
If I never step outside,

27
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,919
how could I see

28
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,800
or hear what truly happens?

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,399
Then why would I come at all?

30
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:48,199
At my age, am I here just
to admire the scenery?

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,479
Miss Li.

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
We have already submitted the evidence.

33
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,600
I have reviewed it all.

34
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,039
I never imagined

35
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,720
that an old unresolved case

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,600
would hide so many dark turns.

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,720
Murder to steal another man's wife.

38
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,039
False testimony.

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,720
And framing the innocent.

40
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,839
All these cases are connected.

41
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,279
I know these words are long overdue.

42
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:13,839
Still, I hope

43
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,320
they are not too late.

44
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,000
Miss Li, you have suffered greatly.

45
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,559
I will see that justice is done for you.

46
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,600
Thank you, Official Liang.

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,639
Alright.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
At last, I can give an answer.

49
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,960
When you fell from the cliff,

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,399
it threw Magistrate Lu into a panic.

51
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,279
He pressed me
to seek out Official Liang.

52
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,679
I have a favor to ask.

53
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,320
I fear Jiang Chun lacks
the ability to find him.

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,279
As for Official Liang…

55
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,960
Very well.

56
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,600
I give you my word.

57
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,279
So it was he who sent you
to seek Official Liang.

58
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:56,600
(If one day I were gone,)

59
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,160
(would you grieve for me?)

60
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,559
From the moment
I fell from the cliff until today,

61
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,119
has anything in his conduct

62
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,800
seemed out of the ordinary?

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,880
Inspecting Envoy Zhai arrives.

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,119
Master Zhai.

65
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,559
You didn't waste a single second.

66
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:33,190
He attempted
an assassination last night,

67
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,000
and today he sent everyone away.

68
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,399
Even if he believed I was dead,

69
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,799
he would not act
with such reckless arrogance.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,040
Did he leave

71
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,160
any trace behind last night?

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,279
Such as

73
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,000
marks or wounds on his body.

74
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:50,950
(The Sun Rises, The Moon Endures)

75
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,640
Lu Yanchong, so it truly was you.

76
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,440
How dare you!

77
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,359
I'm sure you already know

78
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,600
what I'd dare to do.

79
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,519
He meant to
draw Zhai Lu out to find him.

80
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,480
What is he truly plotting?

81
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,799
Gentlemen.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,559
I am the assassin who attacked
Master Zhai last night.

83
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:13,959
Guards.

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,119
(The Sun rises. The Moon endures.)
Come and seize me!

85
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,279
I have a conjecture.

86
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,079
Outside the capital region,

87
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,959
should two officials
of the seventh rank or above

88
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,679
die suddenly or meet an unnatural end,

89
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,600
the case may not be tried locally.

90
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,990
It must be sent
to the Court of Judicial Review,

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,750
to be retried
and held for further judgment.

92
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,079
If Magistrate Lu and Zhai Lu
were to meet misfortune together,

93
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,959
then even without my involvement,

94
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,119
this case

95
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,559
would be quietly buried.

96
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,750
Once it is reported
to the capital circuit,

97
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,239
Zhai Lu's influence in Haining

98
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,760
would no longer avail him.

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
His ties at court would fail.

100
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,239
When matters are forced into the open,

101
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,480
Miss Li would naturally be protected,

102
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,040
and the Thrush Case
would no longer be suppressed.

103
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,640
Still, Miss Li,
you need not worry too much.

104
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,399
Perhaps I have guessed wrongly.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,959
Is there truly someone in this world

106
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,399
who would stake his career and his life

107
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,799
for an old and unresolved

108
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,880
cold case?

109
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,200
Seize him.

110
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,799
Hold.

111
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,640
Master Zhai.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,160
There are certain matters

113
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,239
best not discussed before others.

114
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,079
For example,

115
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,760
Luofu Manor.

116
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:34,880
Wait outside.

117
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

118
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,480
Please.

119
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,519
Your struggle is futile.

120
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:44,119
That woman

121
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,600
is already dead.

122
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,480
That is true.

123
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,119
She is dead.

124
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,760
Everything comes to nothing.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,600
Nothing remains.

126
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,600
Sit.

127
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,959
I once met Li Ji.

128
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,559
When I first took office,

129
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,440
the Thrush Case had not yet occurred.

130
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,279
Li Ji had fine handwriting

131
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,559
and solid learning.

132
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:11,600
He served for several months
as a clerk at the county office.

133
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:13,200
He and I

134
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,920
crossed paths a few times.

135
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,839
You two

136
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,279
bear some similarities.

137
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,920
Do we?

138
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,239
I assumed

139
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,079
you relied
on the current Grand Chancellor,

140
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:30,559
while I,

141
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,000
after writing that poem at Tunhai House

142
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,799
that offended the Chancellor,

143
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,640
earned your deep dislike.

144
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,279
Walk this road long enough
and you will understand.

145
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,839
In officialdom, and in life,

146
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,480
nothing is ever purely black or white.

147
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,160
If you wish
to accomplish certain things,

148
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
you must inevitably

149
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,359
let go of some principles.

150
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,839
Believe it or not,

151
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,959
when I was in my early twenties,

152
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,559
I was not the man I am today.

153
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,079
What you said to me today

154
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,200
was rather amusing.

155
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,959
That said,

156
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,920
I am nothing like Li Ji.

157
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,480
A woman alone

158
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,920
is not enough to make me
throw my life away.

159
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,200
But yesterday,

160
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,720
had I not staged that scene,

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,959
you would not have

162
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,079
revealed yourself so easily.

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,880
Some matters

164
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,480
can only be discussed
in private, face-to-face.

165
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,279
What is it you wish to discuss?

166
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,880
You know me well enough.

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,919
You should know I am no fool.

168
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Helping Li Ji's sister
overturn the verdict

169
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,039
was a calculated risk on my part.

170
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,039
I wagered that the Thrush Case

171
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,380
would stir enough waves in Haining

172
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,799
to win me

173
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,919
a reputation
for integrity and uprightness.

174
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,119
But now that the woman is dead,

175
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,080
and the victim is gone,

176
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,200
this case

177
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,760
is unlikely to make any further impact.

178
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,479
If I wish to advance further in office,

179
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,559
I must seek another path.

180
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,159
After much thought,
I came to one conclusion.

181
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,239
It is easier to rest
in the shade of a great tree.

182
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,440
Master Zhai,

183
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,840
this time,

184
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,880
I have come to offer my allegiance.

185
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,559
Empty promises.

186
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,919
Since I dare sit down
to bargain with Your Excellency,

187
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,919
I would not come without goodwill.

188
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,840
Everything here

189
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,479
is evidence tied
to the Thrush Case at Luofu Manor.

190
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,080
It has never been shown.

191
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,159
Your roots in Haining run deep.

192
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,799
You may not fear my accusation,

193
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,000
yet such leverage in another's hands

194
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,159
is never safe.

195
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,520
Now,

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,359
I return it all to you.

197
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:34,640
That should count
as sufficient sincerity.

198
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,159
What do you want?

199
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,000
Luofu Manor was burnt down,

200
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,719
but Zhao Chengxi's wealth

201
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:42,920
cannot have vanished entirely.

202
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:44,559
I want the estate.

203
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,320
The land.

204
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,479
And the northwest ginseng routes.

205
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,599
That should be easy.

206
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,039
This is daylight robbery.

207
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,320
If I take possession of this property,

208
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,119
you are not losing out.

209
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,359
I am handing you a leverage this large.

210
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,520
From this day on,

211
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,119
we stand or fall

212
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,119
as one.

213
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,039
That way,

214
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,119
you can finally rest easy.

215
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,960
Everything I have done

216
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,679
was for gain,

217
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,280
and for a future.

218
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:16,599
Just sign here.

219
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,000
From here on,

220
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,200
we walk the same path.

221
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,187
(Hereby granted to Lu Yanchong the estate
and the northwest ginseng transport permit.)

222
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,875
(Hereby granted to Lu Yanchong the estate
and the northwest ginseng transport permit.)

223
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:05,850
(Hereby granted to Lu Yanchong the estate
and the northwest ginseng transport permit.)

224
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:13,762
(Signed by Zhai Lu.)

225
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,400
What is this?

226
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,280
Why is there another document?

227
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,119
Something that can convict you.

228
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:23,850
You are playing me.

229
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,719
(Lu Yanchong.)

230
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:48,960
(Master Lu.)

231
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,479
You came just in time.

232
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,880
Do you see that box over there?

233
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,000
It is made of metal.

234
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,119
Fire should not damage it.

235
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,320
Take it with you.

236
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,880
What is inside?

237
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,280
Evidence that will
clear your brother's name.

238
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,890
Turn around and leave.

239
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,119
Do not look.

240
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,840
He is about to die.

241
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,039
Will you do nothing?

242
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,840
Only if the two of you die together

243
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,559
will this case be sealed beyond doubt.

244
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,440
Besides,

245
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,200
he prepared the tung-oil fuse.

246
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,280
It has nothing to do with me.

247
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,799
Very well.

248
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,320
Human affection

249
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,119
is as thin as water.

250
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,520
From this day forth,

251
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,440
may you be like a kite with wings,

252
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,520
free to soar any sky as you please.

253
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,159
