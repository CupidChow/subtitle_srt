00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,562
(The Next Day)

5
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,680
Miss. Have you received news
from Magistrate Lu?

6
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,040
Where shall we go now?

7
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,680
Find someone for me.

8
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:31,440
I'll handle the rest.

9
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,239
Alright.

10
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,600
Why did you coerce me

11
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
to come here?

12
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:14,639
Why did your servant boy

13
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,320
overturn my boat in the water

14
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,360
a few days ago?

15
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,119
What are you saying?

16
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,240
I don't understand.

17
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,119
You understand.

18
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:26,279
Your series of schemes
were quite clever,

19
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,919
but you picked the wrong person.

20
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,240
You never should've

21
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:30,800
pin it on me.

22
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,479
It seems you insist

23
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,160
I explain everything one by one.

24
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,919
Very well.

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,399
Let's start from the beginning.

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,279
The day I fell in the water,

27
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:45,639
the weather was perfect.

28
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:47,606
There's not a single breeze.

29
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,360
If there was no wind,

30
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,440
could my boat have been alive

31
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,800
to flip on its own?

32
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,119
Since Fan Jili is dead,

33
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:58,320
why did someone see him in the streets?

34
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,919
And whose charred corpse

35
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,240
was that?

36
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,679
Your imagination

37
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,080
is vivid.

38
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,960
Why would I do such a thing?

39
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,119
Good question.

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,039
It was

41
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,039
to use me as a witness.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,679
First, you subdued Fan Jili,

43
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:19,199
then found a corpse
to burn as a stand-in.

44
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,960
The next day, you staged my fall

45
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,679
and rescued me.

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,759
Then you place Fan Jili in a carriage,

47
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,720
(Fan)
parading him through the city

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,119
so that everyone would see.

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,880
In this way,

50
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,080
Fan Jili died in the afternoon,

51
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,119
and you couldn't have traveled
to the western suburbs.

52
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:41,240
Suspicion against you
is naturally cleared.

53
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,850
What if the corpse
had been found earlier?

54
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
That place is deserted.

55
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,839
Only a woodsman passes the abandoned
house every noon without fail.

56
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,279
You must have

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,199
investigated it.

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,559
It's all calculated.

59
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,279
How about this?

60
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,399
I'll count to three.

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,039
If you can't convince me,

62
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,479
I will have you prosecuted.

63
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,600
County Magistrate Jiang.

64
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,160
Magistrate Lu is in that teahouse.

65
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,880
He must covet my lady's beauty

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,160
and intends to commit a crime.

67
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,479
Three.

68
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:09,639
You have no proof.

69
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
If I examine the corpse,

70
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,399
determine their age,
gender, and burial duration...

71
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,080
Two.

72
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,600
Instead of arresting directly,
you act secretly.

73
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,200
You must be up to something.

74
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,239
What do you want?

75
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,760
Just speak plainly.

76
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,320
Great.

77
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,679
Here's the deal.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,920
I want you

79
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,760
to take those pretending boys

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,880
and leave Huachang County.

81
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,279
You...

82
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,200
Toad venom aroma

83
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,399
takes effect
in about a quarter of an hour.

84
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,160
Sir.

85
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,799
You don't think

86
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:51,679
I enjoy listening to all this nonsense,

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,359
do you?

88
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:59,160
This is news I just bought
from a broker in the capital.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,279
A top scholar.

90
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,990
Accomplished
in both civil and martial arts.

91
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:05,320
Wrote poems and painted at Tunhai House.

92
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,640
Famous in the capital.

93
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,600
Praised by influential officials.

94
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,079
You were sent
to a small county like ours.

95
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,679
You're likely to rise quickly.

96
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,239
A person so skilled
in currying favor and avoiding harm

97
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,239
cannot truly be a fool.

98
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,760
If I don't take precautions,

99
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,000
then

100
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,160
you'd be a fool.

101
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,359
(Whether for the people
of Huachang County)

102
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
(or the prophecy of that day,)

103
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,119
(such scum and disaster)

104
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,920
(cannot be allowed to remain.)

105
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,200
Wait.

106
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,279
You cannot kill me.

107
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,679
I'll count to three.

108
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,399
If you cannot convince me,

109
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,519
I will act on you first.

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,399
Your fake corpse is in my hands.

111
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:49,839
(If you kill me,)

112
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,760
(the fake corpse matter
will be exposed.)

113
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,359
(Someone will then trace
Fan Jili's whereabouts.)

114
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,600
(Your plan)

115
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,920
(will probably fail.)

116
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
This item is called Don't Defy.

117
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,990
When it acts up,
you'll be in heart-wrenching pain.

118
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,190
Within these 12 days,

119
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,000
I must be able to freely
enter and exit the magistrate's office.

120
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,079
No matter what method you use.

121
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,320
Magistrate Lu.

122
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,320
Are you inside?

123
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,559
Sir.

124
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,600
What are you doing?

125
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,760
Don't come any closer.

126
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,790
Prepare a carriage.

127
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:34,720
Sir.

128
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,640
Fan Jili from Huachang County

129
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,880
seems to have suddenly died.

130
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
How did he die?

131
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,200
I heard he was burned alive.

132
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:42,440
Noted.

133
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,480
There's another matter.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,559
Speak.

135
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,720
The one surnamed Lu from the capital

136
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,190
has taken office in Huachang County.

137
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,440
Keep a close eye on him.

138
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:53,760
Yes.

139
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,987
(Huachang County Magistrate Office)

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
(Huachang County Magistrate Office)
I disturbed you.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,959
My apologies.

142
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,820
County Magistrate Jiang.

143
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,760
It's this room.

144
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,590
Cooperate if you don't want to die.

145
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,839
Sir.

146
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,959
What are you doing?

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,839
My lady is born weak.

148
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,200
(Gathering Auspiciousness With the Sun)
No need to trouble Master Jiang.

149
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,720
Are you alright?

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,640
Miss.

151
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,959
Have Huiyi guard the carriage.

152
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,359
Fan Jili was inside.

153
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,160
If someone inspects carefully,

154
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,559
they might discover something.

155
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,320
Yes.

156
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,160
You...

157
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,679
Don't worry.

158
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,279
He's not capable enough.

159
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,959
(Jiang Chun.)

160
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:14,040
(What exactly is your link
to the Thrush Case?)

161
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,080
You reacted well just now.

162
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,440
Doesn't it fit

163
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,840
your lecherous reputation perfectly?

164
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,599
I've cooperated as much as I can.

165
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,500
You've entered
the county magistrate office too.

166
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,880
What's your next move?

167
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,599
(This person is trouble anyway.)

168
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,400
(He should be dealt with sooner)

169
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,719
(to prevent future problems.)

170
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:56,520
Now,

171
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,599
help me find someone immediately.

172
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,840
You have the nerve to give orders.

173
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,000
Who?

174
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,880
Jiang Chun.

175
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,479
This is

176
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:30,880
a bamboo comb.

177
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,919
How do I use it?

178
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,119
You've never seen one?

179
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,520
I thought young ladies
would all have one or two.

180
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,119
Is that so strange?

181
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:46,200
I've never used one.

182
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,039
Do I use it like this?

183
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,280
What you want has arrived.

184
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,280
Ms. Li.

185
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,320
Please come in.

186
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,080
I heard some noise when I was outside

187
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,640
and knew you've woken up.

188
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,520
That day at Xuezhao Residence,

189
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,280
you faked spirits to swindle people.

190
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,840
I won't take back

191
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,359
calling you a demoness.

192
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,960
However,

193
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
what just happened

194
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,679
wasn't your fault.

195
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,479
I didn't expect Lu

196
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,200
to bully in broad daylight.

197
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,960
He's the local official here.

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,260
You might find it hard
to stand your ground here after this.

199
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,919
If you want to escape his harassment,

200
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,359
I have some money.

201
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,440
Take it.

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,380
Leave Huachang County immediately.

203
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:37,880
If I must leave,

204
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,559
I can stand anywhere.

205
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,239
But I have things I must do.

206
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,479
I cannot leave.

207
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,840
Thank you for your guidance.

208
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,840
