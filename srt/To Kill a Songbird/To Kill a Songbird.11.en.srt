(Shi is the trial fate
never meant me to escape.)

7
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,319
(Yesterday you bound me
and made me miss the right moment.)

8
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,000
(I nearly died outside the city.)

9
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,279
(After we come down the mountain,)

10
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:29,100
(it is best that our paths
be kept separate.)

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,959
(From then on,
we owe each other nothing.)

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,120
I said long ago

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,279
that you would get me killed.

14
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,760
Luckily, this girl is quick-witted.

15
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,990
She grabbed the arrow by hand,
shedding most of its force.

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,279
She won't die.

17
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,520
Guess

18
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:14,119
who wants to kill you.

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,720
Zhai Lu.

20
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,199
Zhao Chengxi is not the culprit.

21
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,360
There's someone behind him.

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,399
This case

23
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,960
is far more complex than we thought.

24
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,720
She's about to wake up.

25
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,720
Come drink some water too.

26
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,559
Why run so fast?

27
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:49,787
(Gathering Auspiciousness With the Sun)

28
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,919
Miss.

29
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,720
Miss, you're finally awake.

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,960
How's Luofu Manor?

31
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,520
We arrived too late.

32
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,399
It all burned down.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,399
People and belongings

34
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,039
are pretty much gone.

35
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,639
What about Lu Yanchong?

36
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,399
He's not hurt at all.

37
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,080
You were injured saving him.

38
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,600
He wandered off on his own.

39
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,399
He didn't even
come to see you or ask about you.

40
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,279
This bird is surprisingly smart.

41
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:50,559
When we returned,

42
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,960
it followed us back.

43
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,479
It's calm and didn't make a sound.

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,919
Ms. Li.

45
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,399
What happened after yesterday?

46
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,759
You were unconscious.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,790
Magistrate ordered me to take you back
to the county magistrate office.

48
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,360
I heard Zhai Lu

49
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,520
went down the mountain
after the incident .

50
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,039
I originally thought

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,479
Zhai Lu only trusted false proof

52
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,880
while in office.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
That Zhao Chengxi was the culprit,

54
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,920
and he was only negligent.

55
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,200
Thinking about it now,

56
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,880
there's another hidden truth

57
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,119
behind the murder and framing.

58
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,839
Zhai Lu.

59
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,079
Shen Xiu was just
a servant tending my birds.

60
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,920
So what if I killed him?

61
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,359
Since you're here,

62
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,160
don't expect to leave alive!

63
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,880
Zhai Lu knew the truth.

64
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,119
Chief.

65
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,399
I found it.

66
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,519
13 years ago, Zhai Lu was
the magistrate of Huachang County.

67
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Get up.

68
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,359
He knew every case detail best.

69
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,440
He deliberately concealed it

70
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,519
and now silenced witnesses.

71
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:59,359
He's likely the mastermind.

72
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,000
We

73
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,000
have no evidence.

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,320
To know whether

75
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,000
Zhai Lu is behind everything

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,559
is simple.

77
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,100
County Magistrate Jiang.

78
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,600
Will you go somewhere with me?

79
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,320
Sure.

80
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:17,720
Wait.

81
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,160
What is this?

82
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,279
I saw it by the roadside

83
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,279
and bought it.

84
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,959
I once thought

85
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,119
you were a cold bystander,

86
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,640
complicit with this world.

87
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,160
But now I know

88
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,200
you're someone bold.

89
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:52,399
I respect

90
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,440
and

91
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:55,519
admire you.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,119
If fate were kinder,

93
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,519
I wish you weren't so alone.

94
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,920
This incense
is called Yearning Bitterness.

95
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,720
It traps one in illusion,

96
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,640
showing their happiest moment.

97
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,079
The heart wanders freely,

98
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,559
leaving no strength to fight.

99
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,119
You just let the girl leave?

100
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,720
I think she's quite good.

101
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,200
Fierce and righteous.

102
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,720
What are you looking for?

103
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:50,959
You'll flip the bookshelf.

(Elder Baiyun Biography)

105
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,519
Elder Baiyun Biography?

106
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,119
When did you
get interested in cultivation?

107
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,799
You know Elder Baiyun?

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,200
Elder Baiyun is a true immortal.

109
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,440
You know him?

110
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,119
If

111
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,959
he made a judgment outright,

112
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,480
can it be changed?

113
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,820
Do you think
words spoken by a true immortal

114
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,600
can be changed?

115
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,640
I have to change my name.

116
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,390
Especially the character Yan.

117
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,640
I can't keep it.

118
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,839
Master Lu.

119
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,880
You're now a court official,

120
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,839
registered in official records.

121
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,600
As long as your head is still on,

122
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,040
you can't change your name.

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,200
Why are you glaring at me?

124
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
That girl saved you, yet you ignored her.

125
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,079
Now that she has left,
and you lash out at me.

126
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,359
What is wrong with you?

127
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,519
Why leave again without finishing?

128
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,119
Sir.

129
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,399
Why are you suddenly interested
in alchemy and mysticism?

130
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,559
Too many misfortune lately.

131
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm trying to ward it off.

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,839
By the way, Sir,

133
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,119
how much do you know about Zhai Lu?

134
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,359
Luofu Manor's fire was strange.

135
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,839
The arrow that night was strange too.

136
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,239
I suspect Zhai Lu...

137
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:19,040
You don't need to say more about this.

138
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:21,000
Find Jiang Chun if you need anything.

139
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,760
Li Fuyuan.

140
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,880
I know you suffered injustice,

141
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,880
but you're not the only one.

142
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:42,919
You can't expect me

143
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,119
to focus only on your old case.

144
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,760
Do you understand?

145
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,760
I understand.

146
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,799
Sorry.

147
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,239
Is your injury alright?

148
00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:16,400
I'm fine.

149
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:18,400
No vital damage was done.

150
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,000
Thank you for risking your life.

151
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,280
You're too polite.

152
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,239
You saved me before too.

153
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,559
You owe me nothing.

154
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,239
(You probably)

155
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,039
(never felt bone-deep hatred,)

156
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,640
(so you don't know why I risk my life)

157
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,039
(to fight for the truth.)

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,159
(I also have)

159
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,479
(bone-deep hatred.)

160
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,520
Your older brother

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,119
was also my enlightening teacher.

162
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,520
Kan is a trap.

163
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,640
What am I trapped in?

164
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:21,440
Gen is restraint.

165
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,919
What does it restraint?

166
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,520
My bond with her

167
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,840
or her life?

168
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,479
If I keep approaching her,

169
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,919
Kan is water and added sorrow.

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
I never

171
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,799
thought

172
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,080
I would fear ghostly beliefs

173
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,440
and hesitate to move forward.

174
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,479
Li Fuyuan.

175
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,200
You truly are my nemesis.

176
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,200
Ms. Li, are you alright?

177
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,840
I'm fine.

178
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,479
Someone is following us.

179
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,320
I know.

180
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,200
Ignore them.

181
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,119
Should we shake them off?

182
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:10,960
Go through the market.

183
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,400
Give me a few more.

184
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:15,919
Thanks.

185
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,262
(Xuezhao Residence)

186
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,840
The place you mentioned

187
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,760
(Xuezhao Residence)
is Xuezhao Residence?

188
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,719
Sir.

189
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,440
They went to Xuezhao Residence?

190
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,280
Yes.

191
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,119
