1
00:00:07,906 --> 00:00:11,916
(Earth Arcade 3)

2
00:00:12,176 --> 00:00:13,675
(Previously)

3
00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:15,785
(They got their makeup done for the perfect disguise.)

4
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:17,586
(They adjusted perfectly to the site.)

5
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:19,716
(They obviously looked suspicious.)

6
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:21,785
(The agents followed Torong's traces...)

7
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:24,386
(and finished investigating the scene.)

8
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:25,856
(Next morning, )

9
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:28,726
(the E-cade members enjoyed breakfast freely.)

10
00:00:29,326 --> 00:00:31,665
(Hey!)

11
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:32,966
Torong just spent money.

12
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:35,735
(Did he use money at the Etihad Airways?)

13
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:39,405
(Torong posted a selfie that was taken at the airport.)

14
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,546
(For goodness' sake)

15
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:43,176
(He ran away with Cheol Yong.)

16
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,446
(Was he a spy?)

17
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,546
(Was Cheol Yong a spy?)

18
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:50,946
(The double agent who was sent by Torong, Cheol Yong)

19
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:54,116
(He didn't run away empty-handed.)

20
00:00:55,926 --> 00:00:57,325
(What? That's our laptop.)

21
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,326
(Laptop)

22
00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:00,255
(He took Yang Hee Eun's glasses case!)

23
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:02,365
(Devastated)

24
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:04,695
(Cheol Yong ran away with the members' prized items.)

25
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:06,935
(Where did Torong go to?)

26
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,065
(Portugal!)

27
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:10,206
(He'll go to Lisbon, Portugal.)

28
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:13,076
(Torong's next destination)

29
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,676
(The capital of Portugal)

30
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:18,046
(Lisbon)

31
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:19,546
Eun Ji, I don't know about that.

32
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,986
I need to hurry up and find Yang Hee Eun's glasses.

33
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:23,245
- Please. - Hold on.

34
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:24,485
- Hurry up. Please. - I think he's nearby.

35
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:26,286
What are we supposed to do? Eun Ji.

36
00:01:26,456 --> 00:01:27,556
I should've known.

37
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:29,856
That explains why we got free breakfast.

38
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:31,356
Young Ji, hurry up and run.

39
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:34,495
- Yang Hee Eun! - Oh, no!

40
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:36,065
- What are we going to do? - Yang Hee Eun!

41
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:37,096
Cheol Yong!

42
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:38,535
Yang Hee Eun!

43
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:39,965
(Cheol Yong stole the most important items.)

44
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,306
He must be leaving in a car.

45
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:43,236
My bag!

46
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:45,586
- My slippers. For goodness' sake. - Give me my bag!

47
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,105
- My slippers. - My bag!

48
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,345
(The living room is empty.)

49
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:50,005
Why didn't we know?

50
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,446
(They go outside the front door.)

51
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,275
Where is he?

52
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:55,315
(Cheol Yong is gone already.)

53
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:56,316
He's gone.

54
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,385
He really took them. No!

55
00:01:58,386 --> 00:01:59,916
(Mimi checks the room.)

56
00:02:02,186 --> 00:02:03,226
Yang Hee Eun.

57
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:05,796
This is so annoying. He only took one slipper.

58
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:08,416
I can't lose the glasses from Yang Hee Eun.

59
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,465
(The thief, )

60
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,965
(Cheol Yong left to catch his morning flight.)

61
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,136
- Shall we book our flights? - We need to leave.

62
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,335
- The fastest ones? - Book them.

63
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:19,636
- Go ahead. - We can't get on that plane anyway.

64
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,006
The plane to Portugal?

65
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:22,575
- Are we going to Portugal? - Are we going...

66
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,146
to Portugal in this state?

67
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:25,216
Warriors.

68
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:26,815
- Are you ready to go to Portugal? - Like this?

69
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:28,245
- Hold on. - Did he really go to Portugal...

70
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:30,046
with my glasses from Yang Hee Eun?

71
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:32,196
- What's wrong? - What's up with her?

72
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,616
Let me wear lipstick first.

73
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:37,056
- Warriors. - I see.

74
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:39,596
This part will get aired no matter what,

75
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,195
so she wants to wear lipstick.

76
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:42,476
- Okay. We'll wait. - All right.

77
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:44,365
It's a dramatic moment, but we'll wait.

78
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:45,595
She's an idol, after all.

79
00:02:45,596 --> 00:02:47,265
(She finishes wearing lipstick.)

80
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,335
The next plane...

81
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,765
- we can get on leaves at 2am. - Did you say 2am?

82
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:51,835
Let's catch Torong in Lisbon no matter what.

83
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:52,836
- Let's catch him no matter what. - Okay.

84
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:54,505
- Let's do that. - Are we going to Portugal?

85
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:55,845
- It's so nice. - He took the glasses...

86
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:57,145
- from Yang Hee Eun. - It's so nice.

87
00:02:57,146 --> 00:02:58,575
- I love that we're going there. - He ran way...

88
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:00,475
with the case that's full of glasses from Yang Hee Eun, right?

89
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:01,485
Yes.

90
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:03,716
- Why did he do something so brave? - I mean...

91
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:05,315
- Which item of yours went missing? - It's bad.

92
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:06,515
None of my items went missing.

93
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:07,685
I think he's smart.

94
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:09,226
I would've killed him for real.

95
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,125
If he touches my items, I'll kill him.

96
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,295
- No. - Do you have all of your items?

97
00:03:12,296 --> 00:03:13,396
- Yes, I do. - He stole...

98
00:03:13,556 --> 00:03:15,195
- the laptop that was... - Look again.

99
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,665
- a substitute for yours. - That's right! My laptop!

100
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,865
We can't watch "I'm Sorry, I Love You" anymore.

101
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,165
You played music with it.

102
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,196
What am I going to do?

103
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,235
He's sneaky...

104
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,506
because we were just watching "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

105
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:30,676
- What is it? - What?

106
00:03:33,076 --> 00:03:35,216
(What?)

107
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:38,156
(What is it?)

108
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:39,555
(Why is she so surprised?)

109
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:40,755
- What is it? - Please.

110
00:03:40,756 --> 00:03:41,756
- What is it? - She's right.

111
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:42,855
We were just watching "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

112
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,856
- He took the items very recently. - That's...

113
00:03:45,196 --> 00:03:46,925
Listen to me.

114
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,096
That's why I suspect the producers.

115
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,095
- What are we going to do? - Hold on.

116
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:52,096
- What? - Hello.

117
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,435
- You didn't receive a call. Wait. - Hello.

118
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:54,436
- What? - You're faking it.

119
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:56,666
- Hold on. Hello. - What is it?

120
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:58,736
- Yes. - "Yes."

121
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,736
- Yes. Okay. - "Yes. Okay."

122
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:03,246
(This spy has terrible acting skills.)

123
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:05,245
- Okay. - He was on the "Reply" series.

124
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,315
- He's different. - He's an experienced actor.

125
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:09,662
I can tell that he played a boarder in Sinchon in the "Reply" series.

126
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:10,715
Okay. Thank you.

127
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:11,885
(Okay. Thank you.)

128
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:13,456
- Okay. - It was Jade Emperor.

129
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,025
What did he say?

130
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:16,525
- We just received an order. - What did he say?

131
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:18,226
- We had sent him a report. - Okay.

132
00:04:18,496 --> 00:04:19,995
According to Jade Emperor,

133
00:04:19,996 --> 00:04:22,165
we should've entered Abu Dhabi as agents.

134
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,396
An article was released.

135
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:26,435
(An article about the members leaving for Abu Dhabi)

136
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:27,916
That was why their covers were blown.

137
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,336
- So we're switching countries? - Hold on.

138
00:04:30,606 --> 00:04:31,606
- So you got a call... - No way.

139
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:32,727
From Writer Woo Jung, right?

140
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,535
Jade Emperor is Writer Woo Jung, right?

141
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:35,645
That must be it.

142
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:36,646
- That must be it. - Writer Woo Jung is...

143
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:38,375
- Jade Emperor. - That must be it.

144
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:40,145
Jade Emperor, what are you doing here?

145
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,716
You're wrong! I'm the boss here, okay?

146
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:46,015
You aren't the only princess, okay? I'm a princess too!

147
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:47,615
- We're princesses too. - Jade Emperor only calls me.

148
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:48,985
Don't lie. We know the truth.

149
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:50,525
Woo Jung can't order me around.

150
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:51,696
- Don't lie. - I...

151
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:54,196
- One, two, three. - Blueberry and cream cheese bread.

152
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,165
- That's... - It's correct.

153
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,795
(Glancing over)

154
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:01,565
(Brother Yeong Seok, good luck.)

155
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:02,735
- What should we do now? - So...

156
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,205
- our covers got blown. - Explain it to us again.

157
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:05,905
- Five princesses. - Your disguise...

158
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,375
- from yesterday... - Okay.

159
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:09,006
And your appearance as an agent...

160
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,075
became known in Abu Dhabi.

161
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,315
- No way. - I told you...

162
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:13,916
that we stood out too much.

163
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:16,716
This time, you need to wear a different disguise.

164
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:18,016
What?

165
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:20,915
(A new disguise)

166
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,026
- How? - Lisbon, Portugal is...

167
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:26,626
the haven for backpackers,

168
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,025
- That's right. - you know.

169
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,242
- The haven for backpackers. - Backpackers.

170
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:32,736
You guys are no longer famous celebrities.

171
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:35,765
You guys will infiltrate the place...

172
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:37,635
- as ordinary backpackers. - I see.

173
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:38,936
Ordinary backpackers.

174
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:44,846
(The final destination for a backpacking trip in Europe)

175
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:50,216
(Lisbon, Portugal)

176
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:55,356
(The E-cade members had no idea about the place.)

177
00:05:55,956 --> 00:06:00,696
(They'll go on their first journey with a backpack only.)

178
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:06,136
(Flowers Over Earth Arcade)

179
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:08,166
Ma'am. Sir.

180
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,036
Oh, my.

181
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:16,506
(Even the streets will be part of the trip.)

182
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:21,886
(Lisbon is full of romance.)

183
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,286
It's so pretty.

184
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:25,785
- It's pretty. - I really feel like...

185
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,216
I'll find romantic love here.

186
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:32,726
(The most romantic scenery)

187
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:35,825
I want to live here.

188
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:37,966
(Sunset)

189
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,066
(The E-cade members fall in love with the atmosphere.)

190
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:47,876
(The scenery makes them forget about Torong and everything.)

191
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:48,976
We earned our suitcases.

192
00:06:48,977 --> 00:06:51,105
Let's catch Torong a bit later.

193
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,215
I want to do that.

194
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:54,522
- You want to stay here longer. - Yes. Let's stay here longer.

195
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:55,885
It's so nice.

196
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:56,886
(The E-cade members' sentimental backpacking trip)
I'm thankful.

197
00:06:57,887 --> 00:06:59,386
(However)

198
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,926
You must disguise yourself perfectly as backpackers.

199
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,495
So we'll collect your suitcases as you can only carry the items...

200
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:07,125
that fit into the backpack.

201
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,595
- Hold on. That's ridiculous. - Thus,

202
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,995
you must win...

203
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,635
- a big backpack. - We must do that no matter what.

204
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:13,865
- For goodness' sake. - This is aggravating.

205
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,866
We're in trouble.

206
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,427
- Give us the backpack. - The backpack?

207
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,775
(From Abu Dhabi to Lisbon)

208
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:20,276
(A game for the backpack)

209
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:25,846
(They enter as they sing purposeful music.)

210
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:28,416
We really need to pick well. We need to concentrate.

211
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:31,815
(Yu Jin moves stealthily to keep herself hidden.)

212
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:33,215
- By the way, - I mean...

213
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:35,786
didn't you put on those pajamas yesterday?

214
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:39,326
- I have a question. - What is it?

215
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,026
Do we get 1 backpack for 4 people?

216
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:42,965
No. It's one backpack per person.

217
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:44,096
Okay.

218
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:45,496
Is it an individual match?

219
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:47,536
- It's a team competition. - Excuse me?

220
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:48,966
We can do it.

221
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,776
- It's a team competition. - Excuse me?

222
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,136
We can do it.

223
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:55,345
I don't like that.

224
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:56,746
- What? - Why not?

225
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,046
You guys... Never mind.

226
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:02,386
(What about us?)

227
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,186
I like you guys.

228
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:05,586
I'm in your care, Mimi.

229
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:08,825
Why did you say that to Mimi?

230
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:10,786
(Scared)

231
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:12,595
- I'm in your care. - I'm in your care, Mimi.

232
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:15,026
(She became the person of interest due to many reasons.)

233
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,436
Now, it's time to check out the backpacks.

234
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:23,305
I'll show you the backpacks...

235
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:24,766
from the moon.

236
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,536
There are five kinds.

237
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:31,946
(They want to be the agents' backpack.)

238
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:35,216
(5 kinds of bag)

239
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,885
The first one is...

240
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:39,915
the backpack you can earn if you succeed in it in one go.

241
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,076
- We're curious. - Show them.

242
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:42,625
- I see. - Okay.

243
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:44,056
That's the basic one.

244
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:45,725
- Nice. - Not bad.

245
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,155
It can hold up to 45l.

246
00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:48,295
- Did you say 45l? - Nice.

247
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:50,365
- It's like one suitcase. - Yes.

248
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,265
If it holds up to 45l, Mi Hyun can probably fit into it.

249
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,565
Let's see if it works.

250
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,696
Go inside, Mimi.

251
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:56,165
(She can put her legs inside with ease.)

252
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,275
- She can fit into it. - It's entirely possible.

253
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,405
I'll stop here.

254
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,676
"I'll stop here."

255
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,905
- It holds up to 45l. - You can also put water bottles.

256
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:04,406
It's nice.

257
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:06,275
- Eun Ji, it really suits you. - Yes.

258
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:07,676
- Brother Yeong Seok. - Yes?

259
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,636
Not you. She looks like Brother Yeong Seok.

260
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:11,186
Really?

261
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:13,285
(Na Yeong Lee Eun Ji, age 34, unmarried)

262
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,856
Woo Jung, where are you?

263
00:09:16,386 --> 00:09:18,426
- I'm not like that! - Woo Jung!

264
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:19,596
Hyun Yong!

265
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:21,496
Geon Jun!

266
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:23,066
Where are you guys?

267
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,495
I'm the boss, okay?

268
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:27,535
- I do things as I want. - How coy.

269
00:09:27,536 --> 00:09:28,666
- Okay. - She's coy.

270
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:30,735
That's number 1. We can get it if we succeed in it in 1 go.

271
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,605
You guys will get four of them.

272
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,606
If you win that backpack...

273
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,275
(Number 1, 45-liter backpack)

274
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:38,076
(Storage, portability, sturdiness, aesthetic, camouflage)

275
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:40,376
Show us the second one.

276
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,286
(What?)

277
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:44,286
- It's okay. - That's just wrong.

278
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,115
(Number 2, Large-sized tarpaulin bag)

279
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:47,855
But if you open it...

280
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:49,155
It holds a lot of items.

281
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:50,186
Really?

282
00:09:50,286 --> 00:09:52,095
- It holds a lot of items. - We always...

283
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:53,096
(Young Ji is missing.)

284
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:54,395
- It's a camouflage. - It has a camouflage function.

285
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:56,266
- It's a tarpaulin bag, right? - Yes.

286
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:57,865
I have a question. Won't the straps break?

287
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,572
- They don't break easily. - They don't break.

288
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:01,495
- You use these bags for moving. - Yes.

289
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:04,305
- This is a bag stylists use. - Yes.

290
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:06,075
Because of that, you can easily carry two outfits.

291
00:10:06,076 --> 00:10:07,406
- It holds many items. - Yes.

292
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:09,775
- This bag won't be bad. - That's right.

293
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,345
(Number 2, Tarpaulin bag)

294
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:14,276
(Storage, portability, sturdiness, aesthetic, camouflage)

295
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:16,285
If this is the 2nd one, what's the 3rd one?

296
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:18,246
I'll show you the third one.

297
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:19,685
Not bad.

298
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:20,915
- Not bad. - I'll be okay with this one.

299
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,632
- It's a backpack. - If we want to carry our clothes...

300
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:23,985
It holds up to 23l.

301
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:25,695
This one won't do.

302
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:27,702
- It'll be hard to pack clothes. - Does it hold up to 23l?

303
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,366
Does it hold up to 23l?

304
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,466
(Solemn)

305
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,696
- Then I can fit into it. - Mimi.

306
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:37,136
(Mimi's face and right arm fill up the backpack.)

307
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:39,236
- I guess it's the same brand. - I guess.

308
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:41,275
(Number 3, 23-liter backpack)

309
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:44,246
(Storage, portability, sturdiness, aesthetic, camouflage)

310
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:45,976
I'll show you the fourth one.

311
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,676
(Torn)

312
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:49,516
It's gold, Mimi's favorite color.

313
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,316
(Satisfied)

314
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,285
(Number 4, Small-sized gold tarpaulin bag)

315
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,816
It really suits you.

316
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:57,756
- It suits you. - It suits you.

317
00:10:57,826 --> 00:10:59,126
I choose this one.

318
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:00,295
- What? - I like it.

319
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:01,895
Even if you win that backpack?

320
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:03,796
It's a team competition!

321
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,636
Mimi.

322
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,195
Isn't it the same case as the one for the glasses?

323
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:09,405
It's very narrow.

324
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:10,406
- Right. Not much will go in. - Look at this.

325
00:11:10,407 --> 00:11:12,135
It'll barely hold a laptop.

326
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:13,435
- It's tiny. - You guys don't have a laptop.

327
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:14,475
I forgot.

328
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:15,845
I forgot that it was stolen.

329
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:17,375
(Number 4, Gold tarpaulin bag)

330
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,316
(Storage, portability, sturdiness, aesthetic, camouflage)

331
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,785
- Lastly... - What?

332
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:23,345
- That's... - Mimi.

333
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:24,985
It means that the game is hard.

334
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:25,986
Seriously.

335
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:27,616
(Chuckling)

336
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,126
What's this? For goodness' sake.

337
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:33,725
Hold on. That's...

338
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,965
a plastic bag for a supermarket here.

339
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:38,295
I'm sorry, but I'd rather carry things in my hands.

340
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:40,935
I'd rather do that than receive such treatments.

341
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:42,736
If you fail in every stage,

342
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,806
- you'll get a plastic bag. - A plastic bag.

343
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:49,146
But this plastic bag has an advantage.

344
00:11:49,446 --> 00:11:52,446
It won't be right to limit the number of the plastic bags.

345
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:55,345
- You can get as many as you want. - That isn't half bad.

346
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:57,485
Doesn't it seem like a Balenciaga fashion show?

347
00:11:57,486 --> 00:11:58,585
A little bit.

348
00:11:58,586 --> 00:12:00,686
(Runway in a fashion show)

349
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:05,126
(You can look like someone who's taking out the trash.)

350
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,172
- You know what it is. - A Balenciaga fashion show.

351
00:12:07,196 --> 00:12:08,726
It's nice.

352
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,325
(Number 5, Plastic bag)

353
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:13,296
(Storage, portability, sturdiness, aesthetic, camouflage)

354
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:16,636
(Out of the five options, )

355
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:19,776
(which one do the agents want?)

356
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:20,905
Hey.

357
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,675
- Young Ji. - It's no joke, right?

358
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,605
- It's perfect, Young Ji. - If you travel like this,

359
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:26,176
you'll be a proper backpacker.

360
00:12:26,216 --> 00:12:27,915
You look like someone who has been traveling the world...

361
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,646
without any money for seven years.

362
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:30,846
(She goes from a traveler to a nomad.)

363
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,885
You look like a travel influencer, seriously.

364
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,255
You... My goodness.

365
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:35,562
(The outfit that's the perfect disguise)

366
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:38,025
You'll beat Pani Bottle right away.

367
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:39,255
- You'll beat Pani Bottle. - You'll beat Pani Bottle.

368
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:40,625
I think I should start a YouTube channel.

369
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:41,865
- You should. - A traveling YouTube channel.

370
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:43,095
Young Ji, isn't it comfortable?

371
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,165
I love it.

372
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,235
If you succeed in it in one go, you'll get a nice backpack.

373
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:48,506
Every time you fail, the bag will be downgraded.

374
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:51,136
I'll now reveal the game.

375
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:53,275
- This is important. - Here comes the game.

376
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:54,436
Finally,

377
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:55,906
after three years,

378
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,445
- Is it a new game? - we have...

379
00:12:57,446 --> 00:12:58,746
a new reverse game.

380
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,816
- Stop it. - I'm bad at the reverse games.

381
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:03,745
- What am I going to do? - Hold on a second.

382
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:05,816
Hold on a second.

383
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:08,297
(Reverse Rock-Paper-Scissors was a new game in Season 1.)

384
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,655
(You had to say "I won" when you lost and vice versa.)

385
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,556
(You had to say the opposite result.)

386
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,226
(Screaming)

387
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:22,906
(All the agents struggled.)

388
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,236
I won.

389
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,905
(Young Ji in particular...)

390
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,536
- I lost. - Wrong.

391
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:29,005
- I lost. - Wrong.

392
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:30,376
- Scissors. - I lost.

393
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:31,606
Wrong.

394
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:34,106
(She's the worst member who got it wrong 6 out of 13 times.)

395
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:35,885
We have a new reverse game.

396
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:37,745
- What am I going to do? - Hold on a second.

397
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:39,486
(Tossing the backpack)

398
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:40,855
(Feisty runs away.)

399
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,786
- Young Ji. - Young Ji.

400
00:13:43,026 --> 00:13:44,785
(No. I won't do it. I can't do it.)

401
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:47,156
The girls are sullen.

402
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:49,495
- What are we going to do? - Why play a new game...

403
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,995
in this crucial moment?

404
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,665
I'm okay with plastic bags.

405
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,536
I have a question. Why did you decide to desert me?

406
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:57,905
Nobody decided to desert you.

407
00:13:57,906 --> 00:14:00,235
Why play a new game in this crucial moment?

408
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:01,975
- What should we do? - You guys are more than capable.

409
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:05,046
Young Ji can do this without a problem.

410
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:08,016
And Mimi can do this without a problem.

411
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:10,586
You just need to be good with the diction and key.

412
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:14,055
It's the Reverse Perfect Pitch.

413
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:16,026
(Reverse Perfect Pitch)

414
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,455
- Yu Jin. - Yes?

415
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,926
Try the Perfect Pitch with "Mona Lisa."

416
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,395
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa.

417
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:25,126
- She's good. - For the Reverse Perfect Pitch...

418
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,235
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa,

419
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:31,006
- Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa. - It sounds scary.

420
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,676
(She's good!)

421
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:36,405
(You need to lower the key for each syllable.)

422
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:38,545
You switch the keys.

423
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:41,215
It isn't "Mona Lisa." It's "Mona Lisa."

424
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:43,085
- Mo... - She doesn't understand.

425
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:44,346
She doesn't understand.

426
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:47,056
The first syllable starts at a lower key. Mona Lisa,

427
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:48,985
- I see. - Mona Lisa,

428
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:51,755
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa.

429
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:52,756
There you go. That's it.

430
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:55,365
Even though it's a new game, you can do it without a problem.

431
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:56,995
- You can succeed in it in one go. - Mimi.

432
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,095
- Mona Lisa. - Usually, it goes like this.

433
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:00,435
- The key goes down. - Again.

434
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:02,136
- Mona Lisa. - Tree frog.

435
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:03,635
No.

436
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:04,705
(The 2nd problematic member)

437
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:07,275
Let's begin right away.

438
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:08,505
Here's the important thing.

439
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:09,852
You can go slow, but there are rules.

440
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,015
You must make a round trip in 100 seconds.

441
00:15:12,016 --> 00:15:13,815
- Okay. - If anyone gets it wrong,

442
00:15:13,816 --> 00:15:15,986
- you go back to the start. - Okay.

443
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:18,246
Also, put your hands behind your back.

444
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,756
- Don't move your facial muscles. - Don't do that.

445
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:23,685
- Can't we do this? - No.

446
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:26,395
There are various cheating skills to get the right pitch.

447
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:27,755
We're well aware of them.

448
00:15:27,756 --> 00:15:28,926
Cheating is prohibited.

449
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:30,995
- Everyone... - Listen.

450
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,395
This isn't an audition for the applied music department.

451
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:35,295
All of you guys are musicians.

452
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:37,606
Does he think he's Lee Young Hyun?

453
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:39,436
For goodness' sake.

454
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:42,576
(Round 1, 45-liter backpack)

455
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:44,245
We must succeed in it in one go.

456
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:45,992
- We must succeed in it in one go. - Let's go.

457
00:15:46,016 --> 00:15:48,146
All right. The keyword...

458
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:50,736
- Let someone save me. - will be revealed. What is it?

459
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:52,886
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

460
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,525
(He gives them seven syllables...)

461
00:15:55,526 --> 00:15:57,626
(after making them practice with four syllables.)

462
00:15:57,786 --> 00:16:00,255
- All right. Are you ready? - Yes.

463
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:01,295
- Set... - Won't you show us the keyword?

464
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:02,625
- Show us. - You need to show us.

465
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:04,766
- One hundred seconds. Set, go. - Let's go.

466
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:06,535
Bibbidi...

467
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:07,536
Go.

468
00:16:07,537 --> 00:16:12,135
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

469
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:13,875
Bibbidi-bibabidi-boo.

470
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,106
Wrong.

471
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:17,206
(It's hard.)

472
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:18,716
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

473
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:24,115
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

474
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,056
- Bbbidi-bodibi-boo. - Wrong.

475
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:28,156
What's "Bbbidi?"

476
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:30,786
- We can do it. - Bidibib...

477
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:32,926
- Wrong. - It's okay.

478
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:34,696
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

479
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:40,736
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

480
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:44,735
- Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. - There you go.

481
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:48,805
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

482
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:50,376
Pass.

483
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,816
Bibibidi-bodibidi-boo.

484
00:16:53,476 --> 00:16:54,676
Wrong.

485
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:56,916
Bibibidi-bodibidi-boo.

486
00:16:57,586 --> 00:17:00,115
Wrong.

487
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:01,462
(She got the word, key, and number of syllables wrong.)

488
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:02,725
(Chuckling)

489
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:04,526
Wrong. Back to Yu Jin.

490
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,595
- Shall I go first? - Go ahead.

491
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:09,126
(They switch positions.)

492
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:11,826
Bibibidi-bodibidi-boo.

493
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:14,165
Bibibidi-bodybuilding-boo.

494
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,235
- Wrong. Hands behind your back. - Go slowly.

495
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,236
Hands behind your back.

496
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:20,375
- Bibibidi-bobbidi-boo. - Wrong.

497
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:21,735
(Dying)

498
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,676
- You know... - Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo?

499
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:27,576
She can't say, "Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo."

500
00:17:28,576 --> 00:17:30,545
Bibibidi-bobbidi-boo.

501
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:32,285
- Bibbi... - You say, "Bibibidi-bobbidi."

502
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:33,315
Wrong. Again.

503
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:34,485
- Bi... - Focus.

504
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,955
Bibibidi-bobbidi-boo.

505
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:36,956
- Wrong. - I mean...

506
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,256
- Bibibi... - It's "Bibbidi."

507
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:41,896
(The bibibidi-bobbidi-boo flower has bloomed.)

508
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:44,665
(This nomad hasn't even received a chance yet.)

509
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,035
It's "Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo."

510
00:17:47,036 --> 00:17:49,636
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

511
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,966
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

512
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:55,135
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

513
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:57,045
You're doing well.

514
00:17:57,046 --> 00:17:59,615
- Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo - You're doing well.

515
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:01,945
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

516
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:03,985
- Wrong. - Time's up.

517
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:05,015
- Bibbidi-bobbidi... - What?

518
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:06,655
One hundred seconds are up. You failed.

519
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:08,686
(They failed.)

520
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:11,456
Mimi, I told you that I was in your care.

521
00:18:11,986 --> 00:18:14,196
This is something I can't do.

522
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:16,765
- Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. - We got...

523
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:18,265
- a difficult word. - It was hard.

524
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:19,365
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

525
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,795
- Let me practice. - Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

526
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:23,206
- Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. - Bibip...

527
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,252
(Mimi approaches Eun Ji when she's practicing.)

528
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:31,006
(She laughs at her face.)

529
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:34,616
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

530
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:36,616
- Bi... - No. It's "Bibbi."

531
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:38,915
(It's quite hard when you actually try it.)

532
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,416
I want to go home.

533
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:43,085
(You can go home after you catch Torong.)

534
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:44,355
- Is there no practice round? - A practice round.

535
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,386
Give it back.

536
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:47,302
(The nonpossessive nomad even loses the backpack.)

537
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,926
Why did that wench, Princess Yeong Seok become so catty?

538
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:51,595
"That wench?"

539
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:52,865
- It was for a skit. - "That wench?"

540
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,065
- I'm sorry. It was for a skit. - "That wench?"

541
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,135
It was for a skit.

542
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,405
- Princess Yeong Seok. - It was for a skit.

543
00:18:58,406 --> 00:19:00,576
(The 45-liter backpack is out.)

544
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:02,445
Plastic bags are better than this, right?

545
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:04,745
- That's what I think. - Right? Plastic bags are better.

546
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:06,545
We can use as many plastic bags as we want.

547
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,015
- We can take ten each. - We still have this option.

548
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,646
- You're right. - Let's go.

549
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:11,615
- We can do it. - The next one is the tarpaulin bag.

550
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:12,685
- The tarpaulin bag. - We need it.

551
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:13,985
- This one. - This time...

552
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,855
- It's a good one. Seriously. - We need it.

553
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:17,655
Mi Hyun, don't try to be funny.

554
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,126
- Go slow. - I've never tried to be funny.

555
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,795
(She feels victimized.)

556
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:23,395
- Seriously. - Not even once.

557
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,596
- Not even once. Never. - I've always been serious.

558
00:19:25,836 --> 00:19:26,836
Bibbidi...

559
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,165
Shall we give it a go? I prepared a keyword you're familiar with.

560
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,805
- It's a new word. - Let's go.

561
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:33,166
(A keyword they're familiar with?)

562
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:34,935
(Keyword: Su-su-su-supernova)

563
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:35,976
Here it is.

564
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,346
You can do it.

565
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:40,476
Su-su-su...

566
00:19:40,976 --> 00:19:41,976
It's okay.

567
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:43,446
It isn't bad. There are four Sus.

568
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,285
- Su-su-su... - Are you okay?

569
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,186
- Su-su-su-supernova. - Mimi.

570
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:50,686
Hands behind your back.

571
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:53,626
Get ready. Set, go.

572
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:57,196
- Su-su-su-supernova. - She's good.

573
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,835
- Su-su-su-supernova. - She's good.

574
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:01,965
- Su-su-supernova. - Wrong.

575
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,405
- Why? - There are four Sus.

576
00:20:03,406 --> 00:20:04,705
You said it three times. Su-su-su-su...

577
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:06,776
- It's okay. We have time. - Su-su-su-su-supernova

578
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,206
Wrong.

579
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,645
(She goes from 3 Sus to 5 Sus.)

580
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:10,775
(The one who said "Su" 5 times)

581
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:11,776
You got this.

582
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:16,016
Su-su-su-supernova.

583
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:18,346
Su-su-su-supernova.

584
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:20,816
Su-su-su-supernova.

585
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:24,185
- Su-su-su-supernova. - She's good.

586
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:27,556
Su-su-su-super...

587
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:29,526
Wrong.

588
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:30,926
(Super)

589
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:33,196
(It's a disaster.)

590
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,436
(She drops to the floor.)

591
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:39,536
(It surpasses the iron taste of the original song.)

592
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:41,506
Wrong.

593
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:44,106
(Mimi started a small nova.)

594
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:46,845
(This seal has a metal allergy.)

595
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,686
You still have a chance.

596
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:54,656
- Su... Su-su-su-supernova. - You still have a chance.

597
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:58,126
Su-su-su-supernova.

598
00:20:58,486 --> 00:21:01,356
Su-su-su-supernova.

599
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:04,295
Su-su-su-supernova.

600
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,365
- It was wrong. Wrong. - Why? Wasn't it correct?

601
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,565
- No. It should've been "Supernova." - Okay.

602
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,336
Supernova. No.

603
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:14,336
- Go, Mimi. - Su-su-su-supernova.

604
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:18,306
- Su-su-su-supernova. - There you go.

605
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:21,846
Su-su-su-supernova.

606
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:25,046
Su-su-su-supernova.

607
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:26,915
Su-su-su...

608
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,985
(Groaning)

609
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:29,986
Supernova.

610
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:34,196
Su-su-su-supernova.

611
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,065
Su... Hold on.

612
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:39,666
Su-su-su-supernova.

613
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:41,866
- Pass. - She did it.

614
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,136
(Sighing)

615
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:44,936
I'm exhausted.

616
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:47,536
Hurry up, Eun Ji.

617
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:49,916
- I'm exhausted. - Hurry up, Eun Ji.

618
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,846
(Eun Ji's first attempt)

619
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:53,046
Time's up.

620
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:58,516
(Mimi used 100 seconds all by herself.)

621
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:00,015
(Dejected)

622
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:02,656
- Time's up. - Hey.

623
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,956
- Time's up. - My goodness.

624
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:08,955
(Thanks for the new meme.)

625
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:10,526
(The large-sized tarpaulin bag is out.)

626
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,366
- I think Mimi got trained. - Supernova.

627
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,035
- Su... - Su...

628
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:17,905
- Su-su-su... - Su-su-su-supernova.

629
00:22:17,906 --> 00:22:19,705
- It's so hard. - Supernova.

630
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,906
I thought Mimi was underwater.

631
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:23,746
"Supernova."

632
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:27,446
- "Per." - "Pernova."

633
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:30,545
Would you let me use my hands?

634
00:22:30,546 --> 00:22:32,215
- No. - Just once.

635
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:35,415
Instead, I'll give you a good chance.

636
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,556
Okay.

637
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,256
- It'll be 1-way. - A 1-way event.

638
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:40,895
(Round 3, 23-liter backpack)

639
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,095
- It's one-way. It's over... - Shall I stand here?

640
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,125
- if Mimi succeeds in it. - I think it'll be better.

641
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:45,996
- One-way. - Let's begin. Here's the keyword.

642
00:22:46,096 --> 00:22:47,136
One, two, three.

643
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:48,935
- Abracadabra. - Okay.

644
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:49,965
Abracadabra.

645
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:51,335
- It's a good one. - Get ready.

646
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,575
(Round 3, Abracadabra)

647
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:54,275
- Hands behind your back. - Hands behind your back.

648
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:56,006
Get ready. Set, go.

649
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:59,576
Abracadabra.

650
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:02,545
Abracadabra.

651
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:04,285
- Abracadabra. - She's good.

652
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:06,785
Abracadabra.

653
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:07,786
Pass.

654
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:09,955
(The Perfect Pitch professor passes in 10 seconds.)

655
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:12,286
The previous one was easier. Hold on.

656
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:14,496
(Oh, my)

657
00:23:14,596 --> 00:23:16,166
(It's hard to start.)

658
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:21,166
Abracadabra.

659
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:24,696
(Making the difficult first attempt amidst the members' support)

660
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:29,906
Adabracadabra.

661
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,976
What was that? Wrong.

662
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:34,175
- I mean... - What was that?

663
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:41,715
Abracadabra.

664
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:43,626
- Abracadabra. - Correct.

665
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,055
- Abracadabra. - She's good.

666
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:47,056
No hands.
(No hands!)

667
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:49,565
(Once Eun Ji is told not to use her hands, )

668
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:53,236
(Yu Jin's hand rests on Eun Ji's back.)

669
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,506
- Abracadabra. - That's it.

670
00:23:56,706 --> 00:24:01,776
(She follows the professor's touches.)

671
00:24:01,836 --> 00:24:05,405
- Abracadabra. - Pass.

672
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:07,146
(She passes safely.)

673
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:08,616
A...

674
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:10,516
(Chuckling)
It's the low key, right?

675
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:14,756
Abracadabra.

676
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:21,756
Abracadabra.

677
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:25,126
(The soundless Abracadabra)

678
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:27,035
(Laughing)

679
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:30,036
(She plays the game diligently despite having no voice.)

680
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:32,836
(Yu Ae Sun and Yang Feisty)

681
00:24:33,136 --> 00:24:35,876
Abracadabra.

682
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:38,406
Abracadabra.

683
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:39,516
Pass.

684
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,875
- I can do it. - It's the last member.

685
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:44,085
- Mimi. - Abracadabra.

686
00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:46,115
- Well done. - Abracadabra.

687
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:51,025
Abracadabra.

688
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:52,325
Aca...

689
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:56,326
- Wrong. - My goodness.

690
00:24:56,426 --> 00:24:58,095
- That's... - You were so close.

691
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,596
I can do it now.

692
00:24:59,836 --> 00:25:02,096
Mimi, you did well.

693
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:03,205
- It was okay, right? - Yes.

694
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:04,742
I can do well as long as there are no repeating syllables.

695
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:07,205
- You'll succeed in it next time. - This is so funny.

696
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,975
- We can do it. - Is this out?

697
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:10,475
- We just need to speed up. - No.

698
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:11,775
- Is it this round? - The backpack is out, right?

699
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:12,875
(Yes.)

700
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:14,646
(The 23-liter backpack is out.)

701
00:25:14,816 --> 00:25:17,245
- What's the prize this time? - The gold bag.

702
00:25:17,246 --> 00:25:18,246
- The gold bag. - The gold bag.

703
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:19,585
- Is this round for the gold bag? - Yes, it is.

704
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:21,946
- I thought it was the last round. - You folded it already.

705
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:24,186
I'm ready to hand it back.

706
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,995
(Round 4, Gold tarpaulin bag)

707
00:25:25,996 --> 00:25:27,525
- And... - Yes?

708
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,266
- Yu Jin, you get a warning. - Why?

709
00:25:29,496 --> 00:25:31,665
- No tapping on the back. - I was just supporting her.

710
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:34,265
- No playing the piano on the back. - She was supporting me.

711
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,336
Tap on my back instead.

712
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:38,406
- What do you mean? - My back.

713
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:41,076
I told you that it was prohibited.

714
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:43,505
The order is okay, right?

715
00:25:43,506 --> 00:25:45,275
- Shall we have Mimi go first? - That's right.

716
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:47,276
- Young Ji is pretty good at it. - Yes.

717
00:25:47,376 --> 00:25:48,775
Keep going until you succeed in it.

718
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:50,186
- It's one-way. - Go slowly.

719
00:25:50,286 --> 00:25:51,345
Shall we begin?

720
00:25:51,346 --> 00:25:52,386
- We can do it. - Yes.

721
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:55,416
- Squishy beanie tofu face. - I can't pronounce it as it is!

722
00:25:55,616 --> 00:25:57,526
I can't pronounce it as it is!

723
00:25:58,326 --> 00:26:00,126
- You can do it. - You can do it.

724
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,955
- Just stay alert. You can do it. - You can do it.

725
00:26:01,956 --> 00:26:02,995
- Squishy... - You can do it.

726
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,765
There are no repeating syllables. Are you ready?

727
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:07,396
- Do as Yu Jin does. - Get ready. Set, go.

728
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,506
Squishy beanie tofu face.

729
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:21,645
Squishy beanie tofu face.

730
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:22,646
Correct!

731
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:24,769
Set, go.

732
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:38,848
Squishy beanie tofu face.

733
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:39,988
Correct!

734
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:41,718
Squishy beanie tofu face.

735
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:44,128
- Nice. - Squishy beanie tofu face.

736
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:46,228
Squishy beanie tofu face.

737
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,458
- Nice. - Squishy beanie tofu face.

738
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:54,598
Squishy beanie tofu face.

739
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,969
Good. Pass!

740
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:58,608
(Mimi can't believe it herself.)

741
00:26:58,609 --> 00:26:59,939
- Pass! - Ready.

742
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,079
Everyone, be quiet.

743
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,549
Squishy beanie tofu face.

744
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:07,118
Squishy beanie tofu face.

745
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,718
- Nice. - Squishy beanie tofu face.

746
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:24,298
Squishy beanie tofu face.

747
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:25,299
- Pass! - Correct!

748
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,939
Squishy beanie tofu face.

749
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:35,279
Squishy beanie tofu face.

750
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:38,578
Squishy beanie tofu face.

751
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:39,619
- Pass! - Correct!

752
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:41,978
(They succeeded within 71 seconds!)

753
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:43,089
Congratulations.

754
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,088
- Congratulations. - I prefer...

755
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:46,289
the plastic bags over this.

756
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:49,118
(The only upside to this one is that its pretty.)

757
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,159
Right.

758
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:53,129
Then we'll give you the plastic bags on the side.

759
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:55,158
- That sounds good. - Thank you.

760
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:56,199
Thank you.

761
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:59,938
Please disguise yourselves as backpackers.

762
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:01,038
That's not even a backpack.

763
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,038
(That's not a backpack and they can't even disguise it as one.)

764
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,808
(They each get a tarpaulin bag...)

765
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,638
(with plastic bags on the side.)

766
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:08,909
Some experienced backpackers...

767
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:11,108
actually travel with these too.

768
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:12,148
Like minimalist nomads?

769
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,348
- Thank you. - Yes, minimalist nomads.

770
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:14,749
- Thank you. - Something like this.

771
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:17,118
- At least they won't tear. - Right, they won't tear.

772
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,689
I think it makes you look rich too.

773
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:20,559
(It's over with self-justification.)

774
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,559
(Time to pack)

775
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:27,028
What are we supposed to pack?

776
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:29,899
I'm going to wear a hat today.

777
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:33,199
You didn't wash your hair, did you?

778
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:36,638
I washed it yesterday.

779
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:39,238
(I washed it yesterday.)

780
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:40,609
(Before they start packing, )

781
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,579
(let's get to know the bag better.)

782
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:47,979
(The beautiful golden bag...)

783
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:51,319
(is a laptop bag from Abu Dhabi.)

784
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,819
(Let's check out how much space there is.)

785
00:28:57,589 --> 00:28:59,428
(Plenty for a 5-person group project)

786
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:01,428
(The straps are strained.)

787
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:03,429
(Torong can't help but laugh.)

788
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:07,239
(Sweatsuits from "NANA bnb with SEVENTEEN" that airs on June 2)

789
00:29:07,699 --> 00:29:09,199
(Shoving them in)

790
00:29:09,939 --> 00:29:12,409
(A total of 3 NANA bnb sweatsuits can fit in the bag.)

791
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,079
(Let's go pack our bags.)

792
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:21,749
(Meticulous and efficient Mimi...)

793
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,149
(stacks everything neatly in the bag, )

794
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:26,719
(pressing it all down to fit as much as possible.)

795
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:34,099
(She even tied the straps to make sure nothing falls out.)

796
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,429
This is nice.

797
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:38,329
Why do you have that look on your face?

798
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:40,429
The bag is even smaller than I thought.

799
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,839
- Right? - It's too small.

800
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:44,538
- It's narrow, right? - The bag is really small.

801
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:45,869
How am I supposed to pack?

802
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:51,048
(First, she turns the inside-out clothes right side out.)

803
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:53,678
(Then she just throws everything in the bag.)

804
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,748
(Young Ji's personal belongings)

805
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:56,419
(Her bag is full.)

806
00:29:56,689 --> 00:29:57,889
- Also, - Yes?

807
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:00,318
- these plastic bags... - Yes.

808
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,659
Are a bit dirty.

809
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,558
We're reusing the plastic bags.

810
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,289
Still, we're supposed to pack our clothes in these.

811
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,898
(Eun Ji has already finished packing.)

812
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:10,928
Being on Earth Arcade...

813
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:12,399
only improved my packing skills.

814
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,038
Everyone's good at it, for sure.

815
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,268
- Your skills improve every day. - Right.

816
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:17,169
- It's so... - Right.

817
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,368
You, baby

818
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:21,739
(Childish Yu Jin loves to dress up to impress.)

819
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:24,749
- Isn't this cute? - What is it?

820
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,839
- Your makeup bag? - Strawberries.

821
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:29,118
You look cute today.

822
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,919
- What? - My shower products.

823
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:33,019
(Item 2: black toiletry bag)

824
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:36,289
And this is my heart.

825
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:37,929
Gen Z.

826
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:40,149
- It's our everything. - My everything.

827
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:41,529
It's your soul.

828
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:43,128
This is a must when dressing up.

829
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:44,129
It's your soul.

830
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:46,299
(Packing is complete.)

831
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,568
How are these backpacks?

832
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:48,838
- How are these backpacks? - Right.

833
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,138
We can't even wear it on our shoulders.

834
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,408
- Right. - You can't even go...

835
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:52,508
grocery shopping like this.

836
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:54,349
- We're grocery-bag travelers. - My arms hurt.

837
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:55,708
You said we had to be secretive,

838
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:57,829
- and yet you gave us flashy bags. - Watch your step.

839
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:00,349
We're grocery-bag travelers.

840
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:03,649
Wait, so are we saying goodbye to Abu Dhabi?

841
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,318
- Yes. - Not yet.

842
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,658
- What? - We're going to eat first,

843
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,558
but we won't be returning to this house.

844
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,188
- Bye, house. - Bye, house.

845
00:31:11,189 --> 00:31:12,688
(They're saying farewell to their Abu Dhabi house, )

846
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:15,629
(but they still have unfinished business.)

847
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:19,469
(Young Ji's cell phone issue)

848
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:21,438
(You'll be on digital detox...)

849
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,998
(for 70 hours.)

850
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:25,145
(She turned in her cell phone for approximately 3 days.)

851
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:31,849
(Dopamine addict Young Ji was always on her phone.)

852
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:38,589
(She's about 30 hours into her digital detox now.)

853
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:41,819
(Yesterday)

854
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:44,189
(I challenged him to a match.)

855
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:46,328
(If we're only making dry ramyeon, )

856
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:48,498
(I could beat Jae Yeong.)

857
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:52,368
(Young Ji requested a match with the production staff.)

858
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,598
(Version 2 of Young Ji versus the Production Staff)

859
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,668
(Making the best dry ramyeon)

860
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:57,009
(Introducing the chefs)

861
00:31:57,309 --> 00:31:59,009
(Chef 1: Lee Young Ji)

862
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:01,108
(Her spicy dry ramyeon cooking skills...)

863
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:03,079
(were already showcased last season.)

864
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:05,679
(Yum)

865
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:09,195
(She's the Buldak ramyeon maker of Earth Arcade.)

866
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,618
(Let's say I eat...)

867
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:12,325
(three meals a day, every day of the week.)

868
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,088
(I eat Buldak ramyeon for about 18 out of those 21 meals.)

869
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:15,158
(I'm being serious!)

870
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:17,759
(No one takes Buldak ramyeon more seriously than this chef does.)

871
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:19,688
(Her 24 years of life has been devoted solely to Buldak ramyeon.)

872
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,159
(Chef Lee Young Ji)

873
00:32:21,699 --> 00:32:24,099
(Chef 2: Choi Jae Yeong, who's been a writer for 24 years)

874
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,499
(The production staff has faith in his ramyeon cooking skills.)

875
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:30,585
(He was on the "Master of Ramyeon" episode of "Qualifications of Men.")

876
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:34,479
(His specialty is using ramyeon to create a new dish.)

877
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:36,549
(He's in charge of making...)

878
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:40,579
(all the Korean dishes on Earth Arcade.)

879
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:42,048
(I heard Producer Na and Writer Woo Jung...)

880
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:43,818
(had eaten a lot of ramyeon that Jae Yeong made.)

881
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:45,518
(About 3,000 times, I think.)

882
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,618
(The production staff have already acknowledged...)

883
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:47,895
(his cooking skills 3,000 times.)

884
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:48,919
(I'm not even joking, )

885
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,858
(but he's been making ramyeon since even before you were born.)

886
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:51,859
That's great.

887
00:32:52,229 --> 00:32:53,975
(An impressive career that's longer than 24 years)

888
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:56,059
(Young Ji, I've even made Happy Ramyeon.)

889
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:58,729
(This seasoned chef has been cooking ramyeon since 1982.)

890
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:00,468
(A ramyeon master with 24 years of experience in variety shows, )

891
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:02,369
(Chef Choi Jae Yeong)

892
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:05,708
(That's how Young Ji's suggestion suddenly led to...)

893
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:08,085
(the ramyeon making competition between Young Ji and Jae Yeong.)

894
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:10,709
(They're on their way to Lisbon. Today's competition...)

895
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:14,119
(will be held at a Korean restaurant near Abu Dhabi airport.)

896
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:17,088
(Quick setup complete)

897
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:19,819
(All ingredients and cookware are ready for the ramyeon match.)

898
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:21,419
Let's go.

899
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,618
(A chef is making a dramatic entrance.)

900
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:24,165
- Let's give her our strength. - Let's come together.

901
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:25,728
- Young Ji's pride is on the line. - Right.

902
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:26,899
I know how she feels.

903
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,999
(Laughing)

904
00:33:29,459 --> 00:33:30,468
- Gosh. - They're here.

905
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:31,928
(The match setup turned out more serious than expected.)

906
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,439
- This is amazing. - Are we...

907
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:35,669
- Gosh. - We didn't have to do all this,

908
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:39,269
but thankfully the restaurant gladly agreed to let us use this space.

909
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:42,639
- Thank you, restaurant. - Thank you.

910
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:44,449
I suddenly feel nervous.

911
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:46,508
Gosh, this is incredible.

912
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:47,648
(They enter the space with a heightened sense of tension.)

913
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:48,848
The total number of judges is...

914
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:50,749
- One, two, three, four, five, six. - Six.

915
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:53,488
- There are 6 judges. - You 3 will sit over here.

916
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,129
Who would have thought we'd be filming...

917
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:56,958
"Chef and My Fridge" in Abu Dhabi?

918
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,489
For fairness,

919
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:01,059
three of the production staff will be judging as well.

920
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:02,828
He majored in Food and Nutrition.

921
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:04,269
Marketing team leader, Lee Min Hwan.

922
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:07,138
Former military cook, Sound Supervisor Sun Woo.

923
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:08,845
(Former military cook, Sound Supervisor Kim Sun Woo)

924
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:11,168
(Lee Min Hwan, Kim Sun Woo)

925
00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:14,779
And Camera Director Chang Dae, known for being a Thinking type.

926
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,808
(Camera Director Lee Chang Dae, known for being a Thinking type.)

927
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:18,049
He's a Thinking type?

928
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:21,379
I have faith in Young Ji's cooking skills.

929
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:24,119
Once Chang Dae takes a bite of her ramyeon,

930
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:25,839
regardless of how indifferent he is...

931
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:27,688
(He will become full of emotions right away.)

932
00:34:27,689 --> 00:34:29,849
- That's how he'll behave? - This is how he'll behave.

933
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,859
We'll start off by introducing the chefs.

934
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:34,859
Lee Young Ji, step forward.

935
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,898
(Chef Lee Young Ji has devoted her whole life to Buldak ramyeon.)

936
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:40,399
- You got this! - Lee Young Ji!

937
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,039
- Lee Young Ji! - Lee Young Ji!

938
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:45,468
(Lee Young Ji)

939
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,538
- She is unable to speak right now. - Lee Young Ji!

940
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:48,539
Lee Young Ji.

941
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,309
If she wins this match,

942
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,509
we will allow her to skip...

943
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,679
the remaining hours of her digital detox...

944
00:34:55,779 --> 00:34:57,179
and give her phone back right away.

945
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:59,689
- She will be getting it back. - But if she loses,

946
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:01,689
another day will be added.

947
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:04,758
So keep that in mind.

948
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:07,119
Buldak ramyeon is the only thing I've eaten my entire life.

949
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:09,458
There's the saying,

950
00:35:09,459 --> 00:35:11,999
- "Passion beats talent." - Yes.

951
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:14,769
Well, devotion beats passion and I'm devoted to Buldak.

952
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:16,199
I really do eat it every day.

953
00:35:16,709 --> 00:35:19,009
All right. Going up against Lee Young Ji is...

954
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:21,279
the production team's secret weapon.

955
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:22,738
Writer Choi Jae Yeong.

956
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:24,478
(Chef Choi Jae Yeong is a master of all kinds of ramyeon.)

957
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:26,149
Oh, no.

958
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:29,179
- Choi Jae Yeong! - Choi Jae Yeong!

959
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:31,688
It's just cooking ramyeon.

960
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:34,689
Yesterday, I didn't really have the desire to win.

961
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:36,859
But on our way here, I started to want to win.

962
00:35:37,229 --> 00:35:38,229
(The tension is high.)

963
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,659
I'll do my best and win.

964
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:42,198
(Trying hard to look unfazed)

965
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,799
All right. Let me go over the rules.

966
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:46,739
(The time is limited to 15 minutes.)

967
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,769
- That's... - You can do this.

968
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:52,009
You can use those ingredients to cook.

969
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:53,708
(Olive oil, mayonnaise, sesame oil, )

970
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:55,508
(Buldak sauce, onions, canned corn, )

971
00:35:55,509 --> 00:35:57,155
(mozzarella cheese, string cheese, cheddar cheese, eggs.)

972
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:59,909
This is Young Ji's space, and that's Jae Yeong's space.

973
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:02,349
Once you're done cooking, bring it over...

974
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:04,489
- and ring the bell. - Got it.

975
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:06,418
The dish of the first one to do so...

976
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:08,589
will be the first dish the judges will taste.

977
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:11,829
- All right. - Do you have any preferences?

978
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,998
Personally, I...

979
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:16,428
- do love my noodles al dente. - I see.

980
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:17,568
How are you with spicy food?

981
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:21,239
I actually don't enjoy spicy food that much.

982
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:23,068
I happen to...

983
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:25,068
- crave something spicy right now. - I see.

984
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:26,908
Being spicy is the essence of dry spicy ramyeon.

985
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:28,338
I want the dish to be very spicy.

986
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:31,179
- You want it to be spicy. - Yes.

987
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:33,008
I prefer overcooked noodles.

988
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:34,479
Overcooked noodles.

989
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:36,618
I enjoy thick noodles.

990
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:38,449
I like them overcooked and mushy.

991
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:41,119
Please be careful about noodle texture.

992
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:44,158
- The judges should be objective. - Okay.

993
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,528
Are you two ready?

994
00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:46,689
- Yes. - Akh.

995
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:48,228
- When I say "Begin," - Akh.

996
00:36:48,229 --> 00:36:51,228
Grab your choice of ingredients and go to your counters.

997
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:52,269
Ready.

998
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,769
(Get ready.)

999
00:36:55,939 --> 00:36:57,209
Begin!

1000
00:36:57,309 --> 00:36:59,369
(The 15-minute ramyeon match has begun!)

1001
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,838
She's carrying the ingredients in her hands.

1002
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,185
(Chef Young Ji takes her ingredients right away.)

1003
00:37:03,209 --> 00:37:07,519
(Mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese, sesame oil, Buldak sauce)

1004
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:08,979
(Opening a bottle of water)

1005
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,789
(With a solemn look on her face, she pours the water into the pot.)

1006
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:16,159
(She then turns the stove to high heat.)

1007
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,529
(Showing off her gloves)

1008
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:22,299
(What is she doing now?)

1009
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:24,929
(Showing off her fake chopping skills)

1010
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:28,199
(She has nothing to do while waiting for the water to boil.)

1011
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:31,069
(Chef Lee Young Ji leaves her counter.)

1012
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:33,919
(It looks as if she's on her way to pick up more ingredients.)

1013
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:38,209
- She's being noisy. - She's keeping an eye on him.

1014
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:40,678
I don't think she has the time for that.

1015
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,748
She's saying Jae Yeong is nothing to worry about.

1016
00:37:41,749 --> 00:37:42,778
She's saying it’s not that serious.

1017
00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:44,219
(I'm the best one.)

1018
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:45,788
She has experience being on survival shows.

1019
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:47,158
- She has experience winning them. - That's right.

1020
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,518
She checked on him and he's not that impressive.

1021
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,719
(Showing off her gloves again)

1022
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:53,089
(She still keeps looking over at the neighboring kitchen.)

1023
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:54,759
She's not...

1024
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:57,369
He seems very busy.

1025
00:37:58,129 --> 00:38:01,139
(Keeping tabs on her competitor)

1026
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:03,739
(Meanwhile, in Chef Jae Yeong's kitchen)

1027
00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:05,408
(Jae Yeong's choice of ingredients)

1028
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,055
(Olive oil, an onion, cheddar cheese, eggs, mayonnaise)

1029
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,119
(He cuts up an onion, which Young Ji doesn't have.)

1030
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:11,079
He's stir-frying something.

1031
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:15,419
(Snapping his wrists)

1032
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,749
(Feeling nervous)

1033
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,729
(The ramyeon purist haven’t even brought the water to a boil yet.)

1034
00:38:23,529 --> 00:38:26,029
Stay calm.

1035
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:28,799
They have two totally different styles.

1036
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:32,799
There's something I'm looking forward to seeing from Jae Yeong.

1037
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:35,469
The word might be too advanced for you.

1038
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:37,238
- It's cuisson. - Cuisson?

1039
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,909
Cuisson. It means "doneness."

1040
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:41,778
He's very precise.

1041
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,255
(Chef Jae Yeong's noodles are perfect in cuisson.)

1042
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,408
Actually, what I consider to be the most important is...

1043
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:47,578
Well, I'm not sure...

1044
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:48,718
- if you'd know this term, but... - What is it?

1045
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,995
(Yu Jin imitates Yeong Seok immediately.)

1046
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:51,189
it's "soupiness."

1047
00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:53,418
- Soupiness. Yes. - Not too much,

1048
00:38:53,419 --> 00:38:55,088
- That's right. - and not too little.

1049
00:38:55,089 --> 00:38:56,188
There shouldn't be too much soup.

1050
00:38:56,189 --> 00:38:57,288
It should be moist at first,

1051
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:59,859
but you should also consider how the noodles absorb moisture.

1052
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:01,698
That's hard.

1053
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:03,568
- I'll be focusing on that. - Soupiness is important,

1054
00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:04,628
but for me, it's creaminess.

1055
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:07,168
People like their dry ramen either creamy or soupy.

1056
00:39:07,169 --> 00:39:08,169
Which one do you like?

1057
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,369
- I like mine more creamy. - I like mine soupy.

1058
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:12,169
Mine has to be overcooked and soupy.

1059
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,438
That's too hard.

1060
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,238
- Your preference is really hard. - Right. It has to be mushy.

1061
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,355
This competition is going to be really difficult to win.

1062
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:20,148
There can only be...

1063
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,395
- one master of ramyeon. - Master of ramyeon.

1064
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:22,419
Is it going to be Lee Young Ji?

1065
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,565
(Chef Lee Young Ji, the Buldak purist)

1066
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:24,918
Or is it going to be Writer Choi Jae Yeong?

1067
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,365
(Chef Jae Yeong, who creates all kinds of fusion ramyeon dish)

1068
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:28,619
- Yes. - Five minutes have passed.

1069
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:30,759
(Into the boiling water, )

1070
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:33,329
(Young Ji puts 2 noodles.)

1071
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,198
Right as we speak,

1072
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:37,699
Chef Lee Young Ji is cooking the noodles.

1073
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:41,099
(Solemn)

1074
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:43,839
(I'm a Buldak purist.)

1075
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:46,520
(Chef Young Ji is currently protecting her vocal chords.)

1076
00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:48,879
(After boiling for 3 minutes, she pours out the water.)

1077
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:51,349
(This much water should remain in the pot.)

1078
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:54,279
(Leave about 40ml of water in the pot.)

1079
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:58,119
(Putting in the Buldak sauce)

1080
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:00,459
(The key ingredient of Young Ji's Buldak dish)

1081
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:05,259
(Two fistfuls of mozzarella cheese)

1082
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:07,358
(She's practically putting on performance art.)

1083
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,899
(Adding a slice of cheddar cheese)

1084
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:13,269
Young Ji is not being stingy with the ingredients.

1085
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,439
Cheese?

1086
00:40:16,169 --> 00:40:18,038
Gosh, she's...

1087
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,809
I think she's saying it turned out perfect.

1088
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:22,579
(Will Chef Lee Young Ji's ramyeon turn out well?)

1089
00:40:22,779 --> 00:40:25,108
- Three minutes left. - Okay. I'll make it quick.

1090
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:27,179
Chef Lee Young Ji is almost done.

1091
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,555
(Chef Jae Yeong is also stepping up the pace.)

1092
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:32,019
(Leave in about 250ml of water to balance out the spiciness.)

1093
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:34,519
(Add stir-fried onions for a boost of sweet flavor, )

1094
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:36,549
(Buldak sauce, and two slices of cheddar cheese.)

1095
00:40:37,429 --> 00:40:40,759
(Jae Yeong's dish definitely looks different from Young Ji's.)

1096
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:42,858
Gosh, it smells so good in here. My mouth is watering.

1097
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:44,299
(10 seconds remain.)

1098
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:46,629
(Young Ji's finishing touch)

1099
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:49,039
(A drizzle of sesame oil)

1100
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:50,769
(Clapping)

1101
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,009
(Chef Young Ji is the one to finish first.)

1102
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:56,439
(Chef Jae Yeong is making a final burst of effort.)

1103
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:58,179
I'm done.

1104
00:40:58,509 --> 00:41:01,019
(Chef Jae Yeong's dish is also complete.)

1105
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:03,019
(The 15 minutes are over.)

1106
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,288
Hello, nice to meet you.

1107
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:06,289
(A former military cook, a Food and Nutrition major, )
(someone who is a Thinking type)

1108
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,059
Are there three of you?

1109
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:11,229
(A quick skit)

1110
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,529
There are three of us too.

1111
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:16,429
We're here for my friend's birthday.

1112
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,798
- We're having a serious discussion. - I see, a serious discussion.

1113
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:21,099
(Skit over)

1114
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:24,238
- The first dish is served. - Gosh.

1115
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,568
- It looks nice. - You each take a small portion...

1116
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:26,869
- and try it. - Okay.

1117
00:41:27,379 --> 00:41:29,038
(Young Ji preserved the original flavor of Buldak ramyeon, )

1118
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,125
(using mozzarella, cheddar, and just a touch of sesame oil.)

1119
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,878
- It looks good. - Goodness.

1120
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:34,278
- Check out this cheese pull. - This is amazing.

1121
00:41:34,279 --> 00:41:36,619
- Gosh. - She put a lot of cheese in this.

1122
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,389
It's definitely thick.

1123
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:40,188
(Eun Ji’s mouth is watering just from looking at it.)

1124
00:41:40,189 --> 00:41:41,689
Here you go.

1125
00:41:41,759 --> 00:41:43,689
Gosh, this smells great.

1126
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:46,829
(Mimi takes a bite of Young Ji’s ramyeon.)

1127
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:48,659
(The flavor is exquisite.)

1128
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,269
- It's so good. - Really?

1129
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:54,269
- Gosh. - Mimi loves it.

1130
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,845
(Yu Jin, who prefers her dry ramyeon a bit soupy, takes a bite too.)

1131
00:41:57,869 --> 00:41:59,239
(Yum!)

1132
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:01,909
The cheese makes the texture so creamy.

1133
00:42:03,009 --> 00:42:05,779
(It’s so good!)

1134
00:42:06,249 --> 00:42:08,278
(It’s perfectly thick and creamy, just the way Eun Ji likes it.)

1135
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:09,578
It's really good.

1136
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:11,088
The three of them have completely different preferences,

1137
00:42:11,089 --> 00:42:12,888
but they all look pleased.

1138
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:14,059
This is so good.

1139
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:16,319
I think Young Ji's cooking skills have upgraded.

1140
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:19,989
(The judges from the production team also try Young Ji's ramyeon.)

1141
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,498
(Min Hwan puts his major to use for the first time since college.)

1142
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:23,179
- Finally. - Are you good with spicy food?

1143
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:24,728
It's very spicy.

1144
00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:26,869
Chang Dae, turn the camera and film yourself eating.

1145
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:29,439
(A vlog-style angle)

1146
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,439
(He puts down the camera to focus on eating.)

1147
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:34,038
(Nodding in satisfaction)

1148
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:35,909
Min Hwan, do you like spicy ramyeon?

1149
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,249
Yes. Gosh.

1150
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:38,708
- This is good. - Isn't it?

1151
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:41,819
I usually can’t handle spicy ramyeon at all.

1152
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:44,648
But this is the kind of spiciness that's tasty...

1153
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:46,988
so that anyone can enjoy it, regardless of age.

1154
00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:49,658
Despite its spiciness, you still enjoyed it.

1155
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:52,428
Yes. And the cheese was layered...

1156
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:53,958
perfectly between the noodles,

1157
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:55,728
instead of being separated and clumped together.

1158
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:58,799
I've never met someone who's this good at describing taste.

1159
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:00,969
(Chef Young Ji is also pleased with Mimi's comment.)

1160
00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:02,899
All right. Yu Jin?

1161
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:05,208
First of all,

1162
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:07,739
I also thought it was very thick and creamy.

1163
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:10,809
The cheese masked the heat at first, so it didn’t seem that spicy.

1164
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:13,608
Once I swallowed the cheese,

1165
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:15,155
the spicy flavor slightly lingered in my mouth.

1166
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:17,118
That's how I would describe the taste.

1167
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,195
(Young Ji toned down the heat and appealed to a wider audience.)

1168
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:20,559
The cheese covers up the spiciness of the ramyeon...

1169
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:22,988
like a cotton-filled comforter.

1170
00:43:22,989 --> 00:43:24,758
So Young Ji's dish is like Mun Ik Jeom.

1171
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:26,058
It's like Mun Ik Jeom.

1172
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:27,858
- That's one way to describe it. - Okay.

1173
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:29,558
The flavor is beautifully balanced.

1174
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:32,268
The noodles were cooked just the way I liked them.

1175
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:34,239
- The doneness? - The cuisson?

1176
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:35,939
Adding sesame oil was a genius move.

1177
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:38,809
(The splash of sesame oil was a genius move.)

1178
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:40,879
Sun Woo, the former military cook.

1179
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:42,709
Personally,

1180
00:43:42,979 --> 00:43:44,539
the texture of the sauce was too thick.

1181
00:43:44,649 --> 00:43:46,655
(The former military cook gives his honest opinion.)

1182
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:48,278
When you make dry ramyeon,

1183
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:50,218
it should still have a little amount of broth...

1184
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:52,149
so that it's moist when you eat it.

1185
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:55,218
So you're saying that was a bit disappointing.

1186
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:57,888
I think the sauce had just the right thickness, though.

1187
00:43:57,889 --> 00:43:59,629
- So you liked it? - Yes.

1188
00:43:59,729 --> 00:44:03,729
If you use as much cheese as Young Ji did with this dish,

1189
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:06,169
the ramyeon could easily become too dry.

1190
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,898
But her timing in taking it off the heat was perfect.

1191
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,399
(It tastes perfectly fine to me.)

1192
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:12,608
- To begin with, thank you so much. - Okay.

1193
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:14,085
- I'd just like to say one thing. - Sure.

1194
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,079
This is the best ramyeon I've ever made.

1195
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:18,548
You surprised yourself with how good it turned out.

1196
00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:20,449
- I was very surprised. - All right.

1197
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:22,579
Rinse your mouths.

1198
00:44:22,849 --> 00:44:24,089
Rinse your mouth, Mimi.

1199
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:26,195
(Eun Ji welcomes Jae Yeong's dish ecstatically.)

1200
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:27,659
- Mimi, you try it first. - Gosh.

1201
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:29,189
Look at that mayonnaise.

1202
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,418
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1203
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:32,205
(Jae Yeong’s take on the dry ramyeon looks unfamiliar.)

1204
00:44:32,229 --> 00:44:34,759
(Candidate 2: Chef Jae Yeong’s ramyeon)

1205
00:44:34,999 --> 00:44:36,558
(The fusion ramyeon dish is a little soupy, )

1206
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:38,479
(with mayonnaise and an egg yolk placed on top.)

1207
00:44:38,729 --> 00:44:40,498
(The judges are going wild.)

1208
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:42,168
- Mayonnaise and an egg yolk. - Gosh.

1209
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:44,138
- It looks amazing. - This is insane.

1210
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,239
(All eyes are on Jae Yeong’s ramyeon.)

1211
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:49,378
Check out the look on Young Ji's face.

1212
00:44:49,379 --> 00:44:51,378
Chef, how should we eat this?

1213
00:44:51,379 --> 00:44:53,608
Mix the raw egg yolk and mayonnaise...

1214
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:55,348
- with the noodles and sauce. - This looks amazing.

1215
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:56,349
Okay.

1216
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,618
The thickness of this sauce is exactly how I like it.

1217
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:00,148
It's exactly how Yu Jin likes it.

1218
00:45:00,149 --> 00:45:02,489
There are stir-fried onions on the bottom of the bowl.

1219
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:04,088
You have to eat the onions with the noodles.

1220
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:05,459
- Got it. - I love onions.

1221
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:07,905
(Jae Yeong's ramyeon nailed Yu Jin’s taste preference twice.)

1222
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:09,629
Young Ji's throat must be dry.

1223
00:45:09,729 --> 00:45:10,898
Gosh, Young Ji.

1224
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:12,405
(Young Ji anxiously gulps down a bottle of water.)

1225
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:14,168
Gosh, this is like an elaborate dish.

1226
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,269
Gosh, look at these onions.

1227
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:16,799
She's shocked.

1228
00:45:18,269 --> 00:45:20,169
(How does it taste?)

1229
00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:22,079
It tastes so good.

1230
00:45:23,439 --> 00:45:25,349
(That is her honest reaction.)

1231
00:45:25,979 --> 00:45:27,919
(Yu Jin tries it too.)

1232
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:29,449
(Smiling)

1233
00:45:29,979 --> 00:45:31,149
(She can't hide her smile.)

1234
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:33,348
- Isn't it seriously good? - Yes.

1235
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:34,519
(Nodding)

1236
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:36,459
(Judge Eun Ji has a bite.)

1237
00:45:42,229 --> 00:45:44,109
(The incredible taste hits her twice in a row.)

1238
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:45,769
It's so delicious.

1239
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:47,999
- Really? - Yes.

1240
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:50,338
- Mimi is very objective, - This is so good.

1241
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:52,108
- and she said it was good. - My goodness.

1242
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:53,815
(The staff members are sending it praises too.)

1243
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,439
(Amazed)

1244
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:59,179
Young Ji stuck to the basic flavors of Buldak ramyeon...

1245
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:01,778
- and brought out the best in it. - Within the ramyeon itself.

1246
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:05,019
This Buldak ramyeon is a fusion dish.

1247
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:07,759
With this dish, you can go to Italy,

1248
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:10,258
Japan, and Korea.

1249
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:11,958
I don't know what to say. It's just so good.

1250
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:12,959
It was very good.

1251
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,729
You could enjoy the flavors of various cuisines.

1252
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:18,729
I really like tteokbokki.

1253
00:46:19,129 --> 00:46:22,768
- That's right. - It tastes like instant tteokbokki.

1254
00:46:22,769 --> 00:46:24,509
- That's right. - Yes, that was it.

1255
00:46:24,669 --> 00:46:26,139
Writer Jae Yeong's Buldak ramyeon...

1256
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,938
- tastes like Mom cooked it... - With love.

1257
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:30,609
- Mom cooked it with love... - Goodness.

1258
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:33,309
And made a special meal for me.

1259
00:46:33,379 --> 00:46:35,949
The ramyeon reminded her of her mom.

1260
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:38,819
(Feeling homesick in Abu Dhabi, a faraway land from home)

1261
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:40,789
Young Ji's Buldak ramyeon...

1262
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,259
felt like a same-aged boyfriend whom I fight with a lot.

1263
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:47,188
- But we are madly in love. - I see.

1264
00:46:47,189 --> 00:46:49,299
Writer Jae Yeong's Buldak ramyeon...

1265
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,429
reminds me of someone cute, adorable, soft, and sweet...

1266
00:46:53,899 --> 00:46:56,768
who hugs me and says, "You worked hard today."

1267
00:46:56,769 --> 00:46:58,769
It's like a younger boyfriend.

1268
00:47:00,139 --> 00:47:01,639
I think it feels that way...

1269
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:04,479
because of the onion. It gives the dish a kick.

1270
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:06,949
It enhances the sweetness.

1271
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:08,749
I'm so moved.

1272
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:09,879
You're moved.

1273
00:47:09,979 --> 00:47:11,488
- The ramyeon moved you. - It moved me.

1274
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:12,489
(Meanwhile, someone is trembling in worry in a corner.)

1275
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:15,259
Young Ji, stop eating.

1276
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,788
We don't have the results yet.

1277
00:47:17,789 --> 00:47:21,259
It was the perfect thickness and doneness for me.

1278
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:22,459
It was very good.

1279
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,528
(Continued praises)

1280
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:26,929
It was the best Buldak ramyeon I'd ever had.

1281
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:31,239
(The final comment that seals the deal)

1282
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:36,278
Okay. Now, we'll start voting secretly.

1283
00:47:36,279 --> 00:47:37,648
(They start voting secretly.)

1284
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,279
Write your name.

1285
00:47:39,749 --> 00:47:41,449
If you support Young Ji, write "Young."

1286
00:47:41,949 --> 00:47:43,549
If you support Jae Yeong, write "Jae."

1287
00:47:43,979 --> 00:47:45,048
Please vote.

1288
00:47:45,049 --> 00:47:46,619
(They start voting.)

1289
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:49,819
(The two dishes were completely different.)

1290
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:54,029
(Which of the two dishes won the judges' hearts?)

1291
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:57,098
(The staff members vote seriously too.)

1292
00:47:57,099 --> 00:47:58,099
Fold it?

1293
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:00,598
For someone, this match was for fun.

1294
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,769
But for someone, this match will decide her fate.

1295
00:48:03,439 --> 00:48:06,069
Young Ji is already shedding tears.

1296
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:08,515
I will announce the voting results.

1297
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,579
- Okay. - The first vote.

1298
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,279
(Revealing the first vote)

1299
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:15,049
(The first vote goes to...)

1300
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:17,149
- Writer Jae Yeong. - Thank you.

1301
00:48:18,249 --> 00:48:19,729
I think that was Lee Min Hwan's vote.

1302
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:21,658
Next.

1303
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:22,659
(Slightly nervous)

1304
00:48:22,889 --> 00:48:25,288
(Revealing the second vote)

1305
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:26,289
The second vote.

1306
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:28,929
- Oh, dear. - "Young."

1307
00:48:29,529 --> 00:48:30,529
(Chef Jae Yeong 1, Chef Young Ji 1)

1308
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:32,869
It's Young Ji. "Young" is for Young Ji.

1309
00:48:33,299 --> 00:48:34,339
It's 1 to 1.

1310
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:37,568
Why are you crying already?

1311
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:39,385
(She's feeling a lot more pressure than she thought.)

1312
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:40,409
"Jae!"

1313
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,379
(Chef Jae Yeong 2, Chef Young Ji 1)

1314
00:48:42,779 --> 00:48:43,779
"Jae."

1315
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,180
(Chef Jae Yeong 3, Chef Young Ji 1)

1316
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:46,678
(Chef Jae Yeong gets two votes consecutively.)

1317
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:48,279
- With just one more vote... - One more.

1318
00:48:48,379 --> 00:48:50,048
- Young Ji. - Oh, no.

1319
00:48:50,049 --> 00:48:51,548
- Her palms are sweaty. - It's okay.

1320
00:48:51,549 --> 00:48:53,249
Her palms are sweaty.

1321
00:48:55,219 --> 00:48:57,500
(The match is so intense that it makes her palms sweaty.)

1322
00:48:57,659 --> 00:48:59,859
(What will Young Ji's fate be?)

1323
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:02,080
- Young Ji. - Oh, no.

1324
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:03,650
- Her palms are sweaty. - It's okay.

1325
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:05,451
Her palms are sweaty.

1326
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:09,572
(The match is so intense that it makes her palms sweaty.)

1327
00:49:09,661 --> 00:49:11,930
(What will Young Ji's fate be?)

1328
00:49:11,931 --> 00:49:13,291
- No. - Jae Yeong!

1329
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,400
How many votes have we checked so far?

1330
00:49:16,401 --> 00:49:17,530
- Four... - It's four to...

1331
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:18,931
(That means...)

1332
00:49:19,431 --> 00:49:21,401
(the winner has been decided.)

1333
00:49:21,571 --> 00:49:23,141
The last vote is "Young."

1334
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:25,771
(Chef Jae Yeong 4, Chef Young Ji 2)

1335
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:28,711
But the final result is...

1336
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:31,951
With a score of 4 to 2...

1337
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:34,851
(Bowing their heads)

1338
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:36,821
Writer Choi Jae Yeong wins.

1339
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,621
And Young Ji...

1340
00:49:43,321 --> 00:49:46,261
We'll keep Young Ji's phone with us...

1341
00:49:47,091 --> 00:49:50,000
- for one more day. - Hey.

1342
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:51,001
Hey.

1343
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:53,431
Young Ji.

1344
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:56,741
The score of 4 to 2...

1345
00:49:58,071 --> 00:50:02,741
means 1 out of the 3 betrayed you.

1346
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:04,810
It's not me, I swear.

1347
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:06,780
That has to be the case.

1348
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:08,920
- I'll remove the evidence. - It's not me.

1349
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:09,921
Get rid of it.

1350
00:50:10,121 --> 00:50:11,790
Poor you.

1351
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:13,450
- For an additional day, - How did this happen?

1352
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:15,020
Enjoy your digital detox.

1353
00:50:15,021 --> 00:50:16,120
Thank you.

1354
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:17,590
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1355
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:19,031
(The cooking match ends.)

1356
00:50:19,261 --> 00:50:21,101
(But there still remains an unsolved mystery.)

1357
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:22,500
(Young Ji sets out to find the traitor.)

1358
00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:26,331
I can't show you this. Out of the three...

1359
00:50:26,531 --> 00:50:28,541
I think I know...

1360
00:50:29,471 --> 00:50:30,591
who picked Writer Jae Yeong.

1361
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:34,340
If you guess it right, I'll deduct half a day of your penalty!

1362
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:36,310
- That's good. - Nice.

1363
00:50:36,311 --> 00:50:37,951
(Producer Na's shocking suggestion)

1364
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:41,321
(There's a traitor out of the three?)

1365
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:46,290
- I think the traitor is... - Yes.

1366
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:48,220
- Yes. - Should I say...

1367
00:50:48,221 --> 00:50:49,921
her full name?

1368
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:52,890
- The full name. - She uses my game console the most.

1369
00:50:52,891 --> 00:50:55,660
- Yes. - She uses me as ChatGPT.

1370
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:56,761
- Yes. - She deceives me,

1371
00:50:57,131 --> 00:50:59,400
toys me around, and makes things happen.

1372
00:50:59,401 --> 00:51:02,070
- Stress... - But she took more...

1373
00:51:02,071 --> 00:51:04,101
of Writer Jae Yeong's onions.

1374
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:07,711
She is a year younger than me and was born on September 1, 2003.

1375
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:09,941
An Yu Jin is the traitor.

1376
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:13,710
Is Young Ji right?

1377
00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:14,920
(She selects An Yu Jin as the traitor.)

1378
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:18,421
If you're right, I'll deduct half a day of your penalty.

1379
00:51:19,691 --> 00:51:20,691
Young Ji.

1380
00:51:22,921 --> 00:51:27,291
Congratulations, you're right.

1381
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:32,131
- Lee Young Ji. - Lee Young Ji.

1382
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:35,240
- Lee Young Ji. - Lee Young Ji.

1383
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:37,241
- You must feel so happy. - Lee Young Ji.

1384
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:39,971
- But I have something to say. - You have something to say.

1385
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:41,180
I have something to say too.

1386
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,310
I actually thought I should pick Young Ji...

1387
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:44,357
- when I first ate hers. - You thought.

1388
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:46,280
But when I tried Writer Jae Yeong's ramyeon,

1389
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:48,181
I had this thought.

1390
00:51:48,581 --> 00:51:51,121
I'm so envious of Writer Jae Yeong's family.

1391
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:53,190
(The highest praise she can give)

1392
00:51:53,191 --> 00:51:54,191
This ramyeon...

1393
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:56,990
They can eat it when they want to.

1394
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:58,691
Not just this ramyeon.

1395
00:51:59,261 --> 00:52:02,501
Yu Jin is walking on eggshells now. Look at her face.

1396
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:05,877
(Anyway, 12 hours is deducted from Young Ji's digital detox hours.)

1397
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:08,600
- She's not looking at your heart. - She won't accept it.

1398
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:09,601
(Young Ji's digital detox hours, 52 hours)

1399
00:52:09,602 --> 00:52:10,900
She won't accept it.

1400
00:52:10,901 --> 00:52:13,771
- I love you, Lee Young Ji. - I love you, Lee Young Ji.

1401
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:17,110
- I... - Fair-skinned Lee Young Ji.

1402
00:52:17,111 --> 00:52:21,221
Tonight, I will serve another deity.

1403
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:25,451
What changes happen to a human body...

1404
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,861
if digital detox becomes too long?

1405
00:52:29,391 --> 00:52:31,391
I'll show you today.

1406
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:33,791
Look at her.

1407
00:52:34,261 --> 00:52:36,501
We'll all die at this rate.

1408
00:52:36,601 --> 00:52:38,131
We'll all die.

1409
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:40,830
(People wish to go here...)

1410
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,900
(before they die.)

1411
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:44,810
(A backpacking trip to Lisbon)

1412
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,240
(It starts now.)

1413
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:47,241
Shall we go?

1414
00:52:47,341 --> 00:52:48,440
- Let's go. - It's done.

1415
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:49,941
You look like backpackers.

1416
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:52,111
Although you don't have backpacks.

1417
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,411
We look like we're going to a nearby toll.

1418
00:52:55,221 --> 00:52:56,421
- A toll? - Yes.

1419
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:58,421
Do you mean a stroll, not a toll?

1420
00:52:58,891 --> 00:52:59,891
A stroll.

1421
00:53:00,821 --> 00:53:02,160
We're going to Lisbon.

1422
00:53:02,161 --> 00:53:04,091
(Their airport fashion will hit Lisbon hard.)

1423
00:53:04,531 --> 00:53:06,991
You look like you're going to a clothes wholesale market.

1424
00:53:07,091 --> 00:53:08,411
It's the Chatuchak market, right?

1425
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:10,700
(They're not going to a clothes wholesale market.)

1426
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:12,830
(They're on their way to catch Torong!)

1427
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,800
(Abu Dhabi)

1428
00:53:14,801 --> 00:53:18,041
(Lisbon)

1429
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:23,581
(At the western end of Europe)

1430
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:28,981
(A romantic city)

1431
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:34,391
(Lisbon)

1432
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:45,201
(Many people pick Lisbon as the best trip location.)

1433
00:53:48,401 --> 00:53:51,341
(The romantic city vibe)

1434
00:53:55,441 --> 00:54:00,051
(Lovers visit the place naturally.)

1435
00:54:02,151 --> 00:54:06,491
(Yellow flowers that bloomed in an oven)

1436
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:14,491
(The home of egg tarts)

1437
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:22,141
(As a port city, it is well-known for its seafood dishes.)

1438
00:54:25,371 --> 00:54:29,811
(They have amazing tender octopus dishes.)

1439
00:54:33,611 --> 00:54:36,921
(Adorable alleys decorated with tiles)

1440
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:41,021
(Even the streets are covered in tiles.)

1441
00:54:42,091 --> 00:54:44,731
(It feels like you're walking on an artwork.)

1442
00:54:46,661 --> 00:54:50,701
(Welcome to Lisbon.)

1443
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:53,371
(At 7am, they arrive in Lisbon.)

1444
00:54:53,571 --> 00:54:54,670
- Pretend to be backpackers. - Don't greet them.

1445
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:55,770
- We're backpacking. - I almost said hi.

1446
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:56,940
We are backpackers.

1447
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:58,970
There are fans welcoming us...

1448
00:54:58,971 --> 00:55:00,110
in front.

1449
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:01,710
They are actually welcoming us.

1450
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:02,711
- In front there. - Who?

1451
00:55:02,712 --> 00:55:04,381
- In front there. - Our fans.

1452
00:55:04,711 --> 00:55:06,880
- Mr. Chang Dae. - Chang Dae.

1453
00:55:06,881 --> 00:55:08,680
- Chang Dae. - Chang Dae and his team.

1454
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,981
(The fans were waiting for the agents.)

1455
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:14,350
Director, don't we look like normal backpackers?

1456
00:55:14,351 --> 00:55:16,337
- No, it doesn't show. - You can't tell we're agents?

1457
00:55:16,361 --> 00:55:18,331
(They look like backpackers in every aspect!)

1458
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:21,500
At this rate, I think we want people to notice us.

1459
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:23,031
(They get in the car.)

1460
00:55:23,231 --> 00:55:24,460
Where are we at?

1461
00:55:24,461 --> 00:55:25,700
- Lisbon. - Lisbon.

1462
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:27,770
You've successfully infiltrated Lisbon.

1463
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:28,771
Congratulations.
(Applauding to celebrate)

1464
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:32,010
(Cheering)

1465
00:55:32,011 --> 00:55:33,210
- Yes. - The place Torong left...

1466
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:34,371
his first trace. Where is it?

1467
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,181
- The egg tart shop. - The egg tart shop.

1468
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:38,150
(A few minutes ago)

1469
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:39,280
(Gold coffee recipe? I got it.)

1470
00:55:39,281 --> 00:55:41,110
(With the egg tart recipe, I'll become the king of desserts.)

1471
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:42,951
(The agents checked Torong's Instagram story.)

1472
00:55:43,251 --> 00:55:44,551
Based on his Instagram post,

1473
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:46,627
- he is interested in the recipes. - That's right.

1474
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:48,891
I think he wants to set up his own business.

1475
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:51,260
He thinks he is too good...

1476
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:54,290
to be working part-time at the rice cake shop,

1477
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:55,500
so he has decided to start his own business.

1478
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:58,531
Hold on. Wasn't Cheol Yong's dream to start his own business?

1479
00:55:58,701 --> 00:55:59,821
- Cheol Yong's dream? - Yes.

1480
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,230
His Instagram bio.

1481
00:56:01,231 --> 00:56:03,440
Cheol Yong follows a lot of...

1482
00:56:03,441 --> 00:56:04,770
dessert cafe accounts.

1483
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:06,910
They're in the same boat.

1484
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,080
- Those two... - So Torong...

1485
00:56:08,081 --> 00:56:09,140
- wants to start a business... - Exactly.

1486
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:10,240
- with Cheol Yong, right? - Yes. Those two...

1487
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,080
Jade Emperor taught him everything,

1488
00:56:12,081 --> 00:56:13,880
and now he wants to open a dessert cafe on his own.

1489
00:56:13,881 --> 00:56:15,120
That's what happens when their ego gets too big.

1490
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,480
- You shouldn't take in people... - He isn't grateful at all.

1491
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:18,220
- who won't be grateful. - Yes. He's not even human.

1492
00:56:18,221 --> 00:56:19,290
He's an animal.

1493
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:20,450
He isn't even human.

1494
00:56:20,451 --> 00:56:21,920
That's right. He's an animal,

1495
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:22,961
- not human. - Exactly.

1496
00:56:23,661 --> 00:56:25,830
(What...)

1497
00:56:25,831 --> 00:56:28,601
(is Torong planning?)

1498
00:56:29,061 --> 00:56:31,300
(Let's go and check.)

1499
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:34,371
(From Lisbon Airport to the egg tart shop)

1500
00:56:34,631 --> 00:56:35,877
- Producer Na. - What a nice weather.

1501
00:56:35,901 --> 00:56:38,740
As we film more seasons, you're getting tired of us, right?

1502
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:40,110
No, not at all. I love you all.

1503
00:56:40,111 --> 00:56:41,540
- I can feel the level of affection. - My love grows more and more.

1504
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:43,510
- Yes, you don't like us that much. - You don't like us anymore.

1505
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:44,511
- Seriously. - That's right.

1506
00:56:44,512 --> 00:56:46,280
When I pose in front of him, he says,

1507
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:48,580
- "What do you want?" - My goodness.

1508
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:49,721
That's what he says.

1509
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,650
- Princess Yeong Seok, I'm upset. - You got it wrong.

1510
00:56:52,651 --> 00:56:54,521
You get a room far away from ours.

1511
00:56:54,621 --> 00:56:56,590
- You guys are funny. - He used to stay close.

1512
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:58,307
- Stay next room. - He used to stay in the next room.

1513
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,230
I never thought about such a thing.

1514
00:57:00,231 --> 00:57:01,930
Princess Yeong Seok, the way you speak is very annoying.

1515
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:02,931
(Laughing)

1516
00:57:02,932 --> 00:57:05,830
Princess Yeong Seok doesn't visit us when we're having fun.

1517
00:57:05,831 --> 00:57:07,831
- He used to stop by to see us. - Exactly.

1518
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:10,240
Exactly. "How are you guys feeling?"

1519
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:12,010
- You used to ask us that. - That's right.

1520
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,311
Now, you're busy looking after yourself.

1521
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:15,540
- Yes. - If I say this,

1522
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:16,781
you guys might cry.

1523
00:57:16,941 --> 00:57:18,511
- What is it? Say it. - What?

1524
00:57:19,581 --> 00:57:20,880
- I... - Yes.

1525
00:57:20,881 --> 00:57:22,161
- No, I'll stop here. - Come on.

1526
00:57:22,651 --> 00:57:23,821
It turns out that...

1527
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:26,620
Princess Hyun Yong...

1528
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:27,891
Queen Hyun Yong, not Princess.

1529
00:57:29,691 --> 00:57:30,861
He is the queen.

1530
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:33,830
He told me not to go near your room.

1531
00:57:33,831 --> 00:57:35,130
What the heck?

1532
00:57:35,131 --> 00:57:36,901
- That's so shocking. - No wonder.

1533
00:57:37,061 --> 00:57:38,301
(It's terrible.)

1534
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:39,511
- Oh, dear. - Hyun Yong...

1535
00:57:39,771 --> 00:57:41,170
- Queen Hyun Yong. - Oh, dear.

1536
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:43,270
- Look after Princess Yeong Seok. - Exactly.

1537
00:57:43,271 --> 00:57:44,871
- Thank you. - It's nothing.

1538
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:47,970
I didn't expect you to be this supportive.

1539
00:57:47,971 --> 00:57:49,940
- "Supportive." - "Supportive."

1540
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:51,727
(Don't lose to Queen Hyun Yong, Princess Yeong Seok!)

1541
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:55,120
Princesses. Let's do some shopping in Lisbon.

1542
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:56,121
Yes, let's do that.

1543
00:57:56,122 --> 00:57:57,280
(Showing off her wealth with gold jewelry)

1544
00:57:57,281 --> 00:58:01,320
- Princesses. - Yes?

1545
00:58:01,321 --> 00:58:02,461
- Princesses. - Say it.

1546
00:58:02,661 --> 00:58:03,760
It's an echo.

1547
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:05,360
- Don't you know this? - What is it?

1548
00:58:05,361 --> 00:58:06,530
- Is it a meme? - As a princess,

1549
00:58:06,531 --> 00:58:08,060
you should know this challenge.

1550
00:58:08,061 --> 00:58:09,061
Oh, dear.

1551
00:58:09,062 --> 00:58:11,260
Princesses. I challenge you to a duel.

1552
00:58:11,261 --> 00:58:12,530
- I know that. - I know.

1553
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:13,601
What's that?

1554
00:58:14,131 --> 00:58:15,170
(One woman clearly has no idea what it is.)

1555
00:58:15,171 --> 00:58:16,731
Don't you know this, Princess Young Ji?

1556
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:19,841
I don't think the princess theme fits me well.

1557
00:58:19,911 --> 00:58:21,371
(A setting error)

1558
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:23,111
- I'll be a colonel. - Colonel.

1559
00:58:23,511 --> 00:58:24,681
What about a warrior guard?

1560
00:58:24,811 --> 00:58:26,151
- A warrior guard? - Yes.

1561
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:28,080
- I'm confident in it. - I like your tone.

1562
00:58:28,081 --> 00:58:29,551
- That's good. - Thank you.

1563
00:58:29,951 --> 00:58:32,220
So Mimi, do you want to be a princess...

1564
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:33,550
or a warrior?

1565
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,750
You must make up your mind.

1566
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:36,290
- It's hard to choose. - Is it?

1567
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:37,420
- Choose for me. - Mimi, why don't you...

1568
00:58:37,421 --> 00:58:39,290
just become a parrot that sits on a princess' shoulder?

1569
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:40,291
A parrot.

1570
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:41,800
- A parrot. - I like that.

1571
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:43,630
A parrot who always...

1572
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:44,900
- stays with us? - Yes.

1573
00:58:44,901 --> 00:58:46,301
The princesses are so outspoken.

1574
00:58:46,531 --> 00:58:50,741
(Earth Arcade Palace)

1575
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:54,111
Warrior Young Ji. Is there water behind?

1576
00:58:54,311 --> 00:58:55,540
Yes, there is, Your Highness.

1577
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:57,011
(Serving it right away)

1578
00:58:57,341 --> 00:58:59,111
- Goodness. - Here you go.

1579
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,031
- Thank you, Warrior Young Ji. - You're amazing, Young Ji.

1580
00:59:02,281 --> 00:59:04,221
- Warrior Young Ji. - Did you call for me?

1581
00:59:04,351 --> 00:59:06,390
Why do people in Lisbon keep chuckling...

1582
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:08,320
whenever they see me?

1583
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:10,021
Because you...

1584
00:59:11,091 --> 00:59:12,391
You... What did you say?

1585
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:16,301
You keep asking too much from me.

1586
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:18,801
- Warrior Young Ji. - Did you call for me?

1587
00:59:19,131 --> 00:59:20,970
I'm hungry. How long do we need to go?

1588
00:59:20,971 --> 00:59:22,901
I think about seven minutes.

1589
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:24,910
The deity I serve is time-related.

1590
00:59:24,911 --> 00:59:26,431
- So I can tell. - Hold on. You think?

1591
00:59:26,641 --> 00:59:28,980
Are you going to do your job based on how you feel?

1592
00:59:28,981 --> 00:59:30,981
I apologize, Your Highness. I do not have a phone.

1593
00:59:31,181 --> 00:59:32,911
- I... - I do not have a phone.

1594
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:35,121
What do you think, Parrot?

1595
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,051
She isn't qualified.

1596
00:59:37,421 --> 00:59:38,920
- The parrot... - The parrot...

1597
00:59:38,921 --> 00:59:40,151
Acting as a parrot...

1598
00:59:40,321 --> 00:59:42,290
Isn't acting as a parrot way too hard?

1599
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:43,860
- It's hard. - We gave her a hard role.

1600
00:59:43,861 --> 00:59:44,861
To someone like me...

1601
00:59:44,862 --> 00:59:46,231
Flap your wings.

1602
00:59:46,691 --> 00:59:48,191
(She strictly sticks to her role.)

1603
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:50,301
There's a club on your left.

1604
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:54,070
(The youngest princess is at the wrong address.)

1605
00:59:54,071 --> 00:59:55,470
I like hip-hop clubs.

1606
00:59:55,471 --> 00:59:57,700
I don't like clubs that play EDM.

1607
00:59:57,701 --> 00:59:59,710
How can you go to clubs when you're a princess?

1608
00:59:59,711 --> 01:00:01,681
What do you mean? I party every night.

1609
01:00:02,281 --> 01:00:03,481
But not a club.

1610
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:05,581
Warrior Young Ji, be honest.

1611
01:00:05,911 --> 01:00:07,680
- I am being honest. - Honestly, Warrior Young Ji,

1612
01:00:07,681 --> 01:00:09,721
- Honestly, how can a princess... - do you love me?

1613
01:00:11,621 --> 01:00:13,151
Your Highness, this won't do.

1614
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:15,497
(It turns out their relationship is something special.)

1615
01:00:15,521 --> 01:00:16,821
You shouldn't do this.

1616
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:20,060
Stop coming to my room every night.

1617
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:22,760
I just went to check if you were sleeping well.

1618
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:24,000
You barge in even when...

1619
01:00:24,001 --> 01:00:25,401
- I am showering. - No, that's...

1620
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:27,471
- That is when I... - Your Highness..

1621
01:00:28,001 --> 01:00:29,340
Living a debaucherous life is fine,

1622
01:00:29,341 --> 01:00:30,671
but I don't want to be involved.

1623
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:32,740
(Their story is rather intense.)

1624
01:00:32,741 --> 01:00:34,271
Must I protect my dignity...

1625
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:37,311
or my feelings for you?

1626
01:00:38,111 --> 01:00:39,111
Your Highness.

1627
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:41,921
There are a lot of people here.

1628
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:46,990
- You are very professional. - Wasn't that sweet?

1629
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:49,120
It was. You made me feel fluttered.

1630
01:00:49,121 --> 01:00:50,461
It's because you are pretty.

1631
01:00:51,021 --> 01:00:52,060
What?

1632
01:00:52,061 --> 01:00:53,431
(Singing)

1633
01:00:54,361 --> 01:01:01,900
(Sponsored by Space Rice Cake Shop)

1634
01:01:01,901 --> 01:01:03,440
("Princess's Warrior")

1635
01:01:03,441 --> 01:01:05,487
(Two things to protect. Her and my feelings for her.)

1636
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:09,681
(For your information, we are headed to the egg tart shop.)

1637
01:01:10,011 --> 01:01:11,440
Isn't the view so pretty?

1638
01:01:11,441 --> 01:01:13,610
- Look at the left. - It's so pretty.

1639
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:14,711
This is so nice.

1640
01:01:15,021 --> 01:01:16,580
It has a bit of a "Begin Again" vibe.

1641
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:18,051
(Excited)

1642
01:01:18,251 --> 01:01:19,890
(She cannot take her eyes off.)

1643
01:01:19,891 --> 01:01:22,421
On your left is the famous Commerce Square.

1644
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:24,190
It's Commerce Square.

1645
01:01:24,191 --> 01:01:25,360
It's pretty. I want to get out.

1646
01:01:25,361 --> 01:01:26,390
- Can we get out? - Let's get out.

1647
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,111
- Let's get out. - Can we stop for a while?

1648
01:01:28,861 --> 01:01:30,230
(Commerce Square is one of Lisbon's major landmarks.)

1649
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:31,711
(It is the biggest square in Lisbon.)

1650
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,970
(The statue goes very well...)

1651
01:01:36,971 --> 01:01:39,570
(with Rua Augusta Arch.)

1652
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:40,740
You can see the sea.

1653
01:01:40,741 --> 01:01:42,180
- It's so pretty. - That's not a sea.

1654
01:01:42,181 --> 01:01:43,181
It's connected to...
- the North Atlantic. - It's so pretty.

1655
01:01:44,182 --> 01:01:45,450
It's the Tagus River.

1656
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,050
It's not a sea? I got it all wrong.

1657
01:01:47,051 --> 01:01:48,931
It must be nice to know everything on your own.

1658
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:51,080
(A meaningless fight for dominance)

1659
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:52,690
Every street here is pretty.

1660
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:53,691
- Right? - Yes.

1661
01:01:53,692 --> 01:01:54,890
It's not too much either.

1662
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:56,260
If they go overboard with it,

1663
01:01:56,261 --> 01:01:58,137
- it looks a bit too much. - It becomes too much.

1664
01:01:58,161 --> 01:01:59,330
It's just nice.

1665
01:01:59,331 --> 01:02:01,067
(The streets themselves make Lisbon attractive.)

1666
01:02:01,091 --> 01:02:03,661
(Princess Yeong Seok loves it.)

1667
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,301
I want to fall in love in Lisbon.

1668
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:08,081
This really is a place for that.

1669
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:11,041
- Right? - It's famous for trams too.

1670
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:12,210
- Trama? - Tram.

1671
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:14,640
- Tram. - That train-like thing.

1672
01:02:14,641 --> 01:02:16,641
- Yes. - You can get on it...

1673
01:02:16,711 --> 01:02:19,651
and go to various pretty corners.

1674
01:02:19,711 --> 01:02:21,110
It's so nice.

1675
01:02:21,111 --> 01:02:22,450
(Trams transport Lisbon's daily lives.)

1676
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:23,581
The tram is so pretty.

1677
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:27,221
In front there... The cathedral-like building also...

1678
01:02:27,551 --> 01:02:29,021
It's so pretty.

1679
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:31,831
It's the Monastery of the Hieronymites.

1680
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:33,290
- It's crazy. - It's Gothic architecture...

1681
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,261
listed as a World Cultural Heritage.

1682
01:02:35,801 --> 01:02:36,931
We must be stopping here.

1683
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:38,671
Let's get out.

1684
01:02:39,431 --> 01:02:40,970
Let's look around.

1685
01:02:40,971 --> 01:02:43,370
- This is my country. - It's so pretty.

1686
01:02:43,371 --> 01:02:45,571
This is insane.

1687
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:48,911
(Located right next to the Monastery)

1688
01:02:49,941 --> 01:02:52,281
(World's first egg tart shop)

1689
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:54,751
(It is 189 years old.)

1690
01:02:55,221 --> 01:02:56,480
(In a monastery, they used egg white to stiffen their clothes.)

1691
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,050
(They used the leftover egg yolks to make a dessert, )

1692
01:02:58,051 --> 01:02:59,321
(which became egg tarts.)

1693
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,991
(Every morning at 8am, when the bell chimes, )

1694
01:03:03,961 --> 01:03:07,091
(a huge crowd gathers.)

1695
01:03:08,761 --> 01:03:12,071
(Even Torong visited the place yesterday.)

1696
01:03:13,731 --> 01:03:15,800
(Torong wants just one thing.)

1697
01:03:15,801 --> 01:03:18,041
(The egg tart recipe)

1698
01:03:18,971 --> 01:03:22,511
(In Portugal, they call it "Pastel de Nata.")

1699
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:27,051
(This is where egg tarts were first created.)

1700
01:03:27,781 --> 01:03:31,151
(Cutting the pastry into even-sized pieces)

1701
01:03:32,651 --> 01:03:35,791
(Shaping them to fit the molds)

1702
01:03:36,761 --> 01:03:40,491
(Adding a generous amount of egg yolk custard in them)

1703
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:45,301
(The moment the crispy pastry and soft custard are completed, )

1704
01:03:47,571 --> 01:03:50,071
(the egg tarts are done.)

1705
01:03:51,671 --> 01:03:52,710
(Amazed)

1706
01:03:52,711 --> 01:03:53,771
This is crazy.

1707
01:03:54,811 --> 01:03:56,210
Come here quickly.

1708
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:57,811
(Even the entrance makes her impressed.)

1709
01:03:58,341 --> 01:04:00,451
(Designed after medieval Europe)

1710
01:04:02,921 --> 01:04:05,890
(Dozens types of pastries in front of them)

1711
01:04:05,891 --> 01:04:06,891
That looks delicious.
This is driving me mad.

1712
01:04:07,892 --> 01:04:09,391
- Look. - No.

1713
01:04:09,561 --> 01:04:11,791
Mimi, we got caught.

1714
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:13,630
We got caught. We...

1715
01:04:13,631 --> 01:04:15,531
(They try to infiltrate as backpackers.)

1716
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:20,831
(They continue to go in for quite some time.)

1717
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:24,841
Be careful. But this place is really huge.

1718
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:26,611
How far do we have to go?

1719
01:04:27,511 --> 01:04:28,640
It's that way.

1720
01:04:28,641 --> 01:04:31,481
(With 200 employees, it lives up to being world's first egg tart shop.)

1721
01:04:33,111 --> 01:04:34,591
- So this is it. - Please don't film.

1722
01:04:35,321 --> 01:04:36,980
- Good job, team. - Good job.

1723
01:04:36,981 --> 01:04:38,020
(They manage to sit down without getting caught.)

1724
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:39,850
- Let's do this. - Our first schedule in Lisbon.

1725
01:04:39,851 --> 01:04:42,990
We've finally come to the egg tart shop that Torong visited.

1726
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:46,760
This shop opened in 1837 and has been run by 5 generations.

1727
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:48,290
- That's crazy. - For five generations?

1728
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:50,800
This is the world's first egg tart shop.

1729
01:04:50,801 --> 01:04:52,870
- World's first? - Guess how many they sell per day.

1730
01:04:52,871 --> 01:04:53,871
I think 30,000.

1731
01:04:53,872 --> 01:04:55,247
- I say 20,000. - I think 30 million.

1732
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:56,470
You say 30 million?

1733
01:04:56,471 --> 01:04:57,840
- I say 20,000. - I think...

1734
01:04:57,841 --> 01:04:58,911
Correct.

1735
01:04:59,641 --> 01:05:01,341
- They sell 20,000 a day? - For real?

1736
01:05:01,471 --> 01:05:03,410
Something you've been dreaming about.

1737
01:05:03,411 --> 01:05:06,011
(Here come 100 egg tarts out of 20,000.)

1738
01:05:06,651 --> 01:05:08,551
(Seriously impressed)

1739
01:05:10,351 --> 01:05:13,121
(They give an epic welcome.)

1740
01:05:14,121 --> 01:05:16,791
- This is insane! - It's amazing!

1741
01:05:16,891 --> 01:05:17,990
- Incredible! - Oh, no!

1742
01:05:17,991 --> 01:05:19,591
- Incredible! - We have to eat them now.

1743
01:05:20,131 --> 01:05:21,190
- We have to eat them now. - We have to eat them.

1744
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:22,930
You have to let us take a bite at least.

1745
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:24,131
We have to eat them now.

1746
01:05:24,261 --> 01:05:25,370
- Just a taste. - Close the top.

1747
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:26,830
- Just a taste. - Just one.

1748
01:05:26,831 --> 01:05:28,641
- You can have a bite. - One bite.

1749
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:30,470
I think it's better to start after you have a taste.

1750
01:05:30,471 --> 01:05:32,310
I really want to win this time.

1751
01:05:32,311 --> 01:05:34,541
- Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

1752
01:05:34,941 --> 01:05:35,941
Scissors.

1753
01:05:36,481 --> 01:05:38,481
Yu Jin lost!

1754
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:40,211
Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors.

1755
01:05:40,581 --> 01:05:42,481
Rock-paper-scissors.

1756
01:05:43,581 --> 01:05:44,850
It's Mimi.

1757
01:05:44,851 --> 01:05:46,750
- I won? - Mimi is the winner.

1758
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,691
- Eat it quickly. - It's not too burnt.

1759
01:05:49,121 --> 01:05:50,590
- Is it really good? - It looks so tasty.

1760
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,560
- Quickly. - Eat it right now.

1761
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:53,761
- Quickly. - Right now.

1762
01:05:54,131 --> 01:05:55,161
Keep quiet.

1763
01:05:56,061 --> 01:05:57,760
(Crunch)

1764
01:05:57,761 --> 01:05:58,901
Listen to the sound.

1765
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:00,971
(Another bite?)

1766
01:06:01,071 --> 01:06:02,440
Why is she taking another bite?

1767
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:04,800
- You're supposed to take one bite. - Mimi!

1768
01:06:04,801 --> 01:06:06,710
- Hey, just one bite! - Mimi!

1769
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:08,011
One bite!

1770
01:06:08,271 --> 01:06:09,641
This is...

1771
01:06:10,211 --> 01:06:11,211
How is it?

1772
01:06:11,611 --> 01:06:13,281
- Is it that good? - It's insane.

1773
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:16,771
- I really want to eat it. - How many do you think you can eat?

1774
01:06:16,921 --> 01:06:18,251
I can eat all of them.

1775
01:06:18,381 --> 01:06:19,520
- Is it that good? - It is.

1776
01:06:19,521 --> 01:06:20,521
Is it very different?

1777
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:21,650
It's not too sweet.

1778
01:06:21,651 --> 01:06:24,061
This is the best egg tart I’ve ever had.

1779
01:06:24,921 --> 01:06:27,591
The inside is so creamy.

1780
01:06:27,691 --> 01:06:28,860
- So creamy. - Creamy.

1781
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:29,960
We really want to eat it.

1782
01:06:29,961 --> 01:06:31,330
It doesn’t have even the slightest eggy taste.

1783
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:32,771
- Eggy taste. - You know that taste.

1784
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:35,701
That eggy taste. You're taking... oh.

1785
01:06:36,441 --> 01:06:38,321
Why didn't you eat the whole thing in one bite?

1786
01:06:38,371 --> 01:06:39,570
You should have eaten the whole thing.

1787
01:06:39,571 --> 01:06:41,740
- Compare it to Korean egg tarts. - Korean tart is...

1788
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:45,351
It's totally different. It's super crispy on the outside.

1789
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:48,510
The inside is so soft.

1790
01:06:48,511 --> 01:06:50,181
So soft.

1791
01:06:50,281 --> 01:06:51,950
It's so good. You have to taste it.

1792
01:06:51,951 --> 01:06:53,551
It's very creamy.

1793
01:06:53,751 --> 01:06:55,990
- Please, we have to get the answer. - Right.

1794
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:57,760
But I have no idea what we’ll do. I’m so curious!

1795
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:58,890
I'll tell you.

1796
01:06:58,891 --> 01:06:59,961
The title is...

1797
01:07:00,591 --> 01:07:01,961
You are

1798
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:04,961
- An open book - An open book

1799
01:07:05,131 --> 01:07:08,471
(The game title is in the first line of the song.)

1800
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:10,801
("For Lovers Who Hesitate" by Jannabi)

1801
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:13,641
(E-cade friends have been together for 4 years already.)

1802
01:07:13,711 --> 01:07:14,970
(I’m an open book Take a look and be on your way)

1803
01:07:14,971 --> 01:07:16,287
(This is a game where they have to read each other’s minds.)

1804
01:07:16,311 --> 01:07:18,311
Mind reading is a basic skill for a secret agent.

1805
01:07:18,441 --> 01:07:20,610
You have to guess accurately what the other person is thinking.

1806
01:07:20,611 --> 01:07:21,850
- That's the game. - We are the best at this.

1807
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:23,457
- We're good at that. - We are the best now.

1808
01:07:23,481 --> 01:07:26,391
(You Are an Open Book)

1809
01:07:26,621 --> 01:07:27,890
This game is simple.

1810
01:07:27,891 --> 01:07:29,821
One out of four of you... Let's say it's Yu Jin.

1811
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,890
List the four types of bread Yu Jin likes...

1812
01:07:32,891 --> 01:07:34,230
in order.

1813
01:07:34,231 --> 01:07:36,500
There will be the answer listed by Yu Jin.

1814
01:07:36,501 --> 01:07:39,401
- Okay. - You three will talk together.

1815
01:07:39,631 --> 01:07:42,100
You list four breads she likes in order.

1816
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:43,900
If that list matches what's in Yu Jin’s heart...

1817
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:45,610
you’ll each get an egg tart.

1818
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:47,910
- I get it. - You'll give one each.

1819
01:07:47,911 --> 01:07:49,740
- Every time you get it right. - One each. Got it.

1820
01:07:49,741 --> 01:07:51,380
- We can totally crush it. - I know I can do it.

1821
01:07:51,381 --> 01:07:52,750
No matter what comes, I can do it.

1822
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:54,380
Whose mind do you want to read first?

1823
01:07:54,381 --> 01:07:56,580
- I want to read Eun Ji. - Okay, let's do it.

1824
01:07:56,581 --> 01:07:58,520
- Reading Eun Ji's mind. - I think we can do it.

1825
01:07:58,521 --> 01:08:00,220
Guess what my mood is now.

1826
01:08:00,221 --> 01:08:01,701
- Now, your mood is... - Take a look.

1827
01:08:02,091 --> 01:08:03,091
It's good.

1828
01:08:04,221 --> 01:08:05,791
Good job.

1829
01:08:05,991 --> 01:08:07,030
- Good job. - Good.

1830
01:08:07,031 --> 01:08:08,060
(Good job.)

1831
01:08:08,061 --> 01:08:09,631
(Read Eun Ji's Mind)

1832
01:08:09,801 --> 01:08:11,230
Can we read Eun Ji's mind?

1833
01:08:11,231 --> 01:08:13,030
I wonder what the subject will be for her.

1834
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:16,740
- I know. - This is Eun Ji's lifelong subject.

1835
01:08:16,741 --> 01:08:18,041
It's love and marriage.

1836
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:19,870
Oh, no!

1837
01:08:19,871 --> 01:08:22,681
It's okay. It's the easiest subject.

1838
01:08:22,741 --> 01:08:25,410
I believe you all can get it right.

1839
01:08:25,411 --> 01:08:26,411
Here comes your question.

1840
01:08:26,911 --> 01:08:29,420
A once-in-a-lifetime sweet honeymoon.

1841
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:30,421
(Yes!)

1842
01:08:30,422 --> 01:08:32,920
Where does Agent Eun Ji want to go the most...

1843
01:08:32,921 --> 01:08:35,020
for her honeymoon?

1844
01:08:35,021 --> 01:08:36,390
(Sweet honeymoon is a once-in-a-lifetime event.)

1845
01:08:36,391 --> 01:08:38,231
(Where does Agent Eun Ji want to go the most?)

1846
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:41,861
One. Backpacking the Camino de Santiago.

1847
01:08:42,631 --> 01:08:44,130
(Camino de Santiago)

1848
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:45,630
(Located in northwestern Spain, it’s a journey...)

1849
01:08:45,631 --> 01:08:47,447
(that offers people a chance to reflect on life.)

1850
01:08:47,471 --> 01:08:50,241
(She seems pretty pleased.)

1851
01:08:50,471 --> 01:08:52,670
Two. Complete relaxation in nature.

1852
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:54,771
A luxury pool villa in the Maldives.

1853
01:08:55,911 --> 01:08:58,210
Three. It's the ultimate city.

1854
01:08:58,211 --> 01:08:59,950
Metro City, New York.

1855
01:08:59,951 --> 01:09:01,427
(New York is a megacity filled with skyscrapers.)

1856
01:09:01,451 --> 01:09:03,320
Four. Here you can enjoy...

1857
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:06,121
both surfing and biking activities. It's Hawaii.

1858
01:09:08,351 --> 01:09:11,621
First, Agent Eun Ji, please write them down in order.

1859
01:09:11,691 --> 01:09:13,861
Just imagining it makes me so happy.

1860
01:09:14,361 --> 01:09:17,661
(She’s already been around the world in her mind.)

1861
01:09:18,361 --> 01:09:20,270
Number 1 was the Camino, and what was number 2?

1862
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:21,600
- Maldives. - Number two was the Maldives.

1863
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:22,640
Three was New York.

1864
01:09:22,641 --> 01:09:24,071
- Four was... Hawaii. - Hawaii.

1865
01:09:25,101 --> 01:09:29,611
(Eun Ji carefully starts writing down the list.)

1866
01:09:29,911 --> 01:09:32,411
(Will they be able to read the heart of the eldest, Eun Ji?)

1867
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:34,681
(List submitted)

1868
01:09:35,211 --> 01:09:37,820
You'd go to Camino de Santiago for your honeymoon?

1869
01:09:37,821 --> 01:09:39,220
- Yes. - I wouldn't want to do that.

1870
01:09:39,221 --> 01:09:40,591
Eun Ji said to me yesterday...

1871
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:44,160
she wanted to try the Camino with E-cade members for the show.

1872
01:09:44,161 --> 01:09:46,442
Of course, doing a TV show and a honeymoon are different.

1873
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:48,190
(Yesterday in Abu Dhabi)

1874
01:09:48,191 --> 01:09:50,201
I want to go backpacking the Camino de Santiago.

1875
01:09:50,531 --> 01:09:51,760
You're a romantic.

1876
01:09:51,761 --> 01:09:53,431
I want to live like that at least once.

1877
01:09:53,531 --> 01:09:54,531
(In the van, 30 minutes ago)

1878
01:09:54,532 --> 01:09:57,247
Honestly, I’d love to do something like trekking across the country.

1879
01:09:57,271 --> 01:09:58,470
- For 1,200km? - Yes.

1880
01:09:58,471 --> 01:09:59,570
I'll tell her.

1881
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:01,117
(Young Ji was listening to everything at the back.)

1882
01:10:01,141 --> 01:10:03,311
I think Camino de Santiago could be her priority.

1883
01:10:03,781 --> 01:10:06,481
(Eun Ji can’t give any hints whatsoever.)

1884
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:09,620
To be honest, Hawaii is a bit vague.

1885
01:10:09,621 --> 01:10:12,121
She’s not that into activities.

1886
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:15,351
(That’s right. Eun Ji gets scared easily.)

1887
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:18,520
Even when riding the zipline, she was the only one who hesitated.

1888
01:10:18,521 --> 01:10:19,831
- Right. - She doesn't enjoy it.

1889
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,731
(Zipline launch point)

1890
01:10:21,961 --> 01:10:23,131
I'm scared.

1891
01:10:23,201 --> 01:10:24,601
- You're scared? - Yes.

1892
01:10:24,961 --> 01:10:26,900
Eun Ji, were you scared?

1893
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:28,671
She didn't enjoy it. She was scared.

1894
01:10:28,871 --> 01:10:31,231
(Young Ji has always been a little concerned about Eun Ji.)

1895
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:33,470
So I’m thinking...

1896
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,381
Hawaii might be lower on her list than we expect.

1897
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:37,441
It could be number 2 or 3.

1898
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:40,122
(Young Ji guesses that top pick is Camino, while Hawaii ranks low.)

1899
01:10:40,151 --> 01:10:41,650
I think number one is actually her last pick.

1900
01:10:41,651 --> 01:10:43,150
- Really? - Camino de Santiago?

1901
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:45,720
I don't think I'd like the Camino.

1902
01:10:45,721 --> 01:10:47,551
You have to carry a backpack.

1903
01:10:47,621 --> 01:10:50,991
The biggest activity is just getting to the destination.

1904
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:53,230
And on top of that, the places to sleep...

1905
01:10:53,231 --> 01:10:55,191
along the way will probably be run-down.

1906
01:10:55,461 --> 01:10:56,730
So you could end up fighting.

1907
01:10:56,731 --> 01:10:58,131
- That's true. - But...

1908
01:10:58,161 --> 01:11:00,001
- So you think... - I say Camino ranks last.

1909
01:11:00,101 --> 01:11:02,071
- That's what you think. - My ranking is...

1910
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:03,900
two, four, three, and one.

1911
01:11:03,901 --> 01:11:05,841
- Two, four... - Three, one.

1912
01:11:05,871 --> 01:11:07,011
What about you, Mimi?

1913
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:10,240
- I think... - I'm giving you a warning.

1914
01:11:10,241 --> 01:11:11,411
(Eun Ji gets a warning.)

1915
01:11:13,511 --> 01:11:16,251
(What is this strangely cold tension?)

1916
01:11:16,451 --> 01:11:18,651
But I...

1917
01:11:19,751 --> 01:11:21,121
To be honest,

1918
01:11:21,351 --> 01:11:23,360
it reflects a lot of my personal taste.

1919
01:11:23,361 --> 01:11:24,661
(So suddenly?)

1920
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:26,890
You're supposed to read my heart.

1921
01:11:26,891 --> 01:11:29,600
You're saying your taste and Eun Ji’s overalp?

1922
01:11:29,601 --> 01:11:32,531
No. That’s why it’s totally fine to ignore my opinion.

1923
01:11:32,831 --> 01:11:34,300
So, it was a useless opinion.

1924
01:11:34,301 --> 01:11:36,170
It reflects a lot of my personal taste.

1925
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:38,570
Is there a clear winner among these four places?

1926
01:11:38,571 --> 01:11:40,410
Or is it a close call for first place?

1927
01:11:40,411 --> 01:11:43,410
Recently, I told Yoo Seung Ho very clearly,

1928
01:11:43,411 --> 01:11:46,810
“This is where I’m going for my honeymoon.”

1929
01:11:46,811 --> 01:11:48,410
I think it's number one.

1930
01:11:48,411 --> 01:11:50,320
I think number one ranks first.

1931
01:11:50,321 --> 01:11:52,490
- She's saying that for a reason. - Right.

1932
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:55,091
If you go so far as to tell someone,

1933
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:56,360
“I really want to go there,”

1934
01:11:56,361 --> 01:11:58,720
then it’s probably a place most people...

1935
01:11:58,721 --> 01:12:00,630
wouldn’t typically choose.

1936
01:12:00,631 --> 01:12:03,600
Seung Ho probably said, "You really want to go there for your honeymoon?

1937
01:12:03,601 --> 01:12:05,100
I'm sure they made small talk like that.

1938
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:06,801
That makes sense.

1939
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:08,200
Is that your take?

1940
01:12:08,201 --> 01:12:09,600
(She read perfectly between the lines of what Eun Ji said.)

1941
01:12:09,601 --> 01:12:11,471
Therefore, I have decided that...

1942
01:12:11,601 --> 01:12:13,310
- number one ranks first. - Without a doubt.

1943
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,810
What would she think about New York?

1944
01:12:14,811 --> 01:12:16,740
- I don't think she'll like it. - She won't like it.

1945
01:12:16,741 --> 01:12:18,840
I think New York would be her last choice.

1946
01:12:18,841 --> 01:12:20,880
Eun Ji loves nature.

1947
01:12:20,881 --> 01:12:23,581
She likes peace and quiet and dislikes crowded places.

1948
01:12:23,621 --> 01:12:27,150
New York is a mix of all the chaos.

1949
01:12:27,151 --> 01:12:28,720
New York is the last place for sure.

1950
01:12:28,721 --> 01:12:30,167
- It's fourth place for sure. - Right.

1951
01:12:30,191 --> 01:12:33,160
- They're so accurate. - New York is last.

1952
01:12:33,161 --> 01:12:36,230
(1.Camino de Santiago, 2. Maldives, 3. New York, 4. Hawaii)

1953
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:38,630
Is it 1, 4, 2, 3? Or maybe 1, 2, 4, 3?

1954
01:12:38,631 --> 01:12:40,551
(Hawaii after Maldives or Maldives after Hawaii)

1955
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,740
But Hawaii’s nice just as it is.

1956
01:12:42,741 --> 01:12:44,140
- Even without the activities. - Right.

1957
01:12:44,141 --> 01:12:45,270
- So what do you say? - With Hawaii...

1958
01:12:45,271 --> 01:12:46,470
I'll go for 1, 4, 2, 3 too.

1959
01:12:46,471 --> 01:12:47,911
- And you? - I'll go for 1, 4, 2, 3.

1960
01:12:48,211 --> 01:12:49,981
- Our final decision is... - Okay.

1961
01:12:50,081 --> 01:12:52,111
- It's 1, 4... - What's next...

1962
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:54,281
- and 2, 3. - And 2, 3.

1963
01:12:55,481 --> 01:12:58,080
(Did they manage to guess what’s in Eun Ji’s heart?)

1964
01:12:58,081 --> 01:13:00,191
I think we're wrong. It must be 1, 2, 4, 3.

1965
01:13:00,851 --> 01:13:02,090
Where are the egg tarts?

1966
01:13:02,091 --> 01:13:03,097
(She's counting the chickens before they hatched.)

1967
01:13:03,121 --> 01:13:04,521
Here is the list. First place is...

1968
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:06,090
(In the order of Camino de Santiago, Hawaii, Maldives, New York)

1969
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:08,260
backpacking the Camino de Santiago.

1970
01:13:08,261 --> 01:13:09,800
- Eun Ji. - She has a unique taste.

1971
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:11,100
- I got it right. - It's unique.

1972
01:13:11,101 --> 01:13:12,101
Second place.

1973
01:13:12,531 --> 01:13:15,631
(Will Hawaii be 2nd place, just as they guessed?)

1974
01:13:16,701 --> 01:13:18,300
A luxury pool villa in the Maldives.

1975
01:13:18,301 --> 01:13:19,371
It's 1, 2, 4, 3.

1976
01:13:19,611 --> 01:13:20,641
Fail!

1977
01:13:21,241 --> 01:13:22,741
Eun Ji, is it 1, 2, 4, 3?

1978
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:26,911
It’s exactly 1, 2, 4, 3.

1979
01:13:27,781 --> 01:13:29,280
- That was the correct answer. - So close!

1980
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:31,551
Weren't they 99 percent accurate?

1981
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:33,020
As soon as I heard,

1982
01:13:33,021 --> 01:13:34,950
I thought Santiago ranked first.

1983
01:13:34,951 --> 01:13:37,921
And there was no way she’d like New York.

1984
01:13:37,961 --> 01:13:40,760
It's the same with Hawaii. She won't be into it...

1985
01:13:40,761 --> 01:13:42,607
- because of all the activities. - She's right.

1986
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:43,860
I was spot on.

1987
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:45,530
I was so moved by Young Ji.

1988
01:13:45,531 --> 01:13:46,630
Show me some love!

1989
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,601
- I was so moved. - For sure.

1990
01:13:48,671 --> 01:13:50,300
I feel like I’ll get it right next time.

1991
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,070
- We can do it now. - Yes!

1992
01:13:52,071 --> 01:13:53,071
We can do it now.

1993
01:13:53,072 --> 01:13:54,471
(It's not a bad start.)

1994
01:13:54,641 --> 01:13:56,881
I think as this game goes on, it'll become quite moving.

1995
01:13:57,111 --> 01:13:58,680
- It's hard. - Who are we reading next?

1996
01:13:58,681 --> 01:13:59,750
How about Mimi?

1997
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:00,880
Shall I go next?

1998
01:14:00,881 --> 01:14:02,481
- Can we read Mimi's heart next? - Yes.

1999
01:14:02,721 --> 01:14:04,221
- We can do it! - We can do it!

2000
01:14:04,421 --> 01:14:06,151
(Pre-game chant routine)

2001
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,050
- E-cade! - E-cade!

2002
01:14:08,051 --> 01:14:09,721
(Read Mimi's Mind)

2003
01:14:09,861 --> 01:14:10,920
Now this...

2004
01:14:10,921 --> 01:14:13,631
- What? - I wonder how well you know Mimi.

2005
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:15,190
Here comes the question.

2006
01:14:15,191 --> 01:14:17,361
- Okay. - You have to read my heart.

2007
01:14:17,461 --> 01:14:20,301
Mimi, the finance fanatic. The queen of money.

2008
01:14:20,701 --> 01:14:22,870
What kind of a dream house...

2009
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:26,041
does she dream of living in?

2010
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:29,511
For reference, let’s say they all cost the same.

2011
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:35,251
One, a newly-built top-tier apartment in Mayongseong.

2012
01:14:36,051 --> 01:14:37,051
Where's that?

2013
01:14:37,351 --> 01:14:39,051
It means Mapo, Yongsan, and Seongdong-gu.

2014
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:42,720
(Newly-built top-tier apartment is a place built within 2 years, )

2015
01:14:42,721 --> 01:14:45,761
(and is known for its location, brand, and high market value.)

2016
01:14:46,431 --> 01:14:49,830
Two. A spacious villa located in the heart of the city...

2017
01:14:49,831 --> 01:14:53,331
surrounded by restaurants, cafes, and conveniences as hyperlocal area.

2018
01:14:53,731 --> 01:14:56,301
- This one has Seorae Village vibes. - Okay.

2019
01:14:56,471 --> 01:15:00,341
Three. Old apartment with a view of Han River that could be redeveloped.

2020
01:15:00,841 --> 01:15:03,481
But redevelopment association hasn’t been approved yet.

2021
01:15:04,181 --> 01:15:06,951
This one could be nice if it gets redeveloped someday.

2022
01:15:07,181 --> 01:15:09,257
But for now, there's no telling when that will happen.

2023
01:15:09,281 --> 01:15:14,091
Four. A large house in Seongbuk-dong with a lush green lawn.

2024
01:15:14,591 --> 01:15:16,660
(House in Seongbuk-dong is known for its auspicious shaped terrain.)

2025
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:18,661
(It is famous for peaceful, secluded living.)

2026
01:15:18,891 --> 01:15:20,491
I have no idea what all that even means.

2027
01:15:20,931 --> 01:15:23,451
(Refer to Episode 9 of Season 2. This is for money-savvy Mimi!)

2028
01:15:23,831 --> 01:15:27,871
(Meanwhile, Mimi starts writing without hesitation.)

2029
01:15:28,231 --> 01:15:30,340
(List submitted)

2030
01:15:30,341 --> 01:15:31,900
Has Mimi already written down the list?

2031
01:15:31,901 --> 01:15:34,041
- Yes, she's done it. - She's done it already.

2032
01:15:34,211 --> 01:15:36,341
Do you mind if I take a guess myself?

2033
01:15:36,541 --> 01:15:37,881
No, go ahead.

2034
01:15:37,981 --> 01:15:39,181
What was the question again?

2035
01:15:40,311 --> 01:15:41,880
Mayongseong means Mapo,

2036
01:15:41,881 --> 01:15:43,380
- Yongsan and Seongdong-gu. - Newly-built apartment.

2037
01:15:43,381 --> 01:15:45,450
You're talking about a standard 112-square meter apartment.

2038
01:15:45,451 --> 01:15:47,220
- Nothing special, pretty average. - Right.

2039
01:15:47,221 --> 01:15:50,490
Number two sounds super urban.

2040
01:15:50,491 --> 01:15:52,291
Number three has redevelopment potential.

2041
01:15:52,391 --> 01:15:54,860
Number four is a house with lush green lawn vibes.

2042
01:15:54,861 --> 01:15:55,861
- A standalone house. - Yes.

2043
01:15:55,862 --> 01:15:58,560
- I think it's the hyperlocal area. - Number two.

2044
01:15:58,561 --> 01:16:00,731
I think it's number two.

2045
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:04,001
(Mimi has a mysterious expression.)

2046
01:16:04,141 --> 01:16:05,770
There is a reason why number two caught my eye.

2047
01:16:05,771 --> 01:16:08,110
Mimi starts her day by waking up at 8am.

2048
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:09,811
- Then, she does two workouts. - Right.

2049
01:16:09,911 --> 01:16:13,050
Whether it’s boxing or ballet, she does two workouts.

2050
01:16:13,051 --> 01:16:14,810
- She goes to the convenience store. - She eats some cookies.

2051
01:16:14,811 --> 01:16:16,381
She edits some videos.

2052
01:16:16,581 --> 01:16:18,850
She eats dinner before 6pm.

2053
01:16:18,851 --> 01:16:20,420
She spends her evening...

2054
01:16:20,421 --> 01:16:21,727
- and goes to sleep. - She boxes too.

2055
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:24,320
So I think she’d probably prefer someplace...

2056
01:16:24,321 --> 01:16:26,561
where all of that is easily accessible nearby.

2057
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:29,700
(Mimi currently lives in a villa right in a hyperlocal area.)

2058
01:16:29,701 --> 01:16:31,230
I feel she'd prefer places with nearby conveniences.

2059
01:16:31,231 --> 01:16:33,631
Personally, this is what I think.

2060
01:16:33,931 --> 01:16:37,441
She experienced dorm life as an idol.

2061
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:40,511
I feel she could dream about living in a standalone house.

2062
01:16:41,111 --> 01:16:44,510
I also think that kind of green and liberating standalone home...

2063
01:16:44,511 --> 01:16:46,451
might appeal to her.

2064
01:16:46,751 --> 01:16:48,650
You don't like complicated stuff either, right?

2065
01:16:48,651 --> 01:16:49,981
- Right? - She doesn't.

2066
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:52,150
I'm sorry, but don't make eye contact.

2067
01:16:52,151 --> 01:16:54,251
Princess Yu Jin?

2068
01:16:54,351 --> 01:16:56,090
Number two also makes sense.

2069
01:16:56,091 --> 01:16:57,137
- The hyperlocal area. - Right.

2070
01:16:57,161 --> 01:16:59,560
Number four is also a possibility.

2071
01:16:59,561 --> 01:17:01,460
(Likely top picks are hyperlocal area villa and standalone house.)

2072
01:17:01,461 --> 01:17:03,877
(Likely bottom picks are newly built and redevelopment apartments.)

2073
01:17:03,901 --> 01:17:05,861
I think redevelopment apartment ranks last.

2074
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:07,500
- Number three is last. - I agree.

2075
01:17:07,501 --> 01:17:09,541
The order is blank, blank, 1 and 3.

2076
01:17:09,741 --> 01:17:10,800
- Blank, blank, 1, 3. - It's 4, 2, 1, 3.

2077
01:17:10,801 --> 01:17:12,870
- Or 2, 4, 1, 3. - It's either Seongbuk-dong or...

2078
01:17:12,871 --> 01:17:13,871
- hyperlocal area ranking first. - Yes.

2079
01:17:13,872 --> 01:17:15,032
You just have to decide that.

2080
01:17:18,241 --> 01:17:20,281
I think it's the house in Seongdong-gu.

2081
01:17:20,681 --> 01:17:21,811
Number four?

2082
01:17:21,911 --> 01:17:23,820
- I think you're right. - It's 4, 2, 1, 3 for me.

2083
01:17:23,821 --> 01:17:24,821
That's what I think.

2084
01:17:24,822 --> 01:17:26,021
I'll go for 4, 2, 1, 3 too.

2085
01:17:26,691 --> 01:17:29,860
- What do you think? - I think it's 2, 4, 1, 3.

2086
01:17:29,861 --> 01:17:31,020
- It's 2, 4, 1, 3 for you? - Then do rock-paper-scissors.

2087
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,530
When I think hard about how Mimi is acting now...

2088
01:17:33,531 --> 01:17:37,100
I once asked her why she moved there.

2089
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:38,230
And what she told me was,

2090
01:17:38,231 --> 01:17:40,031
"They’re all in the same area."

2091
01:17:40,131 --> 01:17:43,541
I remember that's what she told me.

2092
01:17:43,801 --> 01:17:44,870
You're just like Mimi.

2093
01:17:44,871 --> 01:17:46,841
- So it's 2, 4, 1, 3? - Right.

2094
01:17:47,171 --> 01:17:49,210
- It's 2, 4, 1, 3. - It's 2, 4, 1, 3.

2095
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:50,580
- It's 2, 4, 1, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2096
01:17:50,581 --> 01:17:52,611
- It's 2, 4, 1, 3. - It's 2, 4, 1, 3.

2097
01:17:52,981 --> 01:17:54,250
You Are an Open Book.

2098
01:17:54,251 --> 01:17:56,380
Did you read Mimi's mind correctly?

2099
01:17:56,381 --> 01:17:57,721
I think it's 4, 2, 1, 3.

2100
01:17:58,781 --> 01:17:59,820
Mimi's mind...

2101
01:17:59,821 --> 01:18:02,991
(Will number 2, the hyperlocal area, be the top pick like Eun Ji said?)

2102
01:18:03,891 --> 01:18:05,261
goes for 4, 2, 1, 3.

2103
01:18:05,821 --> 01:18:07,491
- No! - Wrong!

2104
01:18:08,561 --> 01:18:11,361
(Screaming)

2105
01:18:13,701 --> 01:18:16,601
(In the order of house, hyperlocal, newly built, redevelopment)

2106
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:19,441
(The staff member takes the egg tarts.)

2107
01:18:19,641 --> 01:18:23,511
I’ve never heard you talk about Pyeongchang-dong before.

2108
01:18:23,981 --> 01:18:27,050
I'm sorry, but you should punish Agent Eun Ji for this.

2109
01:18:27,051 --> 01:18:28,480
- You're right. - We were so close.

2110
01:18:28,481 --> 01:18:29,681
This is on Agent Eun Ji.

2111
01:18:29,781 --> 01:18:31,421
Mimi, come here and explain.

2112
01:18:32,151 --> 01:18:34,051
Since Season One,

2113
01:18:34,151 --> 01:18:35,690
I’ve been saying I wanted a standalone house.

2114
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:37,560
You did? Are you sure it was us?

2115
01:18:37,561 --> 01:18:39,290
- I've never heard that. - Yes, when we were all together.

2116
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:41,530
- I didn't hear it either. - Frankly, I want to ask you this.

2117
01:18:41,531 --> 01:18:44,031
Are you sure you pronounced standalone house properly?

2118
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,001
Maybe that's why we never heard it.

2119
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:47,600
- Because of my pronunciation? - Yes.

2120
01:18:47,601 --> 01:18:49,970
I'm a scatterbrain crow, so please understand.

2121
01:18:49,971 --> 01:18:50,971
(You're a parrot.)

2122
01:18:51,071 --> 01:18:53,071
- Numbers 1 and 3 were accurate. - Right.

2123
01:18:53,371 --> 01:18:54,451
These two were the problem.

2124
01:18:55,341 --> 01:18:57,441
But my ultimate goal is...

2125
01:18:57,541 --> 01:18:59,080
to live in a house in a hyperlocal area.

2126
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:01,410
- That's what I thought! - Yes.

2127
01:19:01,411 --> 01:19:03,880
Standalone house comes first, with the hyperlocal area as a bonus.

2128
01:19:03,881 --> 01:19:05,051
That's the feeling I had.

2129
01:19:05,151 --> 01:19:06,521
It's okay, but we were...

2130
01:19:06,621 --> 01:19:08,620
- a little close. - You were really close.

2131
01:19:08,621 --> 01:19:09,621
- We were close. - For sure.

2132
01:19:09,622 --> 01:19:11,220
(Round Eun Ji: Fail, Round Mimi: Fail)

2133
01:19:11,221 --> 01:19:13,361
(There are only 2 chances left.)

2134
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:14,760
- Who's up for the next round? - Next one.

2135
01:19:14,761 --> 01:19:15,930
- We'll go with Yu Jin. - It's Yu Jin.

2136
01:19:15,931 --> 01:19:16,931
Let's read Yu Jin's mind.

2137
01:19:16,932 --> 01:19:18,630
- But it's hard to read her mind. - It's hard.

2138
01:19:18,631 --> 01:19:20,830
No, it could actually be surprisingly easy.

2139
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:23,440
- She's good at acting. - You have to think logically here.

2140
01:19:23,441 --> 01:19:24,940
We have to think realistically.

2141
01:19:24,941 --> 01:19:26,847
Yu Jin's mind is so hard to read. What do we do?

2142
01:19:26,871 --> 01:19:28,011
I have to eat that egg tart.

2143
01:19:28,111 --> 01:19:30,610
Young Ji is seriously serious.

2144
01:19:30,611 --> 01:19:31,851
She is hyper-focused right now.

2145
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:33,681
(Read Yu Jin's Mind)

2146
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:35,750
Please listen to the question.

2147
01:19:35,751 --> 01:19:40,090
Yu Jin finally gets a vacation after working hard for so long.

2148
01:19:40,091 --> 01:19:41,990
- I talked about this. - We have to get this right.

2149
01:19:41,991 --> 01:19:43,920
She decides to go on a family trip.

2150
01:19:43,921 --> 01:19:45,360
- With her family. - She's a good daughter.

2151
01:19:45,361 --> 01:19:47,560
We know she frequently goes on family trips.

2152
01:19:47,561 --> 01:19:50,401
She goes on a 15-night, 16-day family trip to Europe.

2153
01:19:51,301 --> 01:19:53,001
About 10 days in, she gets one day,

2154
01:19:53,901 --> 01:19:55,470
just one day all to herself.

2155
01:19:55,471 --> 01:19:57,041
Her parents are doing something else.

2156
01:19:57,141 --> 01:19:59,840
On that one day just for herself,

2157
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:01,840
what would Yu Jin want to do the most?

2158
01:20:01,841 --> 01:20:02,841
Okay.

2159
01:20:02,842 --> 01:20:05,811
(With a whole day just for herself, what would Yu Jin most want to do?)

2160
01:20:05,941 --> 01:20:08,751
One. Get a massage.

2161
01:20:09,111 --> 01:20:10,121
Massage.

2162
01:20:10,251 --> 01:20:12,851
Two. Go to a Korean restaurant.

2163
01:20:14,191 --> 01:20:15,450
Three.

2164
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:18,060
- Go shopping just for herself. - Shopping.

2165
01:20:18,061 --> 01:20:21,831
Four. Buy gifts for E-cade members.

2166
01:20:21,931 --> 01:20:23,631
- Number four is last. - For sure.

2167
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:25,001
- It's the last. - I know.
For E-cade members.

2168
01:20:26,002 --> 01:20:27,562
- Number four is last. - It's the last.

2169
01:20:27,871 --> 01:20:29,500
Number four is last for sure.

2170
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:30,540
I'll start writing.

2171
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:33,171
- Wait a second. - I write what I want to do, right?

2172
01:20:33,271 --> 01:20:34,710
- Yes. - Not my day's schedule.

2173
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:36,071
Is it difficult or easy?

2174
01:20:36,711 --> 01:20:39,080
(With a silent laugh, she writes right away.)

2175
01:20:39,081 --> 01:20:41,151
(List submitted)

2176
01:20:41,781 --> 01:20:43,750
- I think I know the answer. - Did you get the feeling?

2177
01:20:43,751 --> 01:20:45,071
- I got it right away. - You did?

2178
01:20:45,221 --> 01:20:48,021
(Is it Young Ji's showtime again?)

2179
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:50,160
The first thing that came to mind when I heard the question...

2180
01:20:50,161 --> 01:20:52,891
was 2, 1, 3, 4. Or it could be 2, 3, 1, 4.

2181
01:20:53,131 --> 01:20:54,667
- Korean restaurant ranks first? - Yes.

2182
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:57,200
Even two days into Abu Dhabi, Yu Jin was the kind of person...

2183
01:20:57,201 --> 01:20:59,201
looking for cup ramyeon and cup tteokbokki.

2184
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:00,730
She's not pretending.

2185
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:02,230
- She craves them from day one. - She's not pretending.

2186
01:21:02,231 --> 01:21:04,671
So I think Korean restaurant is her top pick for sure.

2187
01:21:04,771 --> 01:21:07,771
She also enjoys relaxing and taking it easy.

2188
01:21:07,911 --> 01:21:11,511
She secretly enjoys doing things to escape from the everyday world.

2189
01:21:11,841 --> 01:21:14,881
So I think getting a massage is the second thing she wants to do.

2190
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:17,850
Since she has been in Europe for ten days,

2191
01:21:17,851 --> 01:21:20,621
I’d say the shopping was already pretty much taken care of.

2192
01:21:21,051 --> 01:21:22,860
Therefore, shopping and getting gifts...

2193
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:25,167
- will be listed in the last place. - Young Ji's opinion...

2194
01:21:25,191 --> 01:21:26,791
Young Ji's opinion has a point.

2195
01:21:26,991 --> 01:21:28,960
- Princess Eun Ji's thoughts? - Princess Eun Ji.

2196
01:21:28,961 --> 01:21:30,761
To be honest,

2197
01:21:31,231 --> 01:21:33,107
I think Yu Jin would want to go shopping by herself.

2198
01:21:33,131 --> 01:21:34,800
- Go by herself? - Yes.

2199
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:35,877
(Once again, it’s the opposite of Young Ji’s guess.)

2200
01:21:35,901 --> 01:21:38,301
(Let’s see whose opinion turns out to be right.)

2201
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:41,241
You should know if you went on a family trip.

2202
01:21:41,341 --> 01:21:44,240
Having time to yourself is different.

2203
01:21:44,241 --> 01:21:45,241
You really need it.

2204
01:21:45,242 --> 01:21:47,350
When you shop with your parents, they go, "Why are you buying that?"

2205
01:21:47,351 --> 01:21:48,631
It starts with things like that.

2206
01:21:48,681 --> 01:21:50,350
You can't really shop in peace.

2207
01:21:50,351 --> 01:21:53,320
If Yu Jin is given a day, I think...

2208
01:21:53,321 --> 01:21:54,450
she'll go shopping.

2209
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:58,891
Considering how Yu Jin has shown strong bonds with her family,

2210
01:21:59,321 --> 01:22:02,160
she is very close with her mom and sister.

2211
01:22:02,161 --> 01:22:03,201
She is.

2212
01:22:03,301 --> 01:22:06,901
The reason I don’t think shopping for herself would rank that high...

2213
01:22:07,001 --> 01:22:09,670
is because she enjoys shopping more when it’s with her mom and sister.

2214
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:11,741
There's one thing I want to know.

2215
01:22:11,841 --> 01:22:14,240
Young Ji, are you this serious because of the egg tart...

2216
01:22:14,241 --> 01:22:16,641
- or because of getting the answer? - It's for the egg tart.

2217
01:22:17,241 --> 01:22:18,841
I have to eat it. I'm serious.

2218
01:22:19,441 --> 01:22:22,381
(If they don't succeed this time, )

2219
01:22:22,411 --> 01:22:23,920
(there is only Young Ji's round left.)

2220
01:22:23,921 --> 01:22:25,880
(Young Ji has no right to speak.)

2221
01:22:25,881 --> 01:22:27,620
The reason why I’m so anxious is because...

2222
01:22:27,621 --> 01:22:31,121
my guesses for the last two were really close.

2223
01:22:31,661 --> 01:22:33,990
But I didn't speak up, so I missed my chance.

2224
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:35,391
She felt frustrated.

2225
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:37,660
I think it's 2, 4, 1, 3.

2226
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:39,461
You two decide.

2227
01:22:39,561 --> 01:22:40,930
(The answer was 2, 4, 1, 3.)

2228
01:22:40,931 --> 01:22:41,931
No.

2229
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:43,871
Challenge me.

2230
01:22:44,301 --> 01:22:45,770
(She had the right answer, but she hesitated.)

2231
01:22:45,771 --> 01:22:46,771
I want this.

2232
01:22:46,772 --> 01:22:49,040
I didn't speak up, so I missed my chance.

2233
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:50,041
She felt frustrated.

2234
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:52,040
I'll support Young Ji's opinion.

2235
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:53,180
That puts pressure on me.

2236
01:22:53,181 --> 01:22:54,911
- No. - Let's go with it.

2237
01:22:55,281 --> 01:22:57,880
(Did Young Ji read Yu Jin's mind?)

2238
01:22:57,881 --> 01:22:59,280
- I wanted to support you. - I like it too.

2239
01:22:59,281 --> 01:23:00,727
- I think it's correct. - We go for 2, 1, 3, 4.

2240
01:23:00,751 --> 01:23:02,550
- We have our final decision. - I think it's correct.

2241
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:04,061
- It's two. - One.

2242
01:23:04,161 --> 01:23:05,590
- Three. - Four.

2243
01:23:05,591 --> 01:23:06,591
That's our answer.

2244
01:23:06,592 --> 01:23:09,431
(In the order of Korean restaurant, massage, shopping, buying gifts)

2245
01:23:09,861 --> 01:23:10,861
Correct!

2246
01:23:10,862 --> 01:23:12,131
(Correct!)

2247
01:23:13,631 --> 01:23:14,631
Correct!

2248
01:23:14,632 --> 01:23:16,870
(They succeed in Round 3.)

2249
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:18,540
Good job, Young Ji!

2250
01:23:18,541 --> 01:23:19,970
- Good job. - That's incredible!

2251
01:23:19,971 --> 01:23:21,411
- You're incredible! - Good job.

2252
01:23:21,741 --> 01:23:23,140
- Such a great job. - You're so good at it.

2253
01:23:23,141 --> 01:23:24,980
I got all three of them right!

2254
01:23:24,981 --> 01:23:26,710
You did such a great job!

2255
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:27,881
But you know this, right?

2256
01:23:27,981 --> 01:23:30,101
If you don’t get mine right, I’ll be so disappointed.

2257
01:23:32,281 --> 01:23:35,191
- She's amazing. - We finally get to eat!

2258
01:23:35,321 --> 01:23:38,321
- Lee Young Ji! - Lee Young Ji!

2259
01:23:38,661 --> 01:23:39,960
Lee Young Ji!

2260
01:23:39,961 --> 01:23:42,131
(They win 4 egg tarts.)

2261
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:46,331
I was conflicted between massage and Korean restaurant.

2262
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:48,731
When you go on a family trip...

2263
01:23:49,171 --> 01:23:50,841
and keep on eating Korean food,

2264
01:23:51,271 --> 01:23:52,940
they can ask, "Why did we come all the way here?"

2265
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:54,710
My parents ask that sometimes.

2266
01:23:54,711 --> 01:23:58,081
I want to go to a Korean restaurant at least once a day.

2267
01:23:58,641 --> 01:23:59,680
It's fun looking for one.

2268
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:01,050
Right, that's why...

2269
01:24:01,051 --> 01:24:03,181
We’re traveling abroad with someone like that.

2270
01:24:03,951 --> 01:24:06,420
Actually, I want to buy gifts for E-cade members...

2271
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:07,951
before anything.

2272
01:24:08,551 --> 01:24:10,390
But... yes...

2273
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:11,960
Yu Jin herself is the gift, really.

2274
01:24:11,961 --> 01:24:13,390
- Right. - Yes.

2275
01:24:13,391 --> 01:24:16,131
- Thanks for the tart. - We'll eat it now.

2276
01:24:16,191 --> 01:24:17,260
The first bite...

2277
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:18,360
- Let's have our first bite. Cheers. - Cheers!

2278
01:24:18,361 --> 01:24:19,361
First bite! Cheers!

2279
01:24:19,362 --> 01:24:20,931
- Cheers! - Enjoy.

2280
01:24:24,571 --> 01:24:27,340
(They involuntarily exclaim after just one bite.)

2281
01:24:27,341 --> 01:24:29,411
- My gosh! - It's so good.

2282
01:24:30,741 --> 01:24:32,041
I think I can have 12.

2283
01:24:32,641 --> 01:24:34,487
(It's not too sweet, so you can keep eating without getting sick of it.)

2284
01:24:34,511 --> 01:24:35,651
I'm going to add cinnamon.

2285
01:24:36,621 --> 01:24:39,850
(Cinnamon powder and powdered sugar)

2286
01:24:39,851 --> 01:24:40,921
Powdered sugar.

2287
01:24:43,921 --> 01:24:46,161
(Crunchy)

2288
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:48,461
(Savoring)

2289
01:24:49,031 --> 01:24:51,601
This powder is really good.

2290
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:54,831
It tastes amazing.

2291
01:24:55,231 --> 01:24:56,777
It's crunchy on the outside, but soft inside.

2292
01:24:56,801 --> 01:24:57,841
I know!

2293
01:24:58,401 --> 01:25:01,071
If someone asks me what I did in Lisbon,

2294
01:25:01,271 --> 01:25:03,580
I'm going to tell them about this first.

2295
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:04,641
This egg tart.

2296
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:06,381
It's amazing.

2297
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:07,880
Have you tried this, Brother Yeong Seok?

2298
01:25:07,881 --> 01:25:10,120
- No, I haven't. - What a shame.

2299
01:25:10,121 --> 01:25:11,121
(What a shame.)

2300
01:25:12,021 --> 01:25:13,951
- It's really good. - Yes, a pity.

2301
01:25:14,221 --> 01:25:15,320
- It's really good. - I want to have another.

2302
01:25:15,321 --> 01:25:16,350
Me too.

2303
01:25:16,351 --> 01:25:18,060
It's so much better with cinnamon.

2304
01:25:18,061 --> 01:25:19,890
- Really? - Eun Ji, I like it too.

2305
01:25:19,891 --> 01:25:21,291
- The cinnamon is so good. - It is?

2306
01:25:21,461 --> 01:25:22,730
I haven't tried it with cinnamon yet.

2307
01:25:22,731 --> 01:25:24,131
- I need to have another. - Me too.

2308
01:25:24,231 --> 01:25:25,260
Hold on a second.

2309
01:25:25,261 --> 01:25:26,700
You didn't go yet, Young Ji.

2310
01:25:26,701 --> 01:25:28,570
- Young Ji needs to go. - We still have Young Ji.

2311
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:29,777
(It’s Warrior Young Ji's turn.)

2312
01:25:29,801 --> 01:25:31,900
(Read Young Ji's Mind)

2313
01:25:31,901 --> 01:25:32,901
Okay.

2314
01:25:33,311 --> 01:25:34,511
- Are you ready? - Yes.

2315
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:36,941
- Young Ji's round. - The question is so funny.

2316
01:25:37,181 --> 01:25:38,480
We have a scenario for Young Ji.

2317
01:25:38,481 --> 01:25:39,681
Listen carefully, please.

2318
01:25:40,981 --> 01:25:42,310
(Here's the scene.)

2319
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:43,350
I'll tell you the situation.

2320
01:25:43,351 --> 01:25:45,820
You're all walking together one day.

2321
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:48,120
Then Mimi sees a store that sells lotteries.

2322
01:25:48,121 --> 01:25:51,020
And she convinces Young Ji to buy one.

2323
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,391
Eun Ji and Yu Jin say...

2324
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:54,390
"Young Ji, I have a feeling about this number!"

2325
01:25:54,391 --> 01:25:55,990
"Young Ji, how about this number?"

2326
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:57,391
And they help you pick the numbers.

2327
01:25:57,501 --> 01:25:58,601
But would you look at that?

2328
01:25:58,831 --> 01:26:02,300
She won a total of 100 million dollars.

2329
01:26:02,301 --> 01:26:03,947
(Young Ji won the lottery for 100 million dollars!)

2330
01:26:03,971 --> 01:26:07,571
Young Ji turned into a millionaire overnight.

2331
01:26:07,941 --> 01:26:11,441
What would she want to do most?

2332
01:26:12,141 --> 01:26:13,351
(Exclaiming)

2333
01:26:13,651 --> 01:26:15,911
(Excited just thinking about it)

2334
01:26:16,051 --> 01:26:18,350
One, buying out an entertainment company...

2335
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:21,221
or a production company and become a CEO.

2336
01:26:22,191 --> 01:26:24,721
It doesn't matter what type of company it is.

2337
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:26,531
She would become a CEO.

2338
01:26:26,861 --> 01:26:27,930
Two.

2339
01:26:27,931 --> 01:26:30,601
Inviting Rihanna, Adele, Bruno Mars,

2340
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:33,401
Kendrick Lamar, and other world-famous celebrities...

2341
01:26:33,571 --> 01:26:35,401
and hosting a luxurious party in Abu Dhabi.

2342
01:26:35,771 --> 01:26:36,801
Three.

2343
01:26:37,101 --> 01:26:38,671
Without telling anyone,

2344
01:26:38,941 --> 01:26:42,241
putting the money in a safe time deposit...

2345
01:26:42,341 --> 01:26:44,011
and yielding interest.

2346
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:45,761
That sounds like something I would do.

2347
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:47,650
(What would Young Ji do?)

2348
01:26:47,651 --> 01:26:48,851
- This is hard. - Four.

2349
01:26:49,451 --> 01:26:51,021
Splitting the money...

2350
01:26:51,321 --> 01:26:53,551
and sharing it with E-cade members.

2351
01:26:53,651 --> 01:26:55,391
I think number four would go last.

2352
01:26:55,991 --> 01:26:57,821
- Number 4. - You're right. Number 4 is last.

2353
01:26:58,261 --> 01:26:59,520
Young Ji is writing it down.

2354
01:26:59,521 --> 01:27:00,730
(Millionaire Young Ji...)

2355
01:27:00,731 --> 01:27:02,230
(writes down her answer with no hesitation.)

2356
01:27:02,231 --> 01:27:03,301
I'm done.

2357
01:27:03,431 --> 01:27:05,501
(List submitted)

2358
01:27:05,761 --> 01:27:07,321
- Okay. - I don't think they'll get it.

2359
01:27:07,671 --> 01:27:09,100
- Did you finish? - Yes, I wrote it down.

2360
01:27:09,101 --> 01:27:10,341
- I think... - Yes.

2361
01:27:10,871 --> 01:27:13,470
I'm torn between 1 and 3.

2362
01:27:13,471 --> 01:27:16,610
I don't think Young Ji is into parties.

2363
01:27:16,611 --> 01:27:18,010
Right, she doesn't like parties.

2364
01:27:18,011 --> 01:27:19,610
But Young Ji looks like she'd live a glamorous life.

2365
01:27:19,611 --> 01:27:21,051
She does seem like that,

2366
01:27:21,311 --> 01:27:24,750
but she'd much rather be in a room and party with us.

2367
01:27:24,751 --> 01:27:25,880
- That's right. - In a room?

2368
01:27:25,881 --> 01:27:27,191
She likes relatable parties.

2369
01:27:27,321 --> 01:27:30,190
So I think the order is 3, 1, 2, 4.

2370
01:27:30,191 --> 01:27:32,160
- It's 3, 1, 2, 4. - I see.

2371
01:27:32,161 --> 01:27:34,461
Did she say 3, 1, 2, 4?

2372
01:27:35,091 --> 01:27:38,101
But if Young Ji...

2373
01:27:38,301 --> 01:27:40,430
did win the lottery, what she would really do...

2374
01:27:40,431 --> 01:27:41,671
isn't on the list.

2375
01:27:42,171 --> 01:27:44,270
Because Young Ji really wants to...

2376
01:27:44,271 --> 01:27:46,201
- build a foundation. - Right, for donations.

2377
01:27:46,501 --> 01:27:48,010
- I'm so touched. - She wants to build a foundation.

2378
01:27:48,011 --> 01:27:49,240
Give her the egg tart!

2379
01:27:49,241 --> 01:27:50,881
- Is that the answer? - Yes, it is.

2380
01:27:51,211 --> 01:27:53,410
So you want to help many people,

2381
01:27:53,411 --> 01:27:55,810
but you wouldn't share the money with the members?

2382
01:27:55,811 --> 01:27:58,721
Of course not. "You make money!"

2383
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:02,120
"You make more money than I do these days!"

2384
01:28:02,121 --> 01:28:04,361
"Come on!" She'd say something like this.

2385
01:28:04,661 --> 01:28:06,930
Wait! I think Young Ji would give us the money.

2386
01:28:06,931 --> 01:28:08,561
- What? - Come on, Mimi!

2387
01:28:09,231 --> 01:28:12,330
We helped her pick the numbers, right?

2388
01:28:12,331 --> 01:28:13,331
That's right.

2389
01:28:13,332 --> 01:28:15,330
- Then I think Young Ji would... - So Mimi suggests she buy,

2390
01:28:15,331 --> 01:28:16,530
and Eun Ji and Yu Jin...

2391
01:28:16,531 --> 01:28:18,241
- help her pick the numbers. - Wait!

2392
01:28:18,371 --> 01:28:20,911
- Right. - Mimi suggests she buy.

2393
01:28:21,041 --> 01:28:22,940
Young Ji told me that she'd give me half...

2394
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:24,941
if she earned one billion dollars.

2395
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:26,611
- Young Ji did? - Yes.

2396
01:28:26,911 --> 01:28:29,251
We talked about this just today.

2397
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:30,451
Why today?

2398
01:28:31,021 --> 01:28:33,250
You know, I'll keep wearing this...

2399
01:28:33,251 --> 01:28:34,491
even if I earn one billion.

2400
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:35,851
That's so cool.

2401
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:36,921
- Right? - Yes.

2402
01:28:37,191 --> 01:28:38,860
If I do, I'll give you half, Mimi.

2403
01:28:38,861 --> 01:28:39,890
(In the plane to Lisbon)

2404
01:28:39,891 --> 01:28:40,991
Thank you so much.

2405
01:28:42,061 --> 01:28:44,100
I really can't read her!

2406
01:28:44,101 --> 01:28:46,730
It's so confusing since Young Ji talks so much!

2407
01:28:46,731 --> 01:28:48,931
- She gave us too much information! - Then...

2408
01:28:49,071 --> 01:28:50,947
- Say that again. - number four, splitting the money.

2409
01:28:50,971 --> 01:28:52,571
The Young Ji we know would think...

2410
01:28:52,741 --> 01:28:54,841
that we won the lottery as a team.

2411
01:28:55,111 --> 01:28:57,481
So I think number four might not be the last one.

2412
01:28:58,211 --> 01:28:59,581
Maybe above the party one?

2413
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:01,451
It might be.

2414
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:03,151
(Interesting)

2415
01:29:03,451 --> 01:29:07,220
No, Young Ji would put sharing the money first.

2416
01:29:07,221 --> 01:29:08,250
You know why?

2417
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:12,460
(1. CEO, 2. Party, 3. Time deposit, 4. Sharing money)

2418
01:29:12,461 --> 01:29:14,091
Number four comes first.

2419
01:29:14,361 --> 01:29:16,231
Because Young Ji told me earlier...

2420
01:29:16,491 --> 01:29:18,230
that she believed in that thing.

2421
01:29:18,231 --> 01:29:19,831
Reincarnation.

2422
01:29:20,171 --> 01:29:21,430
(Talking about reincarnation in an egg tart shop)

2423
01:29:21,431 --> 01:29:23,470
She believes in reincarnation.

2424
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:25,801
Then when she gave, she would get it back.

2425
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:27,310
That's why she would share.

2426
01:29:27,311 --> 01:29:29,110
- That's right. - I don't think you should...

2427
01:29:29,111 --> 01:29:31,011
pay attention to everything Young Ji says.

2428
01:29:32,811 --> 01:29:34,381
I'm so touched, Eun Ji.

2429
01:29:35,111 --> 01:29:37,120
Young Ji is TMI in human form.

2430
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:38,450
She says too much.

2431
01:29:38,451 --> 01:29:40,220
I have so much information about Young Ji.

2432
01:29:40,221 --> 01:29:42,351
- It's hurting my head. - Then number four...

2433
01:29:42,451 --> 01:29:45,020
Instead of the deposit, I think...

2434
01:29:45,021 --> 01:29:46,301
Young Ji would rather donate it.

2435
01:29:46,491 --> 01:29:48,460
- But it's not here. - Donation is not an option.

2436
01:29:48,461 --> 01:29:50,400
- It's not. - Mimi, check the list!

2437
01:29:50,401 --> 01:29:51,801
I think...

2438
01:29:52,031 --> 01:29:54,501
(Young Ji is so hard to read.)

2439
01:29:55,101 --> 01:30:00,001
(Round 4 is taking a lot of time.)

2440
01:30:01,641 --> 01:30:04,841
- Then... - I have a theory!

2441
01:30:05,181 --> 01:30:06,641
I've been thinking...

2442
01:30:06,911 --> 01:30:08,751
that splitting money would be last.

2443
01:30:08,851 --> 01:30:12,921
But inviting people like Rihanna and Kendrick Lamar...

2444
01:30:13,421 --> 01:30:15,021
is going to cost a lot of money.

2445
01:30:15,221 --> 01:30:16,290
Rather than that,

2446
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:18,960
she might think it's better to share the money with us.

2447
01:30:18,961 --> 01:30:19,961
She's smart.

2448
01:30:19,962 --> 01:30:21,491
She's in "Crime Scene" for a reason.

2449
01:30:21,861 --> 01:30:23,960
She might think like that.

2450
01:30:23,961 --> 01:30:26,030
- I agree. - Instead of wasting money...

2451
01:30:26,031 --> 01:30:27,771
- Yes, she doesn't like wasting. - Okay.

2452
01:30:28,371 --> 01:30:30,251
If she decides sharing is better than partying,

2453
01:30:30,471 --> 01:30:31,971
I think it might be 3, 1, 4, 2.

2454
01:30:32,341 --> 01:30:35,271
- It's 3, 1, 4, 2. - You think it’s 3, 1, 4, 2?

2455
01:30:35,971 --> 01:30:37,111
Three, one...

2456
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:39,541
Number one, becoming a CEO.

2457
01:30:39,741 --> 01:30:42,287
Young Ji is interested in producing, so that could be the first one.

2458
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:43,350
(Look at her go!)

2459
01:30:43,351 --> 01:30:45,781
- But don't you produce on your own? - Yes.

2460
01:30:46,681 --> 01:30:49,421
She sometimes suggests things to me.

2461
01:30:49,651 --> 01:30:50,660
- Gosh! - Exactly.

2462
01:30:50,661 --> 01:30:52,290
She says things like "You would pull this off."

2463
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:53,530
And "You could do this well."

2464
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:54,831
She says that often.

2465
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:58,001
Young Ji likes stability, you know.

2466
01:30:58,331 --> 01:31:00,061
She lives a frugal life.

2467
01:31:00,871 --> 01:31:04,370
So I think she'd go with the third one, the time deposit.

2468
01:31:04,371 --> 01:31:06,101
It's a stable and long-term income.

2469
01:31:06,401 --> 01:31:07,541
They're really...

2470
01:31:08,271 --> 01:31:09,311
Oh, I shouldn't say.

2471
01:31:09,741 --> 01:31:11,411
(She can't hide being moved.)

2472
01:31:11,611 --> 01:31:13,411
- Let's do this. - Your final answer is...

2473
01:31:13,881 --> 01:31:15,911
First, telling no one...

2474
01:31:16,411 --> 01:31:18,721
and putting the money in a time deposit? Young Ji?

2475
01:31:19,081 --> 01:31:20,990
Telling no one is key!

2476
01:31:20,991 --> 01:31:22,291
That's the point.

2477
01:31:23,591 --> 01:31:26,161
(We trust you, Yu Jin.)

2478
01:31:27,131 --> 01:31:28,261
Young Ji picked...

2479
01:31:29,291 --> 01:31:30,330
Please.

2480
01:31:30,331 --> 01:31:31,331
Three.

2481
01:31:31,332 --> 01:31:32,560
(Time deposit, CEO, splitting money, party)

2482
01:31:32,561 --> 01:31:33,600
One.

2483
01:31:33,601 --> 01:31:34,830
(Time deposit, CEO, splitting money, party)

2484
01:31:34,831 --> 01:31:36,771
Four and two.

2485
01:31:37,371 --> 01:31:38,401
Correct!

2486
01:31:41,941 --> 01:31:43,641
- Gosh! - Eun Ji, you did well.

2487
01:31:43,781 --> 01:31:45,311
- But seriously... - Yes.

2488
01:31:45,481 --> 01:31:47,351
You guys were spot on toward the end.

2489
01:31:47,681 --> 01:31:49,780
What they said about me thinking the party would be a waste of money,

2490
01:31:49,781 --> 01:31:52,581
and sharing the money with the members would be better...

2491
01:31:52,951 --> 01:31:53,991
was precisely right.

2492
01:31:54,921 --> 01:31:56,391
- Goodness. - I got chills.

2493
01:31:56,921 --> 01:32:00,891
And I really have to thank Eun Ji.

2494
01:32:01,461 --> 01:32:05,731
I spread a lot of false information.

2495
01:32:06,061 --> 01:32:08,770
But Eun Ji remembered the foundation,

2496
01:32:08,771 --> 01:32:10,501
right at the beginning.

2497
01:32:10,841 --> 01:32:12,841
Thank you so much. This was so touching.

2498
01:32:15,011 --> 01:32:16,311
I was so moved.

2499
01:32:17,011 --> 01:32:18,910
- Let's eat. - Enjoy, everyone.

2500
01:32:18,911 --> 01:32:20,011
Can we start?

2501
01:32:23,821 --> 01:32:25,921
The weather is so great!

2502
01:32:26,251 --> 01:32:27,950
The weather is so good!

2503
01:32:27,951 --> 01:32:29,721
Good!

2504
01:32:29,751 --> 01:32:32,021
These cobblestone streets are so charming.

2505
01:32:32,821 --> 01:32:34,661
- I'm so happy. - Me too.

2506
01:32:35,661 --> 01:32:38,531
- The weather is splendid. - It's so beautiful!

2507
01:32:38,861 --> 01:32:40,001
I feel great.

2508
01:32:40,431 --> 01:32:41,570
We're really lucky this time.

2509
01:32:41,571 --> 01:32:42,730
- It rained in the desert, - Right.

2510
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:43,840
- but it's sunny here. - Yes.

2511
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:45,741
- You're right. - It's perfect.

2512
01:32:46,841 --> 01:32:48,440
I'm nervous because the shoot is going so well.

2513
01:32:48,441 --> 01:32:49,441
- Why? - Why?

2514
01:32:49,442 --> 01:32:50,780
I'm scared things might go wrong.

2515
01:32:50,781 --> 01:32:52,540
Don't think like that, Princess Yeong Seok!

2516
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:53,550
Princess Yeong Seok,

2517
01:32:53,551 --> 01:32:54,871
- you shouldn't do that! - Right!

2518
01:32:55,251 --> 01:32:57,051
Just enjoy the moment!

2519
01:32:58,721 --> 01:33:00,290
(She spoke their minds.)

2520
01:33:00,291 --> 01:33:02,350
Please, Princess Yeong Seok!

2521
01:33:02,351 --> 01:33:03,897
- Why do you do that? - This is so funny.

2522
01:33:03,921 --> 01:33:05,321
"Just enjoy the moment."

2523
01:33:05,721 --> 01:33:06,821
It's so weird.

2524
01:33:06,991 --> 01:33:09,391
I just want to spend my life role-playing with you guys.

2525
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:11,930
(I see.)

2526
01:33:11,931 --> 01:33:13,030
- Hey, Parrot! - No.

2527
01:33:13,031 --> 01:33:14,970
(Role-playing with Parrot Mim right away)

2528
01:33:14,971 --> 01:33:16,271
I said you were a parrot.

2529
01:33:16,601 --> 01:33:17,640
What do parrots...

2530
01:33:17,641 --> 01:33:19,270
(Squawking)

2531
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:20,840
- Why did you pick a parrot? - Poor Mimi.

2532
01:33:20,841 --> 01:33:21,970
Princess Mimi.

2533
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:23,011
Let's try again.

2534
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:25,310
- Yu Jin is pretty. - Yu Jin is pretty!

2535
01:33:25,311 --> 01:33:26,541
(Input and output)

2536
01:33:26,811 --> 01:33:28,750
(Following Princess Yu Jin's instructions)

2537
01:33:28,751 --> 01:33:30,010
- Parrot Mim. - Parrot Mim.

2538
01:33:30,011 --> 01:33:31,921
Poor Mimi, Yu Jin's on to her.

2539
01:33:32,681 --> 01:33:34,251
YoungGPT!

2540
01:33:35,551 --> 01:33:37,620
I think she's calling you. You should answer.

2541
01:33:37,621 --> 01:33:38,621
Yes?

2542
01:33:39,321 --> 01:33:40,831
You called for me?

2543
01:33:42,031 --> 01:33:44,261
- YoungGPT. - Yes.

2544
01:33:44,731 --> 01:33:47,831
What should we do when we arrive at the lodging?

2545
01:33:47,971 --> 01:33:51,101
When we arrive,

2546
01:33:51,701 --> 01:33:53,240
the first thing we should do...

2547
01:33:53,241 --> 01:33:55,040
- YoungGPT. - Yes?

2548
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:56,570
What's wrong with your voice?

2549
01:33:56,571 --> 01:33:57,911
I need rest.

2550
01:33:59,341 --> 01:34:02,081
I suggest you play with the parrot on your right.

2551
01:34:02,211 --> 01:34:04,681
What should I do with the parrot?

2552
01:34:05,051 --> 01:34:06,821
Do you want to train the parrot?

2553
01:34:07,221 --> 01:34:08,221
(Thinking)

2554
01:34:08,222 --> 01:34:10,121
I just want to be her friend!

2555
01:34:10,761 --> 01:34:14,660
I estimate that the relationship is too hierarchical for that.

2556
01:34:14,661 --> 01:34:16,460
(Parrot Mim is just happy.)

2557
01:34:16,461 --> 01:34:18,601
- All right. - YoungGPT off.

2558
01:34:19,561 --> 01:34:22,301
It turned itself off.

2559
01:34:22,831 --> 01:34:25,140
- Look over there. - The street is so colorful.

2560
01:34:25,141 --> 01:34:26,141
It's so pretty.

2561
01:34:26,271 --> 01:34:28,141
This looks like a scene in a movie.

2562
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:30,110
I'm in trouble. The scenery...

2563
01:34:30,111 --> 01:34:32,280
- in Lisbon is too pretty. - I know.

2564
01:34:32,281 --> 01:34:34,562
- It's like a movie. - I can't think of something to say.

2565
01:34:35,711 --> 01:34:38,081
(The village where our lodging is in)

2566
01:34:38,181 --> 01:34:40,180
- It's so pretty. - Isn't that the American flag?

2567
01:34:40,181 --> 01:34:41,350
There are a lot of embassies here.

2568
01:34:41,351 --> 01:34:42,650
A lot of people are walking their dogs.

2569
01:34:42,651 --> 01:34:44,690
Right? But it'll be nice to walk.

2570
01:34:44,691 --> 01:34:45,890
It's like Seongbuk-dong.

2571
01:34:45,891 --> 01:34:47,290
It's the Seoungbuk-dong of Portugal.

2572
01:34:47,291 --> 01:34:49,407
(It has a lot of embassies and cute shops to browse in.)

2573
01:34:49,431 --> 01:34:51,130
I love small cafes like this.

2574
01:34:51,131 --> 01:34:52,261
Me too!

2575
01:34:53,061 --> 01:34:56,371
(They arrived at their destination.)

2576
01:34:56,671 --> 01:34:59,140
It's the pink building on our right.

2577
01:34:59,141 --> 01:35:00,470
- Pink? - Cool!

2578
01:35:00,471 --> 01:35:01,571
- Let's get out. - Okay.

2579
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:02,641
We're here.

2580
01:35:02,671 --> 01:35:04,111
We have to get our bags, right?

2581
01:35:04,341 --> 01:35:06,241
- Hi. - Hi.

2582
01:35:06,581 --> 01:35:07,611
It's on the left!

2583
01:35:09,551 --> 01:35:11,050
(Arrived at last)

2584
01:35:11,051 --> 01:35:12,820
- Gosh! - Welcome.

2585
01:35:12,821 --> 01:35:14,150
- It's so pretty. - Come in!

2586
01:35:14,151 --> 01:35:15,821
- Wait, Eun Ji! - Goodness!

2587
01:35:15,851 --> 01:35:17,890
- This is amazing! - Wow!

2588
01:35:17,891 --> 01:35:19,690
- My gosh! - What is all this?

2589
01:35:19,691 --> 01:35:21,890
- This is great! - It's so pretty.

2590
01:35:21,891 --> 01:35:23,961
- Look, there's a pool! - Gosh.

2591
01:35:24,361 --> 01:35:25,441
Do we have the whole house?

2592
01:35:25,661 --> 01:35:27,530
- This is crazy! - These buildings are all together?

2593
01:35:27,531 --> 01:35:28,571
What's going on?

2594
01:35:29,231 --> 01:35:31,470
(The building appears past the spacious garden.)

2595
01:35:31,471 --> 01:35:32,870
This is too pretty!

2596
01:35:32,871 --> 01:35:34,040
- What is this? - What should we do?

2597
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:35,341
There's another pool!

2598
01:35:36,971 --> 01:35:39,681
When the days become warmer,

2599
01:35:39,911 --> 01:35:41,480
you can swim there.

2600
01:35:41,481 --> 01:35:42,810
We should swim.

2601
01:35:42,811 --> 01:35:46,551
(The lodging in daylight)

2602
01:35:46,681 --> 01:35:47,751
Wow!

2603
01:35:48,021 --> 01:35:49,720
This house is too pretty!

2604
01:35:49,721 --> 01:35:51,491
Do we go in through here?

2605
01:35:51,921 --> 01:35:55,391
(A truly aesthetic house!)

2606
01:35:55,661 --> 01:35:57,500
Yu Jin, you look really good standing there.

2607
01:35:57,501 --> 01:35:59,101
- Gosh! - So pretty!

2608
01:35:59,201 --> 01:36:00,230
I know, right?

2609
01:36:00,231 --> 01:36:02,200
Look how excited she is.

2610
01:36:02,201 --> 01:36:03,401
It's really pretty!

2611
01:36:03,531 --> 01:36:05,371
(Exclaiming)

2612
01:36:06,241 --> 01:36:07,611
This room is so cute!

2613
01:36:09,911 --> 01:36:11,741
(Perfect for backpackers)

2614
01:36:12,441 --> 01:36:14,311
(Young Ji and Yu Jin's room)

2615
01:36:14,481 --> 01:36:16,010
- That way. - Is that the other room?

2616
01:36:16,011 --> 01:36:17,397
(It's right next to Eun Ji and Mimi's room.)

2617
01:36:17,421 --> 01:36:20,420
- This place is so nice. - It really is!

2618
01:36:20,421 --> 01:36:21,850
This room looks nice.

2619
01:36:21,851 --> 01:36:24,161
- We'll take this one. - We'll use this room.

2620
01:36:25,191 --> 01:36:27,431
(The well-lit room goes to Eun Ji and Mimi.)

2621
01:36:27,661 --> 01:36:29,991
So the buildings are connected.

2622
01:36:30,431 --> 01:36:31,801
- This is amazing. - Gosh.

2623
01:36:32,001 --> 01:36:35,601
(We have arrived at the lodging in Lisbon.)

2624
01:36:36,131 --> 01:36:38,941
- This place is great. - It's amazing!

2625
01:36:39,301 --> 01:36:41,240
(The current time is 11am.)

2626
01:36:41,241 --> 01:36:43,110
Let's all rest until 3pm.

2627
01:36:43,111 --> 01:36:44,140
Okay!

2628
01:36:44,141 --> 01:36:45,641
That sounds great!

2629
01:36:46,041 --> 01:36:48,111
(Soon)

2630
01:36:48,211 --> 01:36:50,181
- You should rest, Young Ji. - Why?

2631
01:36:50,251 --> 01:36:51,321
Go and sleep!

2632
01:36:51,721 --> 01:36:53,121
(I don't want to.)

2633
01:36:53,351 --> 01:36:55,721
(The members won't go rest as they're told.)

2634
01:36:55,821 --> 01:36:57,321
(We're not going in this pool.)

2635
01:36:57,591 --> 01:37:00,761
(They pick diving as their new pastime.)

2636
01:37:00,991 --> 01:37:02,691
(The production staff versus the members?)

2637
01:37:02,861 --> 01:37:04,431
- Rock-paper… - Hang on.

2638
01:37:05,161 --> 01:37:06,261
We're really doing this?

2639
01:37:06,431 --> 01:37:08,500
(Who will be the one to dive into the cold water?)

2640
01:37:08,501 --> 01:37:11,201
(Diving bet between the staff and the members)

2641
01:37:11,301 --> 01:37:13,571
(Coming soon)

2642
01:37:16,711 --> 01:37:19,680
("Fallen in Love" by Jang Beom June)

2643
01:37:19,681 --> 01:37:23,150
(I've fallen in love)

2644
01:37:23,151 --> 01:37:25,150
- I love Lisbon. - Me too.

2645
01:37:25,151 --> 01:37:26,497
(The older members are starting to relax)

2646
01:37:26,521 --> 01:37:27,591
Let's go!

2647
01:37:30,961 --> 01:37:32,820
(The younger members are still energetic.)

2648
01:37:32,821 --> 01:37:34,561
Young Ji, you have great energy today.

2649
01:37:34,691 --> 01:37:35,960
(Meanwhile)

2650
01:37:35,961 --> 01:37:39,631
("The One I Love" by Jang Beom June)

2651
01:37:44,141 --> 01:37:48,941
(They're resting without resting.)

2652
01:37:49,341 --> 01:37:51,910
(Meanwhile, )

2653
01:37:51,911 --> 01:37:53,881
(Eun Ji makes a call.)

2654
01:37:54,011 --> 01:37:55,511
Did you catch Torong?

2655
01:37:55,651 --> 01:37:57,050
No, I didn't.

2656
01:37:57,051 --> 01:37:59,550
Torong and Cheol Yong popped out...

2657
01:37:59,551 --> 01:38:02,150
and ran away after hitting me.

2658
01:38:02,151 --> 01:38:03,621
I'm so sad, Ha Eun.

2659
01:38:04,261 --> 01:38:06,761
(She's complaining to her niece, Ha Eun.)

2660
01:38:06,921 --> 01:38:09,831
Ha Eun, do you want anything from Lisbon?

2661
01:38:11,831 --> 01:38:13,561
What's a Lis?

2662
01:38:13,601 --> 01:38:14,601
(Lisbon is confusing for an 8-year-old.)

2663
01:38:14,602 --> 01:38:17,341
Not Lis, Lisbon. It's a city.

2664
01:38:17,671 --> 01:38:18,970
I want a camel doll.

2665
01:38:18,971 --> 01:38:21,040
A camel doll, got it!

2666
01:38:21,041 --> 01:38:22,611
(She just says that she can get it.)

2667
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:24,140
Bye, Auntie.

2668
01:38:24,141 --> 01:38:26,641
Can you say "I love you" to cheer me up?

2669
01:38:27,081 --> 01:38:28,611
Cheer up, Auntie. I love you!

2670
01:38:28,651 --> 01:38:29,850
I love you too.

2671
01:38:29,851 --> 01:38:30,881
(Wiggling)

2672
01:38:31,021 --> 01:38:32,421
I love you!

2673
01:38:32,851 --> 01:38:35,291
(Screen grabbing)

2674
01:38:35,551 --> 01:38:37,020
(While Eun Ji was relaxing like that...)

2675
01:38:37,021 --> 01:38:38,121
Bye!

2676
01:38:39,161 --> 01:38:41,761
Where would you like to go on your honeymoon, Yu Jin?

2677
01:38:42,061 --> 01:38:44,460
Is the order you chose for Eun Ji's round...

2678
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:45,731
your personal choice as well?

2679
01:38:45,931 --> 01:38:48,030
Yes, I pick Santiago last.

2680
01:38:48,031 --> 01:38:50,570
- Last? - I like the Maldives the best.

2681
01:38:50,571 --> 01:38:52,971
The love of your life wants to go to Santiago.

2682
01:38:53,071 --> 01:38:55,410
His lifelong dream is to go on...

2683
01:38:55,411 --> 01:38:57,410
the Camino de Santiago.

2684
01:38:57,411 --> 01:38:59,091
I don't think I'll like someone like that.

2685
01:38:59,341 --> 01:39:00,410
(This is not going as she wanted.)

2686
01:39:00,411 --> 01:39:01,451
(Smirking)

2687
01:39:02,051 --> 01:39:04,551
- It has to be Santiago! - I really can't go.

2688
01:39:04,921 --> 01:39:06,320
He's begging you to go.

2689
01:39:06,321 --> 01:39:07,350
That's not love.

2690
01:39:07,351 --> 01:39:09,551
I already said no. Why is he forcing this?

2691
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:10,791
I don't want to.

2692
01:39:10,792 --> 01:39:12,821
Why should I go when I really don't want to?

2693
01:39:13,361 --> 01:39:14,831
He didn't know you didn't like it.

2694
01:39:15,631 --> 01:39:17,160
- The Maldives. - Okay.

2695
01:39:17,161 --> 01:39:19,460
He's offering to go to both the Maldives and Santiago.

2696
01:39:19,461 --> 01:39:20,461
(Agreeing a little)

2697
01:39:20,462 --> 01:39:21,501
Twice!

2698
01:39:25,171 --> 01:39:26,540
It will take 30 days.

2699
01:39:26,541 --> 01:39:29,140
I just won't go to either of them.

2700
01:39:29,141 --> 01:39:31,180
- You'll get ten million dollars. - Okay.

2701
01:39:31,181 --> 01:39:32,441
I'll still never do it.

2702
01:39:32,481 --> 01:39:33,681
How about 100 million dollars?

2703
01:39:33,711 --> 01:39:35,610
I work so that I won't have to do something like that.

2704
01:39:35,611 --> 01:39:36,911
Then one billion dollars.

2705
01:39:37,251 --> 01:39:38,520
He'll give you one billion dollars.

2706
01:39:38,521 --> 01:39:40,751
I don't need that much money to live my life.

2707
01:39:41,551 --> 01:39:43,961
(Pouting)

2708
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:45,661
- Just don't go on a honeymoon. - Fine.

2709
01:39:46,921 --> 01:39:49,531
(Eun Ji is relaxing on her own.)

2710
01:39:49,561 --> 01:39:50,731
Eun Ji, what are you up to?

2711
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:52,661
I'm just having some coffee.

2712
01:39:53,431 --> 01:39:56,231
(Eun Ji is humming to herself.)

2713
01:39:56,531 --> 01:39:57,940
(Becoming too emotional)

2714
01:39:57,941 --> 01:40:00,040
- Yu Jin, what should I do? - What's wrong?

2715
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:02,441
This city is too romantic.

2716
01:40:02,511 --> 01:40:03,811
I can't be funny.

2717
01:40:04,141 --> 01:40:05,511
What are you talking about?

2718
01:40:05,711 --> 01:40:07,010
I'm loving this sunlight.

2719
01:40:07,011 --> 01:40:08,950
There's still a lot of time until 3pm, Eun Ji.

2720
01:40:08,951 --> 01:40:09,951
(Selfies with a staff member's phone)

2721
01:40:09,952 --> 01:40:11,280
We look like an old married couple!

2722
01:40:11,281 --> 01:40:12,450
- A middle-aged couple. - Wait.

2723
01:40:12,451 --> 01:40:14,650
Director, come over here.

2724
01:40:14,651 --> 01:40:16,720
You know, in "Architectural Exploration,"

2725
01:40:16,721 --> 01:40:17,990
people buy an old house with just 300 dollars in the countryside.

2726
01:40:17,991 --> 01:40:20,031
- And they start a business. - To start a business.

2727
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:24,131
(Creating content themselves)

2728
01:40:24,161 --> 01:40:26,331
- Is this being filmed? - It is, honey.

2729
01:40:26,401 --> 01:40:27,831
Good afternoon.

2730
01:40:28,131 --> 01:40:30,230
We are starting You... YouTube.

2731
01:40:30,231 --> 01:40:32,370
- I'm shy. - We are YouTubers.

2732
01:40:32,371 --> 01:40:34,640
- No, it's YouTube... - I'm Kwak Cheol Yong,

2733
01:40:34,641 --> 01:40:36,370
- Honey. - and this is Lee Mi Ja.

2734
01:40:36,371 --> 01:40:37,410
(Mi Ja is shy.)

2735
01:40:37,411 --> 01:40:39,811
- We're still new to this. - How does this work?

2736
01:40:40,211 --> 01:40:41,381
Is this working?

2737
01:40:41,551 --> 01:40:42,580
Hello.

2738
01:40:42,581 --> 01:40:43,751
Now, we...

2739
01:40:44,151 --> 01:40:46,921
- bought an old building over here. - Yes.

2740
01:40:47,081 --> 01:40:49,420
And we're going to rise up.

2741
01:40:49,421 --> 01:40:51,590
We're turning our lives around.

2742
01:40:51,591 --> 01:40:53,421
(Mi Ja is triggered.)

2743
01:40:53,661 --> 01:40:55,260
Don't say you're turning our lives around.

2744
01:40:55,261 --> 01:40:56,730
Did you forget about your business already?

2745
01:40:56,731 --> 01:40:57,830
- I shouldn't say things like that? - No.

2746
01:40:57,831 --> 01:40:59,800
- Don't mention that, honey. - I didn't know that.

2747
01:40:59,801 --> 01:41:01,600
You should take over, dear.

2748
01:41:01,601 --> 01:41:03,270
Goodness, how do you do this?

2749
01:41:03,271 --> 01:41:05,400
Put it up... Yes, like that.

2750
01:41:05,401 --> 01:41:07,040
- Actually, - Get a good angle.

2751
01:41:07,041 --> 01:41:09,541
After the two of us got married,

2752
01:41:09,671 --> 01:41:10,710
well...

2753
01:41:10,711 --> 01:41:12,511
We didn't have a place to call home.

2754
01:41:12,681 --> 01:41:14,781
Goodness, you're crying again?

2755
01:41:14,911 --> 01:41:16,951
You cry every time this comes up!

2756
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:19,380
I told you not to cry like that in public!

2757
01:41:19,381 --> 01:41:21,250
We have to film this again now.

2758
01:41:21,251 --> 01:41:23,491
Well, my husband here...

2759
01:41:24,691 --> 01:41:25,860
- went through... - Stop crying!

2760
01:41:25,861 --> 01:41:27,430
Stop crying, woman!

2761
01:41:27,431 --> 01:41:29,530
- I'll do it. Give me. - I can't do this.

2762
01:41:29,531 --> 01:41:30,801
Please subscribe,

2763
01:41:30,901 --> 01:41:32,331
- And like our video! - yes.

2764
01:41:32,561 --> 01:41:34,570
- How do you turn this thing off? - How do you turn it off?

2765
01:41:34,571 --> 01:41:36,330
- How do you do this? - Should we press this?

2766
01:41:36,331 --> 01:41:37,670
- I got it. - It's that button.

2767
01:41:37,671 --> 01:41:39,191
("Architectural Exploration," The End)

2768
01:41:39,241 --> 01:41:40,970
Everyone, please come in and eat.

2769
01:41:40,971 --> 01:41:42,341
I made kimchi stew.

2770
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:44,080
Come inside and eat.

2771
01:41:44,081 --> 01:41:45,440
Are we still filming this?

2772
01:41:45,441 --> 01:41:47,110
Mi Ja, could we get a shot of you...

2773
01:41:47,111 --> 01:41:48,250
lost in thought, drinking coffee?

2774
01:41:48,251 --> 01:41:50,110
- Honey, should we... - I don't get lost in my thoughts.

2775
01:41:50,111 --> 01:41:51,580
Then let's just sit like we usually do, honey.

2776
01:41:51,581 --> 01:41:53,081
Come sit here.

2777
01:41:53,251 --> 01:41:55,050
- Just naturally. - Pretend the cameras aren't here.

2778
01:41:55,051 --> 01:41:56,950
- Just how we would usually be? - Exactly how you'd usually be.

2779
01:41:56,951 --> 01:41:58,261
Got it.

2780
01:41:58,361 --> 01:42:00,191
(Naturally...)

2781
01:42:00,221 --> 01:42:01,731
We're inseparable.

2782
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:04,230
- We always... - Inseparable?

2783
01:42:04,231 --> 01:42:05,561
Sit like this.

2784
01:42:06,031 --> 01:42:08,101
We shouldn't do this in public.

2785
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:09,530
Whatever!

2786
01:42:09,531 --> 01:42:10,870
Oh, I'm sorry. Honey!

2787
01:42:10,871 --> 01:42:12,900
(This is love!)

2788
01:42:12,901 --> 01:42:14,310
This is what we're usually like.

2789
01:42:14,311 --> 01:42:15,570
Thank you very much.

2790
01:42:15,571 --> 01:42:17,371
This is just our life.

2791
01:42:17,641 --> 01:42:19,010
(Going back to relax)

2792
01:42:19,011 --> 01:42:20,111
(Turning)

2793
01:42:20,181 --> 01:42:23,081
The water... We can't go in here!

2794
01:42:23,251 --> 01:42:25,050
(It did become warmer, )

2795
01:42:25,051 --> 01:42:27,021
(but the water is still 13°C.)

2796
01:42:27,121 --> 01:42:28,250
We can never go inside.

2797
01:42:28,251 --> 01:42:29,991
- Should we do it as a bet? - Okay!

2798
01:42:30,351 --> 01:42:31,760
(Springing)

2799
01:42:31,761 --> 01:42:33,190
(You want to go?)

2800
01:42:33,191 --> 01:42:34,390
(No.)

2801
01:42:34,391 --> 01:42:35,661
(Eun Ji runs away.)

2802
01:42:35,861 --> 01:42:38,601
(What about you?)

2803
01:42:39,031 --> 01:42:40,300
(She has no intention of running.)

2804
01:42:40,301 --> 01:42:42,201
- An Yu Jin, are you scared? - What?

2805
01:42:42,331 --> 01:42:44,270
- Scared? Eun Ji, you are scared? - Scared?

2806
01:42:44,271 --> 01:42:46,001
- Are you scared? - Scared?

2807
01:42:46,471 --> 01:42:49,670
(No one told them to provoke each other.)

2808
01:42:49,671 --> 01:42:51,611
- Eun Ji, are you bothered? - Bothered!

2809
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:53,510
(Actually, Eun Ji...)

2810
01:42:53,511 --> 01:42:56,051
(just wants to rest.)

2811
01:42:56,251 --> 01:42:58,951
(Mimi is already resting.)

2812
01:42:59,221 --> 01:43:00,221
Scared?

2813
01:43:00,222 --> 01:43:01,691
(They're still not done.)

2814
01:43:01,851 --> 01:43:03,191
Even we're not doing this.

2815
01:43:03,521 --> 01:43:05,691
How about the staff versus the members?

2816
01:43:06,091 --> 01:43:07,091
Let's do this.

2817
01:43:07,531 --> 01:43:08,531
Seriously?

2818
01:43:08,532 --> 01:43:10,330
Geon Jun and Hyun Yong versus Young Ji and Yu Jin.

2819
01:43:10,331 --> 01:43:11,331
Okay!

2820
01:43:11,332 --> 01:43:12,360
(Geon Jun, Hyun Yong)

2821
01:43:12,361 --> 01:43:14,131
We're really doing this?

2822
01:43:14,231 --> 01:43:17,601
(The two people addicted to dopamine...)

2823
01:43:17,641 --> 01:43:18,770
Rock-paper-scissors.

2824
01:43:18,771 --> 01:43:20,471
(suggest rock-paper-scissors.)

2825
01:43:21,611 --> 01:43:23,811
- Are we going to dive right now? - Yes!

2826
01:43:24,241 --> 01:43:26,210
- Right after changing! - Straight after!

2827
01:43:26,211 --> 01:43:27,550
- So suddenly? - Yes!

2828
01:43:27,551 --> 01:43:28,751
So we're really diving?

2829
01:43:28,851 --> 01:43:30,250
For real!

2830
01:43:30,251 --> 01:43:32,221
- So Eun Ji's not in? Just us two? - Yes.

2831
01:43:32,281 --> 01:43:33,597
So the team with the loser dives?

2832
01:43:33,621 --> 01:43:34,941
- Yes. - The team with the loser!

2833
01:43:35,451 --> 01:43:36,790
So if I just avoid coming in last...

2834
01:43:36,791 --> 01:43:38,591
- Yes, you're safe. - Wait a second!

2835
01:43:38,691 --> 01:43:39,960
Out of the four of us,

2836
01:43:39,961 --> 01:43:41,530
- the team with the loser dives? - Yes.

2837
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:42,531
Let's go!

2838
01:43:42,532 --> 01:43:43,860
Rock-paper...

2839
01:43:43,861 --> 01:43:45,700
Look, Brother Chang Dae is here!

2840
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:47,401
This is so sudden.

2841
01:43:47,431 --> 01:43:49,301
- Let's go! - All right.

2842
01:43:49,331 --> 01:43:51,001
You started this. Remember that.

2843
01:43:51,571 --> 01:43:52,600
You started this.

2844
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:54,401
It'll be a shame to leave the pool like that.

2845
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:57,011
- Rock-paper... - Wait.

2846
01:43:57,141 --> 01:43:58,380
We're really doing this?

2847
01:43:58,381 --> 01:43:59,740
- Really! - For real!

2848
01:43:59,741 --> 01:44:00,910
- Let's do this! - We're really doing it!

2849
01:44:00,911 --> 01:44:02,350
- Soak your whole body. - Yeong Seok!

2850
01:44:02,351 --> 01:44:03,380
This is crazy.

2851
01:44:03,381 --> 01:44:05,650
- Come down here! - Let's go!

2852
01:44:05,651 --> 01:44:08,221
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

2853
01:44:11,321 --> 01:44:12,790
(Young Ji is safe for now.)

2854
01:44:12,791 --> 01:44:14,861
Young Ji, you got it.

2855
01:44:15,361 --> 01:44:16,430
Yu Jin, I believe you.

2856
01:44:16,431 --> 01:44:18,400
You need to win and join me.

2857
01:44:18,401 --> 01:44:19,561
(These two can't believe it.)

2858
01:44:19,701 --> 01:44:21,000
You don't know yet.

2859
01:44:21,001 --> 01:44:22,001
- You don't know yet. - Play...

2860
01:44:22,002 --> 01:44:23,530
- Play or lose, - Play or lose,

2861
01:44:23,531 --> 01:44:24,777
- rock-paper-scissors. - rock-paper-scissors.

2862
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:27,301
(In danger)

2863
01:44:29,041 --> 01:44:31,580
(Making a big fuss)

2864
01:44:31,581 --> 01:44:33,181
(Checking the depth)

2865
01:44:33,281 --> 01:44:35,210
(Having a mental breakdown)

2866
01:44:35,211 --> 01:44:36,281
Hyun Yong.

2867
01:44:37,381 --> 01:44:38,827
Let's pretend that this never happened.

2868
01:44:38,851 --> 01:44:40,820
Let's do this again later.

2869
01:44:40,821 --> 01:44:42,521
- Play or lose... - Hold on.

2870
01:44:42,991 --> 01:44:44,491
- Play or lose... - Hold on.

2871
01:44:45,261 --> 01:44:46,321
Yeong Seok!

2872
01:44:47,161 --> 01:44:50,191
It's the production crew versus Young Ji and Yu Jin.

2873
01:44:50,591 --> 01:44:54,370
Play or lose,

2874
01:44:54,371 --> 01:44:55,371
rock-paper...

2875
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:57,671
(Yu Jin loses.)

2876
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:02,071
(The reactions make a stark difference.)

2877
01:45:02,611 --> 01:45:04,881
(She squeezes her eyes shut.)

2878
01:45:06,541 --> 01:45:07,541
Let's go, Young Ji.

2879
01:45:07,811 --> 01:45:10,451
(They accept their fate.)

2880
01:45:10,581 --> 01:45:11,950
Let me change my pants first.

2881
01:45:11,951 --> 01:45:13,150
- What? - What?

2882
01:45:13,151 --> 01:45:14,620
- Me too. - Are you serious?

2883
01:45:14,621 --> 01:45:15,920
- Really? - Girls.

2884
01:45:15,921 --> 01:45:17,490
Yu Jin.

2885
01:45:17,491 --> 01:45:18,760
(Chuckling)

2886
01:45:18,761 --> 01:45:21,560
- What, Young Ji? - Let's change our pants.

2887
01:45:21,561 --> 01:45:23,281
- Are you scared? - Let's change our pants.

2888
01:45:24,191 --> 01:45:27,700
(These two are scared.)

2889
01:45:27,701 --> 01:45:29,531
No, we can't do this.

2890
01:45:30,101 --> 01:45:31,340
- We can't do this. - We...

2891
01:45:31,341 --> 01:45:32,800
Why not? We decided to do it.

2892
01:45:32,801 --> 01:45:34,570
(Determined)

2893
01:45:34,571 --> 01:45:35,711
We're changing our pants.

2894
01:45:36,141 --> 01:45:37,910
- Let's go. - I'll go right away.

2895
01:45:37,911 --> 01:45:38,911
(She has changed already.)

2896
01:45:38,912 --> 01:45:40,911
- Hey! - What?

2897
01:45:40,941 --> 01:45:42,211
I can't believe it.

2898
01:45:42,651 --> 01:45:43,951
Yeong Seok, save me.

2899
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,681
(Only the loser is excited.)

2900
01:45:47,081 --> 01:45:48,550
(Young Ji is ready as well.)

2901
01:45:48,551 --> 01:45:50,121
- Are you ready? - Let's go.

2902
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:53,520
(She takes off her hat in an excited state.)

2903
01:45:53,521 --> 01:45:55,561
- Take off your shoes. - You guys are going to die.

2904
01:45:55,831 --> 01:45:58,001
You guys are going to die. Don't do it.

2905
01:45:58,301 --> 01:45:59,301
It's too cold.

2906
01:45:59,501 --> 01:46:01,070
(Worried)

2907
01:46:01,071 --> 01:46:02,570
- All right. - It's dangerous.

2908
01:46:02,571 --> 01:46:05,270
- No! Stop! - Let's go.

2909
01:46:05,271 --> 01:46:06,840
Stop!

2910
01:46:06,841 --> 01:46:07,841
- No. - I'm serious.

2911
01:46:07,842 --> 01:46:09,470
(Hyun Yong approaches them to stop them.)

2912
01:46:09,471 --> 01:46:11,380
What's going on? Why are you guys doing this?

2913
01:46:11,381 --> 01:46:13,341
- All right. - Gosh, Young Ji.

2914
01:46:13,441 --> 01:46:14,611
- It's no joke. - Young Ji.

2915
01:46:15,551 --> 01:46:17,832
(They switch their strategy since the water is too cold.)

2916
01:46:18,051 --> 01:46:21,521
Let's go down here and enter like this.

2917
01:46:21,921 --> 01:46:23,120
- Let's go. - No takebacks.

2918
01:46:23,121 --> 01:46:24,121
- Set, go. - Set, go.

2919
01:46:24,561 --> 01:46:25,820
(Hold your breath and do a love dive)

2920
01:46:25,821 --> 01:46:27,061
- Earth Arcade! - Earth Arcade!

2921
01:46:28,391 --> 01:46:29,561
They're insane.

2922
01:46:31,401 --> 01:46:32,800
(Screaming)

2923
01:46:32,801 --> 01:46:33,961
(Her breath comes out foggy.)

2924
01:46:35,101 --> 01:46:37,971
(They enter the water in a refreshing way.)

2925
01:46:39,441 --> 01:46:42,370
Young Ji.

2926
01:46:42,371 --> 01:46:44,211
(Screaming soundlessly)

2927
01:46:45,081 --> 01:46:46,081
My goodness.

2928
01:46:47,241 --> 01:46:48,310
What's wrong with you guys?

2929
01:46:48,311 --> 01:46:50,510
- Hurry up and come out, Yu Jin. - Come out.

2930
01:46:50,511 --> 01:46:53,621
(She becomes excited in the pool.)

2931
01:46:54,451 --> 01:46:56,650
What's up with you guys?

2932
01:46:56,651 --> 01:46:59,161
- Yeong Seok, save us. - They're insane.

2933
01:46:59,291 --> 01:47:00,520
Look at them.

2934
01:47:00,521 --> 01:47:02,841
They went into the pool after playing rock-paper-scissors.

2935
01:47:03,191 --> 01:47:04,191
Seriously.

2936
01:47:04,401 --> 01:47:06,360
- Gosh, they're insane. - They're insane.

2937
01:47:06,361 --> 01:47:07,361
The water is really cold.

2938
01:47:08,101 --> 01:47:10,071
- Mimi is flustered. - It feels good.

2939
01:47:10,301 --> 01:47:11,470
Come on out.

2940
01:47:11,471 --> 01:47:12,841
- We'll do that. - Come on out.

2941
01:47:15,211 --> 01:47:18,081
(They hold hands and walk out of the pool.)

2942
01:47:18,611 --> 01:47:19,841
They're unpredictable.

2943
01:47:21,411 --> 01:47:22,511
It's best to be wild.

2944
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:24,250
(Let's cover them in towels.)

2945
01:47:24,251 --> 01:47:25,681
- Is it cool? - No.

2946
01:47:25,751 --> 01:47:28,951
But it's better than you expect. Right?

2947
01:47:29,551 --> 01:47:31,990
It feels like a cold shower.

2948
01:47:31,991 --> 01:47:33,960
If you get bored later on...

2949
01:47:33,961 --> 01:47:36,331
All right. Go inside and take a warm shower.

2950
01:47:37,491 --> 01:47:41,000
(They take a warm shower.)

2951
01:47:41,001 --> 01:47:42,771
(Feeling refreshed)

2952
01:47:43,871 --> 01:47:46,040
(The wet clothes get hung up...)

2953
01:47:46,041 --> 01:47:47,471
(in the sunny yard.)

2954
01:47:47,571 --> 01:47:49,870
(She's in a good mood.)

2955
01:47:49,871 --> 01:47:52,081
(It looked like they'd rest.)

2956
01:47:53,181 --> 01:47:54,281
You're bored, right?

2957
01:47:54,381 --> 01:47:56,181
- What? Yes. - Be honest.

2958
01:47:56,551 --> 01:47:57,881
That was why we entered the pool.

2959
01:47:58,981 --> 01:48:00,921
I'm dying of boredom.

2960
01:48:01,651 --> 01:48:03,521
Why aren't we doing anything?

2961
01:48:03,721 --> 01:48:05,060
(A list of things they've done is quite long.)

2962
01:48:05,061 --> 01:48:07,360
- Why aren't we doing anything? - Seriously.

2963
01:48:07,361 --> 01:48:08,361
Get a nap.

2964
01:48:09,131 --> 01:48:10,961
"Get a nap." He's stern.

2965
01:48:11,361 --> 01:48:12,901
"Get a nap. Be quiet. Stop filming."

2966
01:48:13,431 --> 01:48:16,001
- We don't even rest. - I don't feel like taking a nap.

2967
01:48:16,101 --> 01:48:18,340
We don't have content.

2968
01:48:18,341 --> 01:48:19,901
(Their mischievous moments)

2969
01:48:20,601 --> 01:48:23,311
(1. Stealing the remaining egg tarts at 1:30pm)

2970
01:48:23,541 --> 01:48:24,541
Have a battle.

2971
01:48:24,542 --> 01:48:26,841
(2. Having a sudden dance battle at 1:35pm)

2972
01:48:26,981 --> 01:48:28,351
(Regardless of the camera, )

2973
01:48:28,581 --> 01:48:30,511
(they dance.)

2974
01:48:30,751 --> 01:48:32,520
(It's good as long as you're happy.)

2975
01:48:32,521 --> 01:48:33,581
The battle starts.

2976
01:48:34,121 --> 01:48:36,751
(When one quiets down, another one begins.)

2977
01:48:37,191 --> 01:48:39,590
Let's see who can be more emotional.

2978
01:48:39,591 --> 01:48:40,591
(She becomes emotional right away.)
(I refuse to lose.)

2979
01:48:41,592 --> 01:48:43,360
- How emotional. - Be emotional.

2980
01:48:43,361 --> 01:48:45,300
Be emotional.

2981
01:48:45,301 --> 01:48:46,460
Is there something you want?

2982
01:48:46,461 --> 01:48:48,831
(She finally becomes a bit tired.)

2983
01:48:48,871 --> 01:48:51,100
Wait, Young Ji. Your hair isn't dry.

2984
01:48:51,101 --> 01:48:53,671
You need to do the hair-drying song.

2985
01:48:54,001 --> 01:48:55,870
- It isn't over. - There's...

2986
01:48:55,871 --> 01:48:57,411
- the hair-drying song. - Again...

2987
01:48:59,541 --> 01:49:01,040
(Despite being tired, )

2988
01:49:01,041 --> 01:49:02,681
(her body reacts to the song.)

2989
01:49:03,051 --> 01:49:04,480
- I'm in tears. - My goodness.

2990
01:49:04,481 --> 01:49:05,481
Go ahead.

2991
01:49:05,981 --> 01:49:06,981
It's the hair-drying song.

2992
01:49:06,982 --> 01:49:09,591
Young Ji doesn't dry her hair with a hair dryer.

2993
01:49:09,921 --> 01:49:12,561
Young Ji doesn't dry her hair with a hair dryer.

2994
01:49:12,661 --> 01:49:15,460
Natural wind. Weak wind.

2995
01:49:15,461 --> 01:49:17,060
Gentle wind.

2996
01:49:17,061 --> 01:49:18,730
- Strong wind. - Strong wind.

2997
01:49:18,731 --> 01:49:22,030
Very strong wind.

2998
01:49:22,031 --> 01:49:23,701
(Here comes the very strong wind.)

2999
01:49:23,801 --> 01:49:25,301
(Burning up her energy)

3000
01:49:25,571 --> 01:49:27,071
(Laughing)

3001
01:49:27,271 --> 01:49:28,870
(Panting)

3002
01:49:28,871 --> 01:49:31,911
- Let her rest. - Get some rest now.

3003
01:49:32,181 --> 01:49:34,611
- Get some rest. - Get some rest.

3004
01:49:34,751 --> 01:49:36,350
Shall we check out each other's pouches?

3005
01:49:36,351 --> 01:49:37,381
- Okay. - Okay.

3006
01:49:37,811 --> 01:49:40,151
A must-have item for a princess is a cute pouch.

3007
01:49:40,851 --> 01:49:42,691
(Sudden jegichagi at 2:10pm)

3008
01:49:42,891 --> 01:49:45,990
(Sudden jump-roping at 2:20pm)

3009
01:49:45,991 --> 01:49:47,061
How many have I done?

3010
01:49:47,821 --> 01:49:48,990
You should've counted.

3011
01:49:48,991 --> 01:49:50,367
(Again, no one asked them to do this.)

3012
01:49:50,391 --> 01:49:51,930
(The sad story is that they didn't rest for 4 hours.)

3013
01:49:51,931 --> 01:49:52,931
Ten.

3014
01:49:53,401 --> 01:49:55,031
It was so much fun, to be honest.

3015
01:49:55,201 --> 01:49:56,400
It feels like a school trip.

3016
01:49:56,401 --> 01:49:57,967
(The girls who don't get tired will come back as strong as ever.)

3017
01:49:57,991 --> 01:49:59,220
(Despite playing for 4 hours, )

3018
01:49:59,221 --> 01:50:00,490
(they want to play games.)

3019
01:50:00,491 --> 01:50:01,491
One, two, three.

3020
01:50:01,492 --> 01:50:03,360
(So they call Yeong Seok.)

3021
01:50:03,361 --> 01:50:05,330
(The unplanned 2-on-2 Charades)

3022
01:50:05,331 --> 01:50:07,560
(I can't lose to those fools.)

3023
01:50:07,561 --> 01:50:08,630
(Let go of me!)

3024
01:50:08,631 --> 01:50:09,777
(The terrible music pair gets back together.)

3025
01:50:09,801 --> 01:50:12,171
(This is how we turn the tables.)

3026
01:50:12,271 --> 01:50:14,641
(There was something they overlooked.)

3027
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:16,840
(In this game, they must get all 10 questions right.)

3028
01:50:16,841 --> 01:50:19,941
(Thus, the game won't end until they get all questions right.)

3029
01:50:20,041 --> 01:50:21,450
(Frustration is given.)

3030
01:50:21,451 --> 01:50:23,451
(Why did you do this?)

3031
01:50:23,551 --> 01:50:24,881
(You fool!)

3032
01:50:24,981 --> 01:50:26,320
(Swearing with her eyes)

3033
01:50:26,321 --> 01:50:28,790
(They can't get past a question.)

3034
01:50:28,791 --> 01:50:30,150
(What will we do if this goes on until winter?)

3035
01:50:30,151 --> 01:50:32,960
(Absorbed)

3036
01:50:32,961 --> 01:50:34,190
(What's the answer?)

3037
01:50:34,191 --> 01:50:36,260
(Yeong Seok becomes frustrated.)

3038
01:50:36,261 --> 01:50:39,561
(The slowest and worst charades in the history of variety shows)

3039
01:50:39,761 --> 01:50:41,771
(They go on a tour around Lisbon.)

3040
01:50:41,971 --> 01:50:43,871
(Due to the peaceful scenery, )

3041
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:48,411
(the E-cade members become calm.)

3042
01:50:48,511 --> 01:50:50,211
(But it doesn't last long.)

3043
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:51,680
(You opened a tteokbokki place and squandered money!)

3044
01:50:51,681 --> 01:50:53,680
(I told you to stop talking about businesses.)

3045
01:50:53,681 --> 01:50:56,050
(In the middle of a square in Lisbon, )

3046
01:50:56,051 --> 01:50:58,850
(the comedienne couple begins "Divorce Camp.")

3047
01:50:58,851 --> 01:51:01,850
(What will be the end of the dramatic story?)

3048
01:51:01,851 --> 01:51:02,927
(A must-visit restaurant in Lisbon)

3049
01:51:02,951 --> 01:51:04,821
(For the seafood rice and gambas al ajillo, )

3050
01:51:04,921 --> 01:51:06,390
(they play the Three-Word Karaoke.)

3051
01:51:06,391 --> 01:51:07,420
(The school bell)

3052
01:51:07,421 --> 01:51:09,030
(Rings and rings)

3053
01:51:09,031 --> 01:51:10,760
(Let's hurry up)

3054
01:51:10,761 --> 01:51:12,301
(And gather around)

3055
01:51:12,401 --> 01:51:13,401
(It's a success if they keep going until the end of the song.)

3056
01:51:13,402 --> 01:51:15,401
(If they fail, )

3057
01:51:15,501 --> 01:51:17,181
(the production crew will take some food.)

3058
01:51:17,701 --> 01:51:18,701
(Wrong)

3059
01:51:18,801 --> 01:51:19,801
(Wrong)

3060
01:51:19,802 --> 01:51:21,711
(The new game throws them off.)

3061
01:51:21,811 --> 01:51:23,310
(Gosh, it's too much.)

3062
01:51:23,311 --> 01:51:25,680
(Not much seafood rice remains.)

3063
01:51:25,681 --> 01:51:27,410
(Bo Gyeong, I thought you were better than that!)

3064
01:51:27,411 --> 01:51:29,411
(The ones who want to protect the food...)

3065
01:51:29,511 --> 01:51:32,051
(versus the ones who want to take the food)

3066
01:51:32,421 --> 01:51:35,921
(What will be the result of the fierce match over dinner?)

3067
01:51:36,951 --> 01:51:39,261
It looks like him. You're good at drawing.

3068
01:51:39,461 --> 01:51:40,501
It looks exactly like him.

3069
01:51:42,661 --> 01:51:44,530
Brother Yeong Seok.

3070
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:46,131
What? Is it milk?

3071
01:51:47,061 --> 01:51:49,671
It's the hardest to draw Brother Yeong Seok's face.

3072
01:51:52,041 --> 01:51:53,440
I see the resemblance.

3073
01:51:53,441 --> 01:51:54,571
He looks like a milk carton.

3074
01:51:55,511 --> 01:51:57,011
Young Ji, you're good at drawing.

3075
01:51:57,111 --> 01:51:58,241
Seriously.

3076
01:52:01,381 --> 01:52:02,381
My goodness.

3077
01:52:06,051 --> 01:52:07,680
- I see the resemblance. - She drew him well.

3078
01:52:07,681 --> 01:52:09,420
- You drew him well. - I see the resemblance.

3079
01:52:09,421 --> 01:52:11,590
- You drew him well. - Why does it look like him?

3080
01:52:11,591 --> 01:52:12,921
- Seriously. - You drew him well.

3081
01:52:14,691 --> 01:52:15,891
I'll make it my profile photo.

3082
01:52:16,531 --> 01:52:17,761
Why does it look like him?
