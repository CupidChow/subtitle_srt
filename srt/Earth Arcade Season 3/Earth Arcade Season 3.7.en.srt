89
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,430
All right.

90
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,930

(It's 9 to 9.)

102
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:13,696
- How is this possible? - Brother Yeong Seok.

103
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,189
Yu Jin, which one do you want to wear?

104
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,190
Be honest.

105
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,589

106
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,330

107
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,760
(Best friend)

108
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,060
Number one, the white one.

109
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
(A unanimous vote...)

110
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:24,660
(except for Young Ji)

111
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,200
How about you, Young Ji?

112
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,670
I don't know.

113
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,740
I think the navy one is prettier.

114
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,810
I think the navy one is prettier.

115
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,470
I'm sorry. Just pick the white one.

116
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,410
- Number one, the white one. - We're just staff members.

117
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,580
The navy one is prettier, okay?

118
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,810
Young Ji.

119
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,650
We don't get to choose, okay?

120
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,540
Just raise your hand when she tells you to.

121
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,650
Thank you.

What time is it?

125
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,390
- It's 12:16pm. - It's 12:16pm.

126
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,930
(It's the sunniest time of the day.)

127

131

133
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,429

136
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,839
You guys are heading outside to get acquainted with Lisbon.

137

Yes.

138
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:38,869
If it's possible while traveling today,

139
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,309
take one cool photo...

140
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,980
for a photography contest.

141
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
That's a good idea.

142
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:47,010

When it's time, turn in one photo.

00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,859
The photos will be judged fairly by Director Chang Dae...

147
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,390
and other members of the camera team.

148
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,989
The winner will be...

149
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,960
this episode's ending fairy.

150
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,770
The winning photo will be shown for more than 30 seconds.

151
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,470
The winner's face...

152
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,010
in its best state will be shown as well.

153
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,569
- Nice. - That's what I want the most.

154
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,410
- Really? There's a theme. - A theme.

155
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,009
(The theme is...)

156
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,049
(Pure, passion, Portugal)

157
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,380
- Three Ps. - Three Ps.

158
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,989
Take a photo that suits these keywords.

159
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,466
Then we'll have the photography contest...

160
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,989
and the winner will be the ending fairy.

161
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,159
- Isn't that great? - What about the person...

162
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,190
without a phone?

163
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,360
What? You don't have a phone.

164
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,459
- When we planned it out... - But...

165
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,430
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

166
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,430
Six hours remain.

167
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,870
Must I go alone?

168
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,540
I'll be bored by myself. I don't even have a phone.

169
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,439
You can call someone and meet up later.

170
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,569
How am I supposed to call someone...

171
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,579
if I don't have a phone?

172
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,179
- It looks tasty, right? - It's fascinating.

173
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,779
You guys are too much. All of you guys.

174
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,879
How does it taste?

175
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,026
I'm so curious about how they'll capture purity and passion.

176
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,150
Let's go.

177
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,749
Girls, have fun.

178
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,750
Bye.

179
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:03,720
Bye. Ciao.

180
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,859
Where should I go?

181
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,930
You can go anywhere.

182
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,130
(She finds it funny too.)

183
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,600
- Mimi, where are you going? - Me? This place.

184
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,869
(Confeitaria, a bakery that's about 200 years old)

185
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,400
I want to tag along and have a bite.

186
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,470
Can she do that?
(Yes, she can.)

187
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:19,569
(Young Ji will go on a dessert tour with Mimi.)

188
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,769
(Eun Ji will be free from her babysitting duties.)

189
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,170
(Being the Perceiver, Yu Jin will enjoy a spontaneous trip.)

190
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,450
(4 people will travel freely in 3 different ways.)

191
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,450
I have a plan.

192
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,149
I'll go to this souvenir shop...

193
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,820
and buy presents for the members.

194
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,020
I thought of a photo that'll be perfect for the three Ps.

195
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,660
Firstly,

196
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,430
purity. Purity reminds me of a smiley face.

197
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,800
I want to include a pure and smiley face.

198
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,370
Passion.

199
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:49,840
I thought about how to express passion.

200
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,040
Shall I carry a lot of shopping bags?

201
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,510
"I shopped passionately."

202
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,970
However,

203
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:57,609
I don't know if you'll look pure while holding the shopping bags.

204
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,610
You have a point.

205
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,580
Won't I look too greedy?

206
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,949
- But the items inside the bags... - Okay.

207
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,119
Will show my pure love for the members.

208
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,250
It's a good idea.

209
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,189
(She brainstorms the theme during the drive.)

210
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,489
Gosh, it's so pretty.

211
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,960
(She arrives at her destination.)

212
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,259
It's pretty. The weather is so nice.

213
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,130
The weather is amazing today.

214
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,230
There are so many hills.

215
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
Passion.

216
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:25,099
(Climbing up a hill with passion)

217
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,340
(Candidate 1, Between a Hill and Passion)

218
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Passion.

219
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,610
- I hear music. - Yes.

220
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,909
(My goodness)

221
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,280
He's pretty good.

222
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,619
(People are doing street dance in the square.)

223
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,549
Can we do the Random Play Dance outside?

224
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,220
- Seriously. We should do that. - Yes.

225
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,060
I think we'll be popular.

226
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,330
It's so cool.

227
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,500
When the sunlight hits me, the temperature is perfect.

228
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,940
(She walks and walks as she enjoys the weather.)

229
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,210
- There are so many people. - It's a busy street.

230
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,010
This place is so pretty.

231
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,420
(Trams and funiculars pass through the alleys here.)

232
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,550
(Everyone stops and takes photos at this photo spot.)

233
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,260
(It's a must-visit place when you travel to Lisbon.)

234
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,590
It's so pretty.

235
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,550
Shall I pose with this funicular?

236
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,790
This funicular is following me.

237
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,189
Good.

238
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,259
(I run while other people stand.)

239
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
Good.

240
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:26,030
(Candidate 2, Between Funicular and Passion)

241
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,370
(Singing)

242
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,640
(She can't help but hum.)

243
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,670
That's the place.

244
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,340
How cute.

245
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,940
Hello.

246
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,480
Yes. This is it.

247
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,680
I was so curious about the Nata hand cream.

248
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,660
(She searches for it thoroughly, but she can't find it.)

249
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,090
It must be downstairs.

250
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,790
Let's go.

251
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,290
For Mimi... Gosh, it's hard.

252
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,500
(Impressed)

253
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,360
Chocolate biscuit.

254
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,900
Will Mimi like it?

255
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,100
I think she'll really like it. It's 9.5 dollars.

256
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,239
It's piri-piri sauce. Wouldn't it be spicy?

257
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,009
The piri-piri sauce is famous here.

258
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,239
- Is it spicy? - Yes.

259
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,979
- I'll get it for Young Ji. - That's a good idea.

260
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,179
- All right. I think she'll like it. - Yes. I think she'll like it.

261
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,419
- I have Young Ji's present. - Yes.

262
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,900
(Young Ji's present, piri-piri sauce)

263
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,689
Shall I get Mimi that Nata hand cream?

264
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,990
I think she'll like it.

265
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,430
- Mimi... - She likes egg tarts.

266
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,160
Thank you. Let's go.

267
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,790
- Shall I keep going up? - Yes.

268
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,429
Gosh, it's ice cream.

269
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,510
(She walks for 10 minutes.)

270
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,330
Benamor is coming up.

271
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,099
(Benamor is a natural beauty brand that began in Lisbon in 1925.)

272
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,416
(Due to its variety and scents, it's famous as a souvenir.)

273
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,510
Here it is.

274
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,210
(She finds a hand cream with the egg tart scent.)

275
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,150
It smells like butter.

276
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,679
Butter.

277
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,710
(Oh, my!)

278
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,550
I don't think it's half bad.

279
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,180
Nata hand cream.

280
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,719
(She gets an egg tart hand cream as Mimi's present.)

281
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,150
- Is it for Mimi? - It's for Mimi.

282
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,990
This is for me.

283
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,930
(She gets herself a present too.)

284
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,259
Eun Ji?

285
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,499
(She's still thinking about what to get for Eun Ji.)

286
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,700
Eun Ji likes purple.

287
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,099
Shall I get her a soap?

288
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
What?

289
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:08,430
It isn't a sardine soap,

290
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,340
but I'll get her this.

291
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,699
- Thank you. - Thank you.

292
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,840
Have a nice day.

293
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,870
The weather is so nice.

294
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,909
It's so pretty.

295
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,030
(While walking, they find another pretty photo spot.)

296
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,610
(A passionate shopping photo she planned earlier)

297
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,219
(Let's run with presents.)

298
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,090
(Candidate 3, Between Shopping and Passion)

299
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,890
What do you think? Do I look passionate?

300
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,489
- It's nice. - Is it okay?

301
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,530
Yes, it's nice.

302
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,060
Good.

303
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,300
This place is pretty.

304
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,060
(She enjoys coffee at a terrace cafe.)

305
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,400
Three cold brews?

306
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,270
- Please wait. - Okay.

307
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,170
I want a pistachio cookie as well.

308
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,210
Don't you want a dessert?

309
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,079
(She's hungry from all that walking.)

310
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,379
I'll eat a pistachio cookie.

311
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,380
Okay.

312
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:55,610
(The model works hard after ordering)

313
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,019
(Taking photos)

314
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,419
(Laughing)

315
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,949
(Candidate 4, Passion in Front of a Cafe)

316
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,560
Thank you.

317
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,020
Can I leave it here?

318
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,990
(Laughing)

319
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,799
(She laughs with every step.)

320
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,260
(Candidate 4, Laughter and Passion)

321
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,770
(She finally takes a bite of the dessert.)

322
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,270
I'm copying Eun Ji.

323
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,680
(She has only learned comedy.)

324
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,710
It's tasty.

325
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,510
It's so tasty.

326
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,020
(She isn't done taking photos.)

327
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,920
(Candidate 6, Passion of Her Off Days)

328
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,430
There are so many photos I like.

329
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,670
(Which photo will be used for the contest?)

330
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,070
(Meanwhile)

331
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,940
I'm so happy right now.

332
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,970
I can't stop smiling.

333
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,540
This is the moment I wanted.

334
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,710
Everyone, be quiet for a second and listen to this sound.

335
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,149
Aside from the time when we were sleeping,

336
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,050
have you heard such sounds back in the lodging?

337
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,859
- It's the first time. - It's quiet.

338
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,990
It's quiet.

339
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,430
What's this place?

340
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,590
It must be a hip place.

341
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,870
(She arrives at a place to enjoy her freedom.)

342
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,129
(LX Factory is a textile factory that got turned into...)

343
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,369
(a cultural complex of arts and design.)

344
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,416
(It's Lisbon's trendy place that has shops, cafes, and design stores.)

345
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,370
(A bookstore that's full of books is the most popular.)

346
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,240
I love such an atmosphere.

347
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,709
It's the atmosphere where you drink beer during the day.

348
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,510
Yes, it's the atmosphere I want.

349
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,580
That's right. This is Europe. Right? This is Lisbon.

350
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,219
It isn't about running a kids' cafe back in the lodging.

351
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,490
So this is the vibe.

352
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,159
Let's have a glass of beer each.

353
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,529
I understand why...

354
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,700
moms eagerly wait for their children to go to the kindergarten.

355
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,660
There's a bookstore on the second floor.

356
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,799
Gosh, Young Ji said that she wanted to read.

357
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,300
She wanted to check out a bookstore.

358
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,600
But I won't think about the girls today.

359
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,710
Even a mom needs freedom.

360
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,640
Gosh, the vibe is no joke. It's so pretty.

361
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,840
- Over there... - What is it?

362
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,380
Producer Na.

363
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,680
- What are you doing here? - I bought a book.

364
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,790
I see why moms struggle...

365
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,060
when their children come back from kindergarten.

366
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,789
- Are you happy right now? - I'm going insane.

367
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,360
(Laughing)

368
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,260
I'm getting a dopamine rush.

369
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,899
We've never felt...

370
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,369
- this kind of quietness... - Enjoy.

371
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,829
In this season.

372
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,470
- Enjoy your free time. - I'll really enjoy it.

373
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,310
I like this terrace cafe.

374
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,010
We need to eat an octopus.

375
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,980
This taco looks tasty.

376
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,680
Thank you.

377
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,930
Now that my children are gone, I finally feel like I'm living.

378
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,650
For our everlasting...

379
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,119
Married Women's Union,

380
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,520
- cheers. - Cheers.

381
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,990
(It's refreshing.)

382
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,230
Thank you.
(The dishes get served one at a time.)

383
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:58,300
Octopus.

384
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,469
(Tender octopus dish...)

385
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,970
(and hearty chicken tacos)

386
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,170
Octopus dishes are famous here.

387
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,980
(She slices the tender octopus.)

388
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,650
I just tried the octopus.

389
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,060
A piece of an octopus just disappeared in my mouth.

390
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,390
(This time, she eats a big piece.)

391
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,630
(This is it.)

392
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,670
(She eats a chicken taco as well.)

393
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,270
It's so tasty. It's the best.

394
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,270
I'll look up Portugal on Google.

395
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,279
I want to wear a traditional costume of Portugal...

396
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,950
and have my photos taken at the square I visited yesterday.

397
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,140
If the traditional costume doesn't work out,

398
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,050
I want to put a big flag around my body.

399
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,820
I want to draw a mustache here.

400
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,690
(She quickly decides on a style for the photo shoot.)

401
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,000
The kids will be back soon.

402
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,640
(The peaceful daytime beer break comes to an end.)

403
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,439
(She arrives at a props shop nearby.)

404
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,570
I like it.

405
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,740
(She enters a place that's full of props.)

406
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,910
What should I do? I want to live here.

407
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,710
I want to live here.

408
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,250
I'm so happy. What should I do? I'm so excited right now.

409
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,719
Gosh, look at this.

410
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,419
(She calms herself down and picks a costume.)

411
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,060
I think the white one will be prettier for photos.

412
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,629
Do you know how it feels?

413
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,306
It feels like I'm in the props room for "Comedy Big League."

414
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,500
It feels great.

415
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,599
There are many funny items.

416
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,170
I'm going to win this contest.

417
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,139
I'm going to win this contest.

418
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,776
(A former "Comedy Big League" member fears nothing if she has props.)

419
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,240
A mustache. This mustache isn't bad.

420
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,609
(The props turn comedic.)

421
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,410
It'll be perfect if I have a strange, lousy wig.

422
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,749
(She approaches the contest in an unnatural way.)

423
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,579
This one and... Something like this...

424
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,020
Something like this is annoying.

425
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,050
It annoys you.

426
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,760
I think it'll be nice.

427
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,920
How is this place so perfect?

428
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,270
The Photogenic Award isn't anything important.

429
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,830
I don't know. I still want it.

430
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,600
(She moves to the square with all of her props.)

431
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,610
Oh, no. I really want to place first.

432
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,639
If it's a contest of making people laugh.

433
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,940
I go insane.

434
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,339
(It isn't a contest of making people laugh.)

435
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,379
Here.

436
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,479
(Checking the props she bought)

437
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,150
- Like this. - You look pretty like this.

438
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,219
I need to put it on and make myself look funny.

439
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,419
It isn't funny. It's pretty.

440
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,820
It's pretty, so I can't use it.

441
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,149
I love it so much.

442
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,420
(She combs and prepares a wig.)

443
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
(She puts them on the headrest one at a time.)

444
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,060
Here.

445
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,090
Don't I seem like a traveling performer?

446
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,560
Everything around me...

447
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,000
Feathers are flying and all,

448
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,830
so I seem like a traveling performer.

449
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,200
(A bit later)

450
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,110
(Ta-da)

451
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,440
You look pretty.

452
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,209
(She's very satisfied already.)

453
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,210
I'm a bit shy...

454
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:03,449
because there's the danger of meeting Korean people.

455
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,550
How do I look?

456
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,990
- Nice. - Nice,

457
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,219
I saw a scarf in the shape of the Portuguese flag...

458
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,390
at a uniform store yesterday.

459
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,760
- This is better. It's all red. - It's red.

460
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,160
(She puts on a mustache.)

461
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,930
(She's ready for the photos.)

462
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,130
- Do I look great with Ronaldo? - Yes.

463
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,039
(She gets a photo taken with the Portuguese star.)

464
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,910
(Candidate 1, Portugal's Ronaldo and Me)

465
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,480
I'm so satisfied.

466
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,379
I'm so satisfied. Okay.

467
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,940
- Let's go to the square. - The square.

468
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,280
Let's get my full-body shot with the statue.

469
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,650
(Candidate 2, Portugal's Statue and Me)

470
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,020
I want to pose like I'm driving.

471
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,059
Thank you.

472
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,936
(She lets her take a photo in the driver's seat.)

473
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,860
(She's more serious than anyone about this photography contest.)

474
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,030
Let's end it with a seal shot. Then I'll be done.

475
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,370
(Candidate 2, Portugal's Tuk-Tuk and Me)

476
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,740
(Which photo will be used for the photography contest?)

477
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,540
- Mimi. - Young Ji.

478
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,079
Hurry over here.

479
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,109
Who knows what will happen if I pay first?

480
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,509
- Haven't you paid? - No.

481
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,849
- Gosh. - I wanted to enter with you.

482
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,950
What's wrong with you?

483
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,649
Apparently, this place is 200 years old.

484
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,090
This place is 200 years old.

485
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,990
(Various pastries welcome them as soon as they enter.)

486
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,929
(The Korean word for bread, "Ppang," mostly likely comes...)

487
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,399
(from the Portuguese word for bread, "Pao.")

488
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,406
(It's believed that Catholic missionaries spread it.)

489
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,570
- What do you want to eat? - How about you?

490
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,670
Let's try their egg tarts too.

491
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,299
I don't even need to eat.

492
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,710
Just let me watch you eat.

493
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,309
This cake looks tasty.

494
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,440
Let's order one then.

495
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,210
There's salt bread, Mimi.

496
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,150
Salt bread. Is it salt bread?

497
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,410
Let's try it. I'm curious.

498
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,930
- Mimi, doesn't it look tasty? - Which drink...

499
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,749
It looks tasty.

500
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,819
(Young Ji even picks from other people's orders.)

501
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,660
- What's that? - We need to pick.

502
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
Thank you.

503
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:55,361
(The second-oldest sister pays for Young Ji.)

504
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,360
I'll enjoy them. Seriously.

505
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,969
I'll enjoy them. You didn't need to pay for me.

506
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,240
It's nothing, Young Ji.

507
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,800
It's nice to go on a date with you.

508
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,969
- Are you cold? - What?

509
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,109
- Are you cold? - No.

510
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,410
Take photos of me from there.

511
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,180
(Photographer of the day)

512
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,610
(She carries out the photo mission from time to time.)

513
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,420
Make sure I look pretty in the photos.

514
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,790
Okay.

515
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,460
(Candidate, Purity of Waiting for the Pastries)

516
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,019
(Your order is here.)

517
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,340
- Thank you very much. Oh, my gosh. - Thank you very much.

518
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,699
Since you paid for my order,

519
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,900
- I'll take many photos. - Okay.

520
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,530
- Thank you. - Thank you.

521
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,930
- Obrigado. - Obrigado.

522
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,000
- Isn't "Obrigado" for men? - Obrigada.

523
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,240
(They start with an egg tart.)

524
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,539
(Humming in approval)

525
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,910
Their egg tart is tasty too.

526
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,080
It's so tasty. Isn't their egg tart tasty?

527
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,680
It's so tasty.

528
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,450
- How is it so tasty? - It's tasty.

529
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,289
(Mimi, try this one.)

530
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,889
Is it tasty?

531
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,260
(The next target is a muffin.)

532
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,099
(She takes photo of Mimi while she eats bread naturally.)

533
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,760
- It's tasty, right? - It's tasty.

534
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,070
(Checking the result)

535
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,299
I took a nice photo, right?

536
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,800
(Candidate 782)

537
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,640
What will you do after this?

538
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,740
How about you? What's your plan?

539
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,510
(Neither one of them has a plan.)

540
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,020
It'll be insane.

541
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,620
Do you live here?

542
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,790
- No. - Then...

543
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,831
- We're on our honeymoon. - We're on our honeymoon.

544
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,159
Congratulations.

545
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,396
(They run into the newlyweds who are on their honeymoon.)

546
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,089
What are you filming?

547
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,359
- What? Earth Arcade? - Earth Arcade?

548
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,129
- No, it isn't that show. - No.

549
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,199
"Begin Again."

550
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,229
("Begin Again" ended 2 years ago.)

551
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,829
- "Sea of Hope." - "Sea of Hope?"

552
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,370
- Yes. - We're filming "Begin Again."

553
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,069
Someone mentioned Earth Arcade...

554
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,570
- on YouTube. - Yes.

555
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,369
- It isn't Earth Arcade. - It isn't Earth Arcade.

556
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,109
- It isn't Earth Arcade. - "Sea of Hope."

557
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,240
"Sea of Hope."

558
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,680
Please recommend a good restaurant.

559
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,950
What do you like?

560
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,420
- Street food. - Street food.

561
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,089
Have you tried the fries?

562
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,689
- No. - Fries? No.

563
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,859
Where should we go to?

564
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,559
- It's called the Potato Project. - Mimi, let's go there.

565
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,729
- Potato Project. - Potato Project.

566
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,389
- Okay. - Mimi, hurry up.

567
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,559
The garlic fries are tasty.

568
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,599
Really?

569
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,900
(They decide on their next destination.)

570
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,499
- Thank you. - Thank you.

571
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,139
- Thank you. - Please live happily.

572
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,439
Thank you.

573
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,269
Please watch "Sea of Hope."

574
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,309
- Yes. - "Sea..."

575
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,670
- "Sea of Hope." - "Sea of Hope."

576
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,239
(We hope all of their wishes will come true.)

577
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,540
- Bye. - Bye.

578
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,850
Mimi.

579
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,450
Mimi, look at them. They aren't running away.

580
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,950
(Pigeons they didn't call over approach them.)

581
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,019
Mimi, look at these pigeons.

582
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,389
(Please watch carefully if you're scared of birds.)

583
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,990
Please take a photo of me.

584
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,041
This moment captures Portugal. Please take a photo of me.

585
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,000
(She only thinks about the photography contest.)

586
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,130
Please take it with the pigeons.

587
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,099
- Come here. - They're coming.

588
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,670
They're coming from the back.

589
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,240
Oh, my gosh. There are three.

590
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,010
Hold on. I'll take a photo.

591
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,080
Make a shocked face.

592
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,009
(Stage 1)

593
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,549
(Stage 2)

594
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,550
(Stage 3)
All done.

595
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:04,919
(Stage 4)

596
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,020
Why aren't you scared of pigeons?

597
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,049
Me? Why would I be scared of them? We have many pigeons in Korea.

598
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,720
Why are they so unafraid?

599
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,860
Pigeons in Korea are worse, Young Ji.

600
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
- Really? - Yes.

601
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,950
- Is the lemonade tasty? - Yes, it's tasty.

602
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,576
Thank you for the food, Mimi. I'll take more photos of you.

603
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,669
Take a photo of me so that you'll be distracted.

604
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,729
Mimi.

605
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,200
(Crashing)

606
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,869
(Did a car accident suddenly occur?)

607
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:27,910
Is it an accident?

608
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,840
(Everyone freezes.)

609
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,359
Take a photo of me so that you'll be distracted.

610
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,459
Mimi.

611
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,890
(Crashing)

612
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,559
(Did a car accident suddenly occur?)

613
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,590
Is it an accident?

614
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,500
(Everyone freezes.)

615
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,170
What's going on today?

616
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,340
This is Portugal.

617
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,069
Let's think that this is Portugal.

618
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,110
That's right.

619
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,070
Mimi, do this.

620
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,310
(Asking her to act)

621
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,910
What's this?

622
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,780
Pretend to have a conversation with me.

623
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,720
That's it.

624
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
(Something just passed by.)

625
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,730
(Rewind the moment.)

626
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,700
(A pigeon comes hurtling toward Young Ji.)

627
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,070
(She got completely caught off guard.)

628
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,470
(Meanwhile, this picture was taken.)

629
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,070
(Hello.)

630
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,439
Goodness, it's coming toward Young Ji.

631
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,070
It's coming.

632
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,509
Where are you going? No.

633
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,410
- Take a picture of me with it. - I will.

634
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,590
I'll take a picture of you and the pigeon.

635
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,149
It's coming.

636
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,050
(As Mimi slowly approaches the pigeon, )

637
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,160
(the table is left unattended.)

638
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,430
No.

639
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,490
(Their table is instantly taken over.)

640
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,399
No. Mimi, take pictures. No.

641
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,546
(Mimi takes pictures, as requested.)

642
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,029
(An employee fends off the pigeons.)

643
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,500
(An enemy of pigeons)

644
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,710
(She's still in shock.)

645
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,309
(But that wasn't the end.)

646
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,310
No.

647
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,209
(She shouted "No" dozens of times.)

648
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,120
No.

649
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,950
(She even flailed her arms and legs to drive the pigeons off.)

650
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,860
- They ate all of these. - You go.

651
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,860
Go away.

652
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,330
Pay for your own food.

653
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,300
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

654
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,169
- Hey! - Don't!

655
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,270
(The unashamed pigeons keep on attacking them.)

656
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
No.

657
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:30,510
(The pigeons have now broken a glass.)

658
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,570
Stay calm. Guys.

659
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:39,250
(Aren't you supposed to be a symbol of peace?)

660
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,679
What can we do?

661
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,600
(Mimi and Young Ji are stunned from the get-go.)

662
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,889
Su Gyeong, you just ran away.

663
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,960
Should you...

664
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,129
- We're done eating. - It's fine.

665
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,606
We were able to finish almost everything.

666
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,330
I don't think we should keep eating.

667
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,329
- Did you take pictures? - I did. A lot of them.

668
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,629
I took good ones of you.

669
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,930
- You did? - I took good ones.

670
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
(Candidate 1, Young Ji and Pigeons)
(Candidate 2, Young Ji and Pigeons 2)

671
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:02,870
(Candidate 3, Young Ji and Pigeons 3)

672
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,839
- We're just... - The pigeons attacked...

673
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,239
us while we were eating.

674
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,879
- Anyone would have been afraid. - We were eating...

675
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,439
and we just stood up for pictures.

676
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,479
(The shock hasn't worn off yet.)

677
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,979
- But what's strange is... - Yes?

678
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,519
- that the pigeons only came to us. - Right.

679
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,390
- Just us. We were an easy target. - That's right.

680
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,820
(The other tables were left in peace.)

681
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,159
- The waiters... - Yes.

682
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,629
Just used their hands to grab them.

683
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,836
(She's desperately sugarcoating her memory.)

684
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,599
When 200 pigeons swarmed in at the end,

685
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,100
an employee came to us with a smile and he...

686
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,340
(Reenacting)

687
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,369
You'll see it in the footage later.

688
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,769
- Maybe he loves pigeons. - Maybe.

689
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,410
Like how people love puppies.

690
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,209
Mimi, over here.

691
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,450
This is it? Fries?

692
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,049
- Do you like fries? - I do.

693
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,750
- You do, right? - Yes.

694
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,679
- Hello. - Hello.

695
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,990
(They're here for fries, which Mimi and Young Ji love.)

696
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,319
(Freshly made fries...)

697
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,830
(are drizzled with sauce...)

698
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,690
(and shaken so they mix well.)

699
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,430
(The fries are put in a container and finished off with toppings.)

700
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,270
That's a lot of food.

701
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,610
They look so good.

702
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,740
Gosh, thank you.

703
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,856
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

704
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,680
(As soon as she puts a fry into her mouth...)

705
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,650
Thank you so much, Koreans.

706
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,019
We were actually filming for E-cade.

707
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,500
Let's get away from the crowd. How about we go sit over there?

708
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,230
(They move to the perfect spot to sit and enjoy their fries.)

709
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,259
This is seriously the best food I've had so far in Portugal.

710
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,500
Yes, it's so good.

711
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,170
Koreans.

712
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,530
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

713
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,540
I want to feed this to them.

714
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,570
- To that person? - No.

715
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,370
Our members.

716
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,910
(Gosh, I forgot about them.)

717
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,209
- This is really good. - It really is.

718
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,809
- Go ahead and eat, guys. - Eat.

719
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,149
Come sit with us and eat.

720
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,480
Film us when we're swarmed by pigeons.

721
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,050
(Pigeons: "You'll film us if we come by?")

722
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,659
(They say you should never let your guard down.)

723
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,760
(Pigeon)

724
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,630
That's so funny.

725
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,160
(Pigeon 2)

726
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,230
(Screams)

727
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,310
(Chaos)

728
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,410
(This can't be happening.)

729
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,280
Let's run away.

730
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,909
(Everyone went into a frenzy as pigeons began showing up.)

731
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,410
- Not again. - I mean,

732
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,110
we were just talking about them.

733
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,270
It could be that we're haunted by pigeon spirits.

734
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,020
Are they following us?

735
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
(You're the same ones from earlier, right?)

736
00:27:32,221 --> 00:27:33,659
- Where should we go? - The square.

737
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,690
The square.

738
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,260
(Let's go to the square.)

739
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,429
Will there be any of them there? I don't think so, right?

740
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,529
- Pigeons? - Yes.

741
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,730
The pigeons show up wherever we are.

742
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,169
It's not that we show up to where...

743
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,829
- the pigeons are. - It's not?

744
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,700
- We were here yesterday. - Yes.

745
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,769
You see how there aren't any pigeons here?

746
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,040
Not a single pigeon in sight.

747
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,379
We'll stand here for one minute, and if pigeons don't fly over,

748
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,379
- we'll stop. - Then we'll stop.

749
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
It won't be necessary then.

750
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,049
(They're testing out their pigeon spirit theory.)

751
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,319
(A meaningless test to see...)

752
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,726
(if pigeons start swarming them within 1 minute.)

753
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,249
- If pigeons fly to us, - Yes?

754
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,850
Then I'll seriously...

755
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,520
believe that we're haunted today.

756
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,589
There's literally none right now.

757
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,959
- Not a single one. - There aren't any pigeons here.

758
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,200
- We should have done this earlier. - Right.

759
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,700
(As soon as they noticed out loud there weren't any pigeons...)

760
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,340
Why are birds suddenly showing up?

761
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,270
That was definitely a pigeon.

762
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,010
I saw it too. Wait.

763
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,510
Look. There they come.

764
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,380
Wait. Why are they beginning to show up?

765
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,810
Where should we stand?

766
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,449
Let's go where there aren't many people.

767
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,749
- Somewhere good to film. - By that streetlight.

768
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,219
- By the streetlight over there. - Sure.

769
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,250
- One minute. - We're doing this for a minute.

770
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,160
Right here.

771
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,390
(Let the minute begin.)

772
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,929
Can you take pictures of us?

773
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,936
(As soon as they start the test, a seagull flies by.)

774
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,200
(Feeling uneasy)

775
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,069
(I can't do this.)

776
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,470
Wait. Young Ji!

777
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,110
Come back. Hurry.

778
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,750
Mimi, we're in danger.

779
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,120
(They passed the test in approximately 20 seconds.)

780
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,920
(Where are you going?)

781
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,389
Please come back.

782
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,550
(Mimi is kind of scared too.)

783
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,859
We can't stay here. There are so many of them.

784
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,919
No. There are more coming.

785
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,730
(The presence of the two of them...)

786
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,900
Young Ji. Hurry, take pictures of us.

787
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,100
(caused this unbelievable festivity of birds.)

788
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,570
(Let's gather in front of Parrot Mim.)

789
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,210
(Hand over mouth)

790
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,869
(She hides the pastry she was holding in her hand.)

791
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,240
No. This can't be happening.

792
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,610
Mimi.

793
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:38,780
(Young Ji keeps on repeating "No.")

794
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,720
Young Ji, come back.

795
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,080
(Frozen in place)

796
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,460
How is this even real?

797
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,020
Look at the photographers.

798
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,060
(Photographers are moving crowding around Mimi at this rare sight.)

799
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,000
(Candidate 2, The Animal Whisperer)

800
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,500
(Candidate 3, Seagulls Can Dream)

801
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,840
Mimi.

802
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,970
You called over seagulls, not pigeons.

803
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,570
You scared me.

804
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,140
Never before in my life...

805
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,610
did I have a similar experience.

806
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,780
Let's go.

807
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,850
Can we just go home?

808
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,190
Let's go home.

809
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,419
Did you still have fun with me?

810
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,590
Yes, so much fun.

811
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,190
(The fun self-guided travel ends here.)

812
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,929
How are they doing?

813
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,329
Are they being funny or pretty?

814
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,529
- We're not sure yet. - You haven't... I see.

815
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,270
Let's see. I'm not even hoping to win first place.

816
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,976
I feel like they would have put their all into the pictures.

817
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,140
Especially Eun Ji.

818
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
Smile.

819
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,440
(Her passion for the best photo knows no end.)

820
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,610
Thank you.

821
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,650
(That's it for both the travel and the photos.)

822
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,950
(All photos have been submitted.)

823
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,249
We will now begin the contest.

824
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,259
Each of the artists will...

825
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,589
- Goodness. - explain their photos.

826
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,629
- Yes. - And then our camera directors...

827
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,070
will take that into consideration...

828
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,029
as they judge the pictures strictly without any emotion...

829
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,299
- Without any emotion. - to choose who will win.

830
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,469
They'll judge without any emotion.

831
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,029
- All right. Car number one. - Car number one.

832
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,500
- An Yu Jin. - An Yu Jin.

833
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,739
- Okay. - Please explain your photo.

834
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,170
Give us a detailed explanation.

835
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,269
- What? - That's amazing.

836
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,140
- Gosh. - You ate a lot.

837
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,010
(Yu Jin's final submission)

838
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,386
(Her fierce determination to fit everything in one bite is clear.)

839
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,579
- All right. - What is it?

840
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,750
Our theme was the three Ps.

841
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,619
Number one, purity.

842
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,789
- Purity. - See how pure this is?

843
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,089
The purity of myself as I focus on the food.

844
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,019
- Number two, passion. - Passion.

845
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,029
My passion to fit everything in one bite.

846
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,636
(Number 2: Her passion to fit everything in one bite)

847
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,399
- Even your hair. - That's passion.

848
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,770
It's perfect.

849
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,599
And then, Portugal.

850
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,570
You see these buildings behind me?

851
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,339
- It reflects the Portuguese vibe. - The Portuguese buildings.

852
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,869
With a Portuguese backdrop,

853
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,239
- you passionately ate... - Yes.

854
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,579
- Portuguese food. - Passionately.

855
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,649
I want to know what this food was.

856
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,579
This was a pistachio croissant.

857
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,719
- That sounds amazing. - That's Portugal as a food.

858
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,619
- Yes, it's famous for pistachio. - That's Portugal as a food.

859
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,089
That's clearly a mild photo.

860
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,360
- Thank you. - Who's next?

861
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,890
Car number two.

862
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,306
- Car number two. - I caught a glimpse and it's great.

863
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,730
Gosh. I caught a glimpse and it's great.

864
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,499
- I used my own money for the props. - Yes, passion.

865
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,769
- That already shows your passion. - Passion.

866
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,099
Personally, I can already tell...

867
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,340
that Young Ji would love this photo.

868
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,440
I'll show you. One, two, three.

869
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,670
That's amazing.

870
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,509
(Let's see the photo she took with the props she bought herself.)

871
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,540
That's amazing.

872
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,380
This is great.

873
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,250
- Gosh, Eun Ji. - I know.

874
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,679
- Young Ji would love this. - This should be first place.

875
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,849
You get what I mean, right?

876
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,949
- This should be the first place. - This is great.

877
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,349
This should be the first place.

878
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,920
There's nothing pure about this.

879
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,489
Pure? Check out my armpit over here.

880
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,159
My armpit is as pure as snow.

881
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,999
See how pure my armpit is?

882
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,059
I got my armpits lasered.

883
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,146
(She's referring to laser hair removal.)

884
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,829
- This will clearly win first place. - All right, it's pure.

885
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,239
- Passion. - I know Yu Jin personally loves...

886
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,369
when I smile like this.

887
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,139
- She calls it "Happy Seal." - That's insanely good.

888
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,709
- This is amazing. - Her picture is so good.

889
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,309
And the third "P," Portugal.

890
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,639
- Portugal. - Portugal.

891
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,619
My passionate smile and wig.

892
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,850
And purity.

893
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,219
My clean armpit.

894
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,389
Those are the three P's?

895
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,149
Even the sky looks beautiful.

896
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,619
This is a strong candidate.

897
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,320
Her armpit is really clean and pure.

898
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,759
(The happy seal is proud of having gotten laser hair removal.)

899
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,059
This is amazing.

900
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,500
(Number 3 and 4)

901
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,230
(Only 2 photos are left.)

902
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:21,099
The 3rd and 4th photos are part of a continuous set.

903
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,169
This one is the beginning of the sequence.

904
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,670
(Mimi's photo is the third one.)

905
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,509
- Ta-da. - Ta-da.

906
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,579
- It's mild. - It embodies purity.

907
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,939
- It's pure. - Where's the passion?

908
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,779
First of all,

909
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,679
my eyes hold passion.

910
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,279
This store is a 200-year-old...

911
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,249
- shop that's famous for... - It's a famous dessert shop.

912
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,389
Its dessert.

913
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,290
The point of this picture is...

914
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,990
(She's the only 1 person who knows.)

915
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,800
that this was right before I got attacked.

916
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,706
- A second before you were attacked. - This pigeon was flying toward us.

917
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,830
(The way it flew toward them is still astounding.)

918
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,169
- It literally flew toward us. - It came from behind us.

919
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,669
- That looks like a hawk. - It does.

920
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,699
It was the first pigeon.

921
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,369
- The first one to attack us. - The first pigeon.

922
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,409
- So are the two pictures... - Right.

923
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,410
Connected to each other?

924
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:01,809
- That's right. - Yes, this is theatrics.

925
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,079
- You can see the egg tart and... - Did you just say "theatrics?"

926
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,579
- What do you mean "theatrics?" - "Theatrics?"

927
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,449
- What's wrong? - You mean "a masterpiece?"

928
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,919
- Yes, a masterpiece. - A theatric masterpiece.

929
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,179
The moment we stood up to take pictures...

930
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,789
- The moment you stood up. - is when we took the next photo.

931
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,790
- Photo number four. - Young Ji's photo.

932
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,019
(The last photo is Young Ji's.)

933
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,160
- Let me explain this photo. - Sure.

934
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,336
(An extreme sense of urgency is portrayed in Young Ji's photo.)

935
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,029
A dark sorcerer is warding off...

936
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,706
- the pigeon... - That looks like an eagle.

937
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,230
In this photo.

938
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,429
I feel like this itself is an embodiment of Portugal.

939
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,869
- The pigeon? - Yes.

940
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,339
Not a symbol of peace,

941
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,439
- but an embodiment of Portugal. - An embodiment of Portugal.

942
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,169
And for passion. How is...

943
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,939
this not passionate enough?

944
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,479
The waiter's passion to resolve the situation no matter what.

945
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,250
He actually grabbed the pigeon with his bare hand.

946
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,550
- And next to that, - Purity.

947
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,419
- Young Ji is trying to stop him. - Look how pure my face is.

948
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,726
(Number 3. Pure: Young Ji's pure face next to the waiter.)

949
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,819
I didn't even have a drop of lotion on.

950
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,889
- That's how pure my face was. - Pure.

951
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,619
- Her pure face. - Purity itself.

952
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,529
- You could have put lotion on. - I know.

953
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,789
Why is the pigeon a symbol of Portugal, though?

954
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,859
Why Portugal? We have pigeons...

955
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,229
- at the Han River too. - No.

956
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,400
I'll tell you the truth.

957
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,129
I didn't submit this picture to win.

958
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,130
- Then what? - Why else?

959
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,439
Just like how Director Bong Joon Ho created "Parasite,"

960
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,909
my intentions were creative only.

961
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,940
The judges may have their own criteria.

962
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,539
How long will it take you to make your decision?

963
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,280
It won't take long.

964
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,679
(He said that without even thinking.)

965
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,320
I'm sorry, but what did you say?

966
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,119
Excuse me, Chang Dae.

967
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,419
Do you already have a photo in mind?

968
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,820
A photo did catch my attention.

969
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,360
(Gosh)

970
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,459
I think it's yours.

971
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,859
- Caught your attention? - It's probably Eun Ji's photo.

972
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,100
(Eun Ji is a strong contender.)

973
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,430
Will you still be discussing with your fellow judges?

974
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,829
Yes, we will make a fair decision.

975
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,629
- They will make a fair decision. - A fair decision.

976
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,870
- All right. Gather around. - Gather around, please.

977
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,710
(The camera directors will be holding a quick meeting.)

978
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,709
Take an objective look at all of them.

979
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,180
(There are 5 camera directors to judge the photos.)

980
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,830
- This one's pretty. - The theme is...

981
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,010
(Laughing)

982
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:46,709
Isn't this a bit too staged?

983
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,479
Right. Purity-wise, it's...

984
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,519
It's funny.

985
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,396
(The E-cade members cluelessly await the final decision.)

986
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,219
We're not qualified to judge.

987
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,689
I'm looking forward to their decision.

988
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,089
We can be objective.

989
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,460
- Then I'll decide first. - Okay.

990
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,606
- Have you made up your mind? - Everyone is...

991
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,100
Are you done already?

992
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,859
(Final voting result: 1st place won by 4 votes, 2nd place by 1 vote.)

993
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,959
- Four to one? - Four to one?

994
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,370
It was a close call.

995
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,770
(Which photo won 4 votes?)

996
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,969
Can you tell us about your judging criteria?

997
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,039
- Our judging criteria? - Yes.

998
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,670
Purity...

999
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,009
- Purity. - The three P's.

1000
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,680
Passion and Portugal were all considered.

1001
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,109
We judged fairly based on those themes.

1002
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,830
- Based on the themes. - He sounded like...

1003
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,579
- Did you consider composition... - he's from a fair trade authority.

1004
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,489
Or artistic value?

1005
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,720
No. The intuitive aspects were most important to us.

1006
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,019
(They judged only based on intuitive aspects.)

1007
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,289
Then why don't you...

1008
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,290
take a 10 cm close-up shot...

1009
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:37,100
of the person who won first place?

1010
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,930
Go ahead, Chang Dae.

1011
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,099
He's on his way to the winner.

1012
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,770
(He slowly zooms in on the winner.)

1013
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,010
(This is what the situation looked like from the side.)

1014
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,849
(It's hard to tell who he's aiming his camera at.)

1015
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,780
(Who is the winner of the contest?)

1016
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,720
(Lee Young Ji wins!)

1017
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,190
(Take another look at the winning photo.)

1018
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,930
(Turning away swiftly)

1019
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
(A huge twist)

1020
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,199
(No one predicted this outcome.)

1021
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,540
- For real? - Shout out to the pigeons.

1022
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,609
- Shout out to the pigeons. - Why did she win?

1023
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,050
What was so special about her photo?

1024
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,039
- I'm sorry, but... - What was it about hers?

1025
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,639
- Right. - I thought hers would come last.

1026
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,680
That's what I thought too.

1027
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,979
- I thought hers was the worst one. - I'm proud of this result.

1028
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,379
- I'm proud. - Young Ji, you're the first place.

1029
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,650
Why did you choose hers?

1030
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,990
What was the logic behind it?

1031
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,060
Eun Ji's photo was a strong contender, but...

1032
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,490
(But what?)

1033
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,559
- Then why... - It was too staged.

1034
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,659
- Too staged. - He said it was too staged.

1035
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,459
- What did he say? - He said it was too staged.

1036
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,806
(As in it was obvious that it’s been done in a contrived way.)

1037
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,710
- What did he say? - He said it was too staged.

1038
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,199
(It took her a while, but then she burst out laughing.)

1039
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,870
That's kind of like who I am as a person.

1040
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,580
(The clear judging critique left the E-cade members speechless.)

1041
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,679
Everything is thoroughly contrived.

1042
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,949
I follow my plans exactly the way they've been staged.

1043
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,956
(The eldest E-cade member loves it when things are staged.)

1044
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,019
- They had a clear judging criteria. - Very clear.

1045
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,919
- The word "staged" is perfect. - Right.

1046
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,520
He didn't lie, though.

1047
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,889
When you scream...

1048
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,159
(She shows them the other photos she took.)

1049
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,519
- Eun Ji. - I'm sorry.

1050
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,329
- This was my runner-up. - That's so staged.

1051
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,460
- It's really staged. - It's so staged.

1052
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,760
This was my second...

1053
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,970
("I love it when things are staged," said Lee Eun Ji, who got 1 vote.)

1054
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,569
There was nothing to criticize about Yu Jin's photo.

1055
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,640
What?

1056
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,570
- But why didn't she win? - Right.

1057
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,840
The next one we saw was too strong.

1058
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,139
- The pigeons. - It was close.

1059
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,749
It was close. This picture was too realistic.

1060
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,380
So the ending fairy of this episode is...

1061
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,780
Thank you, akh.

1062
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,730
(Stay tuned to watch Young Ji be the ending fairy.)

1063
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,360
(Current time: 04:50pm)

1064
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,700
By the riverside we went to yesterday,

1065
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,600
- By the riverside? - you will go on a special bike ride

1066
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,630
- A special bike ride? - While eating…

1067
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,539
good food, you’ll be going on a special bike ride.

1068
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,099
Eating good food while going on a special bike ride?

1069
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,100
- Okay. - Okay.

1070
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,246
(What could be the special bikes that he mentioned?)

1071
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,909
- Eun Ji, let's do it now. - You want to do it right now?

1072
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,409
- What are you doing? - Wear the wig.

1073
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,009
- That's great. - I bought this for Young Ji.

1074
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,150
I wanted to see her in this.

1075
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,780
I brought this for you.

1076
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,849
All right. Hold down the front part.

1077
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,889
Okay.

1078
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,090
(Laughing)

1079
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
(Producer Na: Gosh.)

1080
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,890
(The comedienne is proud of herself.)

1081
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,159
- Charming, right? - Goo Jun Pyo's style definitely...

1082
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,659
- I look cool, don't I? - suits you.

1083
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,146
(The wig gave her a confidence boost.)

1084
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,630
The wig really suits you.

1085
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,200
- Let's go bike-riding. - Let's go!

1086
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,309
(They're excited at the idea of riding bikes after a long time.)

1087
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,110
- Bike-riding. - Bike-riding.

1088
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,339
By "special bikes,"

1089
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,340
- what do you mean? - What do you mean?

1090
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,750
Maybe they're tandem bikes.

1091
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,979
Or it could be a four-seater bike.

1092
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,080
Or a tuk-tuk.

1093
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,079
- I hope we're riding tuk-tuks. - Tuk-tuks?

1094
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
That would be great.

1095
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,550
That would be awesome.

1096
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,789
Will you drive?

1097
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,790
I will.

1098
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,589
What time is it, Producer Na?

1099
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,389
- Right now, it's 5:02pm. - It's 5:02pm.

1100
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,459
There's one hour left.

1101
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,930
(What's one hour left?)

1102
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,859
- Producer Na. - Yes?

1103
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,030
Will you give me my phone at 6pm sharp?

1104
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,630
Yes, I'll have to.

1105
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,299
(Fully enjoying the digital experience)

1106
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,940
- You're telling the truth, right? - Yes.

1107
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,410
He'll give you your phone back as promised.

1108
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,680
Are you excited, Young Ji?

1109
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,216
It feels like I’m being released from jail.

1110
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,960
Your hair kind of gives off that same vibe.

1111
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,280
(Laughing)

1112
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,780
(With my daughter)

1113
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,490
(One hour until I get my phone back)

1114
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,410
Wait, did I bring Young Ji's phone with me?

1115
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,060
I gave it to you earlier.

1116
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,760
He's such a good actor.

1117
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,060
(The end of this long journey is in sight.)

1118
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,700
This is Belem Park.

1119
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,500
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1120
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,270
This place is so romantic.

1121
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,399
Gosh. Mimi, this place is so nice.

1122
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,570
It's so pretty.

1123
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,909
Goodness.

1124
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,816
(As soon as they get off the car, they start screaming like dolphins.)

1125
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,640
- It's like a breath of fresh air. - It's so beautiful.

1126
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:46,250
(The river is as wide as the ocean.)

1127
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,179
(The Tagus River...)

1128
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,819
(flows through Spain and Portugal.)

1129
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,089
(It connects to the Atlantic Ocean from Lisbon and looks like the sea.)

1130
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,420
- It's beautiful. - This is amazing.

1131
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,959
(The April 25th Bridge and the Christ the King Statue...)

1132
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,480
(spread out impressively right ahead.)

1133
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,729
Amazing.

1134
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,590
(And there are a lot of people relaxing.)

1135
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,229
Is this where we're riding the bikes?

1136
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,500
Gosh.

1137
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,169
Wait. I think that's it.

1138
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,069
- Let's go. - Gosh, wait.

1139
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,569
- Let's go. - Guys, come on.

1140
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,040
(Children never listen to their moms.)

1141
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,480
- Gosh. - Those aren't even the bikes.

1142
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,410
I think these are the bikes.

1143
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,680
- No, they're not. - Come back.

1144
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,850
(They're now finally hearing what Eun Ji is saying.)

1145
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,530
(Whatever. I'm excited too.)

1146
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,960
What's wrong with you guys?

1147
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,430
I feel great!

1148
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,329
(Screaming)

1149
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,400
Slow down!

1150
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,630
(Screaming)

1151
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,199
(The mom is the most excited one.)

1152
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,669
- I feel so good. - Me too.

1153
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,546
(The childish E-cade members have no intention of stopping.)

1154
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,569
(These 2 have fallen behind.)

1155
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,779
- What's wrong with them? - I don't know.

1156
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,910
They're driving me insane.

1157
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,550
Who told them to run?

1158
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,809
(Their bike starts to come into view.)

1159
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:54,920
- Gosh. - Awesome.

1160
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,049
- Hi. Hello. - Hello.

1161
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,820
(What kind of bike awaits them?)

1162
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,920
(Gosh!)

1163
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,319
What is that?

1164
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,090
Do we all have to pedal together?

1165
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,260
Gosh, I'm exhausted.
(They happily get on the bike.)

1166
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:10,300
I ran too much.

1167
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,299
Do you know what this is?

1168
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,569
- We said you'd be bike-riding. - Yes.

1169
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,299
This bike is called "beer-bike."

1170
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,469
- A beer bike? - A beer bike?

1171
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,040
This is a beer bike?

1172
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,409
- Are we having a beer? - As you drink beer,

1173
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,649
you'll slowly pedal...

1174
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,709
around the park on this bike.

1175
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,750
(Full of anticipation)

1176
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,389
This isn't the only area with beer bikes.

1177
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,019
Cities all over the world have them.

1178
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,490
- That's amazing. - Australia and Europe have these.

1179
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,959
(They're popular for special events like birthdays and weddings, )

1180
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,930
(and for tours around cities.)

1181
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,360
So today,

1182
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,229
since we're here, we'll be watching the sunset...

1183
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,900
- and drinking beer. - Nice!

1184
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,440
The sunset should be amazing here.

1185
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,240
How about we start with a glass of beer?

1186
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,539
(There's a draft beer machine.)

1187
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,840
Gosh, there's draft beer.

1188
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:56,309
(There's cold beer on tap.)

1189
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:59,050
This is great. I love draft beer.

1190
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,279
- The beer looks good. - The beer looks good.

1191
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,519
(The eldest gets her glass first.)

1192
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,619
That looks amazing.

1193
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,450
Goodness, this looks so good.

1194
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,189
- This setup is perfect. - I don't know if I can drink it.

1195
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,389
- Why? - It's so nice.

1196
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,490
I'm a light drinker.

1197
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,530
We all saw in "Vroom Vroom."

1198
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,330
(Right, we had that.)

1199
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,530
(Next is Mimi.)

1200
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:19,770
- No, thanks. - Right.

1201
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,940
- Mi Hyun doesn't drink. - We got carbonated water for you.

1202
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,809
Then get carbonated water...

1203
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,170
- for Yu Jin too. - Okay, sure.

1204
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,510
I don't want to trouble you, so I'll take this.

1205
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,479
(Thank you for your consideration. From the production staff.)

1206
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,880
I don't want to trouble you.

1207
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,709
- Can I drink it? - Thank you.

1208
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,120
Toast first.

1209
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,889
- Cheers. - E-cade.

1210
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:38,949
Go.

1211
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,110
- Do we drink? - What's this?

1212
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,719
(They each take a sip.)

1213
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,060
(Feeling nervous for no reason)

1214
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,600
(Satisfied)

1215
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,399
- Let's get going. - It's nice.

1216
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,569
Nice.

1217
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,129
- Are we going now? - Step on the pedals.

1218
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,699
- Yes. - When you do,

1219
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,899
- Gosh, what is this? - it will start moving.

1220
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,639
- It's moving now. - Yes.

1221
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,839
- You must pedal together. - Can you do it?

1222
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,080
- Ready, start. - Ready, start.

1223
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,409
(As they pedal, )

1224
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,210
(the bicycle moves forward.)

1225
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:14,049
(Surprised)

1226
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,820
I feel so good!

1227
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,119
This is insane!

1228
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,429
- What's this? - It's like cycling.

1229
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,430
- It feels so good. - This is the best.

1230
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,700
My gosh.

1231
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,600
- Nice. - Goodness.

1232
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,630
(Today's route is...)

1233
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,070
(The halfway point)

1234
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,000
(They're going to cycle approximately 1.8km.)

1235
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,939
- Shall we pedal faster? - Let's try it.

1236
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,310
(Speeding up)

1237
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,409
It's like the spinning we did last time.

1238
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,679
One, two.

1239
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,980
I'm already getting tired.

1240
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:44,850
(Pedaling as hard as they can)

1241
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,089
This is for eight people,

1242
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,559
- but we're only four. - Exactly.

1243
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,719
- You're right. - It's hard.

1244
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,059
Why are you sitting there? Get down.

1245
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,430
Exactly.

1246
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,460
(There are 10 people including the driver.)

1247
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,499
(But the ones pedaling...)

1248
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,930
(are just these 4.)

1249
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,470
(The total weight of passengers is 620kg.)

1250
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,910
(Including the bike weight, 4 of them have to carry 1t.)

1251
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,170
But this is so...

1252
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,609
(It is a lot harder than you think.)

1253
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:08,610
This...

1254
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,839
As you can see, it's slower than walking.

1255
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,849
You're right.

1256
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,180
(They are faster.)

1257
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,579
We're really cycling at the same speed...

1258
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,849
as the cameraman walking.

1259
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,220
- Seriously. - Exactly. We have eight people.

1260
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,690
(So...)

1261
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,990
(Mercenary Hyun Yong will be joining soon.)

1262
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,789
- Everyone. - Yes?

1263
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,629
- Isn't it tough to pedal? - Yes.

1264
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,829
Doesn't this pop up in your mind?

1265
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,799
- What does? - I wish I could rest...

1266
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,670
while the rest pedaled.

1267
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,670
That sounds nice.

1268
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,870
A bit.

1269
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,369
So following your seating arrangement,

1270
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,839
this team versus that team.

1271
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,980
- Okay. - You'll play very simple quizzes.

1272
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,150
(A bolt from the blue)

1273
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,849
(In the end, they have this match again.)

1274
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,880
(Team BF versus Team BB)

1275
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,719
(The game is...)

1276
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,859
It is a simple general knowledge quiz.

1277
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,190
- We have various genres. - We're doomed.

1278
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,729
(As soon as they hear "general knowledge quiz...")

1279
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,430
We're doomed.

1280
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,159
Just keep pedaling.

1281
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,160
(General knowledge quiz on the beer-bike)

1282
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,430
- There are genres written there. - Just keep pedaling.

1283
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,980
General knowledge, retro, entertainment, and economics and IT.

1284
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,339
Pick a genre out of the four.

1285
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,810
We'll ask you a simple question.

1286
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,180
(The team that answers correctly...)

1287
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,409
Correct.

1288
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,410
(can rest immediately.)

1289
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:21,920
You can rest until the other team answers correctly.

1290
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,249
(The team that lost...)

1291
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,950
(must pedal hard.)

1292
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,790
Just one of you have to answer it right.

1293
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,429
We can still rest if just one of us...

1294
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:34,670
- gets it right. - We can rest.

1295
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,469
- B. - B.

1296
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,470
- Cross. - Cross.

1297
00:46:40,471 --> 00:46:41,699
- B. - F.

1298
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,700
- Cross. - Cross.

1299
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:44,499
We'll start with general knowledge.

1300
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,069
After that, the team that answered correctly...

1301
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,846
- will choose. - I have no general knowledge.

1302
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:50,109
Here comes the first question.

1303
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,280
There are a lot of public bikes in Korea.

1304
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,109
Seoul's is called "Ddareungi."

1305
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,449
Daejeon's is "Tashu."

1306
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,650
- Tashu. - Tashu.

1307
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,119
Jeonju's is "Tarangge."

1308
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,149
- Tarangge. - Tarangge.

1309
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,190
Those are the names.

1310
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,360
Then...

1311
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,590
what about Busan?

1312
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,389
What's the public bicycle in Busan called?

1313
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,459
- BF! - BB!

1314
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,729
(Eun Ji of Team BF was faster.)

1315
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,159
- BF was faster. - Taboiso.

1316
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,770
Taboiso.

1317
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:12,899
- Wrong! - BB!

1318
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,929
- BB. - BB.

1319
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,800
- Taranggaeyu. - Taranggae...

1320
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,339
- Ggaeyu. - BB.

1321
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,070
That's Jeolla Province dialect. Wrong.

1322
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,809
- BF. - BB.

1323
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,256
- This team has the chance now. - BF.

1324
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,840
- Tageuraeyi. - Tageuraeyi.

1325
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,610
- Tageuraeyi. Wrong. - Mimi.

1326
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,450
(The answer is...)

1327
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,680
("Tabanna.")

1328
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,620
Mimi.

1329
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,420
- Tarama! - Wrong.

1330
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:35,819
- Eun Ji, BF! - Yes.

1331
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,390
- Naeriso! - No.

1332
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,629
What is the Busan dialect? "Bap mutna" as in "have you eaten?"

1333
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:39,659
Bap mutna.

1334
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,290
Gosh, BB!

1335
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:42,660
Tabanna.

1336
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,660
Correct!

1337
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,869
Correct!

1338
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:50,230
(Contrary to what they thought, they lose the first round.)

1339
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,809
(Team BB wins.)

1340
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:54,409
- Amazing. - We must get it right.

1341
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,140
(They take a rest.)

1342
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,449
- Congratulations - I'll get it right.

1343
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,226
(Team BF that lost has to pedal on their own.)

1344
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,579
(It's as if they're having a party.)

1345
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,280
Choose the genre.

1346
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,420
- Genre. - Genre.

1347
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,849
You choose.

1348
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,219
- Economics and IT? - Economics and IT.

1349
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,419
- Economics and IT. - Economics.

1350
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,736
(Mimi is an economics expert of Earth Arcade.)

1351
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,989
Eun Ji, this is so tiring.

1352
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,690
- You weren't pedaling, were you? - I was.

1353
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,199
You just pretended to pedal, didn't you?

1354
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,729
Right? I must keep an eye on you.

1355
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,046
(Their team is at risk of falling apart.)

1356
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,539
(Laughing)

1357
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,799
Look at Yu Jin.

1358
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,899
(Don't fight, I'm pedaling too.)

1359
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,420
- She's doing it. - This is so tiring.

1360
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:28,579
It's related to real estate.

1361
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,609
Okay.

1362
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,909
What does ML stand for?

1363
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,110
- BF! - BB.

1364
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:34,779
- BF. - BF was faster.

1365
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,950
Monetary loan.

1366
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,149
- Wrong. - BB.

1367
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,789
- BB. - Mortgage loan.

1368
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:40,850
Correct!

1369
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,919
Wasn't it "monetary?"

1370
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,366
(They unexpectedly lose twice in a row.)

1371
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,659
(The rebellion of the fools!)

1372
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,029
- Keep pedaling. - Pedal.

1373
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,659
- Pedal. - Pedal.

1374
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,660
(At the fools' taunting, )

1375
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:51,260
(she gets annoyed.)

1376
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,630
- Go, Young Ji. - Pedal.

1377
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,140
(The homeroom teacher ignores them.)

1378
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,670
- Go, Young Ji. - Pedal.

1379
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,909
(They don't seem to want to stop.)

1380
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,510
(Biting his lips)

1381
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,409
Choose the next genre.

1382
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:05,770
- Let's try entertainment. - Okay.

1383
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,780
- Entertainment. - Entertainment.

1384
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,019
(The longer they take to choose...)

1385
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,220
(Agonizing)

1386
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,849
- Entertainment. - Entertainment.

1387
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,010
(They start pedaling slower.)

1388
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,819
Keep pedaling. What are you doing?

1389
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,060
- You're too slow. - Tabanna.

1390
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,790
(They're getting more and more exhausted.)

1391
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,400
- It's cooling. - Choose the question quickly!

1392
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,030
(She's feeling amazing.)

1393
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,799
What's taking so long to choose?

1394
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,370
Choose the question quickly!

1395
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,100
It's a simple question.

1396
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:33,610
Singers with an animal or plant name.

1397
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,709
Name four of them.

1398
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,249
An animal or plant name?

1399
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,710
(They can't think of one easily.)

1400
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,279
- BB. - BB.

1401
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,480
- Gummy. - Gummy.

1402
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,250
- Cordyceps. - Wrong!

1403
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,790
"Cordyceps?"

1404
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,059
Gummy.

1405
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,120
- You can discuss. - An animal or plant name.

1406
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,889
- Drunken Tiger. - BF.

1407
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:53,929
BF.

1408
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,060
Flower, NAVI, Gummy, and Drunken Tiger.

1409
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,760
Correct.

1410
00:49:58,730 --> 00:49:59,730
Correct.

1411
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:01,376
(They take their feet off the pedal as soon as they get it right.)

1412
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,769
(Team BB...)

1413
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,210
(starts working out after a long rest.)

1414
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,339
- Go, Mimi. - I can't pedal.

1415
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,179
- Go, Mimi. - Go, Mimi.

1416
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,040
They're just standing.

1417
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,710
Her legs are so long.

1418
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,749
- Pedal faster. - Drink some beer.

1419
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,879
Okay.

1420
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,980
(Oops.)

1421
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,949
(They finally get to enjoy their beer.)

1422
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,490
Choose the genre.

1423
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,460
- The genre we'll choose... - The genre...

1424
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,500
(They're pondering about each and every syllable.)

1425
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,260
(They're paying for their teasing.)

1426
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
- I... - Choose quickly.

1427
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:34,569
I'll let Sally choose.

1428
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:37,499
Then Sally chooses retro.

1429
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,940
- Let's go with retro. - Retro.

1430
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,579
Just like how you can check someone else's Instagram profile...

1431
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,980
from your Instagram follow list,

1432
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,010
last time, on Cyworld...

1433
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,150
BF.

1434
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,049
- BF. - Riding the waves.

1435
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,050
Correct.

1436
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,159
(They become a lot more relaxed...)

1437
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,160
(after answering twice in a row.)

1438
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,859
(On the other hand...)

1439
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,129
(Head dipping)

1440
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:01,229
(Looking far ahead)

1441
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:03,360
(Team BB became depressed rapidly.)

1442
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,530
(Their legs won't stop moving.)

1443
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,700
- Quickly. - Next question.

1444
00:51:07,701 --> 00:51:09,940
The people next to us are walking with us.

1445
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,639
They're faster.

1446
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,869
They're taking over us.

1447
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,210
(It's sad to see their backs.)

1448
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,279
Choose your genre.

1449
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,710
(Taunting them)

1450
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,249
(What are you doing?)

1451
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,820
- What do you want... - Choose quickly!

1452
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,649
- Choose quickly! - Do it!

1453
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,860
- What do you want... - Choose general knowledge!

1454
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,559
- Then shall we go with this? - "Choose general knowledge."

1455
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,789
General knowledge, please.

1456
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:32,790
(Acting coy)

1457
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,500
The National Institute of the Korean Language...

1458
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,129
chose "building this" as a pure Korean word...

1459
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,729
to replace the English word,

1460
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,299
"building qualifications."

1461
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,869
- BB. - In Korean?

1462
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,210
Building experience.

1463
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,740
"Experience?" Wrong. It's pure Korean.

1464
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,309
- Pure Korean. - Yu Jin. BF.

1465
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,210
- BF. - Building knowledge.

1466
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:52,950
"Knowledge." Wrong.

1467
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,009
- "Building qualifications." - It's pure Korean word...

1468
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,049
that means "ability."

1469
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,249
Agility?

1470
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,819
- Ability. - Ability.

1471
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,989
(She is half a step behind in understanding.)

1472
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,349
Ability.

1473
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,620
- BF. - BF.

1474
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:02,990
Building kkalong?

1475
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,959
- Kkalong. - Kkalong.

1476
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,589
- Kkalong. - Really?

1477
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,430
Doesn't "kkalong" mean "cool?" Wrong.

1478
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,630
But I was actually very surprised.

1479
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,199
When I heard "kkal,"

1480
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,730
- I was shocked. - "Kka."

1481
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,239
BF!

1482
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,499
It's their turn.

1483
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,169
- Okay. Nine. - Ten, nine,

1484
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,669
- eight... - Just say something!

1485
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:21,909
- Anything... - Building kkalssam.

1486
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,680
Building kkalssam, wrong.

1487
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,839
Just say something!

1488
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,200
- Anything... - Building kkalssam.

1489
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,780
(She mocks her immediately.)

1490
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,149
I have no clue.

1491
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,149
Pure Korean word that means "ability."

1492
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,690
"You don't have this." We tend to say this.

1493
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:36,689
- You say... - BF!

1494
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,760
- BF. - Building kkamnyang.

1495
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,060
Building kkamnyang. Correct!

1496
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:47,070
(Pedaling for 3 rounds in a row)

1497
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,199
- It's so... - Yu Jin is lightweight.

1498
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,340
- Yes. - But she almost finished it.

1499
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:54,240
I'm upset...

1500
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,110
because they keep losing.

1501
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,750
It's nice to work out and lose some weight here.

1502
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,420
How is it? Isn't it nice to do both?

1503
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,920
My skinny jeans feel loose.

1504
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,889
They've become hip-hop-style pants.

1505
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:07,890
(Doing cardio nonstop)

1506
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,490
Let me take a selfie.

1507
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,990
(She is dancing excitedly.)

1508
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:16,129
(If you can be, become a wind and blow)

1509
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,160
Here comes the question.

1510
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,230
- BF. - BF.

1511
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,200
- Know yourself. - Correct.

1512
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:22,940
- BF. - Short-term deposit.

1513
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,369
- Short-term deposit. - Yes.

1514
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:25,886
Short-term deposit where you can put money in and out.

1515
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:26,910
Correct.
What? Why?

1516
00:53:27,911 --> 00:53:29,256
(She gets lucky and guesses the difficult question right.)

1517
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,210
(Things are strangely not working out for them.)

1518
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,880
(Thanks to Team BB's sacrifice, )

1519
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:35,549
(the bike that was here...)

1520
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,320
(has reached here.)

1521
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,790
- That was the halfway point. - It's so hard.

1522
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,189
- I choose entertainment. - Entertainment.

1523
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,219
Entertainment.

1524
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,619
Mimi, it's entertainment.

1525
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,959
Okay.

1526
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,729
(Try guessing with us.)

1527
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,329
Fans nowadays buy concert tickets...

1528
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,860
- online, right? - Yes.

1529
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,230
Then...

1530
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:57,170
where did the fans who wanted to buy H.O.T's concert tickets...

1531
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,409
in 2001 go to?

1532
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,340
- BF. - BB.

1533
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,439
(6. Entertainment)

1534
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,510
Bank.

1535
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:05,310
Correct!

1536
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,310
How do you know that?

1537
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:08,619
(How do you know that?)

1538
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,250
- You weren't born yet. - In 2001...

1539
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,819
I saw it on the news.

1540
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,489
- On the news? - You saw it on the news?

1541
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:15,990
In a bank last time...

1542
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,589
(Video provided by KBS)

1543
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,060
(From a bank!)

1544
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,160
She's the living proof of K-pop.

1545
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,130
(Coming up)

1546
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,329
(Dancing in front of their faces)

1547
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,499
Stop celebrating.

1548
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,400
Stop celebrating and choose the genre.

1549
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:31,770
(Taking pictures)

1550
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:33,269
Excuse me, what are you doing?

1551
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,739
- I'm sorry. - What shall we choose?

1552
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,740
I'm sorry.
(They get to rest thanks to them.)

1553
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,879
- We'll go with general knowledge. - General knowledge.

1554
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,910
(I got it.)

1555
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:41,609
(Suffering)

1556
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,650
(Shouting)

1557
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,519
(It's even harder now that they took a short rest.)

1558
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,049
Let's go with this.

1559
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,720
It's a very easy general knowledge.

1560
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,989
What's the biggest animal on Earth?

1561
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:52,990
- BB. - BB.

1562
00:54:52,991 --> 00:54:54,190
- BB. - Mammoth.

1563
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,099
Mammoth? They've gone extinct, so they don't count. Wrong!

1564
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,569
- BF. - BF.

1565
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,629
Tiger.

1566
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,399
I think it's smaller than an elephant. Wrong.

1567
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,540
BB.

1568
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,470
- Elephant. - Elephant?

1569
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,569
- Wrong. - BF.

1570
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,570
- BF. - Eagle.

1571
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,480
- Eagle. - Eagle?

1572
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,579
- No. Wrong. - BB.

1573
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,310
- BB. - Shark.

1574
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,620
(So close)

1575
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,019
- They live with sharks. Wrong. - Whale!

1576
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,789
- BF! - Wrong.

1577
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:20,850
- BF. - Whale.

1578
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,959
- This particular whale. Wrong. - Dolphin.

1579
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,319
- BB. - BB.

1580
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,430
Blue whale.

1581
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,360
- What did you say? - Blue whale.

1582
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,729
- Take a rest. - Start pedaling now.

1583
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,260
- Correct! - Rest.

1584
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,146
- Take your feet off. - How did you know?

1585
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,170
(Correct!)

1586
00:55:34,171 --> 00:55:36,399
(After resting for 6 rounds, )

1587
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,340
(their feet finally start pedaling.)

1588
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,810
Go in.

1589
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,710
(They're copying what Team BF did.)

1590
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,379
(She has both arms up in the air, )

1591
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,250
(but she is very tired.)

1592
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,350
It's fun to pedal in a while.

1593
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,549
Thanks for giving us...

1594
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,319
the chance to pedal, guys.

1595
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,419
(Laughing)

1596
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,790
- Thank you, BB. - This...

1597
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,890
It's really tough to pedal.

1598
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,060
- Choose the genre, please. - Mimi.

1599
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,260
- Economics and IT. - Economics and IT.

1600
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,129
Last time,

1601
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:06,269
- YOLO was a trend. - Yes.

1602
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,869
Different from YOLO, there's a new term surfacing now...

1603
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:11,469
called "YONO."

1604
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:14,569
YONO refers to people who only focus on...

1605
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,179
one thing in terms of their spending.

1606
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,710
- Y, O, N, O? - You Only...

1607
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,709
Just the one thing you need...

1608
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,879
Yu Jin! BF.

1609
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,250
- BF. - You Only Need One.

1610
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,250
- Again. - You Only Need One.

1611
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,789
Correct!

1612
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:30,959
(The moment they hear "correct,")

1613
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,030
(they go back to their familiar place.)

1614
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,000
(They return after 1 minute 43 seconds.)

1615
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,430
Let's go.

1616
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,430
Choose the genre.

1617
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,829
Retro.

1618
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,269
What does "NDSL" stand for?

1619
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:46,309
When you face a very unfair situation...

1620
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:47,640
or are wronged...

1621
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:48,779
I have no idea.

1622
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,509
- In this situation... - Nasty...

1623
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,280
- Nasty... - It's NDSL.

1624
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,080
BB.
- Go. - BB.

1625
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:56,219
- Nasty. - Nasty.

1626
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,220
- Dirty. - Dirty.

1627
00:56:57,221 --> 00:56:58,650
- Sickening. - Sickening.

1628
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,750
- Leave. - What's "L?"
(He didn't hear her.)

1629
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,760
- BF. - Lesser being.

1630
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,020
- "Lesser being." - BF.

1631
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,389
- BF. - You're too tired...

1632
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,659
- to think. - Nasty.

1633
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,259
Dirty. Sickening.

1634
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,330
- What's the last one? - Low.

1635
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,169
- Low. - Correct!

1636
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,430
(Cheering)

1637
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:15,799
It's NDSL.

1638
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,869
- Nasty. - Nasty.

1639
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:17,899
- Dirty. - Dirty.

1640
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,740
- Sickening. Low. - It's NDSL.

1641
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,140
(They end up being the only ones to pedal.)

1642
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,509
(The destination)

1643
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,180
- We're almost there. - Almost.

1644
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,780
Okay.

1645
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,279
Why don't we decide which team to pedal until the destination...

1646
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,679
with this question?

1647
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,680
Sure.

1648
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:31,919
With one question? That sounds good.

1649
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,350
- Okay. - We should try.

1650
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,989
- How do you like the deal? - Let's do it.

1651
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,566
- I don't care if I lose. Let's go. - I choose general knowledge.

1652
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,990
The team that loses has to pedal until the end.

1653
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,160
Here you go.

1654
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,400
The World Cup is a global festival.

1655
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,140
Which country holds...

1656
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,640
- Which country? - the World Cup...

1657
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,239
in 2026?

1658
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,469
BB.

1659
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:56,179
Name all three countries.

1660
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,379
- Three countries. - Three?

1661
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,049
(3 countries?)

1662
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,149
- Here I go. - Okay.

1663
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,256
- Republic of South Africa. - Republic of South Africa.

1664
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,350
- Paris. - Paris.

1665
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,119
- Dominican Republic. - Dominican Republic.

1666
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,249
- Wrong! - More than six syllables.

1667
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,350
Wrong.

1668
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,290
Did you think you were right?

1669
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,719
- BF. - BF.

1670
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,560
- China. - Wrong.

1671
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,829
- They have no interest at all. - We don't.

1672
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:15,830
(They have no interest in it at all.)

1673
00:58:15,831 --> 00:58:17,399
- Can I give you a hint? - Yes.

1674
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,730
Eun Ji, would you like to try?

1675
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,799
I can't think of anything.

1676
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,800
- Okay. - Three syllables.

1677
00:58:21,801 --> 00:58:24,039
We commonly refer to this World Cup...

1678
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,440
as North and Central American World Cup.

1679
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,170
BF.

1680
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,680
- North Korea. - North Korea?

1681
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:31,310
Wrong.

1682
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,579
(Non-prejudiced wrong answer)

1683
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,350
(Laughing)

1684
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,180
- What's in the north? - BB.

1685
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,680
It's not a shortened form.

1686
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,090
(It wasn't?)

1687
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:41,119
- North and Central. - What?

1688
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,760
Do you think it's North Korea, China,

1689
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,196
- and the States? - I thought that was it.

1690
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,220
(I thought that was it.)

1691
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,560
I was going to say North America.

1692
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,830
- It's something like that. - BB.

1693
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,760
Brazil.

1694
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,499
Brazil? Wrong.

1695
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,599
- What? - That's South America.

1696
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,699
- That's South America. - Wrong.

1697
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,069
North and Central America.

1698
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:57,400
Which countries are there?

1699
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,539
The area called North and Central America.

1700
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,669
Chile and Peru are in South America.

1701
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:02,879
North and Central America.

1702
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,009
- What is it? - North and Central America.

1703
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,409
- North America and Central America? - Yes.

1704
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,686
North America and Central America?

1705
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,880
All I know is Mimi.

1706
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,349
- North America and Central America. - BB.

1707
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,620
- BB. - India.

1708
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,220
(Despairing)

1709
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:14,719
India.

1710
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,236
(She is jumping across different continents.)

1711
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,319
(What should I do with them?)

1712
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,520
No. Hey.

1713
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:19,789
(They are laughing.)

1714
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,689
- Hey. India... - Come on.

1715
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:22,699
(They don't know either.)

1716
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,099
I'll just say this.

1717
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,329
- I'm embarrassed. It's bad for us. - North America and Central America.

1718
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:26,399
- We can't do this. - Where is it?

1719
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,729
Not South America.

1720
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,839
- Not South America. - Yes.

1721
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,716
- I know that much. - Brazil is in South America.

1722
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,969
What's in the middle?

1723
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,309
The country you visit often.

1724
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:34,769
- BB. - The US.

1725
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,009
- The US. - The US!

1726
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,110
- What else? - The US.

1727
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,479
(The US)

1728
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,609
- And... - Two more.

1729
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,149
- The country nearby. - Russia.

1730
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,349
(The 2026 World Cup host countries)

1731
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,419
Russia.

1732
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,450
(Russia)

1733
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,719
- Wrong! - What?

1734
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,889
(If that were to happen, it would shock the whole world.)

1735
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:50,220
What can I do? I just don't know.

1736
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,560
Okay, so the States is one.

1737
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,629
Here's the US. Look carefully.

1738
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:55,906
- Instead of doing that, - Here's the US.

1739
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,899
Just bring a whiteboard and teach her.

1740
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,599
There's a country above the US.

1741
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,599
And there's a country below the US.

1742
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,039
These three countries are called North and Central America.

1743
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,669
(Out of many countries that are in North and Central America, )

1744
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:09,779
(guess the 3 countries that will host the World Cup.)

1745
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,210
You got the States right.

1746
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,910
Is it the North Pole and the South Pole?

1747
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:15,149
How can you play soccer in the North Pole and South Pole...

1748
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:16,220
when it's so cold?

1749
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:18,950
Would you play soccer in the North Pole?

1750
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:23,020
Would Son Heung Min play soccer on ice?

1751
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:24,860
- BB! - BB.

1752
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,960
- BB. - The US.
- The US. - The UK.

1753
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,960
Sit.

1754
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:30,129
- Sit. BF. - BF.

1755
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,060
- New York. - New York isn't a country!

1756
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,399
There's a country right below the States, right?

1757
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,439
- I don't know. - BB.

1758
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,599
(Here comes a hint.)

1759
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,940
We ate tacos.

1760
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,570
- BF. - BF.

1761
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,909
- Mexico. - Mexico, that's right.

1762
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:44,479
We got the US and Mexico.

1763
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,210
- Just one more country. - Which is it?

1764
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:49,019
The US and Mexico below it.

1765
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,620
There's one above the US.

1766
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,090
- It shares a border with the US. - Okay.

1767
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,089
That country. Don't you know?

1768
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,160
Chile.

1769
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,219
Chile is in South America. Wrong!

1770
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,489
(I want to quit.)

1771
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,189
- BB. - It's three syllables.

1772
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,229
The US.

1773
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,400
Three syllables.

1774
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,600
Sweden.

1775
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:05,869
Wrong.

1776
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,069
(She just names a three-syllable country she knows.)

1777
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,269
The US, Mexico, and...

1778
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:09,299
- BB. - BB.

1779
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,400
Finland.

1780
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,809
(Just having three syllables doesn't cut it.)

1781
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:15,530
I can't believe I'm doing a show with them.

1782
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:17,340
Do you even know where we are?

1783
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,180
Lisbon!

1784
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,450
It has three syllables.

1785
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:24,179
Eun Ji. What do you put on your pancake?

1786
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,449
- Maple. - Maple syrup.

1787
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,149
- BF! - BF.

1788
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,220
- Are you certain? - BF.

1789
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,490
Canada.

1790
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:30,889
Correct!

1791
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,090
(Canada)

1792
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:33,359
(Correct!)

1793
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,630
(He can finally rest.)

1794
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,899
(Team BB has to pedal until they reach the destination.)

1795
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,000
Start pedaling.

1796
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,629
- You guys got it right. - Yes.

1797
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:41,770
But you should pedal too.

1798
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,800
Pedal faster.

1799
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,339
If you have a conscience, pedal.

1800
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,840
Is Canada above the US?

1801
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,209
I think that was it.

1802
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:50,239
What was it?

1803
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,650
It's not what you think. It is correct.

1804
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,750
(Laughing)

1805
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,056
- About the answer... - Producer Na.

1806
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,080
- Pedal as much as you repent. - Producer Na.

1807
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,520
- I'm repenting. - Now.

1808
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,049
- Repeat after me. - Producer Na.

1809
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,449
- Canada. - North and Central America.

1810
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:02,719
- North and Central America. - North and Central America.

1811
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,289
- The US. - The US.

1812
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:05,659
- Canada. - Canada.

1813
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,660
And where?

1814
01:02:06,661 --> 01:02:07,960
- Mexico. - Sweden.

1815
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,230
(And where?)

1816
01:02:10,231 --> 01:02:11,359
(Mexico, Sweden)

1817
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,729
(At one wrong answer, )

1818
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,269
(he hits the roof.)

1819
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:15,740
Not Sweden!

1820
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,439
It's Mexico!

1821
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,800
(Why me?)

1822
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,770
It was me who said it.

1823
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,110
He immediately scolds Mimi.

1824
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:25,710
I said Sweden for fun.

1825
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:28,750
But he immediately scolded Mimi. "Not Sweden!"

1826
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:30,150
Was it you?

1827
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,949
(Just 20 seconds ago)

1828
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,450
(Sweden, Mexico)

1829
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,449
(Producer Na: Not Sweden!)

1830
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:37,420
(Mimi got scolded for no reason.)

1831
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,190
I'm sorry, Mimi.

1832
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,230
This is why your usual behavior matters.

1833
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:42,630
It's so funny.

1834
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,529
- This... - Just go to where the tiles are.

1835
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:45,800
- Tiles. - One, two.

1836
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,929
Let's go. We can do it. Let's shout again.

1837
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,346
- North and Central America. - North and Central America.

1838
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:50,639
- The US. - The US.

1839
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,870
- Canada. - Canada.

1840
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:55,140
- Mexico. - Mexico.

1841
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,679
(They finally arrive after going through a lot of hardships.)

1842
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,949
Here.

1843
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,610
- We're here. - Goodness.

1844
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,449
- Good job. - Thank you.

1845
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,550
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1846
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:11,119
(The North and Central America song never ends.)

1847
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,120
Thank you.

1848
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,659
My legs are shaking.

1849
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,129
Can I sit here?

1850
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,559
Go ahead. Come here.

1851
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,929
(They finally sit down calmly.)

1852
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:21,169
- North and Central America is? - North and Central America is?

1853
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:22,799
- The US, Canada, - The US, Canada,

1854
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,840
Mexico!

1855
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,670
(They start running suddenly.)

1856
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:31,580
It's not that way!

1857
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,550
(Exclaiming)

1858
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,720
(The younger girls start running for no reason.)

1859
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,949
(Eun Ji gave up trying to keep up long ago.)

1860
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:44,760
They still have energy left?

1861
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,529
(Eun Ji's face says she's already transcended.)

1862
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:47,530
(Laughing)

1863
01:03:47,531 --> 01:03:48,590
For me,

1864
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,330
there's no variety show I can’t handle now.

1865
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,170
I can do anything.

1866
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,840
(The girls come back.)

1867
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,269
(You're watching E-cade members who have some time left...)

1868
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,979
(after a 2-hour solo trip...)

1869
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,680
(and 1 hour of beer-bike pedaling.)

1870
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,710
(Local time is 6:03pm.)

1871
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,819
It's time for a big ceremony, right?

1872
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:10,879
- Yes. - Everyone.

1873
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,589
Please welcome this moment with reverence.

1874
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:15,649
- What moment is this? - What is it?

1875
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:17,490
- Now is... - That's right.

1876
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,590
- It's that time now. - It's that time.

1877
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:21,730
- Our Young Ji! - It's the 24th.

1878
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,060
Young Ji!

1879
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,860
It's three past...

1880
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,730
- I'm tearing up. - six!

1881
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,430
Why am I tearing up?

1882
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,639
- What? - Hey, Young Ji.

1883
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,739
(The other members are tearing up, as if it’s their moment too.)

1884
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,870
- Young Ji. - It's finally over.

1885
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,879
(Finally!)

1886
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,080
- The long detox is over. - Finally.

1887
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,280
Young Ji!
- How many hours? - You succeeded.

1888
01:04:40,281 --> 01:04:41,486
- Young Ji! - How many hours has it been?

1889
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,449
It's been 82 hours!

1890
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:44,580
Young Ji!

1891
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,349
- Your detox was successful. - I knew you could do it!

1892
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:47,850
- Good job, Young Ji. - You did it.

1893
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,489
(Celebration song is "Evergreen" by Yang Hee Eun.)

1894
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,390
(I'll go on a digital detox.)

1895
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,129
(Despite all her efforts...)

1896
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:54,890
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)

1897
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,399
(She called the Clock Spirit.)

1898
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,330
(But she was betrayed by the spirit.)

1899
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:05,939
(There is no one)

1900
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:11,409
(To watch over it)

1901
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:13,910
(So, we now look back at Young Ji's past 82 hours.)

1902
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,150
(1 hour)

1903
01:05:15,151 --> 01:05:17,249
(It is saying it will be so boring after the director leaves.)

1904
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,649
(2 hours)

1905
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,619
(3 hours)

1906
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:25,119
(4 hours)

1907
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,429
(5 hours, 6 hours)

1908
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:27,430
(7 hours)

1909
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:28,459
(8 hours)

1910
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,540
(Rare footage of Young Ji falling asleep on the bus)

1911
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,529
(9 hours)

1912
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:33,530
(10 hours.)

1913
01:05:33,531 --> 01:05:35,069
(12 hours)

1914
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:37,739
(The staff members are held captive.)

1915
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,409
(13 hours, 14 hours)

1916
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:41,439
(15 hours, 16 hours)

1917
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,679
(Going on 17 to 25 hours)

1918
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,216
(Eun Ji checks if Young Ji is sleeping.)

1919
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,440
(Rare footage of Young Ji falling asleep before Eun Ji)

1920
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,556
(She said it was the best sleep she'd had in 5 years.)

1921
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,280
(A new day has dawned, but...)

1922
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:56,090
(she still doesn't have her phone.)

1923
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,489
(30 hours)

1924
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,589
(31 hours)

1925
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:00,229
(32 hours)

1926
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:02,529
(She's clipping her nails.)

1927
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,029
(33 hours)

1928
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:06,469
(34 hours)

1929
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:07,470
(35 hours)

1930
01:06:07,471 --> 01:06:09,470
(I can't search for anything.)

1931
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:16,379
(She lost the Buldak battle, and 12 more hours were added.)

1932
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,639
(42 to 51 hours)

1933
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,179
(Watching the airplane monitor)

1934
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:23,679
(52 hours)

1935
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,349
(53 hours)

1936
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:29,289
(54 hours)

1937
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:33,289
(55 hours)

1938
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:35,729
(56 hours)

1939
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,529
(57 hours)

1940
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:39,769
(58 hours)

1941
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:42,130
(60 hours)

1942
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:45,099
(65 to 73 hours)

1943
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,209
(Another day without her phone began.)

1944
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:48,809
(74 hours)

1945
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:52,339
(76 hours)

1946
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,449
(78 hours)

1947
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:56,249
(It turns out you don’t die even without a phone.)

1948
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,919
(80 hours)

1949
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,400
(She asked Mimi to take a picture as she didn't have a phone.)

1950
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:03,489
(Finally, 82 hours)

1951
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:15,300
(Now 82 hours and more?)

1952
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:18,800
When I get my phone back, I want to take a selfie.

1953
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:21,070
You have...

1954
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:23,286
- Finally. - completed your digital detox.

1955
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,140
- Now, I give you back your phone. - Finally.

1956
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,680
Congratulations!

1957
01:07:27,681 --> 01:07:29,109
(Congratulations)

1958
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:30,150
Turn it on.

1959
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,219
It feels so good to have my phone back.

1960
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,249
I'm really grateful.

1961
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:36,619
It's all thanks to your support and the loaned phones.

1962
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,660
- Yes. - Right.

1963
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,700
I think it got a shock because you turned it on after so long.

1964
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:42,129
I got a text message.

1965
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:43,730
It says, "Can you use your phone today?"

1966
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:46,029
(Sorry for the inconvenience.)

1967
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,030
I also got a message from a bank.

1968
01:07:47,031 --> 01:07:49,700
(She's reading the messages like an acceptance speech.)

1969
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,540
Also, there are some messages from friends.

1970
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,709
- Congrats, Young Ji. - Thank you.

1971
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,909
You made it through the never-ending detox.

1972
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:57,639
- Thank you. - On a final note.

1973
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,150
- We owe you an apology. - What for?

1974
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,310
What is it?

1975
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,879
Thing is, there's a time difference...

1976
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,480
- between Abu Dhabi and here. - Yes.

1977
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:08,350
So if we stuck to Abu Dhabi time,

1978
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,189
- They didn't! - it should have ended at 2pm.

1979
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,590
(It should have ended 4 hours ago.)

1980
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:17,200
- That's absurd. - We miscalculated.

1981
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:19,869
Oh, no!

1982
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:20,900
How can this happen?

1983
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,599
They didn't calculate properly.

1984
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,069
- But... - There was a four-hour difference.

1985
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:28,040
How will you compensate me for the lost time?

1986
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:29,740
- Excuse me? - For the lost time.

1987
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,679
Are you saying I could have had my phone...

1988
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,409
during the photo contest?

1989
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,449
- That's right. - Right.

1990
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:37,450
Why would you tell me something I was better off not knowing?

1991
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:40,366
(Honestly, we only realized when it was time to give it back.)

1992
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:42,859
(A few days later...)

1993
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:44,490
APT, APT

1994
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:47,659
(Digital detox will return.)

1995
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,629
(Coming soon)

1996
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:51,659
- Thank you. - First,

1997
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,600
why don't you take a selfie to celebrate?

1998
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,069
(Just like that, she's all smiles again.)

1999
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,590
- Let's take a photo together. - Okay.

2000
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:57,939
One, two.

2001
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,446
(This is the first selfie taken with Young Ji’s phone.)

2002
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:01,210
One, two, three.

2003
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,640
I want to ask you to do one thing.

2004
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:07,549
- North and Central America is? - North and Central America is?

2005
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:09,309
- The US, Canada, - The US, Canada,

2006
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:10,419
- Mexico. - Mexico.

2007
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,420
Thank you.

2008
01:09:11,421 --> 01:09:12,650
I want to zone out.

2009
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,019
- Let's do that. - Zone out.

2010
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,250
Let's zone out.

2011
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,689
This is nice.

2012
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,490
(It's time to soak in the sunset.)

2013
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,360
(Yachts are drifting gently down the river.)

2014
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,700
(Lovers sit by the riverside.)

2015
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,230
(Mimi is capturing the beautiful scenery.)

2016
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:29,700
This is nice.

2017
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,570
(Eun Ji’s lost in the moment, taking photos.)

2018
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:37,680
Yu Jin, you look pretty.

2019
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,650
(Excited)

2020
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,480
(Yu Jin is getting her best photo too.)

2021
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,620
How does it feel to take selfies?

2022
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:47,790
It's nice.

2023
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:50,419
That sunset is insane.

2024
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,159
We'd probably never see something like that again.

2025
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,190
It won't be easy.

2026
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,700
(They leave the beautiful sunset behind.)

2027
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:03,240
What are we having for dinner?

2028
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,940
I'm hungry.

2029
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:08,010
Who is the most famous person in Portugal?

2030
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:10,179
- Ronaldo is the most famous. - Cristiano Ronaldo!

2031
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,440
- That's correct. - Ronaldo.

2032
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:14,149
We're going to Ronaldo's...

2033
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:15,630
- My goodness. - favorite restaurant.

2034
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:18,080
- Really? - It's the best place in Lisbon.

2035
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,749
- Ronaldo? - We're headed there.

2036
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:21,789
(Portuguese dinner is coming up!)

2037
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:22,959
We'll go there now!

2038
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,319
- Yes. - Let's go!

2039
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,490
Amazing.

2040
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:31,800
(As they leave the main street into a narrow alleyway, )

2041
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,670
(the sun has set completely.)

2042
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:36,970
(They arrive at the restaurant.)
- Is the place? - This is it.

2043
01:10:37,971 --> 01:10:39,040
- Nice. - This is it.

2044
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,709
- Is this the place? Amazing! - This way.

2045
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,390
- This must be the place. - Come this way.

2046
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,140
(When you step through the door, )

2047
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:46,410
(you see the place is packed with customers.)

2048
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:50,220
(The walls are covered with photos of celebrities.)

2049
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,396
(There is the world-class soccer player, Cristiano Ronaldo.)

2050
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,020
(Legendary soccer icon, David Beckham)

2051
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,650
(The GOAT of soccer, Lionel Messi)

2052
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,136
(Portuguese soccer hero, Luis Figo)

2053
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,396
(Legendary metal band, Metallica)

2054
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:02,130
(It is a go-to spot for celebrities from Portugal and beyond.)

2055
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,100
(It is famous all the way to the moon.)

2056
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:13,670
(This is the place where you can try all the iconic Portuguese dishes.)

2057
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:17,740
(Lisbon’s most popular restaurant)

2058
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:24,950
(Even Ronaldo fell in love with tonight's dinner spot.)

2059
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,420
(The entire building is a restaurant.)

2060
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:31,920
(Agents enter.)

2061
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,530
(They climb the stairs to the 3rd floor for dinner.)

2062
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:36,799
- Wow, this is nice. - This place is really famous.

2063
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,960
- I think the food will be great. - It's insane.

2064
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,300
There are so many people.

2065
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,040
These are all autographs.

2066
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:46,100
- So many celebrities came here? - It's insane.

2067
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:47,970
Why aren't there any photos of us?

2068
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:49,469
Let’s hang up our photo too!

2069
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,486
(It is not allowed due to identity exposure issues.)

2070
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,179
Since this is Ronaldo's favorite place,

2071
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,250
shall we wear the jerseys?

2072
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:55,379
- Okay. - Let's do that.

2073
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,649
- Right. - Good thing you're wearing it.

2074
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:58,120
It's perfect. Good thinking.

2075
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,319
- Good thing you're wearing it. - Get the energy.

2076
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,350
Young Ji is giving us energy.

2077
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,460
- I'm Hee Eun. - Thank you.

2078
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,790
Where are my glasses?

2079
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,260
- Where are my glasses? - Where are they?

2080
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:09,929
Young Ji is very cute.

2081
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:10,999
- Thank you. - You're good at this.

2082
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,229
It rolls right off the tongue now.

2083
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:14,630
- Very natural. - I've turned totally into Hee Eun.

2084
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,500
(Yang Hee Eun Ji is satisfied.)

2085
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:19,869
- She's good. - She is.

2086
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,440
This works. What’s the secret?

2087
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:23,739
There is no secret.

2088
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,840
(There is no secret!)

2089
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,080
I guess practice is the only way.

2090
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:31,950
Okay. The name of this restaurant is Solar Dos Presuntos.

2091
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,820
- Solar Dos Presuntos.. - Okay.

2092
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,550
It opened in 1974.

2093
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:37,496
- It's the same age as my mom. - It is visited by not only Ronaldo,

2094
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,389
- but by David Beckham, - David Beckham.

2095
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:41,289
- Luis Figo, - Luis Figo.

2096
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:43,160
- Jose Mourinho. - Mourinho.

2097
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,460
- Do you know who they are? - They are soccer players.

2098
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,970
Even the Queen of Spain came.

2099
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:48,669
- The queen came? - And...

2100
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:50,400
the band Metallica also came.

2101
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,139
Metallica.

2102
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:53,469
(Mouth electric guitar)

2103
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,970
Since we're serving some rare delicacies,

2104
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:57,610
we can't just hand them out.

2105
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,880
There's a quality that's crucial for any agent.

2106
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:02,079
It's the ability to identify...

2107
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,219
- a criminal's face. - That.

2108
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:04,819
The ability to instantly call out...

2109
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:05,896
- who's who. - That's right.

2110
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,350
We'll do the "Guess Who?" quiz.

2111
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,689
(Guess Who?)

2112
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:11,589
(Look at the given photo and guess the name.)

2113
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:13,871
If you complete the round trip, you get to eat that dish.

2114
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:16,060
(If you get it wrong...)

2115
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,800
You quietly return it.

2116
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:20,569
What am I going to do?

2117
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:22,900
Mimi shouted "Ronaldo" during this quiz, remember?

2118
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,100
(Mimi's legendary wrong answer from Season 2)

2119
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:26,310
One, two, three!

2120
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,070
(Ronaldo)

2121
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:32,480
(Two years have passed since she shouted the name.)

2122
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,320
(Like fate, they've arrived at Ronaldo’s favorite restaurant.)

2123
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:36,620
What am I going to do?

2124
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,119
- I'm so bad with names. - It's okay, Mimi.

2125
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,390
There is Chung Kyung Ho.

2126
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,090
And Jeon Mi Do.

2127
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,720
- Why are you... - Then there's one I got wrong.

2128
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,860
- Jung Yu Mi. - Yes, Jung Yu Mi.

2129
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:48,830
(She didn't only get those names wrong.)

2130
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:50,199
One, two, three.

2131
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:55,730
(At times, she couldn't even say the name at all.)

2132
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:58,740
(Cutie Kim Seo Jin)

2133
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,809
(Kim Bum Soo)

2134
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,209
Are you calling Park Bo Gum Kim Bum Soo?

2135
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:04,930
(Her specialty is giving people new names.)

2136
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,580
I remember.

2137
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:08,726
Getting it wrong like that takes skills.

2138
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,680
- I’m nailing it today! - You can do it.

2139
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,720
- You will? - You will?

2140
01:14:11,721 --> 01:14:13,850
(Will Mimi redeem herself at Ronaldo's restaurant?)

2141
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,659
You should at least get to...

2142
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:19,319
- take a look at the food first. - Agreed.

2143
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,159
I’m hungry. I pedaled way too hard.

2144
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,889
- Super hungry. - Show us the food.

2145
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:24,170
- It's the first dish. - Please.

2146
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,829
- Please. - Please.

2147
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:27,830
What is this?

2148
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:29,570
- What is it? - What is it?

2149
01:14:29,571 --> 01:14:31,139
- It's salmon. - It's salmon.

2150
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,010
Up first is salmon ceviche.

2151
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,710
Ceviche, I love it.

2152
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:38,210
(Ceviche)

2153
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,879
(It is seafood salad made with raw fish or shellfish...)

2154
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,000
(marinated in lime juice and served with vegetables.)

2155
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,820
(Here, salmon ceviche comes with mango and a splash of salsa sauce.)

2156
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:49,390
(It is the perfect sweet and tangy appetizer.)

2157
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:52,659
(Salmon ceviche)

2158
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,859
Any idea what it is? Yu Jin, can you explain?

2159
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,359
It's like tartare, but with raw fish?

2160
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,759
(It's like beef tartare, but made with seafood.)

2161
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,859
You got it exactly right!

2162
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,229
(You got it exactly right!)

2163
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:02,329
Do any of you like salmon or raw fish?

2164
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:03,799
- I love them. - We all love them.

2165
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,269
- Everyone loves salmon. - I see.

2166
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:06,339
One person should get a taste.

2167
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,669
- Please. - Let's have a taste.

2168
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,370
- Please. - General knowledge quiz?

2169
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:11,379
- North and Central America is? - North and Central America is?

2170
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,300
- Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

2171
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,350
- You lose. - Yu Jin!

2172
01:15:14,351 --> 01:15:15,709
- What's wrong with Yu Jin? - Yu Jin.

2173
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:17,549
- I'm so happy. - It's bad for her.

2174
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:19,479
Play or lose.

2175
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,840
Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors.

2176
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,520
Young Ji, you lose.

2177
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,059
What's up with Mimi these days?

2178
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,390
I'm getting smarter.

2179
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:26,959
- With rock-paper-scissors? - With rock-paper-scissors?

2180
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:27,990
Either way.

2181
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,630
Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors!

2182
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,459
It's been a while, but the big sister gets lucky.

2183
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,569
- It's been a while. - In fact,

2184
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,629
Eun Ji and Yu Jin have the best luck with tasting challenge.

2185
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:37,600
Mimi has been lucky these days.

2186
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:39,840
- Hey. - I'm sorry but...

2187
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:41,869
you're supposed to just have a taste.

2188
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,586
(They didn't expect Eun Ji to take such a big bite.)

2189
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:44,610
(Taking a whiff)

2190
01:15:44,611 --> 01:15:47,209
Oh my, it has the smell of the sauce I love.

2191
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:48,879
- What sauce? - It has...

2192
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:49,880
(Other girls look like baby birds.)

2193
01:15:49,881 --> 01:15:52,020
I'm salivating. It smells a bit like oriental sauce.

2194
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:54,849
(She takes a huge spoonful.)

2195
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,620
- She's a good eater. - It looks so good.

2196
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:59,960
- She's for real. - Right.

2197
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:02,130
- The salmon is... - It even sounds tasty.

2198
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,230
It feels so fresh.

2199
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:07,399
It disappears instantly. There's nothing left. It's gone.

2200
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,576
(There's nothing left. The salmon is gone!)

2201
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,540
- She's so lucky. - Where's the salmon?

2202
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:12,469
(Envious)

2203
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:14,439
(Round 1, Salmon ceviche)

2204
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,440
In 3, 2, 1.

2205
01:16:15,441 --> 01:16:16,640
- E-cade! - E-cade!

2206
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:17,809
- This is it. - Young Ji, will you go first?

2207
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:19,709
- I'll go first. - This is a round trip.

2208
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:20,949
We start with Young Ji, then we loop back.

2209
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:21,950
- Keep cool. - Okay.
Stay sharp, everyone.

2210
01:16:22,951 --> 01:16:24,149
- We’re hitting it hard this round! - Great.

2211
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:25,419
- This is training! - Hit us hard!

2212
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,449
- You're agents! - Don't hold back!

2213
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:27,489
- Hit us hard. - Stay sharp!

2214
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:28,490
- Yes! - Hit us hard!

2215
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,420
- In 1, 2, 3. - Pa... Yoo Hai Jin.

2216
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:31,859
You get a warning.

2217
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:32,860
(Sighing)

2218
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,960
- In 1, 2, 3. - Chef Sung Anh.

2219
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,229
- You have the same surname. - Same surname.

2220
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:40,300
- Wait... Wait a minute! - Mimi, be cool.

2221
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:41,669
- In 1, 2, 3. - Doh Kyung Soo.

2222
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:42,670
That's correct.

2223
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,440
- In 1, 2, 3. - Car the garden.

2224
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,139
- Correct! - She's good.

2225
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,170
That was a difficult one.

2226
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,370
- In 1, 2, 3. - Is it Shin Jun...?

2227
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,180
- Wrong! - Nearly there.

2228
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:53,450
- You got only half right. - Shin Jun...

2229
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,310
(Laughing hard)

2230
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,980
(You got only half right.)

2231
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:58,950
- Do you know who it is? - Jun...

2232
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:00,150
You got half of it right.

2233
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,989
Shin Hyun Joon?

2234
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:03,119
(It’s on the tip of her tongue.)

2235
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,460
He's a member of TOMORROW X TOGETHER.

2236
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:06,930
So you know who it is.

2237
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,960
But I can't really remember the name.

2238
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,200
Shin Jun Min.

2239
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,699
(Where did the "Min" come from?)

2240
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,629
Try changing the first word.

2241
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,169
Just change the first word.

2242
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,440
- Kim Jun. - Kim Jun?

2243
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,740
- That's funny. - Is Jun Min correct?

2244
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,309
- No, it's just "Jun." - Just "Jun."

2245
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:22,870
His name has two syllables. Just "Jun".

2246
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,210
- Something "Jun." - Choi Jun!

2247
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:25,840
Not it.

2248
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,680
- Mimi. - Sit down, please,

2249
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:29,919
- For YEONJUN, - YEONJUN.

2250
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,379
- this is a very sad thing. - Mimi.

2251
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,449
He’s a top-tier 4th-generation idol.

2252
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:36,049
How can you not know the name of your junior?

2253
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:37,259
You don't know the name of your junior.

2254
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,889
You'll be bumping into him in the waiting room.

2255
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:40,089
- Right. - Will you be okay?

2256
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,260
I don't have the connection.

2257
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,399
- You can say that again! - Right.

2258
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,100
You didn't get that one syllable.

2259
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:47,430
You don't have the connection.

2260
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:51,300
(TOMORROW X TOGETHER, we're sorry. We messed up the title last time.)

2261
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,739
(And now, we got YEONJUN's name wrong too.)

2262
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:57,240
(We're taking back the salmon ceviche.)

2263
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:58,710
This is really rough!

2264
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,580
(Laughing)

2265
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,979
- What about our seats? - Seats?

2266
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,850
- I'll go to your place. - Okay.

2267
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:07,419
Still, the fact that we looped all the way back to Mimi...

2268
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,619
- on the first try is encouraging. - That's right.

2269
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:10,689
Hey, nailing Chef Anh's name was awesome.

2270
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:11,790
I was good, wasn't I?

2271
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,030
(They change seats.)

2272
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:16,799
- All right. - It's such a pity.

2273
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,129
- The first dish was really good. - Right.

2274
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:20,370
- I thought we'd win it. - I think I'll get an actor.

2275
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:23,199
- As long as it’s not a foreigner. - I really hope it's a foreigner.

2276
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,240
You'd prefer that?

2277
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:26,740
- You need to see the second dish. - I'm hungry.

2278
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:27,910
- It goes over easy. - What is that?
What is it?

2279
01:18:28,911 --> 01:18:31,139
- I love this kind of a pot. - What do you think it is?

2280
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,810
Please smell it and take a guess.

2281
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:34,510
(Sniffing)

2282
01:18:34,511 --> 01:18:36,820
- Is it curry? - It’s the kind we had yesterday.

2283
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:38,670
- That kind. - Seafood rice?

2284
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:39,949
(It has the similar fragrance of seafood rice.)

2285
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:41,019
- Smell it. - It has a good smell!

2286
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,260
- It smells like tom yum kung. - Really?

2287
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,119
Go ahead and give it a stir.

2288
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,120
It smells of seafood.

2289
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:47,759
- It's crab meat. - It's crab meat.

2290
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,930
- Like tom yum kung. - Now!

2291
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:50,659
It's lobster soup!

2292
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,220
- I've never had one before. - Lobster!

2293
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,500
The rich broth is the real thing.

2294
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:57,300
The broth is made by pureeing the lobster.

2295
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,910
- The taste must be insane. - It must be rich and creamy.

2296
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:03,940
(This soup is made with pureed lobster.)

2297
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:06,050
(It is packed with a deep, rich ocean flavor.)

2298
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:07,709
(There are chunks of lobster meat.)

2299
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:09,710
(Lobster soup)

2300
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,319
- It looks good. - It's very creamy.

2301
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,649
You have to begin with the pre-meal soup.

2302
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:14,719
- We can start with this. - Nice and hot.

2303
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,789
Should we just go for it?

2304
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:16,790
- Okay. - Should we just go for it?

2305
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:18,351
- Let's do it. - You want to go for it?

2306
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,559
We’re on a roll right now.

2307
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,589
- You are? - Mimi.

2308
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:21,629
- Mimi. - We got this.

2309
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:23,259
- Don’t get intimidated. - Don't get intimidated.

2310
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,500
- Keep your head up. - Okay!

2311
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,729
- No one will judge you. - We already went around once.

2312
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:27,799
- We went around once. - Don't worry.

2313
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,299
- You got this. - Go, Mimi.

2314
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,440
- Let's do this. - We're going full speed.

2315
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:34,309
- In 1, 2, 3. - Gabee.

2316
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,410
Correct!

2317
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:37,180
That photo was hard.

2318
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:39,580
- In 1, 2, 3. - Kim Ji Won.

2319
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:40,610
That's correct.

2320
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:41,880
That's Kim Ji Won.

2321
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,319
- In 1, 2, 3. - It's Haewon.

2322
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,350
Correct!

2323
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,219
- In 1, 2, 3. - Who are you?

2324
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,020
- Wrong! - It's WON BIN.

2325
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:52,160
(I'm WON BIN, a member of RIIZE.)

2326
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,266
You guys struggle with the fourth-generation idols.

2327
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,290
We are.

2328
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,330
You know so much about dancing.

2329
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,700
- We are... - Sorry, WON BIN.

2330
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,430
We had a nice flow going.

2331
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,630
- We did? - Yes.

2332
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,139
- It's such a pity. - Give us one more chance.

2333
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:05,269
- What? - I really want to eat that.

2334
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:06,399
Give us one more chance.

2335
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,969
- Just one more. - Please.

2336
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,309
- I'm begging you. - I need an appetizer.

2337
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:11,079
- If we can't have the appetizer, - Appetizer!

2338
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,739
The main dish loses its meaning.

2339
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:14,079
We'll get indigestion.

2340
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,080
For sure...

2341
01:20:15,081 --> 01:20:16,919
- the recent... - We'll get indigestion?

2342
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,549
Honestly, if I don't get an appetizer, I get indigestion.

2343
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,850
- We can get sudden indigestion. - So true.

2344
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:23,090
The questions are so good.

2345
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,559
- They're so on trend. - Right.

2346
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,919
- I'm so grateful. - You guys are the best!

2347
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,929
(They are showered with praise like never before.)

2348
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:29,430
- Great questions. - The best!

2349
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,859
(Captain is in a good mood now.)

2350
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,470
(Were the questions that good?)

2351
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,529
(The writers don’t know what to do with themselves.)

2352
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:36,699
- One more time! - Please.

2353
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,300
- One more time! - Great questions.

2354
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:40,109
- One more time! - One more time!

2355
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:41,310
(Chuckling)

2356
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,109
- They're so generous. - Just one more chance.

2357
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:44,110
- Just one more. - Thank you.
I love lobster soup.

2358
01:20:45,111 --> 01:20:46,586
- This is a great game. - Do we start from the top?

2359
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:47,909
You go in reverse order starting from Eun Ji.

2360
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:49,210
- Okay. - We got this.

2361
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:50,720
Our oldest sister.

2362
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,220
(Round 3, Lobster soup rechallenge)

2363
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,990
- Agent Eun Ji, you're up. - All right.

2364
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,019
- In 1, 2, 3. - Ryu Seung Ryong.

2365
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,540
- Correct! - I didn't know who it was.

2366
01:20:58,820 --> 01:20:59,860
In 1, 2, 3.

2367
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,390
- President Obama. - Wrong!

2368
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,029
- She got it! - She got it!

2369
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:04,030
In 1, 2, 3.

2370
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,329
(Obama... Wrong!)

2371
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:08,329
(Young Ji was faster by a split second.)

2372
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:09,769
- She got it. - That was a buzzer beater.

2373
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:10,799
Buzzer beater.

2374
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,040
- Buzzer beater. - I choked up.

2375
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,610
- Why? - I was grateful.

2376
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:17,140
- Why? - He was responsible for the US.

2377
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:20,010
- But why are you... - Why...

2378
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,909
- North and Central America is? - North and Central America is?

2379
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:22,910
- The US. - The US.

2380
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:24,079
- Canada. - Canada.

2381
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,079
- Mexico! - Mexico!

2382
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,349
But why is a Korean choking up?

2383
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,389
That was a buzzer beater.

2384
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:32,350
(Anyway, they cleared North and Central America!)

2385
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:33,660
Let's go.

2386
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:35,429
- In 1, 2, 3. - NATTY.

2387
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:36,459
- Great. - That's correct.

2388
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,029
- No. - In 1, 2, 3.

2389
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:39,400
- It's REI. - Correct!

2390
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,530
(My little sister)

2391
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,799
- In 1, 2, 3. - Park Hae In?

2392
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,539
- Wrong! - It's Jung Hae In.

2393
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,210
Yu Jin is in big trouble now.

2394
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,270
- That was so close. - Park Hae In?

2395
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:50,639
So close.

2396
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,580
- That was so close. - Oh, no.

2397
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,110
Hello, Hae In.

2398
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:58,649
The way your hair was parted was more off to the side than usual.

2399
01:21:58,650 --> 01:21:59,650
- To the side. - It was way to the side.
His part is perfectly normal.

2400
01:22:00,651 --> 01:22:02,189
- His hair is always like this. - So, I got a little confused.

2401
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:04,990
Hae In, I'm always so grateful to you.

2402
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,490
Why on earth did I call him Park Hae In?

2403
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:11,099
(Lobster soup goes out.)

2404
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,299
However,

2405
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,030
- This is hard. - compared to the past...

2406
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,200
- We're better. - you actually made...

2407
01:22:15,201 --> 01:22:16,269
- decent progress. - He's right.

2408
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,550
- We're not bad. - That's right.

2409
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:19,740
- I'm good. - Right.

2410
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,440
Mimi is doing a good job.

2411
01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:23,161
- I'm no longer stupid. - She's doing good.

2412
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:24,710
You didn't get everything right.

2413
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,039
You got the wrong answer.

2414
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,849
- You have to be careful. - You got the first question wrong.

2415
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,750
- Give us food! - Give us food!

2416
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:30,919
What's that?

2417
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:31,920
- It's a drink. - So suddenly?

2418
01:22:31,921 --> 01:22:33,321
- It's that. - A drink so suddenly?

2419
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:36,089
You could have eaten the first two dishes.

2420
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:38,259
- That would have been perfect. - If you had eaten them,

2421
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:39,589
it would've been time for this refreshing drink.

2422
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:41,390
Have you heard of sangria?

2423
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:44,830
(It's red wine mixed with fruits, an iconic Iberian cocktail.)

2424
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,800
(This restaurant’s special sangria is made with champagne.)

2425
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,040
(Sangria)

2426
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:54,740
(Impressed)

2427
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,639
- Sangria! - Sangria!

2428
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,310
Sangria. Is it alcohol?

2429
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,639
Sangria...

2430
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,910
- has a little bit of alcohol. - I can't drink that.

2431
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,919
(This idol is suddenly hit with a headache.)

2432
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:04,920
She's at it again.

2433
01:23:04,921 --> 01:23:06,989
What are Mimi and I supposed to drink?

2434
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:08,889
What about the beer you just had?

2435
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:10,489
- We had no choice. - But...

2436
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:12,036
- For the sake of the show. - But we already...

2437
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,789
But we already drank so much on "Vroom Vroom."

2438
01:23:13,790 --> 01:23:14,989
We had a lot of makgeolli.

2439
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,600
We drank six bottles of soju on "Vroom Vroom."

2440
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:19,099
(Slapping)

2441
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,469
- Let's go. - Let's go, then.

2442
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:21,476
- Okay. - Yes, give us sangria.

2443
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,669
So if you guys succeed,

2444
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:24,440
we'll pour you each a glass of sangria.

2445
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,899
Should we start with you, Mimi?

2446
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,109
- Shall we? - Yes, I'll go first.

2447
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:28,240
- That sounds good. - Okay.

2448
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:31,380
- One, two, three! - Dex.

2449
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:34,210
- What happened to her? - Goodness.

2450
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:36,009
- One, two, three! - WINTER.

2451
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:37,150
That is correct.

2452
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:39,119
- One, two, three! - Lee Yi Kyung.

2453
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,180
- Correct! - Young Ji!

2454
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:42,550
- Young Ji, look at you! - Correct!

2455
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,789
- One, two, three! - Lee Mu Jin.

2456
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:45,820
Correct!

2457
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:48,090
We've reached the halfway point. Let's continue.

2458
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:50,959
- One, two, three! - Philips.

2459
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,229
- That's correct! - I mean, FELIX.

2460
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:53,300
You're so good!

2461
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,999
- She's right. - Yes, she is.

2462
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,029
(He said she was correct because he heard FELIX.)

2463
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,339
- Wait a minute. - No, it's okay.

2464
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,340
Come on, she's right.

2465
01:23:58,341 --> 01:23:59,369
(I'm innocent.)

2466
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:00,886
- His name is in English. - It's okay.

2467
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,230
- This is a warning. - A warning.

2468
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:04,780
One, two, three!

2469
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,710
- Ha Jung Woo? - Wrong!

2470
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,550
(The ace answered wrong twice in a row.)

2471
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,219
(The original weak link is amazed, too.)

2472
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:15,320
- I think Yu Jin is broken. - Right?

2473
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,359
Oh, I saw him on "I Live Alone."

2474
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,459
Yes, that's right.

2475
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,930
- Announcer Kim Dae Ho. - It's Kim Dae Ho.

2476
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,090
What's wrong with me?

2477
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,729
- He went freelance recently, too. - Right.

2478
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,930
Congratulations, sir.

2479
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,670
(Congrats on no sangria.)

2480
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:30,699
Yu Jin, you only have to answer one question here.

2481
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:31,799
- Do you want to take this spot? - Can I?

2482
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,216
- Sure. - I'm not doing so well today.

2483
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,909
This is bad. Yu Jin is broken.

2484
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:37,779
This isn't my field.

2485
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:39,479
- And... - Yu Jin isn't normally like this.

2486
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,349
- the twist is with Mimi. - Right.

2487
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:42,609
- She's so stable today. - So calm, too.

2488
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,450
- Mimi is doing great. - Mimi, I think I know.

2489
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:46,826
You're doing well because you think this is a practice round.

2490
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:48,119
Let's all think we're just practicing.

2491
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,149
We just had dishes that you didn't really like,

2492
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:51,789
so you consider it as a practice round, and you ace it.

2493
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:52,819
- Good, a practice round. - Was that your trick, Mimi?

2494
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:53,989
I'll just take it easy.

2495
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:55,859
- Take it easy. - Good.

2496
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:58,430
Maybe Yu Jin could learn a thing or two from Mimi.

2497
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:00,900
- I'll take it easy. - You will?

2498
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:03,170
She's mocking me!

2499
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,600
(Puppy An learned impersonations from Parrot Mim.)

2500
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,440
Is it a main dish?

2501
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,269
- I'm so hungry right now. - We're hungry.

2502
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,979
- Gosh! - We're really getting started now.

2503
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,709
- It's a steak! - You guys, look!

2504
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:15,779
- Guys! - We have to win this round.

2505
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:17,349
- We have to eat this. - We have to win.

2506
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:19,380
- Just look at it. - Look here!

2507
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:20,990
This is a beef steak.

2508
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:23,249
(Juicy and soft beef steak)

2509
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:26,260
(It also has pork jamon on top for a rich flavor.)

2510
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:30,700
(Paired with soft and fresh creamed spinach)

2511
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,030
(Beef steak)

2512
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,629
- I love creamed spinach! - Calm down.

2513
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:38,400
- Could we try it? - Just one bite.

2514
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:40,410
- Just one piece. - Okay.

2515
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:43,540
Rock-paper-scissors.

2516
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:46,079
- Goodness. - What is wrong with me today?

2517
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,380
We won?

2518
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,080
(Rage unlike anything before)

2519
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:51,279
- Ba! - We won! Bo!

2520
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,650
- Cross! - Cross!

2521
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:54,820
(Angry at herself)

2522
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,759
I'm so mad!

2523
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,960
- Why? Why are you so mad? - Gosh!

2524
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,030
Rock-paper-scissors was my thing!

2525
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:05,029
- Rock-paper-scissors was her thing. - It was mine!

2526
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:06,500
Rock-paper-scissors were mine!

2527
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,570
(She was against the members who only played papers.)

2528
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,540
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

2529
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:17,240
(So she always won by playing scissors.)

2530
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:23,080
(This was back when she had everything she wanted to try.)

2531
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,649
It's karma, I tell you.

2532
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:26,249
(Analyzing why she lost)

2533
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:27,650
Rock-paper-scissors.

2534
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:31,220
- Parrot Mim! - Yes!

2535
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:33,759
- Parrot Mim! - That's me!

2536
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,260
- Could you cut us a piece? - I won!

2537
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:36,959
Parrot Mim...

2538
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,429
- This is amazing. - Parrot Mim, please add the sauce.

2539
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:40,669
- It looks so good. - The creamed spinach.

2540
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:41,829
Get a big scoop.

2541
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:44,100
(A big scoop of creamed spinach on top of the steak)

2542
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:45,169
(Along with a potato chip)

2543
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:47,670
- Mimi, let's go! - This is the real thing.

2544
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:50,370
(Jealous)

2545
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:51,640
All in one bite!

2546
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:54,350
- Gosh. - Mimi.

2547
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,049
(Nodding)

2548
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,220
It looks so good.

2549
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:59,579
(Parrot Mim's real reaction to real good food)

2550
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,350
- Goodness. - Parrot Mim!

2551
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:04,460
Parrot Mim, how good is it?

2552
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,919
- This is awesome. - Is it that good?

2553
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,020
Savor it slowly.

2554
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:09,059
- The dip is the best. - The creamed spinach?

2555
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:10,700
- The spinach? - It tastes...

2556
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:12,800
sweet, but also...

2557
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:16,500
It's almost like cream cheese.

2558
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,599
The three of them together...

2559
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,639
- It's perfect? - I could have it all day.

2560
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,146
(The combination of the three is harmonious.)

2561
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:24,479
By the way, Agent Yu Jin.

2562
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,440
What happened to your rock-paper-scissors skills?

2563
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:28,350
It's the wheel of life.

2564
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,730
- It's because she had sinned? - Of course.

2565
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,179
Whenever we tried a dish out,

2566
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:36,289
- Yu Jin won almost all the time. - Right.

2567
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:39,160
- This is her karma. - So she's being punished?

2568
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:40,889
- It's okay, we can just win. - That's right.

2569
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:42,490
- Right, it's okay. - We got this.

2570
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:44,330
(Round 5, beef steak)

2571
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:46,499
How about we start with Yu Jin this time?

2572
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,700
- Yu Jin can overcome this... - Okay, I got this!

2573
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,800
- by facing it head-on. - Take it easy!

2574
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,569
(With the "take it easy" spirit)

2575
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:54,169
- Take it easy! Who are you? - Take it easy!

2576
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:55,770
- Just take it easy! - Hey!

2577
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:57,909
- Who is this? - We'll start.

2578
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:59,810
- We can do this. - Who are you?

2579
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,250
One, two, three!

2580
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:05,980
(I'd rather be a laughing pierrot)

2581
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,219
- I'd rather be - Wrong!

2582
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:10,490
- a laughing pierrot - Wrong!

2583
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,659
(She's dealing with the trauma of losing with dance.)

2584
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:14,430
(Yu Jin was wrong three rounds in a row.)

2585
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,590
- She's Kim Wan Sun. - Right.

2586
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:19,299
- Okay, the round is over. - Come on, why?

2587
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,970
- Please! - Could you let this slide?

2588
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,130
(In despair)

2589
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:24,369
But I got it right.

2590
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:25,700
No, you didn't!

2591
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,040
- An Yu Jin. - But she sang the song.

2592
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:29,370
An Yu Jin, get over here.

2593
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:31,779
- You... - I'm already here.

2594
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:34,249
- This is unacceptable, Yu Jin! - This round ended quickly.

2595
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:35,380
I'm sorry.

2596
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,250
Wait, no! I'm not sorry!

2597
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,650
- Why aren't you sorry? - These things can happen!

2598
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,860
(Feisty is dumbfounded.)

2599
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,819
She's losing it!

2600
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,090
Why do you hate me?

2601
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:48,990
You get answers wrong, too!

2602
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:50,530
We're all human here.

2603
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,299
- She's losing it. - That's not what you said...

2604
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:53,900
when I was wrong.

2605
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:55,669
I'm sorry.

2606
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:57,799
- Okay, let's start again! - Today is the day of karma.

2607
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,399
Actually I... Eun Ji, could you go first?

2608
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,740
- Then I can start. - Gosh!

2609
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,940
- Then I'll start. - Gosh!

2610
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:07,950
- Awesome! - Ace Mimi!

2611
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:09,950
- You're so cool, Mimi. - Goodness.

2612
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,419
I can really count on you, Mimi.

2613
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:12,920
(Exclaiming)

2614
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,720
- What a day. - Parrot Mim is so cool.

2615
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:18,619
Beef tastes good, too.

2616
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:20,289
- But this restaurant is known... - This is amazing.

2617
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:21,729
For their seafood. You all saw the fish tank.

2618
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:24,429
This is their tiger prawns and butter rice.

2619
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:28,270
I heard the butter rice is really something else.

2620
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:31,800
(Tiger prawns with chewy flesh)

2621
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:37,210
(With butter rice rich with savory flavor)

2622
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,009
(Tiger prawns and butter rice)

2623
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,479
You could add that if you want.

2624
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,780
It smells amazing.

2625
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:46,320
(Everyone is mesmerized by the butter rice's aroma.)

2626
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,789
- The smell alone is delicious. - Right?

2627
01:29:48,790 --> 01:29:50,366
- Can we start right away, Eun Ji? - Mimi likes it.

2628
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:52,219
- I want to have it right now. - Let's start!

2629
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,319
Should we start while it's still warm?

2630
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,160
- Okay. - I shouldn't be so excited.

2631
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:56,359
I'll take it easy.

2632
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:57,600
- Take it easy. - Take it easy!

2633
01:29:58,130 --> 01:30:00,670
(Round 6, tiger prawns and butter rice)

2634
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,169
- One, two, three! - Eun Ji Won!

2635
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:04,300
- Correct. - Yes!

2636
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,740
- Oh, dear. - Oh, no!

2637
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:08,469
(My bad.)

2638
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:09,739
- You leaked it! - One, two, three!

2639
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:11,240
- SEUNGKWAN. - Correct!

2640
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,909
- One, two, three. - Kim Ah Young.

2641
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:16,580
- Correct! - Wait a minute!

2642
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,749
(It's today's weak link, Yu Jin's turn.)

2643
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:20,020
- Wait. - Here we go, Yu Jin.

2644
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:23,549
- One, two, three. - Eom Ji Yoon!

2645
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:24,660
- Yes! - Good job!

2646
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:27,660
(With that, they passed the halfway point.)

2647
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:30,030
- One, two, three! - CharlesEnter.

2648
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,399
That was a hard one.

2649
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,329
- She's right. She's a YouTuber. - Young Ji, hold me.

2650
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:35,129
- One, two, three! - Yano Shiho.

2651
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:36,269
- That's right. - Correct!

2652
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:37,800
- That's correct! - My gosh.

2653
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,639
(Take It Easy Mimi is the only one left.)

2654
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,240
- All right. - Last question.

2655
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:44,580
One, two, three!

2656
01:30:45,233 --> 01:30:48,402
(Take It Easy Mimi is the only one left.)

2657
01:30:48,403 --> 01:30:49,563
- All right. - Last question.

2658
01:30:50,713 --> 01:30:51,713
One, two, three!

2659
01:30:51,714 --> 01:30:52,913
Brian!

2660
01:30:54,013 --> 01:30:55,512
Correct!

2661
01:30:55,513 --> 01:30:57,453
(Brian)

2662
01:30:57,783 --> 01:30:59,883
(Their first success after 6 rounds)

2663
01:31:00,823 --> 01:31:02,722
Mimi, come here!

2664
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,352
- Eun Ji, we should eat. - Guys, let's eat.

2665
01:31:04,353 --> 01:31:06,393
- I overcame this! - Good work, guys.

2666
01:31:06,653 --> 01:31:08,663
- I might start crying. - I overcame this.

2667
01:31:08,793 --> 01:31:10,362
Yu Jin, you did well too.

2668
01:31:10,363 --> 01:31:12,092
I almost didn't recognize Eom Ji Yoon.

2669
01:31:12,093 --> 01:31:14,403
- We were really good just now. - Could you cut this?

2670
01:31:15,003 --> 01:31:16,902
- Eun Ji, go for it. - Thanks.

2671
01:31:16,903 --> 01:31:18,372
(They're splitting it into fours.)

2672
01:31:18,373 --> 01:31:20,403
- My heart is fluttering. - This piece is too big.

2673
01:31:20,703 --> 01:31:23,542
- You got CharlesEnter right. - We had difficult questions, too.

2674
01:31:23,543 --> 01:31:24,613
Right.

2675
01:31:24,943 --> 01:31:26,212
- Thank you for the meal. - Enjoy.

2676
01:31:26,213 --> 01:31:27,293
- My goodness. - Thank you!

2677
01:31:29,043 --> 01:31:30,342
Young Ji, you were so good.

2678
01:31:30,343 --> 01:31:33,113
(The weak link of the day takes a bite, too.)

2679
01:31:33,413 --> 01:31:35,153
The prawns are really plump.

2680
01:31:36,483 --> 01:31:38,393
(Exclaiming)

2681
01:31:38,653 --> 01:31:40,553
(The ace of the day tries the butter rice.)

2682
01:31:42,193 --> 01:31:43,322
Guys, the rice!

2683
01:31:43,323 --> 01:31:44,769
- What about it? - The rice is amazing!

2684
01:31:44,793 --> 01:31:47,502
It's kind of like abalone butter rice.

2685
01:31:47,503 --> 01:31:48,962
- I see what you mean. - Yes.

2686
01:31:48,963 --> 01:31:51,633
(Exclaiming)

2687
01:31:51,733 --> 01:31:54,403
I see why Ronaldo loves this place.

2688
01:31:54,803 --> 01:31:55,943
It's delicious.

2689
01:31:56,243 --> 01:31:58,172
But personally, guys...

2690
01:31:58,173 --> 01:32:00,172
I think we did a great job in that last round.

2691
01:32:00,173 --> 01:32:02,242
- There were lots of hard questions. - This is so good!

2692
01:32:02,243 --> 01:32:04,083
- Right! - We were awesome, guys.

2693
01:32:04,883 --> 01:32:05,913
My gosh!

2694
01:32:06,013 --> 01:32:07,253
What is that?

2695
01:32:08,083 --> 01:32:09,822
- Okay. - Hey, it's pulpo!

2696
01:32:09,823 --> 01:32:11,452
- It's an octopus dish. - It's pulpo!

2697
01:32:11,453 --> 01:32:12,792
- Pulpo. - I've never seen...

2698
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:14,122
such a fancy octopus dish.

2699
01:32:14,123 --> 01:32:16,522
This is not an ordinary pulpo that you see around.

2700
01:32:16,523 --> 01:32:19,993
It's pulpo a la gallega, a Galician dish.

2701
01:32:20,163 --> 01:32:21,802
(Galicia is the region in the northwest of Spain, )

2702
01:32:21,803 --> 01:32:24,333
(near the Portuguese border.)

2703
01:32:24,673 --> 01:32:30,743
(Boiled octopus seasoned with olive oil and paprika)

2704
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:35,213
(This Galician octopus dish is savory and rich in flavor.)

2705
01:32:35,313 --> 01:32:38,653
(Pulpo a la gallega)

2706
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:41,222
- Just one bite. - That won't do.

2707
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:42,543
- Just one bite. - Just one bite.

2708
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:45,129
You're really shameless for someone who is doing poorly today.

2709
01:32:45,153 --> 01:32:46,223
Just one bite!

2710
01:32:46,523 --> 01:32:48,569
- Rock-paper-scissors? - Just tell us when to start.

2711
01:32:48,593 --> 01:32:50,393
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors!

2712
01:32:51,493 --> 01:32:52,992
- My gosh. - Yu Jin, what's going on?

2713
01:32:52,993 --> 01:32:55,039
- I think you're really broken. - This is a big issue.

2714
01:32:55,063 --> 01:32:56,202
What happened to her?

2715
01:32:56,203 --> 01:32:58,102
- This is no laughing matter. - Right.

2716
01:32:58,103 --> 01:33:00,132
- What's going on? - This could lower your confidence.

2717
01:33:00,133 --> 01:33:02,173
- That's right. - When you lose your skills.

2718
01:33:02,573 --> 01:33:03,772
(I'd rather not watch.)

2719
01:33:03,773 --> 01:33:05,573
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2720
01:33:05,673 --> 01:33:07,312
- No way! - Could Mimi win this time too?

2721
01:33:07,313 --> 01:33:08,483
- Mimi, again? - Could she?

2722
01:33:08,713 --> 01:33:10,543
(The original ace can't bear to watch.)

2723
01:33:10,643 --> 01:33:12,113
Rock-paper-scissors!

2724
01:33:12,183 --> 01:33:13,253
- My goodness! - Gosh!

2725
01:33:13,483 --> 01:33:15,052
(Mimi is acing everything today!)

2726
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:16,153
- My goodness! - Gosh!

2727
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:17,922
Mimi won again!

2728
01:33:17,923 --> 01:33:20,192
- This is amazing. - Yu Jin, look. You're in trouble.

2729
01:33:20,193 --> 01:33:22,192
(The ace of the day goes over to have a bite.)

2730
01:33:22,193 --> 01:33:24,463
- Mimi, come and have a bite. - Mimi.

2731
01:33:25,233 --> 01:33:26,333
It smells zesty.

2732
01:33:26,363 --> 01:33:27,739
- It looks so good. - Mimi's on a roll today.

2733
01:33:27,763 --> 01:33:29,902
- I'm so jealous. - The octopus here is really good.

2734
01:33:29,903 --> 01:33:30,933
How is it?

2735
01:33:31,573 --> 01:33:32,903
Look how wide her eyes are!

2736
01:33:33,503 --> 01:33:34,573
What's wrong?

2737
01:33:34,843 --> 01:33:36,173
Mimi is amazed.

2738
01:33:36,373 --> 01:33:38,042
It tastes like mango.

2739
01:33:38,043 --> 01:33:39,843
- Really? A mango? - Do you mean the texture?

2740
01:33:39,873 --> 01:33:41,113
Yes, it's like chewing a mango.

2741
01:33:41,413 --> 01:33:43,112
It's not like the Korean parboiled octopus, right?

2742
01:33:43,113 --> 01:33:44,713
It's completely different!

2743
01:33:45,853 --> 01:33:47,253
It's savory...

2744
01:33:48,253 --> 01:33:50,522
- Tell us more! Describe it! - It's savory and...

2745
01:33:50,523 --> 01:33:51,992
It's very...

2746
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:54,522
- fresh and zesty. - They look like misers.

2747
01:33:54,523 --> 01:33:55,763
It's delicious.

2748
01:33:56,463 --> 01:33:58,333
(Round 7, pulpo a la gallega)

2749
01:33:58,533 --> 01:34:00,532
I can do this. I'll get back on track.

2750
01:34:00,533 --> 01:34:01,862
- You got this, Yu Jin. - Let's start.

2751
01:34:01,863 --> 01:34:04,003
Okay, we'll start with Mimi.

2752
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:07,432
- One, two, three! - Kim Chae Won.

2753
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:09,103
- Correct. - Let's go, guys.

2754
01:34:09,643 --> 01:34:11,143
- One, two, three! - Yuk Jun Seo.

2755
01:34:11,973 --> 01:34:13,843
- Eun Ji! - That's correct.

2756
01:34:14,643 --> 01:34:15,882
- One, two, three! - Yuna.

2757
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:16,883
Correct!

2758
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:18,004
(Time for today's weak link)

2759
01:34:18,183 --> 01:34:19,752
- One, two, three! - Lim Yon Ja!

2760
01:34:19,753 --> 01:34:21,422
I mean Kim Yon Ja!

2761
01:34:21,423 --> 01:34:24,323
(Amor Fati)

2762
01:34:24,523 --> 01:34:25,853
Amor fati

2763
01:34:28,523 --> 01:34:30,293
You're doing great!

2764
01:34:30,723 --> 01:34:31,862
(The Guess Who quiz turned into a music quiz.)

2765
01:34:31,863 --> 01:34:33,733
I was about to say you were wrong.

2766
01:34:34,063 --> 01:34:35,983
- I got it. - I was going to say you were wrong.

2767
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:38,033
It's Kim Yon Ja.

2768
01:34:38,403 --> 01:34:40,332
- I'll let this one slide. - Goodness.

2769
01:34:40,333 --> 01:34:41,602
- But it's also a warning. - Thank you.

2770
01:34:41,603 --> 01:34:43,642
- I'm warning you. - Thank you, Akh!

2771
01:34:43,643 --> 01:34:45,283
(They managed to pass the halfway point.)

2772
01:34:46,773 --> 01:34:48,782
- One, two, three! - Ohtani Shohei.

2773
01:34:48,783 --> 01:34:50,313
(Ohtani Shohei)

2774
01:34:50,343 --> 01:34:51,483
Ohtani Shohei.

2775
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:54,652
- I really didn't know. - My goodness!

2776
01:34:54,653 --> 01:34:55,653
(She hit a home run on the hardest question.)

2777
01:34:55,654 --> 01:34:57,183
- I had no idea. - Ohtani!

2778
01:34:57,223 --> 01:34:59,223
(Baseball celebration)

2779
01:34:59,423 --> 01:35:01,622
- I deserve two pieces! - Without question.

2780
01:35:01,623 --> 01:35:03,463
We're going to speed things up now.

2781
01:35:04,333 --> 01:35:05,892
- One, two, three! - Yuk Jun Seo.

2782
01:35:05,893 --> 01:35:08,563
- Wrong! - I thought it was him, too.

2783
01:35:08,633 --> 01:35:11,133
(Why would Yuk Jun Seo be in here twice?)

2784
01:35:11,303 --> 01:35:14,243
It's Um Tae Goo.

2785
01:35:14,343 --> 01:35:17,173
Ohtani Shohei was a legendary question.

2786
01:35:17,503 --> 01:35:18,972
- Eun Ji. - I even got that right, Eun Ji.

2787
01:35:18,973 --> 01:35:20,143
But Um Tae Goo?

2788
01:35:20,343 --> 01:35:21,512
(A sinner)

2789
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:22,513
- No. - What a shame.

2790
01:35:22,514 --> 01:35:24,412
I'm so sorry, Mr. Um.

2791
01:35:24,413 --> 01:35:25,852
You sound just like him!

2792
01:35:25,853 --> 01:35:27,722
I am doing your impression right now.

2793
01:35:27,723 --> 01:35:29,782
I think I'll be able to do his impression, too.

2794
01:35:29,783 --> 01:35:31,522
There are two Um Tae Goos here now.

2795
01:35:31,523 --> 01:35:33,022
- Hello, Mr. Um. - Good day, Mr. Um.

2796
01:35:33,023 --> 01:35:34,292
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

2797
01:35:34,293 --> 01:35:36,062
I heard you got my name wrong. Is it true?

2798
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:37,832
I'm so sorry, Mr. Um.

2799
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:40,563
I'm sorry, but Mr. Um doesn't talk that fast.

2800
01:35:41,203 --> 01:35:42,232
Thank you.

2801
01:35:42,233 --> 01:35:44,803
(Avoiding eye contact)

2802
01:35:44,873 --> 01:35:46,873
(The pulpo a la gallega is out.)

2803
01:35:47,073 --> 01:35:48,972
- No! - You guys were so close.

2804
01:35:48,973 --> 01:35:50,342
- It's okay. - I wanted to have it all together.

2805
01:35:50,343 --> 01:35:52,242
- I'm so hungry. - Guys, personally...

2806
01:35:52,243 --> 01:35:54,513
I think it's time to change our strategy.

2807
01:35:54,613 --> 01:35:55,812
- Because... - Should we switch spots?

2808
01:35:55,813 --> 01:35:57,482
I never got a question wrong.

2809
01:35:57,483 --> 01:35:59,412
Young Ji is unexpectedly good today.

2810
01:35:59,413 --> 01:36:00,683
- Right. - I'm amazing.

2811
01:36:01,483 --> 01:36:02,882
Yu Jin, how is your confidence level?

2812
01:36:02,883 --> 01:36:04,453
- It's higher now. - Really?

2813
01:36:04,493 --> 01:36:05,999
She becomes confident when others are wrong!

2814
01:36:06,023 --> 01:36:08,422
She's confident when others make mistakes. Good.

2815
01:36:08,423 --> 01:36:09,892
It's all thanks to Sally.

2816
01:36:09,893 --> 01:36:10,992
(Her confidence boosting friend)

2817
01:36:10,993 --> 01:36:12,492
- I regained my confidence. - Thanks to Sally!

2818
01:36:12,493 --> 01:36:13,533
I'm sorry.

2819
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:16,003
Here comes the next dish.

2820
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:17,132
(Gasping)

2821
01:36:17,133 --> 01:36:18,172
- What is it? - It smells great.

2822
01:36:18,173 --> 01:36:19,402
Gosh, I really want to have it.

2823
01:36:19,403 --> 01:36:20,602
(Cheering)

2824
01:36:20,603 --> 01:36:21,603
Is it paella?

2825
01:36:21,604 --> 01:36:23,343
This is the endgame, paella!

2826
01:36:23,543 --> 01:36:26,213
It was the staff's favorite dish.

2827
01:36:26,513 --> 01:36:28,442
(Bye)

2828
01:36:28,443 --> 01:36:30,513
(Paella)

2829
01:36:30,813 --> 01:36:34,483
(It's made by simmering rice with broth and different ingredients.)

2830
01:36:34,923 --> 01:36:37,923
(This restaurant's paella has pork, which is the kick.)

2831
01:36:38,193 --> 01:36:40,853
(Paella)

2832
01:36:40,953 --> 01:36:42,692
It'll be insane not to have this...

2833
01:36:42,693 --> 01:36:44,732
- after coming to Lisbon. - We should eat it. Please.

2834
01:36:44,733 --> 01:36:45,893
Go on and smell it.

2835
01:36:46,163 --> 01:36:47,463
(Exclaiming)

2836
01:36:47,533 --> 01:36:48,703
(Laughing)

2837
01:36:48,733 --> 01:36:51,003
The aroma almost blew my wig off.

2838
01:36:51,133 --> 01:36:52,302
- What? - Your wig?

2839
01:36:52,303 --> 01:36:53,332
Seriously.

2840
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:55,172
- What kind of aroma is that? - She's saying it was that good.

2841
01:36:55,173 --> 01:36:56,173
This is definitely tasty.

2842
01:36:56,174 --> 01:36:57,572
Could we please have it while it's still warm?

2843
01:36:57,573 --> 01:36:58,772
- Let's start right now! - Okay!

2844
01:36:58,773 --> 01:37:00,172
- We have to get this right. - Stand up!

2845
01:37:00,173 --> 01:37:01,742
- You can do this! - Let's go!

2846
01:37:01,743 --> 01:37:03,282
I lost my confidence.

2847
01:37:03,283 --> 01:37:04,612
- You can do this. - You got this.

2848
01:37:04,613 --> 01:37:05,912
- I lost it. - Lee Eun Ji!

2849
01:37:05,913 --> 01:37:07,782
- Sally, do you want to switch? - Yes, please.

2850
01:37:07,783 --> 01:37:09,823
- Good, you two switch. - I regained my confidence.

2851
01:37:09,983 --> 01:37:11,192
- Sally? - Yes?

2852
01:37:11,193 --> 01:37:12,552
You're my best friend.

2853
01:37:12,553 --> 01:37:13,592
Yes!

2854
01:37:13,593 --> 01:37:14,793
- Get it, girl. - Oh my gosh.

2855
01:37:15,223 --> 01:37:16,623
- Let's go. - What are they doing?

2856
01:37:16,923 --> 01:37:18,092
Show me what you've got.

2857
01:37:18,093 --> 01:37:19,093
(Round 8, paella)

2858
01:37:19,094 --> 01:37:20,162
- Let's go. - We got this.

2859
01:37:20,163 --> 01:37:21,632
- We'll start now. - Let's go.

2860
01:37:21,633 --> 01:37:22,862
- My wig is shaking. - One, two, three!

2861
01:37:22,863 --> 01:37:24,473
- AHYEON. - Correct!

2862
01:37:24,503 --> 01:37:26,132
- Gosh! - Focus, Mimi.

2863
01:37:26,133 --> 01:37:27,303
AHYEON is correct.

2864
01:37:27,743 --> 01:37:29,172
- One, two, three! - Baek Z Young.

2865
01:37:29,173 --> 01:37:31,042
- Correct! - Mimi is best friends with her.

2866
01:37:31,043 --> 01:37:32,072
- Like being shot by a bullet - One, two, three!

2867
01:37:32,073 --> 01:37:33,613
- Yang Se Chan. - Correct!

2868
01:37:34,483 --> 01:37:35,682
- One, two, three! - Lee Su Ji.

2869
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:36,713
Correct!

2870
01:37:37,513 --> 01:37:38,583
One, two, three!

2871
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:39,953
- Seo In Guk. - Wrong!

2872
01:37:40,083 --> 01:37:41,829
- Director Kim! - Young Ji said his given name!

2873
01:37:41,853 --> 01:37:43,452
Young Ji said his given name!

2874
01:37:43,453 --> 01:37:45,722
Seo In Guk.

2875
01:37:45,723 --> 01:37:46,753
(Oh, no.)

2876
01:37:46,793 --> 01:37:48,673
(Stage name, K.Will, given name, Kim Hyung Soo)

2877
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:51,263
(Please don't do this)

2878
01:37:51,563 --> 01:37:52,892
(She bragged about getting everything right a minute ago.)

2879
01:37:52,893 --> 01:37:54,373
- Please don't leave me - Seo In Guk?

2880
01:37:54,703 --> 01:37:56,763
- Don't know why - Really, Seo In Guk?

2881
01:37:56,963 --> 01:37:59,973
(Yu Jin is promoting her company director's song.)

2882
01:38:00,233 --> 01:38:02,442
But he looks like Kang Daniel here.

2883
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:03,542
- You're right. - It must be the hair.

2884
01:38:03,543 --> 01:38:05,173
- K.Will is quite handsome. - Right?

2885
01:38:05,343 --> 01:38:06,873
Seo In Guk was in his music video.

2886
01:38:06,943 --> 01:38:08,812
- That's why you thought of him. - That's why!

2887
01:38:08,813 --> 01:38:13,053
(Seo In Guk appeared in two of K.Will's music videos.)

2888
01:38:13,183 --> 01:38:14,212
I have something to say.

2889
01:38:14,213 --> 01:38:15,782
K.Will is a senior at my company.

2890
01:38:15,783 --> 01:38:16,982
- Really? - At your company?

2891
01:38:16,983 --> 01:38:20,252
K.Will is really generous with these kinds of mistakes.

2892
01:38:20,253 --> 01:38:21,893
- How nice! - If so...

2893
01:38:21,963 --> 01:38:24,692
If he's willing to forgive us, we should get another chance.

2894
01:38:24,693 --> 01:38:26,132
- Please, just one more chance. - Please, for the paella?

2895
01:38:26,133 --> 01:38:27,732
I got every other question right.

2896
01:38:27,733 --> 01:38:29,462
It's the paella round!

2897
01:38:29,463 --> 01:38:30,463
How about this, then?

2898
01:38:30,464 --> 01:38:32,372
I should really end this round here.

2899
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:34,172
- But this is such a signature dish. - Right.

2900
01:38:34,173 --> 01:38:35,202
- Right. - It's so tasty.

2901
01:38:35,203 --> 01:38:36,942
I do think we need to show the viewers...

2902
01:38:36,943 --> 01:38:38,873
- what this tastes like. - I agree.

2903
01:38:38,943 --> 01:38:40,572
It'll be a shame to just move on.

2904
01:38:40,573 --> 01:38:42,012
- So I'll give you another chance. - Thank you so much.

2905
01:38:42,013 --> 01:38:43,213
- But! - It's okay.

2906
01:38:43,513 --> 01:38:45,083
Go back and forth three times.

2907
01:38:45,513 --> 01:38:46,513
- Three times? - Three rows?
For the paella?

2908
01:38:47,514 --> 01:38:48,852
Take it or leave it.

2909
01:38:48,853 --> 01:38:50,622
We'll take it!

2910
01:38:50,623 --> 01:38:51,952
- We can do it! - Why not?

2911
01:38:51,953 --> 01:38:53,122
- Why not? - We got this!

2912
01:38:53,123 --> 01:38:54,662
(Chanting together)

2913
01:38:54,663 --> 01:38:56,062
- We can do it! - We can do it!

2914
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:58,162
- We can do it! - Yes!

2915
01:38:58,163 --> 01:39:00,063
(Last round, paella)

2916
01:39:00,193 --> 01:39:01,533
Then, we go...

2917
01:39:01,803 --> 01:39:03,062
We go one more row.

2918
01:39:03,063 --> 01:39:05,002
- Back and forth and back. - Once, twice, thrice.

2919
01:39:05,003 --> 01:39:06,679
- I'll go last. - Which spot answers the most?

2920
01:39:06,703 --> 01:39:07,942
The two in the middle.

2921
01:39:07,943 --> 01:39:09,072
- Okay, we can do this. - Gosh.

2922
01:39:09,073 --> 01:39:10,379
- We've been doing well today. - Team BB!

2923
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:12,242
We'll start with you, Yu Jin.

2924
01:39:12,243 --> 01:39:13,572
- Let's go! - We can do this, guys.

2925
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:15,183
- We'll begin. - This is too difficult.

2926
01:39:15,713 --> 01:39:17,343
- One, two, three! - Han Ga In!

2927
01:39:17,883 --> 01:39:19,183
- Good job. - Correct.

2928
01:39:20,153 --> 01:39:22,453
- One, two, three. - Parkdara... Sandara Park.

2929
01:39:23,723 --> 01:39:24,752
Why...

2930
01:39:24,753 --> 01:39:26,053
Parkdara... Sandara Park.

2931
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:28,822
- Why... - Wait a minute.

2932
01:39:28,823 --> 01:39:30,163
Parkdara... Sandara Park.

2933
01:39:30,393 --> 01:39:32,933
(Ji Young Ji Lee Young Ji bursts into laughter.)

2934
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:34,903
(Mimimi Kim Mimi is shameless.)

2935
01:39:35,003 --> 01:39:36,533
(Jin Yu Jin An Yu Jin is shocked.)

2936
01:39:36,563 --> 01:39:38,402
- Why? What's wrong? - Wait a minute.

2937
01:39:38,403 --> 01:39:40,673
- What did you say? - She did go back and forth thrice.

2938
01:39:41,673 --> 01:39:43,179
- Except with the name. - What did you say exactly?

2939
01:39:43,203 --> 01:39:45,412
You said Parkdara...

2940
01:39:45,413 --> 01:39:47,413
She went back and forth three times with the name.

2941
01:39:47,473 --> 01:39:49,542
You know "Kung Ddari Sha Bah Rah?"

2942
01:39:49,543 --> 01:39:51,983
Mimi was just getting in the groove like that song.

2943
01:39:52,513 --> 01:39:53,913
(Touched)

2944
01:39:53,983 --> 01:39:55,682
It's Sandara Park.

2945
01:39:55,683 --> 01:39:57,923
- I'm warning you. - Okay, thank you.

2946
01:39:58,653 --> 01:40:00,322
Mimi, you can't make me laugh so hard right now.

2947
01:40:00,323 --> 01:40:02,123
- What should I do? - You can do this.

2948
01:40:02,223 --> 01:40:03,743
- What do I do? - Young Ji, you're up.

2949
01:40:04,793 --> 01:40:06,332
- One, two, three! - Na Moon Hee.

2950
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,563
Correct!

2951
01:40:08,503 --> 01:40:09,802
- One, two, three. - Tablo.

2952
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:10,863
Correct!

2953
01:40:11,003 --> 01:40:13,303
(They passed the first halfway point.)

2954
01:40:13,903 --> 01:40:15,302
- One, two, three! - Ji Ye Eun.

2955
01:40:15,303 --> 01:40:16,643
- Yes! - Correct!

2956
01:40:17,243 --> 01:40:18,972
- One, two, three! - Daniel Henney.

2957
01:40:18,973 --> 01:40:20,213
She's so good!

2958
01:40:20,243 --> 01:40:21,443
(The ace is back on track.)

2959
01:40:22,013 --> 01:40:23,242
(The weak link becomes tense.)

2960
01:40:23,243 --> 01:40:24,342
Here comes the next question.

2961
01:40:24,343 --> 01:40:26,483
- One, two, three! - Lee Kwang Kyu, Kim Kwang Kyu!

2962
01:40:26,583 --> 01:40:28,282
I meant Kim Kwang Kyu.

2963
01:40:28,283 --> 01:40:29,352
Correct!

2964
01:40:29,353 --> 01:40:30,659
(Correct because she changed her answer before he said anything)

2965
01:40:30,683 --> 01:40:32,192
- Mimi! - Gosh!

2966
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:34,293
We have three more to go.

2967
01:40:36,293 --> 01:40:38,163
- One, two, three! - So Ji Sub!

2968
01:40:38,433 --> 01:40:40,293
- Correct! - Yes!

2969
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:43,033
- One, two, three! - Kim Hye Ja.

2970
01:40:43,263 --> 01:40:44,732
Correct.

2971
01:40:44,733 --> 01:40:46,272
- Guys! - Last question!

2972
01:40:46,273 --> 01:40:49,272
(The last person is losing her mind.)

2973
01:40:49,273 --> 01:40:50,802
Guys, what should I do?

2974
01:40:50,803 --> 01:40:52,142
- You can do it. - I can do it.

2975
01:40:52,143 --> 01:40:53,673
- Give me strength, guys. - Okay.

2976
01:40:54,213 --> 01:40:56,682
If you get this last question right,

2977
01:40:56,683 --> 01:40:58,483
- the paella is yours. - Okay.

2978
01:40:58,613 --> 01:41:00,412
The very first three-row round.

2979
01:41:00,413 --> 01:41:01,423
I'm ready.

2980
01:41:03,823 --> 01:41:06,252
- One, two, three! - Han Ji Min!

2981
01:41:06,253 --> 01:41:07,253
Correct!

2982
01:41:07,923 --> 01:41:09,963
(They succeeded going back and forth three times!)

2983
01:41:10,063 --> 01:41:11,492
- My gosh! - Eun Ji!

2984
01:41:11,493 --> 01:41:12,693
(They won the paella.)

2985
01:41:12,793 --> 01:41:14,109
- Let's eat. - Thank you for the meal.

2986
01:41:14,133 --> 01:41:16,233
We're really having the paella.

2987
01:41:16,363 --> 01:41:19,133
- It looks so good. - I wanted to have paella the most.

2988
01:41:21,303 --> 01:41:22,543
- It looks so good. - Enjoy.

2989
01:41:22,603 --> 01:41:25,343
(Exclaiming)

2990
01:41:27,043 --> 01:41:28,243
It looks so good.

2991
01:41:31,813 --> 01:41:33,883
(Mimimi Kim Mimi also takes a bite.)

2992
01:41:34,013 --> 01:41:35,683
This isn't just rice!

2993
01:41:35,853 --> 01:41:37,683
- It's so chewy and soft, right? - Yes!

2994
01:41:38,053 --> 01:41:39,053
- This is... - It's amazing.

2995
01:41:39,054 --> 01:41:40,853
- It's not just rice? - It's like...

2996
01:41:41,153 --> 01:41:42,953
- You know... - It feels light like a potato.

2997
01:41:43,093 --> 01:41:45,063
- It's like having seafood rice, - Yes?

2998
01:41:45,863 --> 01:41:47,463
- but it's really concentrated. - I see.

2999
01:41:48,163 --> 01:41:50,033
They must cook it for a long time.

3000
01:41:50,233 --> 01:41:52,172
- It's fantastic! - The flavor is so rich.

3001
01:41:52,173 --> 01:41:54,133
The seasoning on this meat is amazing.

3002
01:41:54,303 --> 01:41:56,503
- It's savory and sweet. - This is so good.

3003
01:41:56,773 --> 01:41:58,042
We did a great job today.

3004
01:41:58,043 --> 01:41:59,712
This paella is the best.

3005
01:41:59,713 --> 01:42:01,383
(They had two main dishes.)

3006
01:42:03,843 --> 01:42:06,213
(The members are taking pictures near the restaurant.)

3007
01:42:08,053 --> 01:42:09,753
(Puppy An is very excited.)

3008
01:42:10,183 --> 01:42:11,393
(Hopping)

3009
01:42:12,623 --> 01:42:13,823
It's cool.

3010
01:42:14,663 --> 01:42:17,662
(She looks like a backpacker, right?)

3011
01:42:17,663 --> 01:42:18,863
(Chuckling)

3012
01:42:23,603 --> 01:42:25,773
(Jade Emperor watches the members.)

3013
01:42:26,303 --> 01:42:29,343
(He calls someone.)

3014
01:42:29,603 --> 01:42:31,173
- Agents. - Yes?

3015
01:42:31,303 --> 01:42:32,643
There's good news.

3016
01:42:33,373 --> 01:42:35,243
You guys disguised yourselves perfectly.

3017
01:42:35,683 --> 01:42:37,083
- Jade Emperor... - Yes?

3018
01:42:37,483 --> 01:42:39,812
Ordered to give back your suitcases.

3019
01:42:39,813 --> 01:42:41,093
(They get their suitcases back.)

3020
01:42:41,153 --> 01:42:42,682
We hope you'll have more fun in Lisbon.

3021
01:42:42,683 --> 01:42:43,822
(It's so sudden.)

3022
01:42:43,823 --> 01:42:44,893
(Cheering)

3023
01:42:44,923 --> 01:42:45,923
Hurrah.

3024
01:42:46,293 --> 01:42:48,292
- Thank you. - See you guys at 9am.

3025
01:42:48,293 --> 01:42:49,992
Can we sleep soundly tonight?

3026
01:42:49,993 --> 01:42:51,323
- Yes. - I'll pass out.

3027
01:42:52,233 --> 01:42:54,263
Finally, I got my suitcase back.

3028
01:42:54,593 --> 01:42:56,502
I didn't know what to do...

3029
01:42:56,503 --> 01:42:58,603
because the bag I had felt so awkward.

3030
01:42:59,633 --> 01:43:00,803
I'm so happy.

3031
01:43:01,743 --> 01:43:03,542
I'm happy because you're happy.

3032
01:43:03,543 --> 01:43:05,013
(They got their suitcases back.)

3033
01:43:07,113 --> 01:43:09,143
(It's time to get ready for bed.)

3034
01:43:10,583 --> 01:43:12,153
It looks pretty.

3035
01:43:13,683 --> 01:43:15,153
- Is it soft? - Yes.

3036
01:43:21,763 --> 01:43:24,063
It's the texture I really like.

3037
01:43:25,063 --> 01:43:27,092
It's so cool. It cools down the skin.

3038
01:43:27,093 --> 01:43:28,233
How is it so cool?

3039
01:43:28,363 --> 01:43:30,163
- It's moist and light. - Yes.

3040
01:43:30,333 --> 01:43:31,633
- It isn't heavy. - No.

3041
01:43:33,233 --> 01:43:35,173
(Shiny)

3042
01:43:35,643 --> 01:43:37,072
Your skin looks amazing right now.

3043
01:43:37,073 --> 01:43:38,712
Yours too. It's shining.

3044
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:39,742
- Does it look good? - Yes.

3045
01:43:39,743 --> 01:43:41,883
Can we put this in our suitcases?

3046
01:43:42,043 --> 01:43:43,082
Sure.

3047
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:44,113
(Oh, yes. This is mine.)

3048
01:43:44,313 --> 01:43:47,683
(Before going to bed, Young Ji comes to the older members' room.)

3049
01:43:48,013 --> 01:43:49,683
How does it feel to get your phone back?

3050
01:43:50,023 --> 01:43:51,053
It's nice.

3051
01:43:51,323 --> 01:43:52,853
Young Ji suddenly became quiet.

3052
01:43:54,293 --> 01:43:56,223
You'll get your voice back tomorrow.

3053
01:43:56,323 --> 01:43:58,563
I'll need to keep myself from talking for two more days.

3054
01:43:58,633 --> 01:43:59,933
I'll go and sleep now.

3055
01:44:00,293 --> 01:44:01,463
(Impressed)

3056
01:44:03,503 --> 01:44:06,133
(Current time: 11pm)

3057
01:44:06,873 --> 01:44:10,403
(Everyone is asleep.)

3058
01:44:12,673 --> 01:44:14,343
(One person can't fall asleep.)

3059
01:44:15,143 --> 01:44:18,213
(Tonight, Young Ji has her phone.)

3060
01:44:19,153 --> 01:44:22,853
(She's replenishing the dopamine for the past 86 hours.)

3061
01:44:24,383 --> 01:44:26,893
(Yawning)

3062
01:44:28,053 --> 01:44:30,823
(She's tired, but her eyes are on the phone.)

3063
01:44:31,463 --> 01:44:33,463
(While Young Ji gets soaked in dopamine)

3064
01:44:34,093 --> 01:44:37,332
(Let's distance ourselves from dopamine for a moment.)

3065
01:44:37,333 --> 01:44:40,472
(It rains in Lisbon at night.)

3066
01:44:40,473 --> 01:44:42,742
(Let's distance ourselves from dopamine for a moment.)

3067
01:44:42,743 --> 01:44:46,873
(The sun rises.)

3068
01:44:47,713 --> 01:44:50,782
(The rain begins to let up.)

3069
01:44:50,783 --> 01:44:56,453
(Let's distance ourselves from dopamine for a moment.)

3070
01:44:57,783 --> 01:45:00,453
(Current time: 8am)

3071
01:45:00,653 --> 01:45:02,393
I'm hungry.

3072
01:45:02,593 --> 01:45:04,222
(The younger ones wake up because they're hungry.)

3073
01:45:04,223 --> 01:45:07,193
- I'm hungry. - I'm hungry.

3074
01:45:07,493 --> 01:45:10,333
(They move to eat breakfast.)

3075
01:45:13,433 --> 01:45:14,903
(Serious)

3076
01:45:15,403 --> 01:45:17,803
I'll have something healthy for breakfast today.

3077
01:45:18,273 --> 01:45:20,343
I'll have Greek yogurt.

3078
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:25,482
It's really tasty with Greek yogurt.

3079
01:45:25,483 --> 01:45:26,713
(Eating)

3080
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:28,083
(Thumbs up)

3081
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:33,053
(She takes a spoonful of Greek yogurt like Eun Ji.)

3082
01:45:33,223 --> 01:45:35,293
(It's refreshing.)

3083
01:45:35,463 --> 01:45:37,193
(The dessert monster enters.)

3084
01:45:37,923 --> 01:45:40,693
Is it cheesecake with maple syrup?

3085
01:45:41,193 --> 01:45:43,873
(She adds a chocolate spread to the yogurt since she loves sweets.)

3086
01:45:44,203 --> 01:45:45,733
(A big spoonful)

3087
01:45:47,133 --> 01:45:48,803
(Yes, this is the taste.)

3088
01:45:48,903 --> 01:45:50,403
(It's very tasty.)

3089
01:45:50,573 --> 01:45:52,272
- Who made this? - Who made this?

3090
01:45:52,273 --> 01:45:53,942
- Mimi, did you add chocolate? - Yes.

3091
01:45:53,943 --> 01:45:54,943
- Gosh. - Gosh.

3092
01:45:55,113 --> 01:45:56,443
Mimi, you're so smart.

3093
01:45:56,713 --> 01:45:58,212
Eun Ji is having a proper breakfast.

3094
01:45:58,213 --> 01:46:00,553
- Yes, I'm hungry. - Yes. It's a proper breakfast.

3095
01:46:02,453 --> 01:46:03,623
Milk...

3096
01:46:03,953 --> 01:46:05,473
It's really tasty when it's heated up.

3097
01:46:06,393 --> 01:46:08,223
(Eating)

3098
01:46:08,563 --> 01:46:09,563
(Thank you.)

3099
01:46:09,823 --> 01:46:10,823
You look like a camel.

3100
01:46:10,824 --> 01:46:13,133
(What are you saying in the morning?)

3101
01:46:13,363 --> 01:46:14,463
She's tired.

3102
01:46:15,663 --> 01:46:16,832
Young Ji, at what time did you go to bed?

3103
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:19,203
- The digital detox had ended. - I went to bed around 12am.

3104
01:46:19,273 --> 01:46:20,733
I watched "I'm Solo."

3105
01:46:21,403 --> 01:46:22,502
(She briefs them on how she replenished her dopamine level.)

3106
01:46:22,503 --> 01:46:23,973
Did you watch "I'm Solo?"

3107
01:46:24,913 --> 01:46:26,433
I checked social media in the morning.

3108
01:46:27,013 --> 01:46:28,073
When Yu Jin...

3109
01:46:28,583 --> 01:46:30,542
was on her phone in the morning,

3110
01:46:30,543 --> 01:46:32,312
I turned to the opposite direction in a feisty way.

3111
01:46:32,313 --> 01:46:34,159
- It was perfect. - Then I played with my phone.

3112
01:46:34,183 --> 01:46:35,823
I don't want to try digital detox again.

3113
01:46:36,583 --> 01:46:37,583
Seriously.

3114
01:46:37,653 --> 01:46:39,222
What are we going to do during lunchtime?

3115
01:46:39,223 --> 01:46:40,253
Gosh!

3116
01:46:41,253 --> 01:46:43,053
The vocalization was amazing just now, right?

3117
01:46:43,093 --> 01:46:45,663
Why do you guys leave now that we're here?

3118
01:46:46,163 --> 01:46:47,363
We're done eating.

3119
01:46:47,663 --> 01:46:49,303
Will we move to a different lodging?

3120
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:51,203
(Will we do that?)

3121
01:46:51,633 --> 01:46:52,832
Doesn't it feel like we'll move to a different lodging?

3122
01:46:52,833 --> 01:46:54,102
- Isn't it about time? - I think so.

3123
01:46:54,103 --> 01:46:55,742
- Yes. - In the morning,

3124
01:46:55,743 --> 01:46:57,202
the camera crew moved busily.

3125
01:46:57,203 --> 01:47:00,213
The camera directors took out their luggage...

3126
01:47:00,313 --> 01:47:02,483
and moved their suitcases.

3127
01:47:02,543 --> 01:47:04,912
- Then... - We can guess where it's going.

3128
01:47:04,913 --> 01:47:06,382
Then we'll move to a different lodging.

3129
01:47:06,383 --> 01:47:08,722
- That's right. - We'll do that.

3130
01:47:08,723 --> 01:47:10,652
Their outfits look different too.

3131
01:47:10,653 --> 01:47:11,822
They aren't dressed like...

3132
01:47:11,823 --> 01:47:12,999
- they'll stay. - You're right.

3133
01:47:13,023 --> 01:47:16,062
We're saying that you guys look like you'll move.

3134
01:47:16,063 --> 01:47:18,562
This is how you look when you stay at home.

3135
01:47:18,563 --> 01:47:19,863
That's right.

3136
01:47:19,893 --> 01:47:21,532
You guys are suspicious.

3137
01:47:21,533 --> 01:47:23,203
That's right.

3138
01:47:23,463 --> 01:47:25,373
Why did you guys sit there?

3139
01:47:25,903 --> 01:47:28,803
You guys can neither move nor stay seated.

3140
01:47:28,873 --> 01:47:31,772
Don't suddenly quit your job at eggiscoming.

3141
01:47:31,773 --> 01:47:33,772
Don't do that. You guys have seen us at our worst.

3142
01:47:33,773 --> 01:47:35,482
- You guys can't leave. - That's right.

3143
01:47:35,483 --> 01:47:36,542
Where are you guys going?

3144
01:47:36,543 --> 01:47:37,882
- Where are you guys going? - Where are you guys going?

3145
01:47:37,883 --> 01:47:39,353
(They leave hurriedly.)

3146
01:47:39,483 --> 01:47:41,152
- Stay here. - You guys will leave first, right?

3147
01:47:41,153 --> 01:47:42,723
You guys will leave first, right?

3148
01:47:42,983 --> 01:47:45,153
Why are you guys carrying a bag?

3149
01:47:45,793 --> 01:47:47,692
Director Chang Dae's outfit looks different.

3150
01:47:47,693 --> 01:47:49,362
- That's right. We're moving. - It looks different.

3151
01:47:49,363 --> 01:47:50,462
His outfit is thick.

3152
01:47:50,463 --> 01:47:51,492
Did you see that just now?

3153
01:47:51,493 --> 01:47:52,892
Director Chang Dae was approaching with a camera.

3154
01:47:52,893 --> 01:47:54,933
Producer Hyun Yong went, "Go."

3155
01:47:54,963 --> 01:47:56,132
(It happens all the time.)

3156
01:47:56,133 --> 01:47:57,932
What's wrong with you? Let him film us.

3157
01:47:57,933 --> 01:47:59,502
What's wrong with you? We're cast members.

3158
01:47:59,503 --> 01:48:00,932
We get paid to be on this show.

3159
01:48:00,933 --> 01:48:02,672
Why would you keep him from filming us?

3160
01:48:02,673 --> 01:48:04,402
That's right. It's our job to be on a camera,

3161
01:48:04,403 --> 01:48:05,712
There's a camera in front of you guys.

3162
01:48:05,713 --> 01:48:07,072
It's a small one.

3163
01:48:07,073 --> 01:48:09,043
- Seriously. - Is this a camera?

3164
01:48:09,143 --> 01:48:10,413
(Studying it carefully)

3165
01:48:10,513 --> 01:48:11,812
- Gosh. - Gosh.

3166
01:48:11,813 --> 01:48:13,613
Gosh, I can see my own face.

3167
01:48:13,783 --> 01:48:15,283
- I'm in trouble. - Gosh.

3168
01:48:15,653 --> 01:48:16,723
My bare face is...

3169
01:48:17,023 --> 01:48:18,493
My bare face is too much.

3170
01:48:19,853 --> 01:48:20,992
You look pretty.

3171
01:48:20,993 --> 01:48:22,193
Thank you.

3172
01:48:22,223 --> 01:48:23,392
Let's meet at 10am.

3173
01:48:23,393 --> 01:48:24,662
Come, look, and buy.

3174
01:48:24,663 --> 01:48:26,492
We have so much time until 10am.

3175
01:48:26,493 --> 01:48:28,463
Advance party, have a safe trip.

3176
01:48:28,663 --> 01:48:30,532
Take good photos.

3177
01:48:30,533 --> 01:48:32,302
Advance party, drive safely.

3178
01:48:32,303 --> 01:48:33,673
Are we meeting at 10am?

3179
01:48:34,003 --> 01:48:35,442
At 10am.

3180
01:48:35,443 --> 01:48:36,642
What time is it now?

3181
01:48:36,643 --> 01:48:37,972
It's 8:47am.

3182
01:48:37,973 --> 01:48:40,142
Why don't you know when you got your phone back?

3183
01:48:40,143 --> 01:48:41,572
I got used to not carrying it around.

3184
01:48:41,573 --> 01:48:44,082
What's the use of having it if you don't carry it around?

3185
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:45,182
- Seriously. - See you later.

3186
01:48:45,183 --> 01:48:46,352
See you later.

3187
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:48,052
Hold on. Yu Jin...

3188
01:48:48,053 --> 01:48:50,123
It's refreshing.

3189
01:48:50,483 --> 01:48:52,653
(The members go back to their rooms.)

3190
01:48:55,023 --> 01:48:56,763
(The lodging turns quiet.)

3191
01:48:57,163 --> 01:48:58,763
(The camera crew is left behind.)

3192
01:48:58,893 --> 01:49:00,433
(They decide to take revenge.)

3193
01:49:00,933 --> 01:49:03,933
(It has been hard to keep up with the E-cade members' energy.)

3194
01:49:04,403 --> 01:49:08,903
(The production crew has suffered because of that.)

3195
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:10,543
(Thus, they prepared something.)

3196
01:49:10,873 --> 01:49:12,572
(Mouth Detox)

3197
01:49:12,573 --> 01:49:14,373
What? Hold on a second.

3198
01:49:14,713 --> 01:49:16,413
(They'll play a game for the Mouth Detox.)

3199
01:49:16,813 --> 01:49:18,753
(Against whom?)

3200
01:49:19,083 --> 01:49:21,083
(The 4 youngest members of the production crew)

3201
01:49:21,453 --> 01:49:25,653
(They'll go against the E-cade members' insane energy.)

3202
01:49:26,223 --> 01:49:31,193
(The production crew's shy rebellion will begin.)

3203
01:49:31,593 --> 01:49:36,303
(The match of the century to keep the E-cade members quiet)

3204
01:49:38,133 --> 01:49:39,202
(Before we wrap up Episode 7)

3205
01:49:39,203 --> 01:49:40,233
Hold on a second!

3206
01:49:40,703 --> 01:49:42,073
(Let's see the ending fairy.)

3207
01:49:42,773 --> 01:49:44,273
(We introduce...)

3208
01:49:44,343 --> 01:49:49,743
(the ending fairy, Lee Young Ji.)

3209
01:49:50,283 --> 01:49:52,313
(Young Ji, the member who evens walks differently)

3210
01:49:52,713 --> 01:49:54,483
(Her undisclosed clips will be revealed.)

3211
01:49:55,153 --> 01:49:57,823
(No matter what kind of makeup she wears, )

3212
01:49:58,593 --> 01:50:01,823
(it can't hide her charms.)

3213
01:50:02,823 --> 01:50:04,762
(In the blink of an eye, )

3214
01:50:04,763 --> 01:50:06,693
(we'll miss you again.)

3215
01:50:08,563 --> 01:50:10,063
(Blinking)

3216
01:50:10,163 --> 01:50:12,833
(Young Ji rides a zipline bravely.)

3217
01:50:12,973 --> 01:50:15,073
(But she's scared of pigeons.)

3218
01:50:15,103 --> 01:50:18,913
(I'm scared of pigeons.)

3219
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:22,313
(Feisty wants to be on "Reply 2002.")

3220
01:50:22,883 --> 01:50:26,053
(She has practiced acting throughout the shoot.)

3221
01:50:26,383 --> 01:50:27,712
(Musical acting: A castaway who lived on an deserted island...)

3222
01:50:27,713 --> 01:50:29,323
(sets afoot on the land after 60 years.)

3223
01:50:29,553 --> 01:50:30,782
(Tearful scene: She got scolded...)

3224
01:50:30,783 --> 01:50:32,369
(because she forgot to pay her fee for the Comedienne Association.)

3225
01:50:32,393 --> 01:50:33,422
(Occult genre acting: The friend of Clock Spirit, )

3226
01:50:33,423 --> 01:50:34,599
(the water ghost has awakened.)

3227
01:50:34,623 --> 01:50:36,023
"Young Ji, do you want your phone?"

3228
01:50:36,423 --> 01:50:39,733
(She can easily imitate the production crew now.)

3229
01:50:41,433 --> 01:50:42,763
That's right.

3230
01:50:43,103 --> 01:50:45,403
(She resembles him a lot, right?)

3231
01:50:46,003 --> 01:50:47,873
She looks exactly like him.

3232
01:50:51,443 --> 01:50:54,072
The pigeons ate all the food.

3233
01:50:54,073 --> 01:50:55,073
(This video is dedicated to the winner...)

3234
01:50:55,074 --> 01:50:56,112
(of the photography contest, Young JI.)

3235
01:50:56,113 --> 01:50:58,242
I'm not lying.

3236
01:50:58,243 --> 01:50:59,812
We can go back to Seoul...

3237
01:50:59,813 --> 01:51:01,252
without playing a game in the evening.

3238
01:51:01,253 --> 01:51:03,683
We filmed a great scene.

3239
01:51:05,523 --> 01:51:07,883
(Sending love to Young Ji who gave us a great scene)

3240
01:51:07,936 --> 01:51:09,679
(Thieves' Market)

3241
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:12,819
(There are all sorts of items at the Thieves' Market.)

3242
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:14,019
(It's the worst!)

3243
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:15,390
(A swindler!)

3244
01:51:15,490 --> 01:51:17,389
(Customers' complaints flood in at this place.)

3245
01:51:17,390 --> 01:51:19,389
(NANA Souvenir Shop)

3246
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:22,259
(Different souvenirs captivate the members' hearts.)

3247
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:23,799
(They can win them by answering correctly.)

3248
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,129
(After getting slapped in Jongno?)

3249
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:26,500
(You swear in Myeongdong.)

3250
01:51:26,570 --> 01:51:29,969
(CEO NA becomes happy when they answer incorrectly.)

3251
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:31,800
(What's the capital of Mexico?)

3252
01:51:32,270 --> 01:51:33,750
(Incorrect! Give me one more chance.)

3253
01:51:33,870 --> 01:51:35,779
(Yu Jin is scared of the aftermath.)

3254
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:38,139
(Shouldn't we stop accepting customers?)

3255
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:40,849
(Everything is up to CEO NA at this place.)

3256
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:43,879
(Will they be able to win some souvenirs?)

3257
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,290
(And)

3258
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:46,949
It's Torong!

3259
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:48,350
(They finally find Torong's trace.)

3260
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:49,790
(Girls!)

3261
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:51,919
(It's the 2nd floor!)

3262
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:54,589
(It's a big picture that began in Abu Dhabi.)

3263
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:57,199
(In a confused state, the agents chase after him.)

3264
01:51:57,200 --> 01:52:00,599
(The double agent, Cheol Yong joins in.)

3265
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:04,340
(Their mockery turns even more annoying.)

3266
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:09,010
(They chase and get chased ferociously.)

3267
01:52:09,110 --> 01:52:12,609
(The scale is as big as ever.)

3268
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:15,819
(The race is as daring as ever.)

3269
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:19,250
(What will become of Torong?)

3270
01:52:19,490 --> 01:52:20,789
You look very pretty...

3271
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:22,489
when you soak up the sunlight and use the phone quietly.

3272
01:52:22,490 --> 01:52:24,520
Young Ji, you look very pretty right now.

3273
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:26,090
- Eun Ji! - Yes?

3274
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:29,229
Brother Yeong Seok told us to quiet down.

3275
01:52:29,230 --> 01:52:30,299
I didn't say that.

3276
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:32,429
- I said that you looked pretty. - Brother Yeong Seok...

3277
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:33,529
I know that those words meant something different.

3278
01:52:33,530 --> 01:52:35,229
You were telling her to be quiet.

3279
01:52:35,230 --> 01:52:36,839
Brother Yeong Seok told us to keep my mouth shut...

3280
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,199
- and stay on my phone. - You were telling my child...

3281
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:39,670
to be quiet, right?

3282
01:52:40,210 --> 01:52:42,010
Why do you keep telling my child to be quiet?

3283
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:44,986
- Why do you keep doing that? - I said that you looked pretty.

3284
01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:46,779
She has passion and diligence for the variety show.

3285
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:47,879
Why do you keep telling her to be quiet?

3286
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,280
- Do whatever you want. - Mom!

3287
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:50,850
Do whatever you want.

3288
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:53,649
- For goodness' sake. - I said that you looked pretty.

3289
01:52:53,650 --> 01:52:55,790
This restroom is closed, so we should use that one.
