00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:23,969
(Earth Arcade 3)

2
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,938
Space Rice Cake Shop continues to be incredibly busy.

3
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:27,939
It's this one, right?

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,038
- My goodness. - When will it be my turn?

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,308
Is it to go?

6
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:31,778
The world is spinning.

7
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:33,548
- My eyes are spinning. - That's my order.

8
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:35,818
Hey, you only work 14 hours a day.

9
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:37,349
Why are you so distracted?

10
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:39,889
In the past, employees were careful even when they breathed.

11
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,758
(For goodness' sake)

12
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,428
To spy on Torong,

13
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:45,728
Jade Emperor employs...

14
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,928
- a secret agent, Agent F. - Are you Agent F?

15
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:49,229
Yes, I am.

16
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,898
Please keep your eye on that rabbit.

17
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:53,968
Don't worry.

18
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,838
- Circling Torong, - I thought I heard something.

19
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,439
Agent F spies on him.

20
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,938
One day, a get-together takes place at the Space Rest Area...

21
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:03,079
for the 1st time in 1,000 years.

22
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,778
- Go ahead and drink. - Why did you come so late?

23
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:07,218
- Why aren't you drinking? - The food has gone cold.

24
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:09,418
- I had to work late. - Let's get wasted today.

25
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:11,149
Torong, why did you come so late?

26
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:14,219
You like carrots the most since you're a rabbit, right? Okay.

27
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:17,128
Auntie, please give us a vegetable set. Let's go.

28
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:18,628
- Please add it to our order. - Nonsense.

29
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:20,258
- Since when was I a vegetarian? - Let's go!

30
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,828
I was excited about eating some meat today.

31
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:23,428
All right.

32
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:24,469
What?

33
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:26,938
- What's that? - I sold it...

34
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,238
- That's... - when the price rose.

35
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,839
- Shall I make use of my skills? - I'm so great.

36
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,938
- You're so great. - All right.

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,678
Since we had a feast today,

38
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:36,748
let's work hard tomorrow.

39
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:39,279
- Let's leave. - Our youth starts now!

40
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:41,218
- Right now! - Jade Emperor!

41
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:42,778
- Jade Emperor! - Jade Emperor!

42
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:43,918
- Jade Emperor! - Let's see.

43
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,788
Where is the corporate card?

44
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,188
- What? Why isn't it here? - What?

45
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,359
- Oh, my! - What's going on?

46
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,758
- What? - Gosh,

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,158
- it was here. - I guess something is missing.

48
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,529
I'm not trying to eat and run.

49
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,599
What? What's going on? My goodness.

50
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:58,328
What kind of a punk is using my corporate card?

51
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:00,168
It's Torong's doing.

52
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:01,438
How did this happen?

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,668
I told you to keep your eye on him. You should've done something.

54
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:05,568
Go and catch Torong!

55
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:08,239
To catch Torong who ran away with the corporate card,

56
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:11,549
the four Earth Warriors step forward once more!

57
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,379
Warriors.

58
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:15,718
(Warning)

59
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,718
(Despite beginning with material from MBC, )

60
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,719
(this is a tvN show.)

63

(It was the year-end stage of a major channel, )

64
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,439
(and tvN's E-cade members made a daring entrance.)

65
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,039
(Shouting)

66
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:42,339
(Earth Arcade)

67
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:46,349
(They shouted the name of a tvN show at MBC.)

68
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,249
(We're E-cade)

69
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:54,088
(Despite the egotistical lyrics, )

70
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:56,889
(the performance ranked 1st among the trending videos.)

71
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:59,028
(The performance is pretty cool, )

72
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:00,728
(so we'll get to the point after Mimi's part.)

73
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:02,599
(3 days later)

74
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:07,469
(Come in, come in, come in to the tvN world)

75
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,339
(Yeong Seok waits for the E-cade members.)

76
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:15,908
(Earth Arcade)

77
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:17,408
- Hello, everyone. - Who is it?

78
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:19,309
(Laughing)

79
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:20,849
I'm so happy.

80
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:22,719
I can't wait to dance.

81
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,719
Chang Dae.

82
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:26,588
- Chang Dae. - Are you Chucky?

83
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:27,859
- Hello. - Hold on.

84
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:30,158
Chang Dae.

85
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,588
- He's back after a while. - It has been a while.

86
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:33,658
You got your hair styled.

87
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,328
My hair was styled last time too.

88
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,889
You were here the day before yesterday.

89
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:38,968
(Writer King and Eun Ji had a joint birthday party.)

90
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,068
Did you have the same hairstyle then?

91
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:43,038
This hair... How did we do on "MBC Music Festival?"

92
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,279
- Hurry up and tell me. - What?

93

(Earth Arcade)

94
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,049
Standard singing.

95
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,608
- I was so surprised. - Why? Was it good?

96
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:53,978
- I mean, - Okay.

97
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,818
MBC even added the subtitles.

98
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:56,948
- I know. - I was a bit embarrassed.

99
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:58,648
- Why? Why were you embarrassed? - It's a different TV station.

100
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:00,118
- Well, - I can't explain it.

101
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,018
- it was... - When the four of you sang,

102
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:03,188
"Earth Arcade,"

103
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,258
I was like, "My goodness."

(Facepalm)

105
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,329
The title was a bit...

106
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,258
- Maybe it was just us. - No. I reacted the same.

107
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:10,268
Hey!

108
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:11,749
- You startled me. - You startled me.

109
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,598
- Hey, girl. - Hey, girl.

110
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,279
- Five, six, seven, eight. - Seven, eight.

111
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:19,539
(Earth Arcade)

112
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,909
(They suddenly form a 2-member unit.)

113
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,719
(The unit's performance is pretty intense.)

114
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:32,219
(Eun Ji focuses on Yeong Seok.)

115
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,918
(The main rapper uses the entire stage.)

116

My goodness. Hello, Ms. Lee.

117
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:40,999
My goodness. Hello, Ms. Lee. Hello.

118
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:43,728
- Hello. - I can't believe it.

119
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:44,898
Did you watch "GBRB Spinoff?"

120
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:47,098
Producer Shin Won Ho is considering me as the lead...

121
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:48,339
of the "Reply" series.

122
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:49,598
I won't miss that opportunity.

123
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:50,908
(Producer Shin Won Ho made a ridiculous comment on Episode 4.)

124
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:53,038
- You did well as a part-timer. - I worked hard.

125
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:55,408
- She did well. - On that show,

126
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,408
she was diligent and ladylike.

127
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,449
- I was so surprised. - It was someone else's show.

128
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:02,718
- Then... - Wasn't our performance amazing?

129
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,518
- Young Ji. - That's the way to work.

130
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,548
- It was number 1 on Trending. - It was number 1 on Trending.

131
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:09,359
It was number 1 for 2 days.

132
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:12,029
Did you watch it?

133
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:13,829
I watched it in real time.

134
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,598
- I see. - I watched it too.

135
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:16,828
- The performance... - Hey.

136
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,728
- Hey. - Hey.

137
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:21,899

(This time, they form a 3-member unit.)

00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:27,879
(She throws down her Goyard bag.)

140
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,878
(Our performance is more precious than a designer bag.)

141
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,779
- My goodness. - Hey!

142
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,079
Mimi!

143
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,779
- All right. - Hey!

144
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:36,988
Mimi, we need to do this again...

145
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:38,248
when there are all four members.

146
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:39,249
- Please wait. - Eun Ji.

147
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,088
You look pretty and cute as always.

148
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:43,159
Why do you smell like a bath?

149
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,579
- Right? - You smell like a bath.

150
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,089
- You smell like a bath. - A bath!

151
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:47,198
Smell her.

152
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,959
- Smell her. - Did you find a job at a bank?

153
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,698
- To be honest... - Hey, she smells like a bath.

154
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:52,699
Smell her.

155
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,369
After counting so much money...

156
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:57,138
- She smells like a bath. - They sprayed a nice hair essence.

157
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,808
- Gosh, she smells so nice. - A bath.

158
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,508
Mimi looks different from you guys.

159
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:02,478
- I know. - Mimi, what's up with you today?

160
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,148
- Why do you look so rich? - How cool.

161
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:05,878
- I mean... - Seriously. She looks rich.

162
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,748
- Where's your gold necklace? - Where's your bracelet?

163
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:09,148
- It's in here. - I'm wearing a pearl necklace.

164
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,718
- How many are there? Three? - How many are you wearing?

165
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:12,648
She'll open a jewelry shop at this rate.

166
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:15,358
Hey, Mimi. Mimi suddenly became a lady.

167
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,458
- That's right. - Right?

168
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,828
She's a total lady.

169
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:18,988
You became a lady.

170
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:20,789
This is what happens when I don't save money.

171
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:23,998
- You used it all. - You spent everything you earned.

172
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,198
(Mimi: You look rich when you don't save money.)

173
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,868
There were 2 last time. There are 3 now.

174
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,575
- We met once after I got it. - It's very expensive.

175
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:29,899
- Really? - It's very expensive.

176
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,438
- It's very... Eun Ji, look at that. - I save up grain by grain...

177
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,119
- and buy it... - What's "Grain by grain?"

178
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,299
- I save up money. - "Grain by grain?"

179
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:39,155
- What's "Grain by grain?" - I haven't heard it before either.

180
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:40,179
I save up little at a time.

181
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,348
- What's "Grain by grain?" - Grain by grain.

182
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,618
- "Grain by grain?" - Where did you hear such an idiom?

183
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,288
- I mean... - Like a grain of rice?

184
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:47,189
- No. - A grain of rice and...

185
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:49,589
(After "Grain by grain")

186
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:52,828
- Seriously, it's so cool. - Yes.

187
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,528
- But Torong is the main character. - What's with her?

188
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:55,628
What?

189
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:56,929
- Hey. - Hey.

190
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:59,999
(They finally become the whole group.)

191
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:03,499
(The youngest one arrives on the release day of "Attitude.")

192
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:07,179
(It's their 4th time singing the same part.)

193
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:12,279
(Thankfully, it's the last time.)

194
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:14,548
(Hush)

195
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:15,749
- What? - What is it?

196
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:19,689
(We are rebels in our)

197
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,089
(I'm happy because it's my song.)

198
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,788
(The 3rd song since arrival)

199
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,798
- Yes. - It'll become a mega-hit song.

200
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,639
- Did a new album come out? - Congratulations.

201
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,469
It came out an hour ago.

202
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:35,468
Really? Thank you so much.

203
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:36,798
Hey, where's ours?

204
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:37,808
- Where's ours? - Where's ours?

205
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:39,909
- Of course, there's one for each. - Yes.

206
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,439
Girls.

207
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,308
- Your hair looks so cute. - Does it look okay?

208
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:44,708
- It looks so cute. - I got a haircut.

209
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:45,709
How do I look?

210
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,725
- I put on a cute outfit. - You look pretty.

211
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:48,019
You look pretty.

212
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:50,018
- You look cute today. - I put on a cute outfit.

213
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:52,048
Gosh, she wrote a message for each person.

214
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:53,365
There's one for CEO Rhee Myoung Han.

215
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,389
Hey.

216
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:56,159
Hey, CEO Rhee Myoung Han...

217
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:59,158
"Hello, I'm Yu Jin of IVE."

218
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,159
- What are you doing? - "I say hello through an album..."

219
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,975
- "since our last meeting." - What are you doing?

220
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:02,999
It dropped.
- It dropped. - Seriously.

221
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:04,999
CEO Rhee Myoung Han.
- CEO Ko Joong Seok. - Stop it.

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,015
Did she write a message to CEO Ko Joong Seok as well?

223
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,169
The leaders.

224
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,739
- She doesn't disappoint. - She's thorough.

225
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:15,739
(Yu Jin, thank you.)

226
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,548
Producer Ye Seul, Producer Hyun Yong,

227
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,148
- Writer Woo Jung... - Who else?

228
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:21,118
- Why are you reading it out loud? - Ms. Happy Seal.

229
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:23,048
- Ms. Happy Seal. - That's me.

230
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,088
- Ms. Young Ji. - How about me?

231
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:27,658
- Big Sister Mimi. - Big Sister Mimi.

232
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:28,718
Please listen to it.

233
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:29,858
- This is the best. - Thank you.

234
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,828
- We'll listen to it. - Thank you.

235
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:33,958
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

236
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,598
- Why... - Yu Jin's message is memorable.

237
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,628
- May I read it out loud? - Sure.

238
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:39,129
"Let's have a nice shoot without fighting."

239
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,199
"I love you a lot."

240
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:43,539
Why is my message so businesslike?

241
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,709
That isn't true.

242
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:47,778
- Look at this. - That isn't true.

243
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,238
- Which part? - Let me read it out loud.

244
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,239
- Let me read it out loud. - Okay.

245
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,848
"Big Sis, our new album came out."

246
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:53,578
"Every time our album comes out,"

247
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:55,278
- "you film a video..." - Hold on.

248
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,548
- "diligently." - My message has "Every time" too.

249
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:57,918
- "Every time." - Listen.

250
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,658
"Thank you for filming the challenge and rooting for us."

251
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:02,319
"Please listen to this album a lot."

252
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,728
"I'll look forward to your challenge video."

253
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:06,359
"I love you. May our love last forever."

254
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:07,529
Mimi.

255
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:09,798
The only heartwarming part of this message is,

256
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,628
"Big Sis."

257
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:12,768
- That isn't true. - That's it.

258
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,168
- Look. "May our love last forever." - It's similar to mine.

259
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:16,498
- How is that businesslike? - Wait a second.

260
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:17,738
Who else had "Every time?"

261
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:19,208
- Me. Who else had "Every time?" - You know...

262
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,408
"Passionately..."

263
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,578
My message has a part about the challenge too.

264
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:22,738
- How about yours? - Mine too.

265
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:24,408
- That's right. - Read yours.

266
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:25,878
- Stop it. - "The master of IVE's challenges."

267
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,848
There was a touching part in the beginning.

268
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:29,478
- That's right. - What is it? Read it out loud.

269
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,618
"Thanks to you, I have fun when we're together."

270
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:33,548
Hey. Hold on.

271
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:35,089
"The master of IVE's challenges."

272
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,389
Young Ji, this is worse. "Please listen to this album a lot."

273
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:43,399
- Stop it. - Did she copy it from somewhere?

274
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:46,498
- This is what they say... - It sounds like...

275
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,238
- at a TV station. - It's what you say...

276
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,298
to the unspecified individuals.

277
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,708
- That isn't true. - Seriously.

278
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:52,838
- "Please listen to this album..." - That isn't true.

279
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:53,938
- "a lot." - That isn't true.

280
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:55,879
(I love you. May our love last forever.)

281
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:57,778
- Seriously. - Gosh, it's so loud...

282
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,248
since you guys gathered around for the first time in a while.

283
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:01,278
- It has been a while. - I'm sick and tired already.

284
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,418
People absolutely refused to tell us where we were going.

285
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,419
Seriously. I'm so curious.

286
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,518
My stylist and director...

287
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,988
- refused to tell me. - No one knows.

288
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:09,058
- They don't know. - They didn't even tell me...

289
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:10,059
if our destination was cold or hot.

290
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,128
I have an idea.

291
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:12,389
- What is it? - Let's share it.

292
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:14,199
- Still... - An idea?

293
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:16,419
- An idea? A hunch? - I have an idea. I have a hunch.

294
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,568
- What is it? - Would you like to hear it?

295
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:19,209
- Let's hear it. - It won't be a problem.

296
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:22,138
- Australia. - Australia? That'll be great.

297
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,438
- I really want to go there. - Then I'll film a challenge...

298
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,038
- with a kangaroo. - Then I'll do it with a koala.

299
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,908
I hate to break it to you, but a kangaroo will punch you.

300
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:30,549
Then I can release it as a short video, Mimi.

301
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:32,548
- Mimi. - You're obsessed with the show.

302
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,918
- There's a place I want to visit. - Where?

303
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,679
Since this is E-cade,

304
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,448
I want to go to Egypt.

305
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:38,449
- Egypt? - Egypt.

306
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:41,589
You seem a bit like a pharaoh right now.

307
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:42,959
Right now?

308
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,129
- I want to go to Egypt. - We...

309
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:46,705
- It's dangerous. - How about Dubai?

310
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,658
- Dubai is a good destination. - Have you made a guess?

311
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:49,699
- Dubai? - As for me...

312
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,405
So, Mimi thinks we'll go to the Middle East.

313
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:52,998
- How about you, Eun Ji? - There's a place I want to visit.

314
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,138
- Where is it? - Where is it?

315
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,338
I say this with honesty. Mongolia.

316
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,508
I really want to go there.

317
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:58,509
- Eun Ji. - Right?

318
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,208
- Mongolia. - I really want to go to Mongolia.

319
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:01,478
I want to get off the internet. My vision will improve.

320
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:03,278
I want to go there for a digital detox.

321
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,849
- Same here. - Eun Ji.

322
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,678
We can't go to a place because you guys want to.

323
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:09,478
That's right. We can't go to a place because you guys want to.

324
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:11,118
- Will it be a cold place? - We're going there for work.

325
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,718
- That's right. - I forgot about Torong.

326
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,588
- There's a reason why... - I forgot.

327
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:16,029
- we're gathered around. - I forgot.

328
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,828
- We must catch Torong. - We must catch Torong.

329
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:20,228
Torong works at a rice cake shop.

330
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:21,299
Why don't we do the same?

331
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:22,929
That'll come later.

332
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,728
There are too many ideas for a spinoff.

333
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:27,299
(Let's go over the situation.)

334
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,009
(Torong was waiting for a chance to run away.)

335
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,309
(Torong ran away with Jade Emperor's corporate card.)

336
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,039
This time, Torong didn't simply disappear.

337
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:39,479
Torong stole...

338
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:41,048
- Jade Emperor's corporate card. - Oh, my.

339
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:42,518
- Who steals a corporate card? - Oh, my.

340
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,319
Hurry up and come back! Where are you?

341
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:46,688
- I can't believe this punk. - What a gutsy rabbit.

342
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:48,209
- Torong is gutsy. - A corporate card.

343
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:51,329
(Torong is using the corporate card without holding back.)

344
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:53,558
We need to know where Torong went.

345
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,258
- Exactly. - Give us a hint.

346
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:56,858
- A hint. - A hint?

347
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:58,798
- A hint. - You guys talked about...

348
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,229
the countries you wanted to visit.

349
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,468
- A neighboring country... - Not a country.

350
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:04,868
- Dubai? - A neighboring place was mentioned.

351
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:06,908
- A neighboring place. - A neighboring place?

352
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:07,909
The Middle East?

353
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,659
Are we going to the Middle East?

354
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,009
He mentioned the Middle East again.

355
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:13,655
"So, Eun Ji thinks we'll go to the Middle East."

356
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,118
- What? You're right. - The Middle East?

357
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,318
- You're smart. - The Middle East?

358
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,348
Hold on. Will we really go there?

359
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:22,349
What other countries are there in the Middle East?

360
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,928
I don't know the countries.

361
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:28,028
(Same here.)

362
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:29,859
A neighboring country?

363
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,198
I listed all the countries I knew.

364
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:33,745
- What other countries are there? - I don't know.

365
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:35,138
Hurry up and say the correct answer.

366
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:37,638
- We can only give reactions. - I don't know.

367
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,809
I don't know either.

368
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:40,578
Hurry up and tell us.

369
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:41,638
We won't know anyway.

370
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,999
- We'll give surprised reactions. - Where did Torong go to?

371
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,779
This place is right next to Dubai.

372
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,689
(Abu Dhabi)

373
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,559
- Abu Dhabi. - Abu Dhabi?

374
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,188
- Abu Dhabi? - I got goosebumps.

375
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:57,828
- Abu Dhabi? - Abu Dhabi?

376
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:02,728
(For those who are a bit unfamiliar with Abu Dhabi, )

377
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:04,049
(we'll give a brief explanation.)

378
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:08,938
(Abu Dhabi)

379
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:10,908
(The capital of United Arab Emirates)

380
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:11,938
(Dubai)

381
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:14,509
(It's a city that's right next to Dubai.)

382
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,079
(A mysterious desert...)

383
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:20,719
(spreads endlessly.)

384
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,449
(Trends and traditions coexist in this city.)

385
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,659
(It's a luxury travel destination that's on the rise.)

386
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,428
- Dubai is well-known, right? - Yes.

387
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:32,959
Dubai is the little brother.

388
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:34,898
- It's the big brother. - Big brother.

389
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,335
- Abu Dhabi is the big brother. - Big Brother Abu Dhabi.

390
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,828
- Abu Dhabi? - Big Brother Abu Dhabi.

391
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:38,829
Big Brother.

392
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,168
- Big Brother Abu Dhabi is here. - Big Brother.

393
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:44,108
- We'll give a bow. - Big Brother.

394
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:46,638
- Big Brother. - Big Brother Abu Dhabi.

395
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,678
- We'll give a bow. - Big Brother.

396
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,679
- Listen to me, okay? - I'm so embarrassed.

397
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:53,549
- I went to Abu Dhabi, okay? - My goodness.

398
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:55,149
I did everything.

399
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,619
(Let's turn off the audio for a second.)

400
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,819
(Torong ran away to the land of the big brother.)

401
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:09,629
(The members set off to catch the gutsy Torong.)

402
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,839
(E-cade members' adventure in the Middle East)

403
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:18,909
(They'll cross the vast desert.)

404
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:22,939
(Avoid Torong's eyes...)

405
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:26,649
(and land in Abu Dhabi!)

406
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:30,579
(It's a place they've never experienced.)

407
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,618
Vroom, vroom! Let's go!

408
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,258
- Vroom, vroom! Let's go! - Yes!

409
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:37,429
(Let's go the mysterious world of the sand!)

410
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:40,089
- I have a question. Sir. - Yes?

411
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,728
Do many people travel to Abu Dhabi?

412
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:45,328
I don't know anyone who has traveled...

413
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:46,498
- to Abu Dhabi. - Me neither.

414
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,568
- The monkey's name is Abu. - Abu.

415
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:49,929
- Abu. - That came out of nowhere.

416
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:52,339
- Aladdin's friend. - Aladdin.

417
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:54,878
- The apple... - "Abu" means "Dad."

418
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:55,938
- What? - Really?

419
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:57,808
- Abu. - You know...

420
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:00,108
- Abu. - Abu Yeong Seok.

421
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:01,718
(Their variety show dad has no energy to play with them.)

422
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:03,878
- How about "Big brother?" - My ears hurt.

423
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,218
- Akh. - Akh.

424
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:07,219
- Akh. - Akh Yeong Seok.

425
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,858
- Akh. - Akh Yeong Seok.

426
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:11,488
- Akh Yeong Seok - Akh Yeong Seok

427
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,788
Gosh, they're so loud.

428
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,999
I don't know what to do.

429
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,598
I have this much to explain.

430
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,568
Because you guys, I've only explained a small bit.

431
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,368
- We have so much to explain. - We made so many preparations...

432
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:25,138
for this much explanation.

433
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,208
- He's serious. - He's angry.

434
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:28,708
(There are many things Yeong Seok needs to explain.)

435
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:30,108
- My goodness. - We're sorry. We won't cut you off.

436
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:31,908
- At the Space Rest Area... - We're sorry. We won't cut you off.

437
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:33,708
- where Jade Emperor lives, - Okay.

438
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,018
Torong isn't the only one.

439
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,418
- Turtle. - Many people live there.

440
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:40,718
There were secret agents on Earth.

441
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:43,688
Luckily, in Abu Dhabi,

442
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:45,029
- there's... - Is there someone?

443
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:46,628
- one secret agent. - My goodness.

444
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:48,958
- Thank goodness. - This one is chasing after Torong.

445
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,459
- This code name is... - What is it?

446
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,068
Agent F.

447
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:53,468
- Agent F? - F.

448
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:55,239
- Agent F. - F?

449
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:57,609
(The first joint operation on Earth Arcade)

450
00:15:58,469 --> 00:16:01,109
(Rendezvous with Agent F...)

451
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:04,949
(and arrest Torong!)

452
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,549
(The identity of the mysterious Agent F...)

453
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,889
(will be revealed soon!)

454
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,519
(In conclusion)

455
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:17,258
- Rendezvous with Agent F. - Rendezvous with Agent F.

456
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:19,028
Work with Agent F...

457
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:20,729
to arrest Torong...

458
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,859
and retrieve the corporate card.

459
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:24,799
- Okay. - Your mission will be complete.

460
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:27,598
(Raising her hand)

461
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:28,868
No. I have a question.

462
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:30,969
(No. I have a question.)

463
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:32,838
Weren't you going to give me a high-five...

464
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:35,079
- as a compliment? - He thought it was a high-five.

465
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:37,238
(He was proud to receive a round of applause.)

466
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,779
(A high-five?)

467
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:46,989
(It's shameful.)

468
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,418
- He got played. - I have a question.

469
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,389
Ask one question at a time.

470
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:52,329
Ask one question at a time.

471
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:55,229
Also, when Young Ji asks a question,

472
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:57,429
keep quiet to avoid an overlap in the audio.

473
00:16:58,499 --> 00:16:59,868
- I have a question. - Now, Lee Young Ji's question.

474
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:02,499
- Okay. I have a question. - "Now, Lee Young Ji's question."

475
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,468
Will Agent F be helpful?

476
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:07,938
It's someone we recruited out of necessity, so...

477
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,408
No. Agent F will be helpful.

478
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:10,678
- So... All right. - I have a question.

479
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,308
- Go ahead. - Why are there so many questions?

480
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:13,578
- I have a question. - This is driving me crazy.

481
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,948
- We don't have all the answers. - You came up with the setting,

482
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:16,618
- so be prepared for the questions. - We don't have all the answers.

483
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,918
- Seriously. - I have a question.

484
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,349
- Yu Jin. - In that case,

485
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:21,189
- what should we wear? - What?

486
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,558
- What? - Should we dress up?

487
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,828
- That was sharp. - Isn't it a question for us?

488
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,858
- It's important for us. - Yes.

489
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,798
- Bali, Thailand, Finland... - That's right.

490
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,828
- Each time, - We wore unique outfits.

491
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:30,428
- we wore special outfits. - We had a concept.

492
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:31,968
- That's right. - With Agent F,

493
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,828
you guys will become...

494
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:35,838
- the best agents. - A suit.

495
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,568
- Black Widow. - You need to enter the country...

496
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:40,769
without anyone knowing and arrest Torong, right?

497
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:42,879
Thus, you guys have two options.

498
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:44,409
- Spy. - All right.

499
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,078
- What? - No way.

500
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,078
- What? - Gosh, it's like a futuristic city.

501
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,418
They're using equipment.

502
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:50,478
- How will you guys become spies? - Spider-Man.

503
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,488
- Let's go over the plan. - The plan.

504
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,688
- Let's see it. - A leather suit?

505
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:54,689
- What could it be? - "The Matrix?"

506
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,195
- What's the plan? - Gosh, it's a presentation.

507
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:57,958
- "Restricted document." - "Restricted document."

508
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,028
It got cut off.

509
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:00,998
- The First Earth Warriors' Spy... - Spy Disguise Plan.

510
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:01,999
Spy Disguise Plan.

511
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,158
- All right. - Will we wear a disguise?

512
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:04,228
- I want to look pretty. - Now,

513
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:06,098
- I'm nervous. - how do you guys want to look?

514
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:08,299
- Show us the aesthetic goal. - The aesthetic goal.

515
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:09,938
- The aesthetic goal. - He knows all the in-words.

516
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:11,509
(The aesthetic goal gets revealed.)

517
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:17,608
(Unprecedented cheers)

518
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:19,449
- Akh! - Akh!

519
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,118
- They're your seniors. - Yes.

520
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,048
- "Manners maketh man." - Yes.

521
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:24,418
- "Kingsman." - "Kingsman."

522
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:25,588
Agent 007...

523
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:26,848
dresses up in black.

524
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:29,018
He looks very cool with his sunglasses,

525
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,318
- suit, and suitcase. - Yes.

526
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,458
Bullets come out of that tie.

527
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,398
- I know what you mean. - There was that umbrella.

528
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:36,128
- I think those glasses are cool. - Same here.

529
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:37,898
- But... - Those glasses work as a screen.

530
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:39,429
(However)

531
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,268
But here's the problem.

532
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:43,938
Why do you enter a place...

533
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:45,008
- as an agent? - Right.

534
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:46,739
So that no one can recognize you,

535
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:49,509
- you wear a disguise. - A disguise.

536
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,679
What's the essence of being an agent?

537
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:54,148
- People shouldn't know you guys. - Right.

538
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,119
But what did you guys do on a major channel?

539
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:59,919
Earth Arcade

540
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:01,219
It became a trending video.

541
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,658
Everyone around the world knows you guys.

542
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:04,018
- It spread to Abu Dhabi. - Abu Dhabi.

543
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,028
- You guys became too famous. - Too famous.

544
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:08,229
Thus, you'll go back to how you guys were...

545
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:10,458
- Before that. - before fame...

546
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,568
- for this mission. - No way.

547
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:12,898
No way. Seriously, don't be like that.

548
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:14,738
- What's that? - Why are you guys doing this?

549
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:15,968
Hold on. What's your past?

550
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:17,968
I guess you'll go back to dancesport.

551
00:19:17,969 --> 00:19:19,668
Think about how you were before fame.

552
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:23,478
He's talking about how we were before we began appearing on TV.

553
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,448
- You have many pasts. - Shall we go over each one?

554
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:26,908
- The first one is... - Hold on.

555
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:28,448
- Please don't do this. - Lee Eun Ji.

556
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:29,549
Lee Eun Ji.

557
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:32,418
- I'm excited. - I'm looking forward to this.

558
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,948
- Let me sit down. - Don't do this.

559
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:36,188
- Lee Eun Ji was 21 years old. - Please.

560
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:37,658
- The age of 21? - The age of 21?

561
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:39,158
You were younger than me.

562
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:41,398
- The age of 21? - She hadn't become a comedienne.

563
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:42,598
- What? - Weren't you a comedienne...

564
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,628
- at the age of 21? - Wait.

565
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:45,598
Where did you get that photo?

566
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,968
- Hold on. What's this? - Is it from your manager?

567
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:48,338
- It can't be. No way. - No way.

568
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:49,798
On "Star King..."

569
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,469
(An SBS show, "Star King")

570
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:53,469
(Strong reaction)

571
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:54,938
On "Star King..."

572
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:57,679
(What?)

573
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:01,049
(The younger members didn't know about Eun Ji's past.)

574
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:05,518
(She transforms into Chucky.)

575
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,749
She really hates it.

576
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:11,728
(Yeong Seok is very proud.)

577
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:13,988
- Fine! Play it! - My goodness.

578
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:15,328
Show us.

579
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:16,998
- Show us. - Show us.

580
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:18,998
Show us Lee Eun Ji on "Star King..."

581
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:20,699
- at the age of 21. - The age of 21.

582
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,809
(Ta-da)

583
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,009
(Laughing)

584
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:29,304
Show us Lee Eun Ji on "Star King..."

585
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:30,935
- at the age of 21. - The age of 21.

586
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:35,044
(Ta-da)

587
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:38,015
(Laughing)

588
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:42,145
(Lee Eun Ji in 2012)

589
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:46,415
(Eun Ji catches the eyes.)

590
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:49,525
(The veiled past...)

591
00:20:49,925 --> 00:20:52,695
(of Eun Ji gets unearthed.)

592
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:54,354
(She looks a bit scary in this photo.)

593
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:55,895
Gosh, Eun Ji.

594
00:20:56,325 --> 00:20:57,724
- Eun Ji. - You looked so cute.

595
00:20:57,725 --> 00:20:59,194
Stop it.

596
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:01,805
Eun Ji, you need to dye your hair.

597
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:04,735
- She's preparing to do a split. - You know,

598
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:07,675
back then, skirt pants... What are those called?

599
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:09,474
- Skirted leggings. - The skirt is attached.

600
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:12,615
- Skirted leggings. - Skirted leggings.

601
00:21:13,645 --> 00:21:15,715
(Her cheekbones ache from laughing.)

602
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:17,844
(I'm the woman who is beautiful thanks to her challenging spirit, )

603
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:19,355
(Lee Eun Ji.)

604
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:22,085
(Eun Ji was on "Star King" in 2012.)

605
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:29,225
(She showed a musical-inspired comedy skit.)

606
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:33,094
I was 21 years old.

607
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:34,494
- I wore skirted leggings. - Eun Ji was so cute.

608
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,334
If you go like this, no one will recognize you.

609
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:38,474
I hate that outfit.

610
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:40,451
- Why? You look so cute. - It's similar to what you wear now.

611
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:41,944
- It became trendy again. - Really?

612
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:43,244
- Skirted leggings. - Stripes.

613
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:44,674
What were you doing in the right photo?

614
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:46,944
Why is your facial expression so feisty?

615
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:48,214
- Well, - Was she checking the time?

616
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:50,514
It was "Gag King," a special episode...

617
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:51,654
of "Star King."

618
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:53,884
They sent an announcement to all the art schools...

619
00:21:53,885 --> 00:21:55,424
in Korea.

620
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:56,784
"We're making a show like this."

621
00:21:56,785 --> 00:21:57,785
"If you're interested in comedy,"

622
00:21:57,786 --> 00:21:58,794
- "please apply." - Okay.

623
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:00,424
I did well back then.

624
00:22:00,425 --> 00:22:02,395
I became the winner.

625
00:22:02,965 --> 00:22:04,735
- Eun Ji doesn't disappoint. - So,

626
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:06,494
I received the prize money.

627
00:22:06,495 --> 00:22:08,204
- I paid rent with it. - Eun Ji.

628
00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:09,804
- It worked out for you. - You're cool.

629
00:22:09,805 --> 00:22:11,534
- My goodness. - If you don't become an agent,

630
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:12,974
you need to go back to how you were...

631
00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:14,975
- before fame. Understood? - Understood.

632
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:16,945
- The next one is... - Please.

633
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:19,445
- Mimi. - Why?

634
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:21,615
I need to wear wings.

635
00:22:22,315 --> 00:22:24,614
- Didn't she debut at a young age? - In ninth grade...

636
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:26,985
Please!

637
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:28,325
Turn on the faucet.

638
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:30,484
- In ninth grade, - Let's see it.

639
00:22:30,485 --> 00:22:32,654
- Mimi entered an audition. - An audition?

640
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:33,655
Did you do that?

641
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:36,225
(Sprawled on the floor)

642
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:37,964
Please...

643
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:38,995
I'm curious.

644
00:22:39,235 --> 00:22:40,634
All right. Show us Mimi's past.

645
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:42,235
I'm in tears.

646
00:22:42,435 --> 00:22:43,834
- Show us. - I was in middle school.

647
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:46,374
(Ta-da)

648
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,404
- My goodness, Mimi. - You had no gold jewelry back then.

649
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:53,075
(Mimi in 2010)

650
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:54,215
I was in middle school.

651
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:56,485
(They suddenly get a photo of a softie.)

652
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:58,654
My goodness, Mimi.

653
00:22:58,655 --> 00:23:00,984
You had no gold jewelry back then.

654
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:03,184
- Mimi, you were so cute. - What? You were so cute.

655
00:23:03,185 --> 00:23:05,525
I can't believe it. Look at her outfit.

656
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:08,225
Eun Ji, those shorts were trendy...

657
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:09,694
- back then. - Where did you get...

658
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:11,025
a jacket of that color?

659
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:12,664
- Was it trendy back then? - That's right.

660
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:14,064
- Your bangs... - Her bangs were...

661
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:15,464
- so thick. - I'm sorry, but I have a question.

662
00:23:15,465 --> 00:23:17,635
Were those bangs yours?

663
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:20,804
- They were mine. - Swagger.

664
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:22,921
Mimi, do you remember that time? What were you doing?

665
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,145
Back then,

666
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:26,114
- I was in a dance club. - Okay.

667
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:28,615
I thought I'd film a video and post it online.

668
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:30,414
- I danced to "Breathe." - Is it still posted anywhere?

669
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:31,415
- Right. - "Breathe?"

670
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,484
- I think I've seen this before. - Yes, that's the one.

671
00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:35,055
You can check it out here.

672
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:38,055
Mimi, the mouse from "Ratatouille" could live in your bangs.

673
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:42,025
And cook?

674
00:23:43,665 --> 00:23:47,335
(Let's watch Mimi's dance skills of when she was younger.)

675
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:56,374
(Kim Mi Hyun was especially shy when she was in middle school.)

676
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,274
They really won't recognize us if we show up like that.

677
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:00,491
I don't think you're expecting a lot from this next one.

678
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:02,645
We still have to see how Young Ji was...

679
00:24:02,915 --> 00:24:04,344
- before she became a superstar. - Why am I the last?

680
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:05,514
Gosh, it's...

681
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:06,784
- Her past is already famous. - This is going to be easy.

682
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:07,954
Sure. Let's easily...

683
00:24:07,955 --> 00:24:09,524
- take a look at it. - Everyone knows the photo.

684
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:10,954
This was when she was a sophomore at Sinseo High School,

685
00:24:10,955 --> 00:24:12,494
when she appeared on "High School Rapper."

686
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:14,055
- This is... - This is...

687
00:24:14,395 --> 00:24:15,994
- This is very famous. - Show us.

688
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:18,334
- This is what I'm talking about. - "I'm not hip-hop?"

689
00:24:18,335 --> 00:24:19,664
("I'm not hip-hop?")

690
00:24:19,665 --> 00:24:21,864
I see.

691
00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:23,635
Where did you learn hip-hop like that?

692
00:24:23,765 --> 00:24:26,075
(Lee Young Ji, 2018)

693
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:29,274
(It's relatively recent.)

694
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:31,974
(Lee Young Ji, 2025, Lee Young Ji, 2018)

695
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:33,275
"I'm not hip-hop?"

696
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:35,644
- "What's hip-hop?" - I have a question.

697
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:37,014
Do I have to gain weight for this?

698
00:24:37,015 --> 00:24:39,215
(Do I have to gain weight for this?)

699
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:40,454
Gosh.

700
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:41,455
(Dizzy)

701
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:42,484
- You were cute. - I'll gain weight.

702
00:24:42,485 --> 00:24:43,724
- You were so cute. - She was so adorable...

703
00:24:43,725 --> 00:24:45,094
- back then... - She was so cute.

704
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:47,754
- I have to do my makeup like that? - Of course. That's a must.

705
00:24:47,755 --> 00:24:48,994
- You have to make it look real. - Yes, I should.

706
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:50,064
You have to do your makeup like that.

707
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:51,834
To be honest, I want you to do your hair like that too.

708
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:53,034
- You should. - I will.

709
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:54,035
- Wear a wig. - Wear a wig.
Wait. Hold on.

710
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:56,564
We haven't decided on this.

711
00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:58,234
- You're right. - Right.

712
00:24:58,235 --> 00:25:00,134
- Goodness. Thank you, Young Ji. - Goodness. There must be something.

713
00:25:00,135 --> 00:25:01,404
- Thank you. - We have to protect ourselves.

714
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:03,004
I'm saying, if we were to do this,

715
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:04,604
that's a possibility.

716
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:06,474
Then you have to show up as your past self too.

717
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:07,475
- You're famous. - Right.

718
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:08,584
- You have to do it with us. - That's right!

719
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:09,814
When you were on "Heroine 5."

720
00:25:09,815 --> 00:25:10,944
- Age 29, unmarried. - "Heroine 5,"

721
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:11,954
- age 29, unmarried. - You have to do it.

722
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:12,955
Na Yeong Seok.

723
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:14,255
You have to do it.

724
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:15,825
Hey, Mickey

725
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:17,254
Now that I think about it...

726
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:19,094
- You should do it too. - You're the most famous one.

727
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:20,854
- That's right. - Woo Jung has to do it too.

728
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:22,725
(Maybe next time.)

729
00:25:22,995 --> 00:25:24,324
Is it Yu Jin's turn now?

730
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:25,334
- Yes. Our youngest member. - That's right.

731
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:26,564
- Why am I the last one? - What if...

732
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:28,165
it's Yu Jin's sonogram?

733
00:25:28,535 --> 00:25:30,435
- Gosh. - Wait.

734
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:32,075
Or a picture from her first birthday.

735
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:35,074
This was before Yu Jin became the global superstar she is now.

736
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,244
- Yes. Let's see. - Back...

737
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:37,744
when her dream career was still an elementary teacher.

738
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,944
I think I know this one.

739
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:40,275
Her motto was...

740
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:43,445
"Don't limit yourself."

741
00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:44,714
Her motto?

742
00:25:44,715 --> 00:25:46,314
- What was it? - "Don't limit yourself."

743
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:47,754
- "Don't limit yourself." - Her motto.

744
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,115
Back when her dream career was still an elementary teacher.

745
00:25:50,255 --> 00:25:51,724
An Yu Jin graduated in 2016...

746
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:52,994
from Samcheon Elementary School in Daejeon.

747
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:54,655
Let's take a look.

748
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:56,924
(Ta-da)

749
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:58,364
Amazing.

750
00:25:58,365 --> 00:25:59,394
- Yu Jin! - You were adorable.

751
00:25:59,395 --> 00:26:04,235
(An Yu Jin, 2015)

752
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:08,075
(An Yu Jin in elementary school)

753
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:10,904
Amazing.

754
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:12,674
- Yu Jin! - You were adorable.

755
00:26:12,675 --> 00:26:15,184
- Yu Jin, what are those glasses? - You were adorable!

756
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:17,714
- Yu Jin! - You were so adorable.

757
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:19,155
- You were adorable. - That's...

758
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:20,715
You were so adorable, Yu Jin.

759
00:26:20,716 --> 00:26:22,284
Those glasses would give me more than perfect vision.

760
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:24,384
- Yu Jin, you were so adorable. - Turn this on.

761
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:25,394
- Hey, Yu Jin. - Turn it on.

762
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:27,294
- You were so adorable. - You look exactly the same.

763
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,594
- Yu Jin, turn this on. - Where are you going?

764
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:29,595
You were so adorable.

765
00:26:29,596 --> 00:26:30,764
- Yu Jin. - You were so adorable.

766
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:32,595
(Steaming)

767
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:34,495
What's wrong with you?

768
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:35,564
- I mean... - It's adorable.

769
00:26:35,565 --> 00:26:36,834
- Wasn't she so young and cute? - Did you say...

770
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:38,504
Yu Jin's dream career was an elementary school teacher?

771
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:40,535
I can tell from that picture.

772
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:43,104
- She was so adorable. - Why did you do this pose?

773
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:44,405
Was it like, "Hi, guys?"

774
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,214
It was like, "I'm graduating."

775
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:48,644
(An Yu Jin, Dream career: Elementary school teacher)

776
00:26:48,645 --> 00:26:49,645
"Yes!"

777
00:26:49,646 --> 00:26:51,244
- She's so adorable. - She's adorable.

778
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:52,725
- If you show up like this... - Wait.

779
00:26:52,855 --> 00:26:54,984
My eyesight back then was minus nine.

780
00:26:54,985 --> 00:26:55,985
I see.

781
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,284
Do I have to wear those same glasses?

782
00:26:57,285 --> 00:26:58,554
That's why I look so funny...

783
00:26:58,555 --> 00:26:59,794
- Yes. - with my eyes so small.

784
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:01,124
- Yes, we have to get piercings... - We have to get piercings?

785
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,294
And gain weight and everything.

786
00:27:02,295 --> 00:27:04,294
- You have to get bangs, Mimi. - Bangs?

787
00:27:04,295 --> 00:27:05,335
- Gosh. - That's right.

788
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:06,534
- I have to... - That's...

789
00:27:06,535 --> 00:27:08,964
That means I have to reverse my braces.

790
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:10,035
Yes, you have to.

791
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:12,634
- That was before I got braces. - Yes, you have to reverse it.

792
00:27:12,635 --> 00:27:13,804
I'd have to reverse my braces.

793
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:15,174
If you were to become An Yu Jin of 2016,

794
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,705
whenever you say something,

795
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,004
- you have to be like, "Hey." - Hey.

796
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:19,014
- "What happened was..." - And you have to...

797
00:27:19,015 --> 00:27:20,874
- keep saying your motto. - Right.

798
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,755
- Don't limit yourself. - Don't limit yourself.

799
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:26,284
(He put all the pictures together.)

800
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:28,015
It's worse now that they're all together.

801
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:29,424
- Turn it off. - It feels like...

802
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:31,154
those four are up to something in Abu Dhabi.

803
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:32,354
Turn it off.

804
00:27:32,355 --> 00:27:34,095
Hide this.

805
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:36,364
(No!)

806
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:38,094
There must be a way.

807
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:39,834
Whether we get in disguise and sneak in,

808
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:42,734
or we sneak in dressed like our seniors.

809
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:43,735
- How are we... - Do we have to play a game?

810
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:44,864
- A game? - How are we going to sneak in?

811
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:47,475
You're going to play a game and if you succeed,

812
00:27:48,205 --> 00:27:49,574
- All together? - you can dress up as your seniors.

813
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:50,804
Nice.

814
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:51,815
If you fail,

815
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:55,085
you'll have to get in disguise as your past selves.

816
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,285
What's the game?

817
00:27:56,545 --> 00:27:58,244
Out of all your seniors, who's the most famous...

818
00:27:58,245 --> 00:28:00,361
- and successful? He's right there. - Yes, he's on the screen.

819
00:28:00,385 --> 00:28:01,854
Agent 007.

820
00:28:01,855 --> 00:28:03,335
- Agent 007. - Agent 007. That means?

821
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,125
- The game, 007 Bang? - Jack Sparrow.

822
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:06,154
Yes, bang.

823
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:08,565
- The game, 007 Bang. - Bbang is bread. Guess the bread.

824
00:28:08,725 --> 00:28:10,365
- Guess the name of the bread? - Mi Hyun.

825
00:28:10,595 --> 00:28:11,764
Mi Hyun.

826
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:13,494
- Mi Hyun, please. - You have to win this for us.

827
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:16,265
You know I'm not good with names.

828
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:17,965
You don't even know bread names?

829
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:19,874
(Burst out laughing)

830
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,604
I'm sure you know the names of bread.

831
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,004
Things like salted butter roll.

832
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,044
Yes, or soboro bun.

833
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:26,044
I don't really know the precise names. I'll try, though.

834
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:27,144
- You'll be fine. - Last time,

835
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:28,684
you guessed the names of chips. Remember?

836
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:29,685
- Yes. - Yes.

837
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:31,385
This is an extension of that.

838
00:28:31,515 --> 00:28:33,415
(The Bread Quiz)

839
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:37,385
(They'll be shown real bread, )

840
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,395
(and they have to guess the names.)

841
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:42,305
(Obviously, three of them will have to guess twice!)

842
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,765
This isn't a team game.

843
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,394
- It's two-on-two? - You'll have to cooperate...

844
00:28:46,395 --> 00:28:48,364
to decide each of your fate.

845
00:28:48,365 --> 00:28:50,064
For example, let's say it's Young Ji's turn.

846
00:28:50,065 --> 00:28:51,651
- If you all cooperate... - I have to gain weight.

847
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:53,134
And succeed in guessing the bread names,

848
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:54,404
- Young Ji... - Will survive?

849
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:55,704
Will get to dress up like the senior spies.

850
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:58,304
But if Eun Ji hesitates and fails to guess,

851
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:00,465
her disguise will be her past as "High School Rapper."

852
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:02,814
So the other three could dress up in suits...

853
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:04,684
- while I look like that? - That's a possibility.

854
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:07,655
You'll look so odd and out of place.

855
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:10,424
- I got goosebumps. - I got goosebumps too.

856
00:29:10,425 --> 00:29:12,324
- "Earth Arcade" is... - All right.

857
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:13,454
Evolving now.

858
00:29:13,455 --> 00:29:15,164
- I got chills. - You guys are amazing.

859
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:16,224
This sounds fun.

860
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:18,564
- This tournament system. - I really got chills.

861
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:19,565
Akh Yeong Seok.

862
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:20,735
- Akh! - Akh!

863
00:29:20,865 --> 00:29:21,935
Akh Yeong Seok.

864
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:23,035
(However)

865
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:24,434
You have to keep this in mind.

866
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:27,034
When you play games, you're not good at it at first.

867
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:29,404
But you get better the more you play.

868
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:31,644
- If Round One is for Young Ji, - The sacrifice.

869
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:34,314
She could be at a disadvantage.

870
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,085
- I see. - Keep that in mind.

871
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:37,785
He's so annoying.

872
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:39,354
Queen Yeong Seok.

873
00:29:39,355 --> 00:29:41,084
- He's evolved in annoying us too. - Definitely.

874
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:43,525
(The point is that the first round could be disadvantageous.)

875
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:46,654
- You have to guess the bread. - Okay.

876
00:29:46,655 --> 00:29:48,794
Which one of you four will decide her fate first?

877
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:50,194
How should we do this?

878
00:29:50,195 --> 00:29:52,765
- In the order of our seats? - Wait, to be honest...

879
00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:55,464
- I want to improve Yu Jin's vision. - To be honest...

880
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:57,211
- Yu Jin, do this when you speak. - I have an opinion.

881
00:29:57,235 --> 00:29:59,104
Do this when you speak, please.

882
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:00,234
- Can I give my opinion? - Yes, go ahead.

883
00:30:00,235 --> 00:30:01,235
- Yes, Yu Jin. - Yes.

884
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:02,605
To be honest,

885
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:05,744
a member here has "bbang" in her name.

886
00:30:05,745 --> 00:30:06,775
Who is it?

887
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,215
- "Bbang" in her name? - I thanked her in my album too.

888
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:11,285
Young Ji. "Young" means zero.

889
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:13,114
- What's another word for zero? - Wait.

890
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:14,754
- Zero? Bbang. It's bbang. - It's bbang.

891
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:16,554
- It's bbang. - She's Bbang Ji.

892
00:30:16,555 --> 00:30:17,555
Don't be unreasonable.

893
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:18,994
- This is about life or death. - Bbang Ji.

894
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:20,694
(It's about life or death?)

895
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,024
I think it should be Bbang Ji.

896
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:23,294
Let's play the fairest game...

897
00:30:23,295 --> 00:30:24,824
in the world.

898
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,265
- What is it? - Rock-paper-scissors.

899
00:30:27,235 --> 00:30:29,364
- I see. - Rock-paper-scissors?

900
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:31,975
I like the Bbang Ji logic, though.

901
00:30:32,335 --> 00:30:34,534
Why do we have to play rock-paper-scissors?

902
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:35,574
But the thing is,

903
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:37,944
- you have to think this through. - Yes?

904
00:30:37,945 --> 00:30:40,275
I could just not cooperate with you.

905
00:30:40,915 --> 00:30:43,144
- I see. - So let's all get along.

906
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:44,185
Well, in that case,

907
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,784
even though this is about teamwork,

908
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:48,984
let's hear from the bread expert.

909
00:30:48,985 --> 00:30:50,084
The bread expert?

910
00:30:50,085 --> 00:30:51,384
Okay, the bread expert can choose...

911
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:52,855
- who goes first. - Who goes first?

912
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:55,594
- She's the queen of desserts. - She's the leading expert.

913
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:56,595
Yes.

914
00:30:57,425 --> 00:30:59,394
Choosing who to go first is...

915
00:30:59,395 --> 00:31:01,135
If you choose me, I won't cooperate either.

916
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:04,834
(Yu Jin made the first move.)

917
00:31:04,835 --> 00:31:06,404
(She put up a good defense.)

918
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:07,435
Then...

919
00:31:09,005 --> 00:31:10,374
- Young Ji should go first. - Me?

920
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:11,444
Okay.

921
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:12,944
- You sure about that? - Yes.

922
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:15,044
- We'll succeed. - Sure, all right.

923
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,084
We'll succeed.

924
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:17,614
- Guys, let's succeed. - Sure.

925
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:19,684
But you have to promise.

926
00:31:19,685 --> 00:31:20,954
- Promise what? - You have to spare my life.

927
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:22,554
- Of course. - Of course. No matter what.

928
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:23,654
We'll save you no matter what.

929
00:31:23,655 --> 00:31:24,754
- Let's do our best. - Okay.

930
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:26,071
- Do your best. - We'll do our best.

931
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:28,354
- This is Young Ji's round. - Yes.

932
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:29,894
- The picture will be on the screen. - Why am I going first?

933
00:31:29,895 --> 00:31:30,964
Gosh.

934
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:32,995
(Young Ji's round)

935
00:31:33,365 --> 00:31:34,594
- I'm ready. - Shall we begin?

936
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:36,264
- Yes. - Bring in the first bread.

937
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:37,304
- Bring it in. - Gosh, the pressure.

938
00:31:37,305 --> 00:31:38,404
I'm nervous.

939
00:31:38,405 --> 00:31:39,974
My future is in your hands.

940
00:31:39,975 --> 00:31:41,274
- This feels like "Squid Game." - Please...

941
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:42,304
- I'm so nervous. - Please...

942
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:43,545
This is driving me insane.

943
00:31:44,205 --> 00:31:45,445
Look at how big the plates are.

944
00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:46,774
Look at how big the plates are.

945
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:48,245
(She was just the messenger.)

946
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:50,545
(Amazed)

947
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:53,185
I'm so nervous.

948
00:31:53,585 --> 00:31:54,885
Ready?

949
00:31:55,155 --> 00:31:56,285
Lee Eun Ji.

950
00:31:57,655 --> 00:31:58,655
Do I have to open it?

951
00:31:58,656 --> 00:31:59,816
- It's a war of nerves. - No.

952
00:32:00,255 --> 00:32:01,824
It's been so long.

953
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:03,124
- Gosh, Eun Ji. Hold on. - Goodness.

954
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,294
- I'm so nervous. - Wait.

955
00:32:05,295 --> 00:32:06,394
- All right. Let's begin. - All right.

956
00:32:06,395 --> 00:32:07,594
Guess the type of bread.

957
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:09,505
Young Ji's fate depends on this round.

958
00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:11,264
Will she dress up as a spy...

959
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,604
or a sophomore of Sinseo High School?

960
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:13,634
Let's go with spy, guys.

961
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:15,035
- Let's go with spy. - Let's begin.

962
00:32:16,445 --> 00:32:17,445
One, two, three.

963
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:19,074
- One, two, three. - Salted butter roll.

964
00:32:19,075 --> 00:32:20,075
Correct.

965
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:21,984
One, two, three.

966
00:32:21,985 --> 00:32:23,084
- Soboro bun. - Correct.

967
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:24,114
- One, two, three. - Brownie.

968
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:25,115
Correct.

969
00:32:25,116 --> 00:32:26,284
One, two, three.

970
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:27,454
- Chinese flower bun! - Wrong!

971
00:32:27,455 --> 00:32:29,684
(She's just chanting "Chinese flower bun.")

972
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:31,024
- No, let's check the video. - It's correct.

973
00:32:31,025 --> 00:32:32,694
- Check the video. - That was so close.

974
00:32:32,695 --> 00:32:33,695
One, two, three.

975
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:37,425
(- Chinese flower bun! - Wrong!)

976
00:32:37,595 --> 00:32:39,994
(Yu Jin was the tiniest bit faster.)

977
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:41,134
- Just this once. - Okay, I'll let you have this.

978
00:32:41,135 --> 00:32:42,264
It was a buzzer-beater.

979
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:43,634
It's me!

980
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:45,404
- No more from now on, though. - It's me!

981
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:47,105
- Let's go. You ready? - It's me, okay?

982
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:48,334
You ready?

983
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:49,745
All right. One, two, three.

984
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:50,845
- Hardtack. - Correct.
One, two, three.

985
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:52,945
- Clow-jam. - Wrong.

986
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:55,115
- One, two, three. - Clow-jam.

987
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,714
(Frozen)

988
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:58,915
That's a palmier carre.

989
00:32:59,015 --> 00:33:02,385
(That's a palmier carre.)

990
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:05,224
(Hung like laundry)

991
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:06,394
- Do you know what this is? - It's a palmier carre.

992
00:33:06,395 --> 00:33:07,755
Palmier carre.

993
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:09,501
- It's hard to think of the name. - But...

994
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:10,824
- Palmier carre. - we did all right.

995
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:11,894
We did well.

996
00:33:11,895 --> 00:33:13,534
- Yes, for a practice round. - No.

997
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:15,334
- We did well, right? - She's...

998
00:33:15,335 --> 00:33:16,855
- Young Ji, I'm sorry. - Lee Young Ji.

999
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:18,434
Lee Young Ji, a sophomore at Sinseo High School.

1000
00:33:18,435 --> 00:33:19,435
Congratulations.

1001
00:33:23,645 --> 00:33:25,914
(She has to go back to being the Lee Young Ji...)

1002
00:33:25,915 --> 00:33:27,244
(of Sinseo High School.)

1003
00:33:27,245 --> 00:33:29,285
(Lee Young Ji: Past self)

1004
00:33:29,345 --> 00:33:30,784
This is so hard.

1005
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:32,514
This is so hard. Guessing the bread.

1006
00:33:32,515 --> 00:33:33,814
Gosh, this was...

1007
00:33:33,815 --> 00:33:35,484
- The Chinese flower bun. - Wait.

1008
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:36,654
Wait. Hold on a second.

1009
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:38,615
So if this were "Squid Game," I'd be dead, right?

1010
00:33:38,955 --> 00:33:41,225
- If... Then... - Bang.

1011
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:42,594
You're Sinseo High School Young Ji.

1012
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:43,864
- But I have to keep playing... - Yes.

1013
00:33:43,865 --> 00:33:44,924
- to help the others. - Right.

1014
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:46,034
Why would I be selfless like that?

1015
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:48,365
Akh Young Ji!

1016
00:33:48,565 --> 00:33:50,065
- Akh! - Akh Young Ji!

1017
00:33:50,805 --> 00:33:52,204
- All right. - Akh Young Ji!

1018
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:54,775
Whose fate will you decide next?

1019
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:56,274
Can I choose?

1020
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:57,674
- Since I'm dead. - Young Ji, you choose.

1021
00:33:57,675 --> 00:33:59,444
- Akh Young Ji! - Akh.

1022
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:02,185
There's someone whose eyesight I want to improve.

1023
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:07,585
(It's not us.)

1024
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:10,785
I want to improve dear Yu Jin's vision to 9.0.

1025
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,955
I choose Akh Yu Jin.

1026
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:15,565
- Yes. - Akh Yu Jin.

1027
00:34:15,865 --> 00:34:18,094
(Yu Jin's round)

1028
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:19,234
- Shall we? - Yes.

1029
00:34:19,235 --> 00:34:21,535
- I really want to dress up. - She wants to dress up.

1030
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:22,934
- It's been a while. - You did dress up.

1031
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,235
You're wearing layers.

1032
00:34:24,765 --> 00:34:26,334
- And look at that Mickey Mouse. - Yu Jin, you're...

1033
00:34:26,335 --> 00:34:28,474
Yu Jin, don't limit yourself.

1034
00:34:28,475 --> 00:34:30,604
- Right. - I won't limit myself.

1035
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:32,545
- Don't limit yourself. - We got this, E-cade.

1036
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:34,714
Let's do the chant.

1037
00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:35,715
One, two, three.

1038
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:36,915
- E-cade. - E-cade.

1039
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:39,084
Yu Jin's fate depends on this round.

1040
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:40,085
- Let's see. - Gosh, I'm...

1041
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:42,484
- I feel at ease now. - All right.

1042
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:43,584
You know that's better for playing games, right?

1043
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:44,655
- Yes. - Of course.

1044
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:46,595
- Ready? - We got this.

1045
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:49,125
Yu Jin's fate depends on this round.

1046
00:34:49,395 --> 00:34:52,535
Will she return to elementary school or will she become a senior spy?

1047
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:54,135
First bread. We'll quicken the pace.

1048
00:34:55,465 --> 00:34:57,805
- One, two, three. Wrong! - What's... Gook Jin Bbang.

1049
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:00,735
Wrong!

1050
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,374
(Yu Jin burst out laughing.)

1051
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:04,405
- Hey, what is this? - Gook Jin Bbang?

1052
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:05,675
Hey.

1053
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:09,044
(Yu Jin is trying to not face her reality.)

1054
00:35:09,045 --> 00:35:12,115
What was that? Hey.

1055
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:14,554
- What was that? - Gook Jin Bbang?

1056
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:15,725
- Yu Jin. - Gook Jin Bbang?

1057
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,154
Yu Jin, it was...

1058
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:19,524
- It's a muffin. - This is...

1059
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:21,054
- What is this? - Yu Jin!

1060
00:35:21,055 --> 00:35:22,424
- Yu Jin. - Yu Jin.

1061
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:23,425
Yu Jin!

1062
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:24,664
(Dream: Elementary school teacher, Motto: Don't limit yourself.)

1063
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,585
- We'll all end up as our pasts. - Isn't this...

1064
00:35:26,765 --> 00:35:28,094
We'll all end up being our past selves.

1065
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:31,005
Isn't this broccoli?

1066
00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:33,604
- Hey. - This shape is too oval...

1067
00:35:33,605 --> 00:35:34,634
compared to regular muffins.

1068
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,044
You're right. I was startled when I saw it too.

1069
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:37,544
Muffins are normally round.

1070
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:39,445
Yu Jin, is this a mushroom or a broccoli?

1071
00:35:43,985 --> 00:35:47,585
(Yu Jin has to go back to being an elementary school student.)

1072
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:49,585
(An Yu Jin: Past self)

1073
00:35:51,055 --> 00:35:53,324
- What's wrong with you guys? - I don't know.

1074
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:55,155
- Eun Ji. - This isn't a survival show.

1075
00:35:55,895 --> 00:35:57,925
All right. Yu Jin is determined to get revenge.

1076
00:35:58,165 --> 00:35:59,165
She's determined to get revenge.

1077
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:00,834
- Lee Eun Ji. - I'm sorry.

1078
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:02,364
Change that to Eun Ji's picture.

1079
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:03,964
- It's Eun Ji's turn now. - Up next is...

1080
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:05,551
You'll still try your best, right, Yu Jin?

1081
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:07,875
(We'll see.)

1082
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:09,745
Yu Jin.

1083
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:11,404
You have to do your best.

1084
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:13,514
(Why should I?)

1085
00:36:13,515 --> 00:36:15,445
Don't limit yourself.

1086
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:20,054
(Eun Ji is showing her an example of how not to limit oneself.)

1087
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:21,554
Eun Ji, do this.

1088
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:23,025
(Pretending to not see)

1089
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,984
Don't limit yourself.

1090
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:26,071
(Elementary School Yu Jin and "Star King" Eun Ji)

1091
00:36:26,095 --> 00:36:27,455
(Yu Jin couldn't help but laugh.)

1092
00:36:27,595 --> 00:36:29,194
(You have to do your best since I made you laugh.)

1093
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:30,525
What do we do?

1094
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:32,735
(Eun Ji's round)

1095
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:35,435
I feel so confident, now that Yu Jin is dead with me.

1096
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:37,334
Let's still try our best.

1097
00:36:37,335 --> 00:36:38,504
- Let's do this. - Of course.

1098
00:36:38,505 --> 00:36:39,505
But...

1099
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:40,734
I don't think I should be the first person to guess.

1100
00:36:40,735 --> 00:36:42,274
- Do you want to switch? - This is the most nerve-racking.

1101
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:43,744
It's because you see that it's a muffin, but...

1102
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:45,044
I really don't think I'll get it right.

1103
00:36:45,045 --> 00:36:46,574
Trying to think of the name so abruptly is hard.

1104
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:47,645
You can't.

1105
00:36:47,745 --> 00:36:50,445
I feel like only Eun Ji wearing a suit will be funny too.

1106
00:36:50,545 --> 00:36:51,944
I feel like we'll succeed this round.

1107
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:53,014
- I think so too. - Okay.

1108
00:36:53,015 --> 00:36:54,884
I think we'll succeed.

1109
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:55,885
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1110
00:36:55,886 --> 00:36:57,354
We'll begin with Mimi, the bread expert.

1111
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:58,584
- Okay. - But we'll speed things up.

1112
00:36:58,585 --> 00:36:59,654
"One, two, three." Like that.

1113
00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:00,855
- Gosh. You scared me. - Okay.

1114
00:37:01,025 --> 00:37:03,095
Will Eun Ji return to her "Star King" days,

1115
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:05,135
or will she become a spy? Let's find out.

1116
00:37:07,095 --> 00:37:09,175
- One, two, three. - Baguette. Baguette with garlic.

1117
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:11,364
- Correct. You get a warning. - Correct.

1118
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:13,104
- Gosh, Mimi. - You get a warning for that.

1119
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,534
- Correct. - Mimi.

1120
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:16,044
- Baguette. Baguette with garlic. - Baguette. Baguette with garlic.

1121
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:17,944
- Baguette. Baguette with garlic. - You made it work.

1122
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:20,175
- That's her strategy. - She's a rapper.

1123
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:22,315
Here we go. I won't let things slide from now on.

1124
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:25,584
- One, two, three. - Egg tart.

1125
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:27,184
- Correct. One, two, three. - Carrot cake.

1126
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:28,755
One, two... Wait. Correct.

1127
00:37:29,085 --> 00:37:31,255
Goodness.

1128
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:32,994
One, two, three.

1129
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:34,275
- Correct. Goodness. - Goodness.

1130
00:37:34,855 --> 00:37:36,194
- One, two, three. - Gukhwa bread.

1131
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:37,195
- Wrong! - She...

1132
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:39,865
(I decide my own fate.)

1133
00:37:40,035 --> 00:37:41,865
She did that on purpose.

1134
00:37:42,435 --> 00:37:43,464
- No, I didn't. - Isn't that delimanjoo?

1135
00:37:43,465 --> 00:37:45,035
- Yes, delimanjoo. - Delimanjoo.

1136
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:46,304
You didn't do that on purpose?

1137
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,534
- You really got that wrong? - Yes. This gukhwa bread...

1138
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:48,735
What is this?

1139
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,274
This is too hard.

1140
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:52,244
It's hard. I don't know delimanjoo.

1141
00:37:52,245 --> 00:37:54,645
I didn't have the money to buy delimanjoo back then.

1142
00:37:55,215 --> 00:37:57,215
When she was younger. When she was 21.

1143
00:37:57,645 --> 00:38:00,184
Whenever I was at subway stations,

1144
00:38:00,185 --> 00:38:02,154
- I could only smell them. - What are you...

1145
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,054
- You keep smelling it. - That's sad, Eun Ji.

1146
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:05,055
(Her story is sadder than we thought.)

1147
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,995
- You didn't bring enough. - Right.

1148
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:09,025
Producer Na. Brother Yeong Seok. Look.

1149
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,364
Have you ever bought...

1150
00:38:10,365 --> 00:38:12,065
- just two delimanjoo? - No, I haven't.

1151
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,865
How much would you sell two of these for?

1152
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:17,435
- Me? - I mean...

1153
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:19,334
Ten of these are usually sold for three dollars.

1154
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:20,705
- That's right. - So there...

1155
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:23,144
- Right. - should at least be ten of these...

1156
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:24,304
to be seen as delimanjoo!

1157
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:25,874
And honestly, we recognize delimanjoo...

1158
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:27,814
- by the paper bag. - That's right.

1159
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:29,584
- Wait. - We don't remember the bread.

1160
00:38:29,585 --> 00:38:32,884
You can't mistake delimanjoo as gukhwa bread, though.

1161
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:35,185
(Objection)

1162
00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:38,084
Gukhwa bread is round.

1163
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:39,525
Welcome to our world, Eun Ji.

1164
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:41,795
- Welcome. - I thought we'd succeed this time.

1165
00:38:46,495 --> 00:38:50,204
(Eun Ji has to return to her "Star King" days.)

1166
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:52,205
(Lee Eun Ji: Past self)

1167
00:38:52,605 --> 00:38:54,435
- Who's left? - Mi Hyun.

1168
00:38:54,975 --> 00:38:56,374
My throat feels dry.

1169
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,504
Do you want water?

1170
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,844
We've lost morale right away.

1171
00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:01,715
Three out of four have lost morale.

1172
00:39:02,415 --> 00:39:04,185
I'll just expect to go as my past self.

1173
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:06,614
Thinking like that...

1174
00:39:06,615 --> 00:39:08,114
- could lead you to success. - You'll do even better.

1175
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:09,655
I'm suddenly so disappointed.

1176
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:10,955
Our girls are so pretty.

1177
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:13,094
- Then... - Then don't make us do this.

1178
00:39:13,095 --> 00:39:14,555
You shouldn't make us do this.

1179
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:15,665
What?

1180
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:16,825
- Then... - Yes?

1181
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:19,065
If Mimi succeeds, we should all...

1182
00:39:19,165 --> 00:39:20,865
- What? - That's a good idea.

1183
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:22,264
Now that I think about it,

1184
00:39:22,265 --> 00:39:23,304
- we are one team. - How about dressing up together?

1185
00:39:23,305 --> 00:39:24,765
- So... - We're one team.

1186
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:26,025
Let us all dress up together.

1187
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:28,534
What do we get in return?

1188
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:29,644
Right.

1189
00:39:29,645 --> 00:39:30,905
- Hey. - Wait, we...

1190
00:39:31,445 --> 00:39:32,875
- Withdraw. - Withdraw?

1191
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:34,074
- We're too unaffected right now. - Right.

1192
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:35,574
- What should we do? - We're not nervous at all.

1193
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:37,184
- Yes? - If you catch Torong,

1194
00:39:37,185 --> 00:39:38,544
we were thinking of giving you...

1195
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:40,284
- a reward worth 1,000 dollars. - Yes.

1196
00:39:40,285 --> 00:39:42,054
Remember how you...

1197
00:39:42,055 --> 00:39:43,184
- took your mom to that hotel... - Yes.

1198
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:44,801
- and how you went on that trip? - Right.

1199
00:39:44,825 --> 00:39:48,225
So can we cut the amount to 100 dollars?

1200
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:50,101
Wearing a suit just to win 100 dollars? I'm against it.

1201
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,594
Me too. I'll just dress up like that...

1202
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:53,634
- and win 1,000 dollars. - Me too. I want the 1,000 dollars.

1203
00:39:53,635 --> 00:39:55,264
Or we can do this. If we win this round,

1204
00:39:55,265 --> 00:39:56,841
- we get to play the game again. - It's either this or nothing.

1205
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:58,264
Two will receive the original 1,000 dollars.

1206
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:00,604
- The other two, 100 dollars. - Okay, I think that's fair.

1207
00:40:00,605 --> 00:40:01,605
- Sounds good. - Let's shake on it.

1208
00:40:01,606 --> 00:40:03,674
- Let's shake on it, Akh. - We'll decide who will receive...

1209
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:05,474
- what amount later. - Okay, Akh.

1210
00:40:05,475 --> 00:40:06,744
- Akh. - We'll decide that later.

1211
00:40:06,745 --> 00:40:07,774
- Akh. - Akh.

1212
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:09,484
- Akh Yeong Seok. - Akh at three. One, two, three.

1213
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:10,485
- Akh. - Akh.

1214
00:40:10,486 --> 00:40:12,284
(If they succeed, they all get to dress up as spies.)

1215
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,885
(If they fail, they all have to return as their past selves.)

1216
00:40:14,985 --> 00:40:16,484
- This is the last round. - Cloud bread.

1217
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:17,984
I think they'll show us a twisted donut.

1218
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:18,985
- Twisted donut? - I think so.

1219
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:20,655
Twisted donut, hotteok.

1220
00:40:21,355 --> 00:40:22,365
Fish-shaped bun.

1221
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:24,194
- I noticed that if you discuss... - Is cheesecake bread?

1222
00:40:24,195 --> 00:40:25,524
For a long time, you always get the first one wrong.

1223
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:26,934
- That's not true. - No.

1224
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:28,635
Don't mess with our pace.

1225
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:31,605
- Please. - No!

1226
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:33,505
- Egg bread. - Egg bread.

1227
00:40:34,235 --> 00:40:36,345
- Sliced bread. - I'm nervous.

1228
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,545
I feel super nervous.

1229
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:39,114
- I'm suddenly... - If you succeed,

1230
00:40:39,115 --> 00:40:40,875
- everyone will dress up as spies. - Right.

1231
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:42,075
Let's begin.

1232
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:46,155
- One, two, three. - Mammoth bread.

1233
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:47,215
Correct.

1234
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:49,924
- One, two, three. - Egg bread!

1235
00:40:49,925 --> 00:40:52,284
- Correct. - Don't rush yourself.

1236
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:53,755
- One, two, three. - Madeleine.

1237
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:55,965
- That was so good. - Gosh.

1238
00:40:56,295 --> 00:40:58,024
- You did great. - What am I going to do?

1239
00:40:58,025 --> 00:40:59,394
- You got this. - You caught me by surprise too.

1240
00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:00,734
- What am I going to do? - You got this.

1241
00:41:00,735 --> 00:41:02,434
- You got this. Stay calm. - What am I going to do?

1242
00:41:02,435 --> 00:41:03,804
- You got this. - Stay calm.

1243
00:41:03,805 --> 00:41:04,834
You can do this.

1244
00:41:04,835 --> 00:41:05,874
- I'm so nervous. - You got madeleine right.

1245
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:06,875
- Guys. - I'm like "Yumeiro Patissiere."

1246
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:08,374
Guys, give me your good luck.

1247
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,704
- You got this. - Stay calm. Be unaffected.

1248
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:11,844
- Empty your mind. - Just be smooth.

1249
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,285
- Be smooth. - No one's rushing you.

1250
00:41:16,445 --> 00:41:17,714
(The second time bread launched out)

1251
00:41:17,715 --> 00:41:19,115
- One, two, three. - Steamed bun.

1252
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,485
- Correct. - Why?

1253
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:24,555
She got it right. Correct.

1254
00:41:25,355 --> 00:41:26,654
- I'm sorry. - We're going to speed it up.

1255
00:41:26,655 --> 00:41:28,124
- Steamed bun. - We're going to speed it up.

1256
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,125
- Steamed bun. - Slow down.

1257
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:31,126
We're going to speed it up starting with Young Ji.

1258
00:41:31,795 --> 00:41:33,934
One, two, three. Wrong!

1259
00:41:33,935 --> 00:41:36,364
- What is this? - It's a scone!

1260
00:41:36,365 --> 00:41:37,365
- Wrong! - What is this?

1261
00:41:37,366 --> 00:41:40,875
It's a scone!

1262
00:41:41,105 --> 00:41:43,145
- What is this? - It's a scone!

1263
00:41:43,275 --> 00:41:44,574
- I'll be honest with you. - It's a scone.

1264
00:41:44,575 --> 00:41:46,191
Getting madeleine right was the best I could do.

1265
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:47,474
- I used all my knowledge on that. - This is...

1266
00:41:47,475 --> 00:41:48,874
- This is too small. - I really did use all my knowledge.

1267
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:52,115
This looks like a turtle shell. What is this?

1268
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:54,284
Just one more.

1269
00:41:54,285 --> 00:41:55,514
- Please. - Please, just one more.

1270
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:56,754
- Please. - Gosh, please.

1271
00:41:56,755 --> 00:41:58,285
- We'll perform for you. - Please.

1272
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:00,595
(An unexpected performance!)

1273
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:02,895
(Cleaning the crumbs from the turtle shell)

1274
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:06,435
(Dancing desperately for another chance)

1275
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:09,485
(This is already their fifth performance of the day.)

1276
00:42:13,205 --> 00:42:15,845
(Come in, come in, come in to another world)

1277
00:42:15,945 --> 00:42:18,474
(The youngest leaves as the eldest returns.)

1278
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:19,475
I'm so exhausted.

1279
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:24,784
(They added moves that weren't part of the original performance.)

1280
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:25,785
- Let's go. Now let's... - Now let's...

1281
00:42:25,786 --> 00:42:27,585
(Eun MINZY)

1282
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:29,224
(Half-way split)

1283
00:42:29,225 --> 00:42:31,785
(Dreaming about another chance)

1284
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:36,495
(They're putting on a performance no one asked for.)

1285
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:38,565
(Using props)

1286
00:42:38,665 --> 00:42:40,295
(A never-before-seen formation)

1287
00:42:40,395 --> 00:42:42,341
(There's no way Yu Jin would miss the highlight dance move.)

1288
00:42:42,365 --> 00:42:44,564
(Shouting)

1289
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:46,405
(Eun Ji isn't being punished.)

1290
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:49,405
(They have nothing to lose.)

1291
00:42:50,105 --> 00:42:51,405
- Young Ji, let's go! - Right!

1292
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,215
(It's as if she's testing their dynamic visual acuity.)

1293
00:42:54,315 --> 00:42:55,375
(Performance over)

1294
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:56,944
- Just one more chance. - Just one more chance.

1295
00:42:56,945 --> 00:42:58,514
You watched our performance.

1296
00:42:58,515 --> 00:43:01,155
All right, then.

1297
00:43:01,485 --> 00:43:03,724
The condition is that you all get 100 dollars each.

1298
00:43:03,725 --> 00:43:06,695
We might not work hard to catch Torong, then.

1299
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:09,895
That means we won't have a show.

1300
00:43:11,595 --> 00:43:12,764
(We're here to film for our show.)

1301
00:43:12,765 --> 00:43:16,365
We'll catch Torong...

1302
00:43:16,665 --> 00:43:17,864
and each get 100 dollars.

1303
00:43:17,865 --> 00:43:18,865
- Sounds good. - All right.

1304
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:19,875
Let's do this.

1305
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:21,004
(They get to play another round.)

1306
00:43:21,005 --> 00:43:22,651
(The reward for catching Torong is now 100 dollars each.)

1307
00:43:22,675 --> 00:43:24,144
- All right. - We got this.

1308
00:43:24,145 --> 00:43:25,405
- Let's do a shout. - Let's go.

1309
00:43:25,545 --> 00:43:26,545
Ready, go.

1310
00:43:26,546 --> 00:43:28,015
- E-cade. - E-cade.

1311
00:43:28,215 --> 00:43:29,414
- Thank you. - You each paid 900 dollars...

1312
00:43:29,415 --> 00:43:30,814
to play this round.

1313
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:32,484
I'm totally fine with that.

1314
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:33,654
- The money wasn't with us anyway. - You realize that, right?

1315
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:35,791
- We didn't have it anyway. - We didn't have it anyway.

1316
00:43:35,815 --> 00:43:36,954
We didn't own that money.

1317
00:43:36,955 --> 00:43:38,995
- We're earning 100 dollars now. - I've no regrets.

1318
00:43:39,455 --> 00:43:40,625
Starting with Mimi.

1319
00:43:40,855 --> 00:43:41,925
Wait.

1320
00:43:44,025 --> 00:43:45,294
- One, two, three. - Fish-shaped bun.

1321
00:43:45,295 --> 00:43:46,495
- Correct. - That's crazy.

1322
00:43:46,995 --> 00:43:49,405
- One, two, three. - Blueberry cream cheese toast.

1323
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,264
- What's this? - She's right.

1324
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:52,805
Blueberry cream cheese toast.

1325
00:43:53,335 --> 00:43:54,674
- What's this? - She's right.

1326
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:55,974
It's blueberry cream cheese toast.

1327
00:43:55,975 --> 00:43:57,674
- Seriously, what's this? - It is.

1328
00:43:57,675 --> 00:43:58,874
- Blueberry cream cheese toast. - This is...

1329
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:00,921
- You said it so... - It's blueberry cream cheese toast.

1330
00:44:00,945 --> 00:44:02,884
- Is it not? It's toast... - What is this?

1331
00:44:02,885 --> 00:44:04,961
- with cream cheese and blueberries. - It was a meme from last time.

1332
00:44:04,985 --> 00:44:06,415
Do you know what this is?

1333
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:09,054
I know it as blueberry cream cheese toast.

1334
00:44:09,055 --> 00:44:10,484
I also call it blueberry cream cheese toast.

1335
00:44:10,485 --> 00:44:11,884
- It's blueberry cream cheese toast. - Hold on.

1336
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:13,024
- You... - I know what it's called.

1337
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,924
- Hold on. - It's blueberry cream cheese toast.

1338
00:44:14,925 --> 00:44:16,495
- Mimi is the only one... - Mimi.

1339
00:44:16,665 --> 00:44:18,594
- You know what it is. - It's blueberry cream cheese toast.

1340
00:44:18,595 --> 00:44:20,134
Your conscience.

1341
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:21,564
No, she doesn't have a conscience.

1342
00:44:21,565 --> 00:44:23,705
- Mimi. - I've sold mine away long ago.

1343
00:44:24,235 --> 00:44:26,104
I have no conscience.

1344
00:44:26,105 --> 00:44:27,804
- I have no strength. - What did I get wrong?

1345
00:44:27,805 --> 00:44:29,374
- There are blueberries. - That's right.

1346
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,904
- And there's cream cheese. - Don't you know what pastry it is?

1347
00:44:30,905 --> 00:44:32,504
- It's blueberry cream cheese toast. - You know what it is, Mimi.

1348
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:33,944
- This is... - It's blueberry cream cheese toast.

1349
00:44:33,945 --> 00:44:35,874
Isn't it about the breakup thing?

1350
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,114
- It's called... - You see?

1351
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:38,591
- blueberry cream cheese toast. - See? You know it.

1352
00:44:38,615 --> 00:44:41,255
(The answer we wanted)

1353
00:44:41,455 --> 00:44:43,184
(It originates from an internet post that went viral.)

1354
00:44:43,185 --> 00:44:45,085
(I asked my ex-boyfriend for the recipe.)

1355
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:47,325
(Ex-boyfriend toast)

1356
00:44:47,455 --> 00:44:50,325
(It came to be known as "ex-boyfriend toast" because...)

1357
00:44:50,395 --> 00:44:52,494
- See? - Yes, someone broke up...

1358
00:44:52,495 --> 00:44:53,564
with their boyfriend,

1359
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,634
- and they asked for the recipe... - Yes, the recipe.

1360
00:44:54,635 --> 00:44:56,204
Of this blueberry cream cheese toast.

1361
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:57,804
- Yes, blueberry cream cheese toast. - It's blueberry cream cheese toast.

1362
00:44:57,805 --> 00:44:59,834
It's not sold at a restaurant or bakery.

1363
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:01,734
- You can make this yourself. - A random person made it.

1364
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:03,104
Anyone can make it.

1365
00:45:03,105 --> 00:45:05,874
A layperson made this.

1366
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,774
- Yes. Long and short names... - This...

1367
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:09,444
A layperson...

1368
00:45:09,445 --> 00:45:10,445
(She's at a loss for words.)

1369
00:45:10,446 --> 00:45:11,544
Then...

1370
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:12,884
Who sells this?

1371
00:45:12,885 --> 00:45:16,125
Did Kim Sam Soon make this?

1372
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:17,554
(Fainting)

1373
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:19,594
- What is this? - What is this?

1374
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:20,895
What is this, Yu Jin?

1375
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:23,194
- The story behind this... - So what is it?

1376
00:45:23,195 --> 00:45:24,841
If you get it right, I'll count it as a correct answer.

1377
00:45:24,865 --> 00:45:25,995
Ex-boyfriend toast.

1378
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,595
See? You knew!

1379
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:30,305
(She knew but pretended she didn't.)

1380
00:45:30,465 --> 00:45:32,111
(She knew but insisted on the wrong answer.)

1381
00:45:32,135 --> 00:45:34,635
(Puppy An is happy that she got it correct.)

1382
00:45:35,035 --> 00:45:36,544
(And...)

1383
00:45:36,545 --> 00:45:37,705
- What? - You knew!

1384
00:45:39,005 --> 00:45:41,275
(She really didn't know.)

1385
00:45:41,315 --> 00:45:43,284
Hold on. Do people really call this...

1386
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:45,021
- "ex-boyfriend toast?" - You knew it all along.

1387
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:46,084
You didn't know?

1388
00:45:46,085 --> 00:45:47,854
- This... - People see a toast like this...

1389
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:50,085
and immediately goes, "It's ex-boyfriend toast?"

1390
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:52,154
Should I start an Instagram live stream right now...

1391
00:45:52,155 --> 00:45:53,425
and ask the viewers?

1392
00:45:53,895 --> 00:45:55,294
- Seriously? - Seriously.

1393
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:56,865
"What is this, guys?"

1394
00:45:57,065 --> 00:45:58,795
"Guess what this is."

1395
00:45:58,895 --> 00:46:00,934
- No. - Blueberry cream cheese toast?

1396
00:46:00,935 --> 00:46:03,835
No. It's ex-boyfriend toast.

1397
00:46:03,905 --> 00:46:05,504
(True madness)

1398
00:46:05,505 --> 00:46:08,205
It's called "ex-boyfriend" toast when it doesn't have one on it.

1399
00:46:08,775 --> 00:46:10,104
What should I do?

1400
00:46:10,105 --> 00:46:13,045
And I as well...

1401
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:15,674
I didn't think of ex-boyfriend toast after seeing this.

1402
00:46:15,675 --> 00:46:17,484
- Eun Ji mentioned a boyfriend. - Yes, she told the story.

1403
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:19,814
If that was the answer you wanted, instead of the toast,

1404
00:46:19,815 --> 00:46:21,331
you should've printed out the internet post.

1405
00:46:21,355 --> 00:46:22,584
- Yes. - She's right.

1406
00:46:22,585 --> 00:46:24,754
Do you know that guy? Do you know his name?

1407
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:26,554
Do you know if he lives in Pangyo...

1408
00:46:26,555 --> 00:46:30,024
or Cheongna International City?

1409
00:46:30,025 --> 00:46:31,665
We don't.

1410
00:46:32,265 --> 00:46:33,865
Okay, fine.

1411
00:46:34,595 --> 00:46:36,234
She very clearly said...

1412
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:38,904
- blueberry cream cheese toast, - That's right.

1413
00:46:38,905 --> 00:46:40,311
- so we'll accept it. - She's smart.

1414
00:46:40,335 --> 00:46:41,605
She got the ingredients right.

1415
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:42,904
I need to get back to the right mindset.

1416
00:46:42,905 --> 00:46:44,474
- Yes, let's get back. - Focus.

1417
00:46:44,475 --> 00:46:45,804
You'll get the third one wrong right away anyway.

1418
00:46:45,805 --> 00:46:47,474
- No, you won't. - You won't.

1419
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:48,544
Focus.

1420
00:46:48,545 --> 00:46:49,785
(Resuming with Young Ji)

1421
00:46:50,245 --> 00:46:51,715
Name the pastry.

1422
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:54,715
- One, two, three. - Croissant.

1423
00:46:54,785 --> 00:46:55,785
Correct.

1424
00:46:55,786 --> 00:46:57,254
- Wait. - You can do it.

1425
00:46:57,255 --> 00:46:58,655
I need to mentally prepare myself.

1426
00:46:58,785 --> 00:46:59,955
Protect your player.

1427
00:47:01,295 --> 00:47:03,095
- One, two, three. Correct. - Croongji.

1428
00:47:03,495 --> 00:47:04,795
- Croongji. - Correct.

1429
00:47:05,425 --> 00:47:06,734
- One, two, three. - Walnut pastry!

1430
00:47:06,735 --> 00:47:07,735
Correct!

1431
00:47:07,736 --> 00:47:08,994
- One, two, three! - Tiramisu!

1432
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:10,005
Correct!

1433
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:13,135
(If Mimi gets it correct, they succeed this round.)

1434
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:15,085
- One, two, three! - Makgeolli bread.

1435
00:47:16,645 --> 00:47:18,845
(They successfully complete the round trip.)

1436
00:47:21,645 --> 00:47:22,885
- Earth Arcade. - Earth Arcade.

1437
00:47:22,945 --> 00:47:24,485
(They start their sixth performance.)

1438
00:47:24,615 --> 00:47:26,555
(The youngest moves to the back.)

1439
00:47:26,755 --> 00:47:29,755
(Doing their best in their respective positions)

1440
00:47:29,825 --> 00:47:31,625
Ex-boyfriend toast.

1441
00:47:35,595 --> 00:47:37,865
- That was fun. - I'm so tired.

1442
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:39,764
It was the most intense game I've done recently.

1443
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:40,934
It was so tough.

1444
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:42,634
Congratulations, guys.

1445
00:47:42,635 --> 00:47:44,211
- You get to wear the spy outfit. - Thank you.

1446
00:47:44,235 --> 00:47:46,174
- Mimi. - We get to...

1447
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,634
(They each get 100 dollars when they catch Torong.)

1448
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:48,635
Nice.

1449
00:47:48,636 --> 00:47:50,244
Let's say "akh" to each other.

1450
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:52,021
- One, two, three. Akh. - One, two, three. Akh.

1451
00:47:52,045 --> 00:47:53,045
Nice.

1452
00:47:53,075 --> 00:47:54,715
(A few days later)

1453
00:47:55,015 --> 00:47:57,145
(They're supposed to meet up in their spy outfits.)

1454
00:47:58,185 --> 00:48:00,355
(The agents' secret meeting place)

1455
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:04,485
(This dark and secretive place)

1456
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:07,625
(Jade Emperor's Agent Training Center, Hakdong Station Branch)

1457
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:09,454
(Only the agents who pass the facial recognition...)

1458
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:11,195
(and thumb prints scanning...)

1459
00:48:11,525 --> 00:48:14,395
(have access to the secret place.)

1460
00:48:16,365 --> 00:48:19,005
(Filling up one side of the investigation board...)

1461
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:22,104
(is Torong's past actions...)

1462
00:48:22,105 --> 00:48:23,844
(and new information about his identity.)

1463
00:48:23,845 --> 00:48:24,974
(Ok Armstorong, Date of birth, May 1, 1999)

1464
00:48:24,975 --> 00:48:26,004
(Occupation: Space Rice Cake Shop's part-timer)

1465
00:48:26,005 --> 00:48:27,591
(Crime: Ran away with the corporate card)

1466
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:30,215
(Who is the first agent to arrive...)

1467
00:48:30,745 --> 00:48:33,255
(in their spy outfit?)

1468
00:48:38,985 --> 00:48:41,195
(Agent Lee Young Ji)

1469
00:48:42,095 --> 00:48:44,395
(First time seeing Young Ji in a neat outfit)

1470
00:48:45,365 --> 00:48:47,265
(But her actions are nothing like it.)

1471
00:48:48,565 --> 00:48:51,665
(She tries to play the role seriously.)

1472
00:48:55,775 --> 00:48:57,074
You're supposed to be cool this time.

1473
00:48:57,075 --> 00:48:58,405
I am cool right now.

1474
00:48:59,275 --> 00:49:01,845
(What she aspires to be is quite different from what she is.)

1475
00:49:05,545 --> 00:49:07,085
Look straight ahead.

1476
00:49:10,255 --> 00:49:12,925
(Agent Lee Young Ji identified)

1477
00:49:14,195 --> 00:49:15,195
(Throwing)

1478
00:49:15,555 --> 00:49:18,695
(After a powerful performance of removing her gloves, )

1479
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,935
(she passes the 2nd thumbprint scanning.)

1480
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:29,645
(She enters with the spotlight.)

1481
00:49:30,275 --> 00:49:33,115
(She becomes an electric eel.)

1482
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:35,075
- Hello. - Hi.

1483
00:49:35,145 --> 00:49:36,175
Agent Young Ji.

1484
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,295
Congratulations on your arrival.

1485
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:39,615
My gosh.

1486
00:49:39,885 --> 00:49:41,915
(She's still not used to the way agents speak.)

1487
00:49:42,385 --> 00:49:44,285
(Someone is here.)

1488
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:48,525
(At that time, the second agent is approaching.)

1489
00:49:49,665 --> 00:49:52,465
(Agent Kim Mi Hyun)

1490
00:49:52,495 --> 00:49:53,535
Goodness.

1491
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:55,595
Hello.

1492
00:49:57,165 --> 00:49:59,235
(She retreats to the opposite side.)

1493
00:50:00,905 --> 00:50:02,375
(Greeting)

1494
00:50:02,775 --> 00:50:05,105
(She is a polite spy.)

1495
00:50:06,845 --> 00:50:08,774
(She greets everyone that passes by, )

1496
00:50:08,775 --> 00:50:10,685
(but she tiptoes in front of the door.)

1497
00:50:10,985 --> 00:50:12,685
Look straight ahead.

1498
00:50:15,785 --> 00:50:18,555
(Agent Kim Mi Hyun identified)

1499
00:50:19,795 --> 00:50:21,795
I can hear her.

1500
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:22,895
I'm a bit worried.

1501
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:23,965
That startled me!

1502
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:26,934
(She can't remove her gloves.)

1503
00:50:26,935 --> 00:50:29,935
Removing the gloves is a bit uncool.

1504
00:50:30,905 --> 00:50:33,405
(But she enters in a cool way!)

1505
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:36,135
(She swipes at the wall for no reason.)

1506
00:50:37,105 --> 00:50:39,405
(Merging with "The Matrix")

1507
00:50:40,115 --> 00:50:41,715
(Only kind people can see the bullets.)

1508
00:50:42,045 --> 00:50:44,345
Roger that. Copy.

1509
00:50:44,945 --> 00:50:46,115
Copy.

1510
00:50:46,985 --> 00:50:49,415
(Mikachu)

1511
00:50:53,255 --> 00:50:55,755
(They're in spy outfits but act like Earth Arcade kids.)

1512
00:50:55,795 --> 00:50:57,394
- Hello. - You look cool today.

1513
00:50:57,395 --> 00:50:58,971
(Mimi styled herself with a leather jacket.)

1514
00:50:58,995 --> 00:51:00,364
We're both wearing gloves.

1515
00:51:00,365 --> 00:51:02,165
Aren't these for an eating show?

1516
00:51:02,265 --> 00:51:04,035
Aren't these latex gloves for eating shows?

1517
00:51:04,265 --> 00:51:05,365
Seriously.

1518
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:06,735
They are latex gloves.

1519
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,175
They're cool.

1520
00:51:08,205 --> 00:51:10,704
- It's cool. I didn't have gloves. - Look at my gloves.

1521
00:51:10,705 --> 00:51:12,775
- Yours are cool. - They look fine, don't they?

1522
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:15,615
(The next person to arrive is...)

1523
00:51:16,585 --> 00:51:19,185
(Agent Lee Eun Ji.)

1524
00:51:20,555 --> 00:51:23,224
(She is not a parking attendant.)

1525
00:51:23,225 --> 00:51:26,185
(She is not a dancer either.)

1526
00:51:26,655 --> 00:51:27,925
You're not one of the staff.

1527
00:51:28,855 --> 00:51:33,895
(She is just an agent who is engrossed in her role.)

1528
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:36,605
It opened.

1529
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:38,905
- Goodness. - It's awkward.

1530
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:41,175
Someone is here. I should wear my sunglasses.

1531
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:44,195
(An elegant figure approaches while spinning her umbrella.)

1532
00:51:46,615 --> 00:51:48,691
(An elementary school kid you often see on a playground)

1533
00:51:48,715 --> 00:51:51,155
(Another elementary school kid you often see on a playground)

1534
00:51:52,415 --> 00:51:54,014
Manners maketh...

1535
00:51:54,015 --> 00:51:55,815
Girls, open the door for me.

1536
00:51:55,915 --> 00:51:59,055
Manners maketh man.

1537
00:52:00,055 --> 00:52:01,495
(Threatening her with latex gloves)

1538
00:52:02,095 --> 00:52:03,165
Who are you?

1539
00:52:03,565 --> 00:52:04,665
It's me.

1540
00:52:04,865 --> 00:52:06,764
- Don't you remember? - Say the secret code.

1541
00:52:06,765 --> 00:52:08,245
- The secret code? - The secret code.

1542
00:52:08,635 --> 00:52:09,665
Akh.

1543
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:11,635
- Akh. - Akh.

1544
00:52:12,405 --> 00:52:13,434
(She says the word like it's her mother tongue.)

1545
00:52:13,435 --> 00:52:15,235
Is that the correct secret code?

1546
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:17,074
- Is it? Akh? - It is for now.

1547
00:52:17,075 --> 00:52:18,674
- Really? - Checking the identity.

1548
00:52:18,675 --> 00:52:20,615
Fellow agent, Lee Eun Ji.

1549
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:22,544
Nothing here.

1550
00:52:22,545 --> 00:52:23,785
- You pass. - Hold on.

1551
00:52:23,845 --> 00:52:27,484
Why did you grab my bottom twice?

1552
00:52:27,485 --> 00:52:29,514
Is that your way of checking?

1553
00:52:29,515 --> 00:52:31,025
- Twice. - Arms apart!

1554
00:52:31,255 --> 00:52:32,554
- Akh. - Akh.

1555
00:52:32,555 --> 00:52:34,071
(They quickly finish checking her identity.)

1556
00:52:34,095 --> 00:52:36,194
You look a bit like a Department of History professor...

1557
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:37,694
at the University of Oxford.

1558
00:52:37,695 --> 00:52:39,665
(Eun Ji wore a striped suit like "Kingsman.")

1559
00:52:39,765 --> 00:52:41,464
- You have a bit of... - "You Quiz on the Block."

1560
00:52:41,465 --> 00:52:43,105
the commissioner general vibe.

1561
00:52:43,835 --> 00:52:45,805
You two team up in "The Roundup."

1562
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:48,134
You two team up to catch me.

1563
00:52:48,135 --> 00:52:50,904
And you know, the commissioner general goes,

1564
00:52:50,905 --> 00:52:52,044
"Come on, dude!"

1565
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:53,645
"Don't address me so casually."

1566
00:52:54,115 --> 00:52:55,414
- Yes. - You know what I mean, right?

1567
00:52:55,415 --> 00:52:57,014
And they always hit someone in the back with this.

1568
00:52:57,015 --> 00:52:58,884
- Hello, commissioner general, sir. - Hello.

1569
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:01,014
I told you to stop investigating and get off that case!

1570
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:02,455
I'm sorry, but it had to be done.

1571
00:53:03,185 --> 00:53:04,684
(The three agents are getting addicted to role playing.)

1572
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:05,755
Salute.

1573
00:53:06,185 --> 00:53:08,825
(Someone is approaching, unaware of what is happening.)

1574
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:12,065
(Hissing)

1575
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:14,695
(Hissing)

1576
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,805
(She is already solo role playing.)

1577
00:53:17,465 --> 00:53:19,905
(Agent An Yu Jin)

1578
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:21,934
(They are still ongoing with their role playing.)

1579
00:53:21,935 --> 00:53:23,344
I have something to tell you.

1580
00:53:23,345 --> 00:53:24,975
- Stop. - I have to tell you this.

1581
00:53:25,345 --> 00:53:26,715
- Get out. - Sir.

1582
00:53:26,945 --> 00:53:28,915
Must we report this to the commissioner general?

1583
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,314
"Must we?"

1584
00:53:30,315 --> 00:53:31,814
- What do you mean? - An Yu Jin of Ssangmun-dong.

1585
00:53:31,815 --> 00:53:33,535
Must we report that we failed to catch her?

1586
00:53:33,615 --> 00:53:35,154
Stop talking outside and...

1587
00:53:35,155 --> 00:53:36,525
Someone is here.

1588
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:41,724
(User number)

1589
00:53:41,725 --> 00:53:43,995
(Agent An Yu Jin identified)

1590
00:53:45,725 --> 00:53:48,134
(She gets closer with light, big strides.)

1591
00:53:48,135 --> 00:53:49,415
She is scanning her thumbprints.

1592
00:53:51,205 --> 00:53:52,335
(Right finger)

1593
00:53:53,435 --> 00:53:54,435
(Left finger)

1594
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:57,275
- Her thumbprints aren't recognized. - She can't open the door.

1595
00:53:58,075 --> 00:54:00,155
(She carefully puts her thumb on the scanner again.)

1596
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:02,245
Are you an agent? Who are you?

1597
00:54:02,915 --> 00:54:04,685
- Identify yourselves. - Who are you?

1598
00:54:05,945 --> 00:54:07,255
Say the secret code.

1599
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:13,155
E-cade?

1600
00:54:14,525 --> 00:54:17,695
(They're merciless to those who get it wrong.)

1601
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:19,365
Say the code again.

1602
00:54:19,665 --> 00:54:20,795
That was the wrong code.

1603
00:54:22,235 --> 00:54:23,835
(I'll give you a hint.)

1604
00:54:24,805 --> 00:54:25,935
Don't you remember?

1605
00:54:26,105 --> 00:54:27,134
Don't you remember?

1606
00:54:27,135 --> 00:54:28,974
"Brother" in Arabic.

1607
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:30,744
- Don't you remember? - One, two, three.

1608
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:32,004
- Akh. - Akh.

1609
00:54:32,005 --> 00:54:33,575
(Akh!)

1610
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:35,114
(Her body remembers her loyalty to her brother.)

1611
00:54:35,115 --> 00:54:36,144
- Good job. - Akh.

1612
00:54:36,145 --> 00:54:38,244
- Good job. Akh. - Akh.

1613
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:39,384
Our secret code...

1614
00:54:39,385 --> 00:54:40,785
- is Akh. - Akh.

1615
00:54:41,155 --> 00:54:42,354
- Akh. - Say hi...

1616
00:54:42,355 --> 00:54:43,625
to the commissioner general.

1617
00:54:43,955 --> 00:54:45,585
- Akh. - Nice to meet you.

1618
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:47,524
You're the rookie that just joined.

1619
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:49,325
- Nice to meet you. - I'm your direct senior.

1620
00:54:49,425 --> 00:54:51,195
- I'm Lee Young Chul. - Lee Young Chul?

1621
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:54,035
I like that name, Lee Young Chul.

1622
00:54:54,235 --> 00:54:55,364
Nice to meet you, Lee Young Chul.

1623
00:54:55,365 --> 00:54:56,635
Hello, Akh.

1624
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,834
- Nice to meet you. - Give me a name too.

1625
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:00,004
How about An Yu Myung, as in "not famous?"

1626
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,734
- How about An Yu Myung? - An Yu Myung.

1627
00:55:01,735 --> 00:55:02,804
- An Yu Myung. - But you're famous.

1628
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:03,974
You're not famous. An Yu Myung.

1629
00:55:03,975 --> 00:55:05,375
- An Yu Myung. - An Yu Myung.

1630
00:55:05,445 --> 00:55:06,844
- Lee Young Chul. - It sounds like a detective's name.

1631
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:07,874
- An Yu Myung. - An Yu Myung.

1632
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:08,914
- Lee Young Chul. - Lee Young Chul.

1633
00:55:08,915 --> 00:55:10,044
- And she is Kim Mi... - What am I?

1634
00:55:10,045 --> 00:55:11,715
- Kim Mi Jeong. - Kim...

1635
00:55:11,845 --> 00:55:13,525
- Kim Mi Kwan! How is that? - Sounds good.

1636
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,115
- Kim Mi Kwan. - Come on.

1637
00:55:15,155 --> 00:55:16,755
- My name... - I came up with your name.

1638
00:55:16,885 --> 00:55:18,754
- I came up with your name. - Mine?

1639
00:55:18,755 --> 00:55:19,785
Lee Yong Su.

1640
00:55:20,895 --> 00:55:22,895
- Isn't that a name from "I'm Solo?" - What?

1641
00:55:22,995 --> 00:55:23,995
(Agent Lee Eun Ji)

1642
00:55:23,996 --> 00:55:25,994
(Code name, Lee Yong Su)

1643
00:55:25,995 --> 00:55:26,995
(Agent Kim Mi Hyun)

1644
00:55:26,996 --> 00:55:28,894
(Code name, Kim Mi Kwan)

1645
00:55:28,895 --> 00:55:29,895
(Agent Lee Young Ji)

1646
00:55:29,896 --> 00:55:31,464
(Code name, Lee Young Chul)

1647
00:55:31,465 --> 00:55:32,465
(Agent An Yu Jin)

1648
00:55:32,466 --> 00:55:34,175
(Code name, An Yu Myung)

1649
00:55:35,235 --> 00:55:39,274
(They all disguise as agents.)

1650
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:41,615
- What's wrong? - There's something I'm upset about.

1651
00:55:42,275 --> 00:55:45,314
Is this already our third time coming together for the show?

1652
00:55:45,315 --> 00:55:47,395
It is our 3rd time and 4 years of seeing each other.

1653
00:55:47,485 --> 00:55:49,354
- It's been 4 years. - Maybe because it's been 4 years.

1654
00:55:49,355 --> 00:55:50,524
Now, even when I doll up,

1655
00:55:50,525 --> 00:55:52,485
nobody says I'm pretty.

1656
00:55:52,685 --> 00:55:54,025
That can't be helped.

1657
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,824
- Why can't it be helped, Young Ji? - My goodness.

1658
00:55:55,825 --> 00:55:57,871
The more you look at something, the more you get used to it.

1659
00:55:57,895 --> 00:55:59,194
Young Ji, do you remember what you said...

1660
00:55:59,195 --> 00:56:00,294
when you met me for the first time?

1661
00:56:00,295 --> 00:56:01,564
- That you're pretty. - That I'm exceptionally beautiful.

1662
00:56:01,565 --> 00:56:02,805
You're exceptionally beautiful.

1663
00:56:03,565 --> 00:56:04,864
Am I not exceptionally beautiful today?

1664
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:05,905
(Sassy)

1665
00:56:06,065 --> 00:56:07,474
- You look so pretty today. - As expected...

1666
00:56:07,475 --> 00:56:08,604
- You look pretty. - of the first batch of graduates...

1667
00:56:08,605 --> 00:56:09,734
from the intelligence agent academy.

1668
00:56:09,735 --> 00:56:11,421
- Exactly. - Is that what you're going with?

1669
00:56:11,445 --> 00:56:12,604
Dean.

1670
00:56:12,605 --> 00:56:14,645
- Dean. - I'm the first batch.

1671
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:17,084
You're the 2nd batch, and you're 3rd and 4th.

1672
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:18,615
- Dean. - Why am I the fourth batch?

1673
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:20,054
Are you guys from the same batch?

1674
00:56:20,055 --> 00:56:22,154
No... No, we're not.

1675
00:56:22,155 --> 00:56:23,425
She is my junior.

1676
00:56:23,585 --> 00:56:25,124
- Are you sure? - Very sure.

1677
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:26,454
- Okay. - Shouldn't we figure out...

1678
00:56:26,455 --> 00:56:29,354
by undergoing a competence test?

1679
00:56:29,355 --> 00:56:30,365
Good.

1680
00:56:30,695 --> 00:56:34,264
(I accept your challenge.)

1681
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,394
Wait. Why do your gloves...

1682
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:37,081
cover just half of your hand when you're an agent?

1683
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:38,535
I didn't have enough funds.

1684
00:56:40,675 --> 00:56:42,134
(She makes up for it with her flashy hand gestures.)

1685
00:56:42,135 --> 00:56:43,175
Nice to meet you.

1686
00:56:43,205 --> 00:56:44,775
- Akh. - Akh.

1687
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:46,815
- Akh. - Akh.

1688
00:56:47,015 --> 00:56:49,575
- The reason you're gathered here. - Akh.

1689
00:56:49,815 --> 00:56:51,215
- Torong... - That punk.

1690
00:56:51,385 --> 00:56:53,244
Ran away with the corporate card.

1691
00:56:53,245 --> 00:56:54,255
To where?

1692
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:56,725
- To Abu Dhabi. - Abu Dhabi.

1693
00:56:57,085 --> 00:56:59,254
We don't have the evidence,

1694
00:56:59,255 --> 00:57:00,694
but we have two hints.

1695
00:57:00,695 --> 00:57:01,954
- First. - First.

1696
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:04,124
- First. - Someone will aid you in Abu Dhabi.

1697
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:05,624
It's Agent F.

1698
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:07,135
- Agent F. - Agent F.

1699
00:57:07,495 --> 00:57:09,234
- And second. - Second.

1700
00:57:09,235 --> 00:57:10,365
- Thankfully, - Thankfully?

1701
00:57:10,535 --> 00:57:13,104
The corporate card Jade Emperor lost...

1702
00:57:13,105 --> 00:57:14,105
The card?

1703
00:57:15,805 --> 00:57:17,705
Sends transaction messages to his phone.

1704
00:57:18,305 --> 00:57:20,074
Of course it should. This is the 21st century.

1705
00:57:20,075 --> 00:57:21,244
- Is it? - Yes.

1706
00:57:21,245 --> 00:57:24,585
So you get the phone linked to that card.

1707
00:57:25,185 --> 00:57:26,754
- Thank you. - You're even giving us a phone?

1708
00:57:26,755 --> 00:57:28,084
Here is the phone.

1709
00:57:28,085 --> 00:57:29,525
- Thank you. - Commissioner general.

1710
00:57:29,555 --> 00:57:30,555
- Commissioner general, if you will. - Keep it with you.
- Akh. - Akh.

1711
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:33,731
- Check the transaction records. - Commissioner General Lee Yong Su.

1712
00:57:33,755 --> 00:57:35,025
- Akh. - Transaction records.

1713
00:57:35,255 --> 00:57:36,424
You really look like a commissioner general.

1714
00:57:36,425 --> 00:57:38,065
Are we spies or what?

1715
00:57:39,595 --> 00:57:41,694
Are we spies or the police?

1716
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:42,964
We're agents.

1717
00:57:42,965 --> 00:57:44,004
- Agents? - Agents.

1718
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:45,734
First, let's take a selfie.

1719
00:57:45,735 --> 00:57:46,775
A selfie.

1720
00:57:49,135 --> 00:57:50,144
What is this?

1721
00:57:50,145 --> 00:57:51,451
(Jade Emperor's phone has good selfie camera.)

1722
00:57:51,475 --> 00:57:53,074
Commissioner general, check the record quickly.

1723
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:54,214
- I will. - Will you?

1724
00:57:54,215 --> 00:57:55,215
What's this?

1725
00:57:55,216 --> 00:57:56,314
- "Space Card." - "Space Card."

1726
00:57:56,315 --> 00:57:57,414
Space Card?

1727
00:57:57,415 --> 00:57:59,585
"Overseas transaction, Tiger Woozoo."

1728
00:58:00,285 --> 00:58:02,885
(Corporate card transaction history sent to Jade Emperor's phone)

1729
00:58:03,885 --> 00:58:07,354
(Torong used the card so often.)

1730
00:58:07,355 --> 00:58:09,254
"Emirates Palace."

1731
00:58:09,255 --> 00:58:11,064
- How much is that? - "Emirates Palace."

1732
00:58:11,065 --> 00:58:12,424
- How much is it? - Based on the current currency.

1733
00:58:12,425 --> 00:58:13,494
- It says 85. - What's the currency now?

1734
00:58:13,495 --> 00:58:15,765
- It's 85. Hold on. - It's 85.

1735
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:19,205
- Hold on. - It's 85.

1736
00:58:19,935 --> 00:58:21,235
(Holding it far away)

1737
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:22,935
She's good.

1738
00:58:23,175 --> 00:58:24,675
She's so good.

1739
00:58:24,975 --> 00:58:26,045
Hello?

1740
00:58:26,775 --> 00:58:29,144
I'm here. You know...

1741
00:58:29,145 --> 00:58:30,644
(Come back to your real self.)

1742
00:58:30,645 --> 00:58:32,784
Is this baht or... How do you read it?

1743
00:58:32,785 --> 00:58:34,584
United Arab Emirates dirham.

1744
00:58:34,585 --> 00:58:35,684
- Rudiham? - Dirham.

1745
00:58:35,685 --> 00:58:36,854
- Dirham. - Dirham.

1746
00:58:36,855 --> 00:58:38,384
- Check the currency. - I'll look it up.

1747
00:58:38,385 --> 00:58:39,524
- Check the currency. - How much is it?

1748
00:58:39,525 --> 00:58:41,424
It says 85 dirham.

1749
00:58:41,425 --> 00:58:42,624
- This... - Eighty-five dirham.

1750
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:43,794
Then it's about 30 dollars.

1751
00:58:43,795 --> 00:58:45,124
- What did he spend it on? - Yes, 33 dollars.

1752
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,464
- Yes. - He used 30 dollars here.

1753
00:58:46,465 --> 00:58:49,065
Look over there. Recently, he's into desserts.

1754
00:58:49,495 --> 00:58:50,775
Maybe he bought Dubai chocolate.

1755
00:58:51,535 --> 00:58:54,175
(Torong's personal information written on the investigation board)

1756
00:58:54,235 --> 00:58:55,334
(One thing stands out.)

1757
00:58:55,335 --> 00:58:56,855
(Note, he got into desserts recently.)

1758
00:58:56,975 --> 00:58:58,875
(He went around Abu Dhabi...)

1759
00:58:59,345 --> 00:59:02,014
(and used the corporate card to eat desserts.)

1760
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:06,085
Thankfully, Agent F checked the transaction history...

1761
00:59:06,645 --> 00:59:07,754
and visited those places in advance.

1762
00:59:07,755 --> 00:59:09,414
- He ate something like this. - What's that?

1763
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:10,554
- Potato jeon? - What's that?

1764
00:59:10,555 --> 00:59:12,084
It's cheese kunafa.

1765
00:59:12,085 --> 00:59:13,124
Cheese kunafa.

1766
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:14,845
- It looks delicious. - It looks delicious.

1767
00:59:15,095 --> 00:59:16,755
(It looks like potato jeon, )

1768
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:18,824
(but it's the Middle East's representative dessert...)

1769
00:59:18,825 --> 00:59:20,141
(and has the perfect balance of sweetness and saltiness.)

1770
00:59:20,165 --> 00:59:21,364
(Space Card, overseas transaction, Tiger Woozoo, corporate card 0511)

1771
00:59:21,365 --> 00:59:22,694
(He paid with the corporate card.)

1772
00:59:22,695 --> 00:59:24,804
- Second, he bought Dubai chocolate. - Dubai chocolate.

1773
00:59:24,805 --> 00:59:25,865
Dubai chocolate.

1774
00:59:26,705 --> 00:59:28,981
(Space Card, overseas transaction, Tiger Woozoo, corporate card 0511)

1775
00:59:29,005 --> 00:59:31,004
(It tastes sweeter since I didn't buy it with my money.)

1776
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:33,444
What did he eat at Emirates Palace?

1777
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:34,845
- What did he eat? - Upon checking,

1778
00:59:35,045 --> 00:59:36,765
he drank coffee sprinkled with gold powder.

1779
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,245
Gold powder...

1780
00:59:38,515 --> 00:59:40,791
(Space Card, overseas transaction, Tiger Woozoo, corporate card 0511)

1781
00:59:40,815 --> 00:59:42,715
(Decorating the coffee...)

1782
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:45,125
(is a pile of gold powder.)

1783
00:59:46,285 --> 00:59:49,025
(Decorating his fur with gold using the corporate money)

1784
00:59:49,255 --> 00:59:51,065
Our mission is to fly to Abu Dhabi quickly,

1785
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:53,165
meet Agent F,

1786
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:55,464
and apprehend Torong.

1787
00:59:55,465 --> 00:59:57,005
- Our mission, akh. - That's nice.

1788
00:59:57,405 --> 00:59:59,534
- Can we get going now? - Yes.

1789
00:59:59,535 --> 01:00:02,004
- Akh. - You can head straight to the UAE.

1790
01:00:02,005 --> 01:00:03,175
- Okay. - You can,

1791
01:00:03,305 --> 01:00:04,805
- but before you leave... - Before?

1792
01:00:05,045 --> 01:00:06,944
- Not again. - Not again.

1793
01:00:06,945 --> 01:00:08,815
(Habitually becoming suspicious)

1794
01:00:09,475 --> 01:00:11,314
- We need to verify... - We...

1795
01:00:11,315 --> 01:00:13,114
if you are competent agents.

1796
01:00:13,115 --> 01:00:14,484
How are you going to verify that?

1797
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,484
An agent should have a lot of qualities.

1798
01:00:16,485 --> 01:00:17,554
- That's right. - Agent An Yu Jin.

1799
01:00:17,555 --> 01:00:19,001
- What qualities does one need? - Goodness.

1800
01:00:19,025 --> 01:00:20,084
Name one.

1801
01:00:20,085 --> 01:00:21,195
- Yu Jin. - Yes.

1802
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:22,525
- Yu Jin. - Yes.

1803
01:00:22,755 --> 01:00:23,895
- Yu Jin. - Yes.

1804
01:00:24,195 --> 01:00:25,365
- Yu Jin. - Yes.

1805
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,335
- Yu Jin. - Remove the "An."

1806
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:29,965
- I'm sorry. - How many years has it been now?

1807
01:00:30,465 --> 01:00:32,204
- Because of you, - That's right.

1808
01:00:32,205 --> 01:00:33,365
Everywhere I go...

1809
01:00:33,605 --> 01:00:36,104
- Agent Yu Jin. - Yes.

1810
01:00:36,105 --> 01:00:38,774
What are some qualities an agent should have?

1811
01:00:38,775 --> 01:00:40,614
- Name one. - Reflexes.

1812
01:00:40,615 --> 01:00:41,875
- Reflexes. - Reflexes.

1813
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:43,844
- One must be rich. - Rich.

1814
01:00:43,845 --> 01:00:44,945
- Wealth. - That's right.

1815
01:00:45,715 --> 01:00:47,384
- Reflexes, wealth, riches... - Riches. Reflexes.

1816
01:00:47,385 --> 01:00:48,454
- Next. - You need stuff like that.

1817
01:00:48,455 --> 01:00:49,985
However, we don't think so.

1818
01:00:50,485 --> 01:00:51,854
We think...

1819
01:00:51,855 --> 01:00:55,255
one of the most important qualities of an agent is...

1820
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:58,495
There might be a car chase.

1821
01:00:59,065 --> 01:01:02,535
(A car chase, an act of chasing while driving cars)

1822
01:01:03,735 --> 01:01:07,235
(There is always a car chase in every spy movie.)

1823
01:01:08,405 --> 01:01:11,075
(A car chase)

1824
01:01:11,345 --> 01:01:12,644
- Driving license? - A car chase?

1825
01:01:12,645 --> 01:01:14,075
- I don't have one. - Still?

1826
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:15,615
- Still? - What?

1827
01:01:15,845 --> 01:01:17,185
- Still? - But...

1828
01:01:17,345 --> 01:01:18,384
- You still don't have it? - But...

1829
01:01:18,385 --> 01:01:19,385
- Why? - You still don't have it?

1830
01:01:19,386 --> 01:01:20,414
Why not?

1831
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:22,114
You said you were going to get Class 1 license.

1832
01:01:22,115 --> 01:01:23,835
This is the last month I can take the test.

1833
01:01:23,925 --> 01:01:25,484
If I don't pass in March, I have to start all over again.

1834
01:01:25,485 --> 01:01:27,324
- I have to restart the process. - From the written test?

1835
01:01:27,325 --> 01:01:28,494
- From the written test. - No way.

1836
01:01:28,495 --> 01:01:29,924
- What should we do? - It's okay.

1837
01:01:29,925 --> 01:01:32,064
One out of you four can give it a go.

1838
01:01:32,065 --> 01:01:33,165
Thank goodness.

1839
01:01:33,395 --> 01:01:35,935
(They must pick a driver among themselves.)

1840
01:01:37,005 --> 01:01:38,605
(Candidate 1, An Yu Myung)

1841
01:01:38,935 --> 01:01:40,775
(Candidate 2, Lee Yong Su)

1842
01:01:41,005 --> 01:01:42,975
(Secretary Mimi)

1843
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:44,204
I have a question.

1844
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:46,244
- Out of the two drivers, - Yes.

1845
01:01:46,245 --> 01:01:48,674
Who thinks they've improved more?

1846
01:01:48,675 --> 01:01:50,174
When did you last drive recently?

1847
01:01:50,175 --> 01:01:51,484
Recently?

1848
01:01:51,485 --> 01:01:53,654
- Your recent driving history. - What date is it in February?

1849
01:01:53,655 --> 01:01:56,385
It's February 19.

1850
01:01:56,855 --> 01:01:59,225
The last time I drove was last August.

1851
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:01,554
- August last year? - Yes.

1852
01:02:01,555 --> 01:02:02,624
- Really? - Yes.

1853
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,395
- Really? - Last year.

1854
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:05,764
Can you not get yourself to like driving?

1855
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:08,135
I really wish I could just pull a cart.

1856
01:02:08,165 --> 01:02:09,564
- I really wish I could. - That's not a bad idea.

1857
01:02:09,565 --> 01:02:10,734
- I understand. - I'm not interested in driving.

1858
01:02:10,735 --> 01:02:12,704
- What about you, An Yu Myung? - For me, I drove once...

1859
01:02:12,705 --> 01:02:14,274
- this year. - Okay.

1860
01:02:14,275 --> 01:02:15,404
- Okay. - You'll do it.

1861
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:16,434
(She is selected right away.)

1862
01:02:16,435 --> 01:02:18,305
Let's go. It is...

1863
01:02:18,905 --> 01:02:20,944
the best type of agent...

1864
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,515
to test your driving skills.

1865
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:25,615
- It's a parking attendant. - A parking attendant.

1866
01:02:26,045 --> 01:02:27,645
- It is called... - A parking attendant?

1867
01:02:27,885 --> 01:02:29,684
It is called the parking attendant test.

1868
01:02:29,685 --> 01:02:31,224
- We'll start now. - Really?

1869
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:32,761
- A parking attendant test? - A parking attendant test?

1870
01:02:32,785 --> 01:02:34,794
(Parking Attendant Test)

1871
01:02:34,795 --> 01:02:36,124
To explain it in simple terms,

1872
01:02:36,125 --> 01:02:37,324
- What is it? - on the first floor...

1873
01:02:37,325 --> 01:02:38,964
- is the parking lot. - Yes, sir.

1874
01:02:38,965 --> 01:02:40,364
You will choose...

1875
01:02:40,365 --> 01:02:42,195
- one of the many cars there. - Yes.

1876
01:02:42,335 --> 01:02:44,364
You have to drive the car...

1877
01:02:44,365 --> 01:02:45,735
around this neighborhood...

1878
01:02:46,165 --> 01:02:48,505
as marked on the map.

1879
01:02:49,605 --> 01:02:51,475
There will be an empty space in the middle.

1880
01:02:51,745 --> 01:02:54,274
Park the car at the designated place and you're done.

1881
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:55,444
- You're done. - The problem is...

1882
01:02:55,445 --> 01:02:56,674
- The problem is? - The problem is...

1883
01:02:56,675 --> 01:02:57,915
where you'll be parking.

1884
01:02:58,115 --> 01:03:00,585
Whose cars are on each side of the parking slot?

1885
01:03:01,055 --> 01:03:04,385
(The cars on each side of the parking slot in question)

1886
01:03:06,855 --> 01:03:08,324
- Are they the CEO's car? - CEO Ko Joong Seok?

1887
01:03:08,325 --> 01:03:09,594
- Abu? - They're the cars...

1888
01:03:09,595 --> 01:03:10,624
of Rhee Myoung Han and Ko Joong Seok.

1889
01:03:10,625 --> 01:03:12,124
No!

1890
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:13,424
They're the cars of Rhee Myoung Han and Ko Joong Seok.

1891
01:03:13,425 --> 01:03:16,234
(They automatically start clapping.)

1892
01:03:16,235 --> 01:03:17,304
What if she crashes into one?

1893
01:03:17,305 --> 01:03:20,534
You must park between those two cars without scratching them...

1894
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:22,104
- But... - within the set time.

1895
01:03:22,105 --> 01:03:24,174
Why are you using CEO Rhee and CEO Ko's cars...

1896
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,604
for the show?

1897
01:03:25,605 --> 01:03:27,474
Wait a minute. Did you get their permission?

1898
01:03:27,475 --> 01:03:28,475
Are they okay with this?

1899
01:03:28,775 --> 01:03:31,784
(We are okay with this, Eun Ji.)

1900
01:03:31,785 --> 01:03:33,444
- Through this small test, - Yes?

1901
01:03:33,445 --> 01:03:34,615
Should you...

1902
01:03:34,715 --> 01:03:37,125
- pass the agent test, - Okay.

1903
01:03:37,225 --> 01:03:39,684
The prize money you lost while playing the bread game...

1904
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:42,054
The amount dropped from 1,000 dollars to 100, right?

1905
01:03:42,055 --> 01:03:43,055
Right.

1906
01:03:43,255 --> 01:03:44,624
I'll return it back to 1,000 dollars.

1907
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,794
- Yes! - Great!

1908
01:03:46,795 --> 01:03:47,994
- Good! - Good!

1909
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:50,865
- Abu Dhabi! - Abu Dhabi!

1910
01:03:51,605 --> 01:03:53,165
(Embarrassed)

1911
01:03:54,405 --> 01:03:56,234
Let's go up,

1912
01:03:56,235 --> 01:03:57,374
and I'll tell you which car it will be.

1913
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,405
- Akh! - Akh!

1914
01:03:58,705 --> 01:04:00,744
It's important what sort of a car we'll get.

1915
01:04:00,745 --> 01:04:02,675
That is the important question.

1916
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:05,544
Wait! What do you mean there are two things side by side?

1917
01:04:05,545 --> 01:04:06,545
What is this?

1918
01:04:06,546 --> 01:04:08,014
- On both sides? - I know.

1919
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:09,284
Everything's so flashy!

1920
01:04:09,285 --> 01:04:10,355
- It's not. - Hey!

1921
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:11,805
- Is that a MINI? - What's that?

1922
01:04:11,985 --> 01:04:14,895
(Each car model and color is completely different.)

1923
01:04:15,325 --> 01:04:17,624
First, I'll show you the two CEOs' cars.

1924
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:18,664
- Revealing the CEOs' cars. - CEOs' cars.

1925
01:04:18,665 --> 01:04:20,095
This is CEO Ko Joong Seok's car.

1926
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:21,664
- Yes. - It looks a bit like him.

1927
01:04:21,665 --> 01:04:23,765
- And that is... - He parked it here?

1928
01:04:24,505 --> 01:04:25,734
CEO Rhee Myoung Han's car.

1929
01:04:25,735 --> 01:04:27,474
- Recently, he has already... - He crashed it.

1930
01:04:27,475 --> 01:04:29,074
- Recently? - crashed it here.

1931
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:30,474
- Oh, my. - If that's the case...

1932
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:32,144
- It's crashed here. - While backing up.

1933
01:04:32,145 --> 01:04:33,721
- This is not our fault. - There's a scratch.

1934
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,444
- Please take a picture of this. - We need to do that in advance.

1935
01:04:35,445 --> 01:04:36,944
- Right. - Even when we're renting cars,

1936
01:04:36,945 --> 01:04:38,114
- we have to take pictures of this. - We can scratch it a little.

1937
01:04:38,115 --> 01:04:39,115
He has to repair it anyway.

1938
01:04:39,116 --> 01:04:40,361
You're all taking this seriously.

1939
01:04:40,385 --> 01:04:41,554
I have a question.

1940
01:04:41,555 --> 01:04:42,714
When did he last wash his car?

1941
01:04:42,715 --> 01:04:44,025
- I have no idea. - I see.

1942
01:04:44,225 --> 01:04:46,784
Now, among those four cars over there,

1943
01:04:46,785 --> 01:04:48,524
you'll choose one and take it for a drive.

1944
01:04:48,525 --> 01:04:49,924
- Go around the neighborhood once. - Okay.

1945
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:51,795
Come back and park it here in reverse.

1946
01:04:51,895 --> 01:04:54,295
We'll give you ten minutes including getting out of the car.

1947
01:04:55,135 --> 01:04:56,775
- If I were a car... - It's sticking out.

1948
01:04:58,635 --> 01:05:00,234
You have to park in reverse.

1949
01:05:00,235 --> 01:05:01,734
Then, turn the wheel slightly.

1950
01:05:01,735 --> 01:05:03,335
Back up like this here.

1951
01:05:04,075 --> 01:05:07,145
(It's a classy reverse, worthy of someone from " Vroom Vroom.")

1952
01:05:07,515 --> 01:05:08,744
- Beep, beep. - Like that.

1953
01:05:08,745 --> 01:05:10,345
- Right. - Perfectly done.

1954
01:05:10,685 --> 01:05:14,115
Is there one that you prefer among those four cars, Yu Jin?

1955
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:17,185
(We'll now introduce the cars one by one.)

1956
01:05:18,485 --> 01:05:20,795
(Car No. 1 Code: White Benz)

1957
01:05:21,225 --> 01:05:25,195
(Its long length and width make it intimidating for beginner drivers.)

1958
01:05:25,595 --> 01:05:28,365
(Difficulty is four stars.)

1959
01:05:29,135 --> 01:05:31,335
(Car No. 2 Code: Green MINI Cooper)

1960
01:05:31,835 --> 01:05:35,505
(True to its name, its compact size makes parking very easy.)

1961
01:05:36,235 --> 01:05:38,145
(Difficulty is one star.)

1962
01:05:38,945 --> 01:05:41,215
(Car No. 3 Code: Tesla)

1963
01:05:41,845 --> 01:05:45,915
(It may look easy at first, but operating it can be tricky.)

1964
01:05:46,745 --> 01:05:49,215
(Difficulty is three stars.)

1965
01:05:50,085 --> 01:05:52,685
(Car No. 4 Code: Black Defender)

1966
01:05:53,385 --> 01:05:55,955
(No matter which angle you look from, )

1967
01:05:56,155 --> 01:05:57,965
(it's massive!)

1968
01:05:58,165 --> 01:06:00,195
(Difficulty is seven stars.)

1969
01:06:00,295 --> 01:06:01,995
(However...)

1970
01:06:02,365 --> 01:06:03,365
I'm sorry.

1971
01:06:03,366 --> 01:06:07,874
But you don't get to choose the car you want to drive.

1972
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:12,705
You must use your agent-like mind-reading skills.

1973
01:06:12,945 --> 01:06:15,815
If you can guess the right owner of the car,

1974
01:06:15,945 --> 01:06:17,314
- you get to drive that car. - What is this?

1975
01:06:17,315 --> 01:06:18,384
Wait a minute.

1976
01:06:18,385 --> 01:06:20,654
So we have to guess whose car this is, right?

1977
01:06:20,655 --> 01:06:23,855
Now, I'll introduce the owners of these four cars.

1978
01:06:24,285 --> 01:06:25,925
- The first owner! - The first owner!

1979
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:28,145
Producer Shin Geon Jun, please come forward.

1980
01:06:28,425 --> 01:06:29,754
(Looking intently)

1981
01:06:29,755 --> 01:06:32,125
He has a face that looks like he'd be into Tesla.

1982
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:34,835
- I think he'd like Tesla. - Producer Shin.

1983
01:06:35,195 --> 01:06:37,604
Second owner is Writer Choi Jae Yeong.

1984
01:06:37,605 --> 01:06:38,605
- Okay. - Please come.

1985
01:06:38,606 --> 01:06:39,834
That's Writer Jae Yeong.

1986
01:06:39,835 --> 01:06:40,995
I think he's the Cooper type.

1987
01:06:42,305 --> 01:06:44,345
(The second owner is Writer Choi Jae Yeong.)

1988
01:06:44,575 --> 01:06:45,575
He owns a Cooper, right?

1989
01:06:45,576 --> 01:06:47,314
- I think he talked about it. - The car suits him.

1990
01:06:47,315 --> 01:06:49,315
The third car owner is...

1991
01:06:49,845 --> 01:06:51,244
Producer Jang Yo Han. Please come forward.

1992
01:06:51,245 --> 01:06:52,384
- He's our drama producer. - Producer Yo Han.

1993
01:06:52,385 --> 01:06:53,744
- Defender. - Producer Yo Han is...

1994
01:06:53,745 --> 01:06:54,914
- definitely a Defender guy. - Defender!

1995
01:06:54,915 --> 01:06:56,854
(The third owner is Produce Jang Yo Han.)

1996
01:06:56,855 --> 01:06:58,655
Producer Yo Han is definitely a Defender guy.

1997
01:06:58,785 --> 01:07:00,794
But who knows? He might actually be a Cooper guy.

1998
01:07:00,795 --> 01:07:02,625
But he kind of likes cute things too.

1999
01:07:04,065 --> 01:07:06,194
The fourth car owner is the Writer King.

2000
01:07:06,195 --> 01:07:07,315
- It's Lee Woo Jung. - Okay.

2001
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:09,365
- Hello. - Wait.

2002
01:07:09,465 --> 01:07:11,064
She's the Tesla type.

2003
01:07:11,065 --> 01:07:12,134
No, I don't think so.

2004
01:07:12,135 --> 01:07:14,275
I'm sorry, but what's with your shoes?

2005
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:15,375
What are those?

2006
01:07:15,376 --> 01:07:17,004
Were you cleaning the bathroom?

2007
01:07:17,005 --> 01:07:18,674
Wait, Woo Jung!

2008
01:07:18,675 --> 01:07:20,105
You came from filming "GBRB" right?

2009
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,321
- I was on the fourth floor. - You were?

2010
01:07:22,345 --> 01:07:25,014
So it's not just about picking the right car.

2011
01:07:25,015 --> 01:07:26,384
We have to pick the right person.

2012
01:07:26,385 --> 01:07:30,115
That's right. You have to guess the owner of the car properly.

2013
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:33,484
Yu Jin, which car do you want to drive?

2014
01:07:33,485 --> 01:07:35,124
First, the car I don't want to drive...

2015
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:36,125
- is this one. - I see.

2016
01:07:36,395 --> 01:07:38,224
- Because it's too big? - It's really too big.

2017
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:41,034
- That one? - It's bulky on the sides...

2018
01:07:41,035 --> 01:07:42,464
and also chunky front to back.

2019
01:07:42,465 --> 01:07:44,104
- But... - It was difficult to drive.

2020
01:07:44,105 --> 01:07:46,565
- Second. This car... - Yes?

2021
01:07:46,965 --> 01:07:50,074
Sometimes doesn't come with a rear-view camera.

2022
01:07:50,075 --> 01:07:51,374
- Really? - I see.

2023
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:52,974
- This brand? - Really? That happens?

2024
01:07:52,975 --> 01:07:55,074
I don't really know the car brand.

2025
01:07:55,075 --> 01:07:57,144
But I heard there are cars like that.

2026
01:07:57,145 --> 01:07:59,014
So you want to avoid the owner of this car too, right?

2027
01:07:59,015 --> 01:08:00,815
Yes, I can't park without a rear-view camera.

2028
01:08:00,955 --> 01:08:02,614
I agree, you can't park without a rear-view camera.

2029
01:08:02,615 --> 01:08:04,625
You can't do it without a rear-view camera?

2030
01:08:04,785 --> 01:08:05,954
Why? Is that a problem?

2031
01:08:05,955 --> 01:08:07,894
But she can still drive.

2032
01:08:07,895 --> 01:08:09,155
That's a great thing.

2033
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:10,825
So the car Yu Jin wants to drive is?

2034
01:08:10,925 --> 01:08:12,694
It's always nice to have smart features.

2035
01:08:12,695 --> 01:08:14,234
Honestly, Tesla would be the best.

2036
01:08:14,235 --> 01:08:16,464
Then, she just has to choose the right owner, right?

2037
01:08:16,465 --> 01:08:17,635
Please choose the owner.

2038
01:08:18,535 --> 01:08:21,075
(Yu Jin can get her hands on the Tesla she wants.)

2039
01:08:21,175 --> 01:08:23,175
(It begins now.)

2040
01:08:23,305 --> 01:08:25,844
The reason this car feels like it belongs to Woo Jung is...

2041
01:08:25,845 --> 01:08:26,845
It's because...

2042
01:08:26,846 --> 01:08:30,675
Wait, no! Maybe Jae Yeong owns the Defender.

2043
01:08:30,945 --> 01:08:33,285
(They have to guess all four car owners correctly.)

2044
01:08:33,445 --> 01:08:34,484
You can drive it then.

2045
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,814
Guys, the really lucky thing is...

2046
01:08:36,815 --> 01:08:39,485
The really lucky thing is that I know the owner of this car.

2047
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:40,825
This car?

2048
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,194
I know the owner of this car.

2049
01:08:42,195 --> 01:08:43,395
- Who is it? - Yes, who?

2050
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:46,195
(She knows which car belongs to the production team?)

2051
01:08:46,765 --> 01:08:48,294
Benz belongs to Woo Jung.

2052
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:49,295
I think so too.

2053
01:08:49,435 --> 01:08:50,564
(Eun Ji's Mind-Reading Skills)

2054
01:08:50,565 --> 01:08:52,605
(Benz belongs to Woo Jung.)

2055
01:08:52,865 --> 01:08:55,075
I think I saw the owner of this car...

2056
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:57,035
driving around Sangam-dong.

2057
01:08:57,105 --> 01:08:58,305
Actually driving this car?

2058
01:08:58,405 --> 01:09:00,074
- Yes. - Who is it?

2059
01:09:00,075 --> 01:09:02,615
And I went to this car owner's house to have drinks.

2060
01:09:03,445 --> 01:09:04,445
(Who is it?)

2061
01:09:04,446 --> 01:09:05,484
(Not me.)

2062
01:09:05,485 --> 01:09:07,184
(One person is especially nervous.)

2063
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:08,314
(Producer Geon Jun worked with Eun Ji on "Comedy Big League.")

2064
01:09:08,315 --> 01:09:09,384
(His wife and Eun Ji are close.)

2065
01:09:09,385 --> 01:09:11,325
I went to this car owner's house to have drinks.

2066
01:09:11,785 --> 01:09:12,954
(I got it!)

2067
01:09:12,955 --> 01:09:16,055
So, I know the owner of this car.

2068
01:09:16,655 --> 01:09:18,175
Yu Jin, do you want to avoid this car?

2069
01:09:18,595 --> 01:09:20,125
You want to avoid it, right?

2070
01:09:20,225 --> 01:09:21,745
Does your car have a rear-view camera?

2071
01:09:22,035 --> 01:09:23,941
- Does it have a rear-view camera? - We know what your car is.

2072
01:09:23,965 --> 01:09:25,434
Does it have a rear-view camera?

2073
01:09:25,435 --> 01:09:27,675
(Green MINI Cooper belongs to Geon Jun.)

2074
01:09:28,805 --> 01:09:32,345
I think these two cars belong to these two guys.

2075
01:09:32,805 --> 01:09:34,714
It's one of these two for sure.

2076
01:09:34,715 --> 01:09:36,074
Tesla belongs to one of them for sure.

2077
01:09:36,075 --> 01:09:37,075
Who is it?

2078
01:09:37,076 --> 01:09:38,915
(Who is really the owner of Tesla?)

2079
01:09:39,015 --> 01:09:41,284
Wait, this is what I think about Jae Yeong.

2080
01:09:41,285 --> 01:09:42,914
He's always so easygoing.

2081
01:09:42,915 --> 01:09:44,754
He talks like this. "Hey, guys."

2082
01:09:44,755 --> 01:09:47,084
But when he heads home, he gets in the Defender and goes...

2083
01:09:47,085 --> 01:09:48,354
Doesn't it totally seem like that?

2084
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:49,554
- That really makes sense. - Doesn't it?

2085
01:09:49,555 --> 01:09:50,964
It really makes sense.

2086
01:09:50,965 --> 01:09:52,595
I think Jae Yeong owns the Defender.

2087
01:09:52,725 --> 01:09:55,035
These kinds of cars...

2088
01:09:55,135 --> 01:09:57,964
are the dream cars of the people who go camping.

2089
01:09:57,965 --> 01:09:59,004
- You have a point. - Makes sense.

2090
01:09:59,005 --> 01:10:01,175
Jae Yeong loves to go camping.

2091
01:10:01,275 --> 01:10:03,235
Even your shoes look like camping shoes.

2092
01:10:03,935 --> 01:10:05,574
- You have a point. - That's sharp!

2093
01:10:05,575 --> 01:10:07,121
- You have a point. - That makes sense.

2094
01:10:07,145 --> 01:10:08,615
You love camping. Admit it!

2095
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:10,544
Commissioner general.

2096
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:12,284
I'm absolutely sure...

2097
01:10:12,285 --> 01:10:13,314
- Defender belongs to Jae Yeong. - You have a point.

2098
01:10:13,315 --> 01:10:15,114
- You have a point. - It's Jae Yeong.

2099
01:10:15,115 --> 01:10:16,984
Then, where's the evidence that...

2100
01:10:16,985 --> 01:10:18,385
Yo Han drives a Tesla?

2101
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:19,654
Where is it?

2102
01:10:19,655 --> 01:10:21,655
(Please show us, general.)

2103
01:10:21,955 --> 01:10:22,955
Where is it?

2104
01:10:22,956 --> 01:10:25,295
He looks a bit like Tesla.

2105
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:28,394
It all comes down to face reading?

2106
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:29,395
Not yet.

2107
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:31,064
(The final choice is Yo Han who has Tesla vibes.)

2108
01:10:31,065 --> 01:10:32,065
Now...

2109
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:34,405
(They head toward the Tesla owner that Eun Ji guessed.)

2110
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:37,035
(She lightly makes her way.)

2111
01:10:37,945 --> 01:10:39,745
I have a feeling Jae Yeong owns the Tesla.

2112
01:10:39,845 --> 01:10:41,675
No, he owns the Defender.

2113
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:44,544
(Teasing)

2114
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:47,854
She's such a tease.

2115
01:10:47,855 --> 01:10:49,885
(She never lets anything slide.)

2116
01:10:50,255 --> 01:10:51,955
(She is the same.)

2117
01:10:52,455 --> 01:10:55,495
(It felt endless, but finally, the performance comes to an end.)

2118
01:10:55,795 --> 01:10:57,495
- Please give me the key. - Okay!

2119
01:10:58,125 --> 01:10:59,825
(Your key, please.)

2120
01:10:59,965 --> 01:11:01,664
- Good. - She made her choice.

2121
01:11:01,665 --> 01:11:02,994
- Did she choose? - She did.

2122
01:11:02,995 --> 01:11:04,334
She asked for the key, so she made her choice.

2123
01:11:04,335 --> 01:11:06,635
Which car does Yo Han's key belong to?

2124
01:11:08,275 --> 01:11:09,875
Why? Is it Tesla?

2125
01:11:10,005 --> 01:11:11,305
- What is this? - Why?

2126
01:11:11,575 --> 01:11:13,545
(Why? Is it Tesla?)

2127
01:11:13,745 --> 01:11:15,045
What's his car, Yu Jin?

2128
01:11:15,075 --> 01:11:18,085
- It's Green MINI Cooper. - It's Green MINI Cooper.

2129
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:21,955
- It's Green MINI Cooper! - Cooper? Eun Ji, it's MINI Cooper.

2130
01:11:22,485 --> 01:11:24,384
- What's happening? - It's the Cooper.

2131
01:11:24,385 --> 01:11:25,901
- It's the Cooper. - Wasn't it Geon Jun's?

2132
01:11:25,925 --> 01:11:27,485
What on earth is happening?

2133
01:11:29,195 --> 01:11:31,124
(Yo Han's car turns out to be the Green MINI Cooper.)

2134
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:32,624
- Congratulations! - Are you okay with it?

2135
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:33,794
Didn't it belong to Geon Jun?

2136
01:11:33,795 --> 01:11:35,095
I thought it was his.

2137
01:11:35,265 --> 01:11:36,334
Geon Jun, isn't it yours?

2138
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:37,335
His car is Tesla.

2139
01:11:37,765 --> 01:11:39,265
(What?)

2140
01:11:39,565 --> 01:11:43,105
I told you he had the face of a Tesla!

2141
01:11:43,505 --> 01:11:46,205
Really! Nobody believes me.

2142
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:48,875
That's disappointing.

2143
01:11:49,275 --> 01:11:50,674
It doesn't matter. Don't worry.

2144
01:11:50,675 --> 01:11:51,684
Are you sure?

2145
01:11:51,685 --> 01:11:53,925
(They have selected the car. It has a rear-view camera.)

2146
01:11:54,615 --> 01:11:55,955
Shall I keep an eye on the back?

2147
01:11:56,185 --> 01:11:57,185
- Yes. - Are you ready?

2148
01:11:57,455 --> 01:11:59,655
- Get set. Go! - Go!

2149
01:11:59,755 --> 01:12:02,075
(Time limit is 10 minutes. Parking Agent Test starts now!)

2150
01:12:02,525 --> 01:12:03,595
- Get in. - Okay.

2151
01:12:03,895 --> 01:12:04,895
Where is the seat belt?

2152
01:12:05,365 --> 01:12:06,795
Time goes so quickly.

2153
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:08,365
We have ten minutes.

2154
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:09,695
How do you operate this thing?

2155
01:12:09,835 --> 01:12:12,564
Wait. I'll adjust my seat a little.

2156
01:12:12,565 --> 01:12:14,165
- Okay. - I don't really know.

2157
01:12:14,535 --> 01:12:15,535
I'll keep an eye on the side.

2158
01:12:15,536 --> 01:12:16,734
It's time for adjusting everything.

2159
01:12:16,735 --> 01:12:18,375
Is this how you start the engine?

2160
01:12:18,845 --> 01:12:20,005
Where's the "D"?

2161
01:12:20,105 --> 01:12:21,445
It's here. Yu Jin, look here.

2162
01:12:21,945 --> 01:12:23,314
This car looks really interesting.

2163
01:12:23,315 --> 01:12:26,984
(To shift gears, press the unlock button.)

2164
01:12:26,985 --> 01:12:28,185
What's an "unlock button"?

2165
01:12:29,085 --> 01:12:30,685
Where is it?

2166
01:12:32,025 --> 01:12:33,155
That's really unusual.

2167
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:35,595
Where's the unlock button?

2168
01:12:36,995 --> 01:12:39,265
(1 minute has already passed.)

2169
01:12:39,425 --> 01:12:40,525
I can't open the window.

2170
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:43,635
- Press that. - Where's the unlock button?

2171
01:12:43,935 --> 01:12:45,134
Isn't that part of the mission?

2172
01:12:45,135 --> 01:12:46,465
Is that part of the mission too?

2173
01:12:47,135 --> 01:12:48,904
- Oh, no! - Where's the button?

2174
01:12:48,905 --> 01:12:50,174
That's so mean.

2175
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,804
Let's look it up. Anyone got a phone?

2176
01:12:51,805 --> 01:12:53,745
- I don't have a phone. - I have one.

2177
01:12:53,845 --> 01:12:55,144
(They try to help Yu Jin who is struggling.)

2178
01:12:55,145 --> 01:12:56,275
I don't think this is it.

2179
01:12:58,315 --> 01:13:00,745
- Unlock button for Green Cooper. - The unlock button.

2180
01:13:01,155 --> 01:13:03,585
(You can depend on me, Yu Jin.)

2181
01:13:03,985 --> 01:13:06,384
It says to press the unlock button for more than three seconds.

2182
01:13:06,385 --> 01:13:08,355
- What? - It's like this. Here.

2183
01:13:08,795 --> 01:13:10,394
- Here? - Where is it?

2184
01:13:10,395 --> 01:13:11,864
(They press where Mimi pointed out.)

2185
01:13:11,865 --> 01:13:13,394
- Okay. - Got it. Thank you.

2186
01:13:13,395 --> 01:13:15,134
What should we do?

2187
01:13:15,135 --> 01:13:16,164
- Look carefully. - I really don't know.

2188
01:13:16,165 --> 01:13:18,064
What do you want me to do for you?

2189
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:19,564
- Please tell us things. - Will do.

2190
01:13:19,565 --> 01:13:21,285
Interesting thing that happened today is...

2191
01:13:21,335 --> 01:13:23,034
No, I'm not talking about things like that.

2192
01:13:23,035 --> 01:13:24,375
I see. I'm sorry.

2193
01:13:24,545 --> 01:13:27,105
(Laughing)

2194
01:13:27,575 --> 01:13:28,814
(Embarrassed)

2195
01:13:28,815 --> 01:13:30,544
- I'm going now. - I can't open the window.

2196
01:13:30,545 --> 01:13:31,714
- Until the last moment. - The window?

2197
01:13:31,715 --> 01:13:32,991
(They finally drive away 2 minutes after the clock started.)

2198
01:13:33,015 --> 01:13:34,555
This is scary.

2199
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:37,284
- We're going. - Wait, my lovely Yu Jin.

2200
01:13:37,285 --> 01:13:39,654
Shall we... Shall we take care of this?

2201
01:13:39,655 --> 01:13:42,955
- Shall we take care of this? - Oh, dear.

2202
01:13:43,095 --> 01:13:45,024
- That's good. - How can I roll down the window?

2203
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:46,164
- You forgot the side mirror. - There.

2204
01:13:46,165 --> 01:13:49,165
It's scary driving a different car.

2205
01:13:49,335 --> 01:13:51,704
- The wheel is really thick too. - I rolled it down.

2206
01:13:51,705 --> 01:13:54,535
- We'll be back. - Yo Han, no need to worry.

2207
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:57,335
- You're good. - I turn left, right?

2208
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:58,444
- You're good. Turn left. - Turn left.

2209
01:13:58,445 --> 01:13:59,445
- Turn left. - Yes, left.

2210
01:13:59,645 --> 01:14:04,485
(The route is to loop around the neighborhood following the map.)

2211
01:14:05,615 --> 01:14:07,514
- You're good. - I turn left, right?

2212
01:14:07,515 --> 01:14:08,554
- You're good. Turn left. - Turn left.

2213
01:14:08,555 --> 01:14:09,555
- Turn left. - Yes, left.

2214
01:14:09,556 --> 01:14:12,025
Egg... Egg... Turn left at the Egg.

2215
01:14:12,225 --> 01:14:14,725
(She says the same thing four times.)

2216
01:14:14,795 --> 01:14:16,925
This is really scary.

2217
01:14:17,155 --> 01:14:19,195
(There's a reason why Agent An Yu Myung is scared.)

2218
01:14:19,595 --> 01:14:21,835
(The route they have to drive through is...)

2219
01:14:22,795 --> 01:14:25,465
(the narrow alley in the heart of Gangnam.)

2220
01:14:26,205 --> 01:14:28,204
Okay, we're going the right way.

2221
01:14:28,205 --> 01:14:29,965
(That's why she needs a reliable human GPS.)

2222
01:14:30,405 --> 01:14:31,644
We have about eight minutes left.

2223
01:14:31,645 --> 01:14:33,045
We can do this.

2224
01:14:34,005 --> 01:14:36,844
I think 1 minute and 50 seconds have passed so far.

2225
01:14:36,845 --> 01:14:38,585
Right. We still have plenty of time left.

2226
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:40,884
- This car has a unique sound. - We have about eight minutes left.

2227
01:14:40,885 --> 01:14:42,184
- You can do this. - You're doing well.

2228
01:14:42,185 --> 01:14:44,625
Make a right turn at the wall up ahead.

2229
01:14:44,785 --> 01:14:46,625
- All the way to the end? - Yes, that's right.

2230
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,924
Right to the end. It's not here.

2231
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:49,594
- Be careful. - Right to the end.

2232
01:14:49,595 --> 01:14:52,095
(There's a Rolls-Royce up ahead to the left.)

2233
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:53,424
(Basic Stats on Rolls-Royce)

2234
01:14:53,425 --> 01:14:55,035
(It's about 500,000 dollars.)

2235
01:14:55,595 --> 01:14:57,264
This is so scary!

2236
01:14:57,265 --> 01:14:58,365
You're doing well.

2237
01:14:58,705 --> 01:15:02,075
(Staying as far away as possible from the expensive car, )

2238
01:15:03,535 --> 01:15:05,805
(they pass by smoothly.)

2239
01:15:06,275 --> 01:15:08,844
That's good. You're doing great, Yu Jin.

2240
01:15:08,845 --> 01:15:10,415
You're the best driver.

2241
01:15:10,445 --> 01:15:12,414
- We're going to turn right here. - It's so scary.

2242
01:15:12,415 --> 01:15:14,784
That's good. Yu Jin, there's a pole here.

2243
01:15:14,785 --> 01:15:16,285
You can go a bit further.

2244
01:15:16,555 --> 01:15:17,684
You're doing really great.

2245
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:19,054
It's not touching. It's not even close.

2246
01:15:19,055 --> 01:15:22,094
There's plenty of space.

2247
01:15:22,095 --> 01:15:24,524
Yu Jin, your driving has improved.

2248
01:15:24,525 --> 01:15:25,671
- It has? - In that short while.

2249
01:15:25,695 --> 01:15:27,765
(The handle is just for support.)

2250
01:15:27,995 --> 01:15:30,134
- There's no car in sight. - Please check both sides.

2251
01:15:30,135 --> 01:15:31,511
- Please check. - No car is coming here.

2252
01:15:31,535 --> 01:15:34,065
(They pass through the crossroad easily thanks to Eun Ji.)

2253
01:15:34,505 --> 01:15:36,174
They seem to be enjoying their meal.

2254
01:15:36,175 --> 01:15:38,475
- So relaxed. - You need to stop up there.

2255
01:15:38,905 --> 01:15:41,274
Is there a problem with the car in front?

2256
01:15:41,275 --> 01:15:43,344
- The car is trying to go out. - Trying to go out.

2257
01:15:43,345 --> 01:15:44,584
It's trying to make a right turn.

2258
01:15:44,585 --> 01:15:46,285
We just have to follow that car.

2259
01:15:46,685 --> 01:15:50,085
(It's the only section where they merge onto a main road.)

2260
01:15:50,355 --> 01:15:52,284
- There's no car behind us. - Great timing.

2261
01:15:52,285 --> 01:15:54,024
You've turned right.

2262
01:15:54,025 --> 01:15:55,195
You're doing great.

2263
01:15:55,295 --> 01:15:57,295
(They stop for a moment.)

2264
01:15:58,065 --> 01:15:59,724
We've checked there are no people.

2265
01:15:59,725 --> 01:16:00,725
Hello, Mr. Producer.

2266
01:16:00,726 --> 01:16:02,171
(They head out after checking there are no pedestrians.)

2267
01:16:02,195 --> 01:16:04,064
After passing here... Is it here?

2268
01:16:04,065 --> 01:16:05,404
- No, you have to go one more block. - Further?

2269
01:16:05,405 --> 01:16:07,735
- Go a bit further. - Go further.

2270
01:16:08,135 --> 01:16:10,875
You turn right here. This is where you make right.

2271
01:16:10,935 --> 01:16:13,845
- This is... - Here comes the big uphill climb.

2272
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:17,985
(It's steepest slope near Hakdong Station.)

2273
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:21,614
(They hit the gas toward the final climb.)

2274
01:16:21,615 --> 01:16:22,814
- It's an uphill climb. - You're doing fine.

2275
01:16:22,815 --> 01:16:25,184
- Yes. - You're doing so great!

2276
01:16:25,185 --> 01:16:26,355
Just step on it.

2277
01:16:26,585 --> 01:16:28,495
(There's nothing but praise.)

2278
01:16:28,825 --> 01:16:31,024
Yu Jin, you're doing so great.

2279
01:16:31,025 --> 01:16:32,165
This is excellent.

2280
01:16:32,225 --> 01:16:33,695
There are no problems at all.

2281
01:16:34,665 --> 01:16:35,994
Do I just go straight from here?

2282
01:16:35,995 --> 01:16:37,734
Yes, you just go straight. We aren't there yet.

2283
01:16:37,735 --> 01:16:38,964
- You're good at reading the map. - Go straight.

2284
01:16:38,965 --> 01:16:40,164
- Right. She's the best. - Right.

2285
01:16:40,165 --> 01:16:41,435
Go straight a little more.

2286
01:16:41,635 --> 01:16:44,004
Make a right as you go downhill.

2287
01:16:44,005 --> 01:16:45,674
Then left. You need to go through there.

2288
01:16:45,675 --> 01:16:47,604
- We've arrived already. - Yes.

2289
01:16:47,605 --> 01:16:48,914
- They're here? - That was really fast.

2290
01:16:48,915 --> 01:16:51,315
- That's really fast. - They're here.

2291
01:16:51,445 --> 01:16:52,744
Continue going.

2292
01:16:52,745 --> 01:16:55,454
Now, we'll leave the parking all to Yu Jin.

2293
01:16:55,455 --> 01:16:58,385
Now... That's good. Nice and slow.

2294
01:16:58,425 --> 01:17:00,154
(CEO Rhee's car to the left and CEO Ko's car to the right)

2295
01:17:00,155 --> 01:17:02,255
She has to park in reverse.

2296
01:17:03,355 --> 01:17:05,995
(But the Green Cooper has already pulled in headfirst.)

2297
01:17:06,495 --> 01:17:08,794
- I've never done this before. - Someone get out of the car.

2298
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:10,194
- Quickly. Someone get out. - I'll get out.

2299
01:17:10,195 --> 01:17:12,165
- Who'll get out? - I'll get out.

2300
01:17:12,535 --> 01:17:13,864
Back window.

2301
01:17:13,865 --> 01:17:15,874
Yu Jin, open all the back windows.

2302
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:17,074
All right. That's good.

2303
01:17:17,075 --> 01:17:18,104
Come on in.

2304
01:17:18,105 --> 01:17:20,185
(The person who passed the skills test is coaching.)

2305
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:23,075
- I want to go to the right. - To that side.

2306
01:17:23,645 --> 01:17:25,385
Which way are you trying to go?

2307
01:17:25,815 --> 01:17:27,114
This way?

2308
01:17:27,115 --> 01:17:28,554
You have space.

2309
01:17:28,555 --> 01:17:30,355
- It's moving. - You still have space.

2310
01:17:31,085 --> 01:17:32,685
- Okay. - Right.

2311
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:34,055
- Wait a minute. - Good.

2312
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:36,394
You can come a little more this way.

2313
01:17:36,395 --> 01:17:37,524
No, that's not right.

2314
01:17:37,525 --> 01:17:39,695
(There's discord from the very first direction.)

2315
01:17:40,165 --> 01:17:41,734
- You have to go that way. - Young Ji!

2316
01:17:41,735 --> 01:17:43,041
- Yes? - You have to go that way.

2317
01:17:43,065 --> 01:17:44,704
I wonder if looking at Young Ji...

2318
01:17:44,705 --> 01:17:46,665
- is the right thing to do. - This green thing...

2319
01:17:46,905 --> 01:17:50,875
(Believe it or not, Young Ji has more experience with skills tests.)

2320
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:52,975
What do we do now?

2321
01:17:54,845 --> 01:17:56,575
(Why are you standing there?)

2322
01:17:56,945 --> 01:18:00,385
Now, you just turn the wheel. That's great.

2323
01:18:01,185 --> 01:18:02,914
Hey, Wait a minute. Stop, stop!

2324
01:18:02,915 --> 01:18:04,215
Go up a bit more.

2325
01:18:04,415 --> 01:18:06,155
- We'll go up a bit and back up. - Okay.

2326
01:18:06,255 --> 01:18:07,654
- They're quite good at this. - Go right a little.

2327
01:18:07,655 --> 01:18:09,194
Pull out to the right and back up.

2328
01:18:09,195 --> 01:18:10,225
Okay!

2329
01:18:11,255 --> 01:18:13,365
Hey, that's going too far.

2330
01:18:14,195 --> 01:18:15,395
Should you go that far?

2331
01:18:16,165 --> 01:18:17,235
Where are you going?

2332
01:18:17,465 --> 01:18:19,941
(This is a tough situation even for someone who passed the skills test.)

2333
01:18:19,965 --> 01:18:22,205
- Where are you going? - I have my own methods.

2334
01:18:22,835 --> 01:18:24,374
She has learned her own way.

2335
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,815
(She gets as far away as possible to secure the right angle.)

2336
01:18:27,505 --> 01:18:29,775
You're going between CEO Ko and CEO Rhee.

2337
01:18:30,215 --> 01:18:31,884
(CEO Rhee's car to the left and CEO Ko's car to the right)

2338
01:18:31,885 --> 01:18:33,521
(At last, it's the moment of going between the cars of the two CEOs.)

2339
01:18:33,545 --> 01:18:35,754
- See if we touch Mr. Rhee's car. - Wait a second.

2340
01:18:35,755 --> 01:18:36,785
Is it okay?

2341
01:18:37,285 --> 01:18:38,285
Is there enough space?

2342
01:18:38,286 --> 01:18:40,131
(There's enough space on the opposite side too.)

2343
01:18:40,155 --> 01:18:41,855
It's okay for now.

2344
01:18:41,995 --> 01:18:43,901
- Mr. Rhee's car? - It's touching a little. Stop!

2345
01:18:43,925 --> 01:18:45,501
- Mr. Rhee's car? - It's touching a little. Stop!

2346
01:18:45,525 --> 01:18:47,495
(Where is it touching?)

2347
01:18:47,865 --> 01:18:49,334
- Mr. Rhee's car? - It's touching a little. Stop!

2348
01:18:49,335 --> 01:18:51,235
(What?)

2349
01:18:51,405 --> 01:18:52,564
- Where's it touching? - Where?

2350
01:18:52,565 --> 01:18:54,464
- Keep coming like that. - What's she doing?

2351
01:18:54,465 --> 01:18:56,475
- Keep coming like that. - Where's she going?

2352
01:18:56,735 --> 01:18:59,016
(The driver stays calm, focused on the rear-view camera.)

2353
01:18:59,145 --> 01:19:00,774
(But the coach is making a fuss at the back.)

2354
01:19:00,775 --> 01:19:01,845
Keep coming like that.

2355
01:19:02,275 --> 01:19:04,644
(Now, it's just a voice lost in the void.)

2356
01:19:04,645 --> 01:19:05,785
It's not touching.

2357
01:19:06,285 --> 01:19:07,384
It's not touching.

2358
01:19:07,385 --> 01:19:09,585
(It's just one-way communication.)

2359
01:19:09,715 --> 01:19:11,885
- It's not touching. - It's not touching.

2360
01:19:12,055 --> 01:19:13,154
(Even Mimi in the back seat steps in.)

2361
01:19:13,155 --> 01:19:14,455
It's not touching.

2362
01:19:14,695 --> 01:19:16,724
It didn't touch. It's perfect. Smoothly done!

2363
01:19:16,725 --> 01:19:18,195
- Bravo! - Great.

2364
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,595
Great, Yeon Jin!

2365
01:19:19,825 --> 01:19:22,635
(Yeon Jin is staying calm.)

2366
01:19:22,965 --> 01:19:25,365
(As expected, the rear-view camera is better than Young Ji.)

2367
01:19:25,665 --> 01:19:27,865
(Watch out for Young Ji in the rear.)

2368
01:19:28,135 --> 01:19:30,905
(She just has to go in straight, and parking will be done.)

2369
01:19:31,105 --> 01:19:33,004
That's perfect. Go!

2370
01:19:33,005 --> 01:19:35,645
Stop! Go! Stop!

2371
01:19:36,145 --> 01:19:37,675
(7 go's and 6 stop's)

2372
01:19:37,775 --> 01:19:39,344
But isn't this too tight?

2373
01:19:39,345 --> 01:19:40,684
Stop. It's fine, but we...

2374
01:19:40,685 --> 01:19:41,914
But we have to get out carefully.

2375
01:19:41,915 --> 01:19:43,715
Don't door-ding the car when you get out.

2376
01:19:43,785 --> 01:19:45,185
Yu Jin, that was perfect.

2377
01:19:46,655 --> 01:19:48,454
It's not over until all four of you get out.

2378
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:50,895
- You have 1 minute left. - We have 1 minute left.

2379
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:52,525
- I'll get out carefully. - Okay.

2380
01:19:53,725 --> 01:19:55,895
(Absolutely no door dings!)

2381
01:19:57,165 --> 01:19:58,535
Mimi is out.

2382
01:19:58,805 --> 01:20:01,035
(Yu Jin, the driver, gets out right after.)

2383
01:20:01,735 --> 01:20:03,275
- Yu Jin is out. - She's out.

2384
01:20:03,535 --> 01:20:05,874
Now, Eun Ji has to get out.

2385
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:07,551
- Are you all right? - This side is really tight.

2386
01:20:07,575 --> 01:20:09,115
(She opens the door carefully.)

2387
01:20:09,275 --> 01:20:10,714
What is this?

2388
01:20:10,715 --> 01:20:12,084
- Wait a minute. - Eun Ji!

2389
01:20:12,085 --> 01:20:13,844
- I'll fold the side mirrors. - Go over to the other side.

2390
01:20:13,845 --> 01:20:15,361
(Even at a glance, it's just a hand's width.)

2391
01:20:15,385 --> 01:20:17,955
(Save the commissioner general!)

2392
01:20:18,385 --> 01:20:19,625
(2nd attempt?)

2393
01:20:19,655 --> 01:20:21,755
Hey. I'll go over to that side.

2394
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:23,495
Go over to the other side.

2395
01:20:23,825 --> 01:20:24,924
The other side.

2396
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:27,325
(Surprisingly, Mimi is flustered, and Young Ji has stopped.)

2397
01:20:27,395 --> 01:20:28,434
I'll go over to that side.

2398
01:20:28,435 --> 01:20:30,565
(Hold on, girls. I'm getting out.)

2399
01:20:30,595 --> 01:20:31,964
(Laughing)

2400
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:34,235
- You can do this. - Hurry!

2401
01:20:34,305 --> 01:20:36,275
- Come on! - Okay.

2402
01:20:37,135 --> 01:20:38,874
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

2403
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:39,975
- Akh! - Akh!

2404
01:20:40,075 --> 01:20:42,615
(Is this mission a success?)

2405
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:44,375
Mission accomplished!

2406
01:20:44,445 --> 01:20:45,844
(Mission accomplished)

2407
01:20:45,845 --> 01:20:46,885
Mission accomplished!

2408
01:20:47,115 --> 01:20:48,214
(Barefoot spirit)

2409
01:20:48,215 --> 01:20:50,384
Your biological clock was right on time.

2410
01:20:50,385 --> 01:20:51,854
Yu Jin crushed it!

2411
01:20:51,855 --> 01:20:53,525
You did it in 9 minutes and 18 seconds.

2412
01:20:55,025 --> 01:20:58,055
(The cleared the mission with a whole 40 seconds to spare.)

2413
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:01,124
That was amazing!

2414
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:02,594
- Yu Jin, you were amazing. - That was amazing.

2415
01:21:02,595 --> 01:21:04,765
This parking lot is terrible.

2416
01:21:04,865 --> 01:21:07,135
It's so hard to park here.

2417
01:21:07,265 --> 01:21:09,674
- Yo Han, get your key. - Right.

2418
01:21:09,675 --> 01:21:10,704
Here it is.

2419
01:21:10,705 --> 01:21:12,905
You must have been worried sick back there.

2420
01:21:13,545 --> 01:21:16,414
Everyone, if you catch Torong later,

2421
01:21:16,415 --> 01:21:19,444
your prize money will be restored to 1,000 dollars per person.

2422
01:21:19,445 --> 01:21:20,714
Wonderful!

2423
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:21,715
- That's crazy. - So that's done.

2424
01:21:21,716 --> 01:21:22,784
The prize money has increased.

2425
01:21:22,785 --> 01:21:24,584
Akh to Agent Ahn Yu Jin.

2426
01:21:24,585 --> 01:21:25,825
- Akh. - Akh.

2427
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:27,454
(She's the agent for the ending.)

2428
01:21:27,455 --> 01:21:28,494
Akh to her.

2429
01:21:28,495 --> 01:21:29,995
- Let's go to eat. - Okay.

2430
01:21:30,155 --> 01:21:31,325
- Akh. - Akh.

2431
01:21:32,765 --> 01:21:33,894
- Hey! - Hey!

2432
01:21:33,895 --> 01:21:35,795
- It's Yu Jin. - It's her.

2433
01:21:36,165 --> 01:21:37,894
Where is Yu Jin?

2434
01:21:37,895 --> 01:21:39,005
- Yu Jin. - There she is.

2435
01:21:39,535 --> 01:21:41,905
(Rich garlic sauce meets...)

2436
01:21:42,475 --> 01:21:46,305
(light and savory potatoes.)

2437
01:21:46,405 --> 01:21:48,744
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2438
01:21:48,745 --> 01:21:50,044
It's toasty hot.

2439
01:21:50,045 --> 01:21:51,244
Everybody, cheers.

2440
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:53,044
- Akh. - Congratulations.

2441
01:21:53,045 --> 01:21:55,184
Congrats on our success. Celebrate the prize money.

2442
01:21:55,185 --> 01:21:56,655
(Delicious)

2443
01:21:57,255 --> 01:22:00,555
(She satisfies her hunger from carrying out the mission.)

2444
01:22:00,585 --> 01:22:01,725
(Nice!)

2445
01:22:07,565 --> 01:22:08,895
- This is good. - Tasty.

2446
01:22:09,935 --> 01:22:13,135
(Super hungry Yu Jin digs in.)

2447
01:22:13,805 --> 01:22:17,675
(She wolfs down the food to recharge.)

2448
01:22:17,775 --> 01:22:19,704
I want to give them to our team.

2449
01:22:19,705 --> 01:22:21,275
- The team? - It's for them.

2450
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:22,574
What is it?

2451
01:22:22,575 --> 01:22:24,844
While drawing for OH MY GIRL team uniform,

2452
01:22:24,845 --> 01:22:26,644
I made a group drawing of our Earth Aracade team too.

2453
01:22:26,645 --> 01:22:28,214
- I'm going to change right now. - Are you serious?

2454
01:22:28,215 --> 01:22:29,385
Seriously?

2455
01:22:29,685 --> 01:22:31,455
- It's so cute. - Amazing.

2456
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:32,784
You drew this?

2457
01:22:32,785 --> 01:22:35,094
- Why are you so talented? - I love it.

2458
01:22:35,095 --> 01:22:36,494
- Mimi! - That's awesome!

2459
01:22:36,495 --> 01:22:37,594
- I want to draw like that. - Amazing.

2460
01:22:37,595 --> 01:22:38,694
- I love it. - You should draw...

2461
01:22:38,695 --> 01:22:40,794
- illustrations for Earth Arcade. - It's awesome.

2462
01:22:40,795 --> 01:22:42,571
(Each character brings out everyone's individuality.)

2463
01:22:42,595 --> 01:22:43,935
That's so sweet.

2464
01:22:44,065 --> 01:22:45,705
- That's so very sweet. - It's so pretty.

2465
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:48,335
This is so cute. I want to wear this now.

2466
01:22:48,405 --> 01:22:50,705
(Young Ji comes out after changing into the T-shirt.)

2467
01:22:50,735 --> 01:22:52,645
(At that moment)

2468
01:22:52,675 --> 01:22:54,844
Producer Shin Won Ho, where are you?

2469
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:55,845
(Producer Na laughs.)

2470
01:22:55,875 --> 01:22:57,945
I have to tell you quickly.

2471
01:22:58,145 --> 01:22:59,845
I've been practicing acting.

2472
01:23:00,085 --> 01:23:01,384
You're practicing acting?

2473
01:23:01,385 --> 01:23:02,984
I've been acting... Producer Shin!

2474
01:23:02,985 --> 01:23:04,755
I've been practicing acting.

2475
01:23:05,155 --> 01:23:07,425
You really have to pick me.

2476
01:23:07,585 --> 01:23:09,094
You really have to pick me.

2477
01:23:09,095 --> 01:23:10,815
(What is she doing while changing clothes?)

2478
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:13,594
(Why is Young Ji so desperately searching for Producer Shin?)

2479
01:23:13,595 --> 01:23:15,095
(About 5 months ago)

2480
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:18,705
(On a recent variety show that Young Ji appeared in, )

2481
01:23:19,065 --> 01:23:20,704
(he expressed the idea of casting...)

2482
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:22,405
(Young Ji as the lead in "Reply 2002.")

2483
01:23:22,735 --> 01:23:24,575
(Young Ji found out about this.)

2484
01:23:25,475 --> 01:23:28,815
(Young Ji has been waiting to appear on "Reply 2002.")

2485
01:23:29,015 --> 01:23:30,775
Was I a little drunk that day?

2486
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:32,844
(He started to back out on his comment.)

2487
01:23:32,845 --> 01:23:34,285
His face is starting to turn red.

2488
01:23:34,685 --> 01:23:36,645
Goodness, Producer Shin. You're so irresponsible.

2489
01:23:36,885 --> 01:23:37,955
Have a good trip!

2490
01:23:38,385 --> 01:23:39,705
(He also backed out of the room.)

2491
01:23:40,425 --> 01:23:42,125
(Cameras off)

2492
01:23:42,425 --> 01:23:44,455
(However...)

2493
01:23:44,965 --> 01:23:47,624
(Young Ji is not one to stand idly by.)

2494
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:49,665
Woo Jung, I really have to be in "Reply 2002!"

2495
01:23:49,865 --> 01:23:51,594
I can start acting for my audition right now.

2496
01:23:51,595 --> 01:23:53,134
- So suddenly? - Free acting.

2497
01:23:53,135 --> 01:23:54,135
Free acting.

2498
01:23:54,136 --> 01:23:56,234
(She started auditioning without cameras.)

2499
01:23:56,235 --> 01:23:57,774
(Turning the camera on in a hurry)

2500
01:23:57,775 --> 01:23:58,944
- You answer the phone. - Okay.

2501
01:23:58,945 --> 01:24:00,721
It's your boyfriend. He wants to break up with you.

2502
01:24:00,745 --> 01:24:02,545
Could you... Won Ho, get here quick!

2503
01:24:03,075 --> 01:24:04,775
(Mission accomplished!)

2504
01:24:05,885 --> 01:24:06,944
Won Ho!

2505
01:24:06,945 --> 01:24:08,785
- Come here quick. - Wait. I'm really nervous.

2506
01:24:08,885 --> 01:24:10,885
So her boyfriend calls her.

2507
01:24:11,185 --> 01:24:13,054
(And so begins the impromptu...)

2508
01:24:13,055 --> 01:24:15,595
("Reply 2002" auditions!)

2509
01:24:15,855 --> 01:24:17,654
I'll start my free acting now, then.

2510
01:24:17,655 --> 01:24:18,664
Number... Wait.

2511
01:24:18,665 --> 01:24:19,864
I meant applicant number.

2512
01:24:19,865 --> 01:24:22,395
I'm Lee Young Ji, applicant number 392.

2513
01:24:22,765 --> 01:24:24,334
Hello, I'm An Yu Jin, applicant number one.

2514
01:24:24,335 --> 01:24:25,805
Applicant number one.

2515
01:24:25,965 --> 01:24:27,704
- Number one? - She's number one.

2516
01:24:27,705 --> 01:24:29,574
(Has to wait for 391 people)

2517
01:24:29,575 --> 01:24:31,175
The first one never gets picked, anyway.

2518
01:24:31,305 --> 01:24:32,345
You got this!

2519
01:24:32,675 --> 01:24:34,845
Your boyfriend calls you.

2520
01:24:35,045 --> 01:24:37,414
He wants to break up on the phone.

2521
01:24:37,415 --> 01:24:38,884
And you're heartbroken,

2522
01:24:38,885 --> 01:24:41,014
but you pretend to be fine.

2523
01:24:41,015 --> 01:24:42,415
(Number 392, Young Ji goes first.)

2524
01:24:44,815 --> 01:24:47,485
(A weekend special, "I Am Sorry, I Am E-cader")

2525
01:24:47,955 --> 01:24:49,325
What do you mean?

2526
01:24:50,395 --> 01:24:52,764
(Lee Young Ji plays the sad Feisty.)

2527
01:24:52,765 --> 01:24:53,824
I'll be honest here.

2528
01:24:53,825 --> 01:24:55,635
I want to break up.

2529
01:24:56,135 --> 01:24:58,365
(Lee Eun Ji plays the boyfriend who wants to break up.)

2530
01:24:58,835 --> 01:25:00,865
(Producer Shin Won Ho is the interviewer.)

2531
01:25:01,135 --> 01:25:03,004
(Bystander, Mr. Na)

2532
01:25:03,005 --> 01:25:04,005
Ready, action!

2533
01:25:04,006 --> 01:25:05,904
- Eun Ji, could you go? - Hello?

2534
01:25:05,905 --> 01:25:08,145
- Hello, Young Ji? - Yes, babe?

2535
01:25:08,245 --> 01:25:09,274
Are you busy?

2536
01:25:09,275 --> 01:25:10,714
No, I'm just hanging at E-cade.

2537
01:25:10,715 --> 01:25:11,715
I see.

2538
01:25:12,045 --> 01:25:13,244
"Just hanging at E-cade."

2539
01:25:13,245 --> 01:25:14,245
By the way,

2540
01:25:14,246 --> 01:25:16,954
I've been meaning to tell you this.

2541
01:25:16,955 --> 01:25:18,284
- Okay. - I don't think I have...

2542
01:25:18,285 --> 01:25:20,585
the energy to be in a relationship anymore.

2543
01:25:20,825 --> 01:25:23,194
(A classic breakup line suddenly entered the chat.)

2544
01:25:23,195 --> 01:25:24,455
What do you mean?

2545
01:25:25,065 --> 01:25:26,294
I'm just so...

2546
01:25:26,295 --> 01:25:27,695
You could have an energy drink.

2547
01:25:27,895 --> 01:25:30,764
I mean, I think I'm starting to hurt you lately.

2548
01:25:30,765 --> 01:25:32,065
(She went too far, )

2549
01:25:32,735 --> 01:25:34,405
(and Producer Shin lowers his head.)

2550
01:25:34,935 --> 01:25:37,005
I need some time to think.

2551
01:25:37,475 --> 01:25:38,975
You met someone, right? You jerk.

2552
01:25:39,905 --> 01:25:41,605
(The cheating boyfriend ending)

2553
01:25:42,045 --> 01:25:44,074
(The plot line took a curveball, )

2554
01:25:44,075 --> 01:25:46,215
(shocking the humanist producer.)

2555
01:25:46,415 --> 01:25:47,684
You went from energy drink...

2556
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:49,185
to situational comedy!

2557
01:25:49,415 --> 01:25:52,925
(Singing)

2558
01:25:53,385 --> 01:25:56,225
(Don't have the energy to date?)

2559
01:25:56,655 --> 01:25:58,995
(Have an energy drink!)

2560
01:25:59,095 --> 01:26:00,864
Your expression is so stern, Producer Shin.

2561
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:02,395
I'm sorry, I'll stop here.

2562
01:26:03,065 --> 01:26:04,695
- Next up! - Applicant number one.

2563
01:26:04,865 --> 01:26:06,565
(Number 1, Yu Jin goes second.)

2564
01:26:06,965 --> 01:26:08,575
Wait, what?

2565
01:26:09,475 --> 01:26:11,605
(An Yu Jin plays the sad Puppy An.)

2566
01:26:12,275 --> 01:26:14,345
(Lee Eun Ji plays that same guy.)

2567
01:26:15,145 --> 01:26:16,644
(Yu Jin will act out a breakup scene.)

2568
01:26:16,645 --> 01:26:17,975
(How good will it be?)

2569
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:19,644
(Yu Jin's auditions start.)

2570
01:26:19,645 --> 01:26:20,645
Hello?

2571
01:26:20,646 --> 01:26:22,355
- Hi, babe. - Hi.

2572
01:26:22,455 --> 01:26:24,485
Can we talk for a bit?

2573
01:26:24,985 --> 01:26:26,755
Sure, for a bit.

2574
01:26:27,085 --> 01:26:28,085
Well...

2575
01:26:28,695 --> 01:26:31,195
How about we take some time off for a month?

2576
01:26:32,095 --> 01:26:33,695
Wait, what?

2577
01:26:34,325 --> 01:26:35,434
I'll be honest here.

2578
01:26:35,435 --> 01:26:37,265
I want to break up.

2579
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:39,605
(Sobbing)

2580
01:26:40,935 --> 01:26:41,974
Wait.

2581
01:26:41,975 --> 01:26:45,275
(She's pretending to be choked up in her sadness.)

2582
01:26:45,505 --> 01:26:47,045
What was that?

2583
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:53,314
(The performance Yu Jin had in mind)

2584
01:26:53,315 --> 01:26:57,485
(What Yu Jin actually did)

2585
01:26:57,885 --> 01:26:59,784
(The girls are weak in their knees with laughter.)

2586
01:26:59,785 --> 01:27:00,825
What was that?

2587
01:27:00,955 --> 01:27:02,294
(While the interviewer grows deep in thought...)

2588
01:27:02,295 --> 01:27:03,895
Hello, Yu Jin? What's wrong?

2589
01:27:04,095 --> 01:27:05,794
(Wrapping up quickly)

2590
01:27:05,795 --> 01:27:06,894
How were we?

2591
01:27:06,895 --> 01:27:08,425
What are your thoughts, Producer Shin?

2592
01:27:08,735 --> 01:27:10,194
I really like...

2593
01:27:10,195 --> 01:27:11,694
non-professional acting like this.

2594
01:27:11,695 --> 01:27:12,905
Non-professional?

2595
01:27:13,905 --> 01:27:15,004
Acting like theirs...

2596
01:27:15,005 --> 01:27:16,704
He said we're not professional.

2597
01:27:16,705 --> 01:27:18,305
Acting with no grounds.

2598
01:27:18,705 --> 01:27:19,844
(Another soft attack)

2599
01:27:19,845 --> 01:27:21,744
What I'm trying to say is...

2600
01:27:21,745 --> 01:27:24,114
- It was fresh. - You don't have a style.

2601
01:27:24,115 --> 01:27:25,384
That is what he means.

2602
01:27:25,385 --> 01:27:26,485
- Thank you. - Yes, so...

2603
01:27:26,645 --> 01:27:28,444
Then, Eun Ji...

2604
01:27:28,445 --> 01:27:29,954
- Why don't you show them? - Yes, go ahead, Eun Ji.

2605
01:27:29,955 --> 01:27:31,454
(She's been waiting for those very words.)

2606
01:27:31,455 --> 01:27:33,255
Show us your acting style!

2607
01:27:33,655 --> 01:27:34,754
(Goes to grab her phone with style)

2608
01:27:34,755 --> 01:27:36,324
Watch her acting carefully.

2609
01:27:36,325 --> 01:27:38,124
I often see you act, Eun Ji...

2610
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:39,795
on the radio.

2611
01:27:39,965 --> 01:27:41,024
He must.

2612
01:27:41,025 --> 01:27:42,765
(Lee Eun Ji goes third.)

2613
01:27:43,065 --> 01:27:44,295
You want to break up?

2614
01:27:45,065 --> 01:27:47,225
(Lee Eun Ji plays the girl with style getting dumped.)

2615
01:27:47,805 --> 01:27:50,235
(Lee Young Ji plays the Feisty who dumps her.)

2616
01:27:50,475 --> 01:27:53,705
(Eun Ji's audition starts.)

2617
01:27:54,305 --> 01:27:55,515
- Hello? - Hey.

2618
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:56,745
- Eun Ji. - Yes?

2619
01:27:57,975 --> 01:28:00,445
- What are you doing? - Nothing much.

2620
01:28:01,185 --> 01:28:02,185
(Sighing)

2621
01:28:02,615 --> 01:28:04,055
- Eun Ji. - What is it?

2622
01:28:04,285 --> 01:28:05,755
I think we need to break up.

2623
01:28:06,125 --> 01:28:08,205
(Her boyfriend suddenly wants to break up with her.)

2624
01:28:08,355 --> 01:28:09,525
You want to break up?

2625
01:28:10,055 --> 01:28:11,095
I...

2626
01:28:12,225 --> 01:28:13,225
I...

2627
01:28:13,226 --> 01:28:14,594
(The very picture of style)

2628
01:28:14,595 --> 01:28:15,595
My gosh.

2629
01:28:16,395 --> 01:28:17,734
(Laughing)

2630
01:28:17,735 --> 01:28:19,435
My gosh. That's...

2631
01:28:19,765 --> 01:28:22,435
(Eun Ji shows everyone what cliche acting is.)

2632
01:28:22,705 --> 01:28:24,674
(Producer Shin is deeply touched by her professional acting.)

2633
01:28:24,675 --> 01:28:25,915
I'm not afraid to show you all.

2634
01:28:26,145 --> 01:28:27,945
I... Hold on.

2635
01:28:28,405 --> 01:28:30,515
(Comedic acting 101)

2636
01:28:30,675 --> 01:28:32,644
I think I have feelings for...

2637
01:28:32,645 --> 01:28:34,485
- Yu Jin. - An Yu Jin in the other department.

2638
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:36,245
(And the shocking news that follows...)

2639
01:28:36,755 --> 01:28:38,684
(makes her pinch her nose forcefully.)

2640
01:28:38,685 --> 01:28:39,785
Did you eat wasabi?

2641
01:28:40,055 --> 01:28:41,055
(Laughing)

2642
01:28:41,056 --> 01:28:42,955
- Goodness. - Yu Jin?

2643
01:28:43,295 --> 01:28:45,294
(Sobbing)

2644
01:28:45,295 --> 01:28:46,494
- You like her? - Eun Ji.

2645
01:28:46,495 --> 01:28:49,035
You're just too overbearing.

2646
01:28:49,695 --> 01:28:51,065
Fine by me!

2647
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:52,805
You know...

2648
01:28:53,865 --> 01:28:55,004
While going out with you...

2649
01:28:55,005 --> 01:28:57,605
(Ran out of reactions)

2650
01:28:57,775 --> 01:28:59,505
Eun Ji can only do comedic acting!

2651
01:28:59,675 --> 01:29:00,945
No, I like stuff like this!

2652
01:29:01,305 --> 01:29:02,644
(Unexpectedly met his requirements)

2653
01:29:02,645 --> 01:29:03,914
Comedic acting with style.

2654
01:29:03,915 --> 01:29:05,144
You really like this too?

2655
01:29:05,145 --> 01:29:07,144
I liked them all, but I'm leaning toward this one.

2656
01:29:07,145 --> 01:29:08,684
- You're leaning toward this? - I had style.

2657
01:29:08,685 --> 01:29:10,084
- I have no idea what you like! - No.

2658
01:29:10,085 --> 01:29:11,654
- Mimi! - Mimi, you should go.

2659
01:29:11,655 --> 01:29:13,254
- Let's go, Mimi. - Mimi is serious.

2660
01:29:13,255 --> 01:29:14,884
- A true diamond in the rough! - She...

2661
01:29:14,885 --> 01:29:16,355
I wish I'd broken up with someone!

2662
01:29:16,795 --> 01:29:18,024
What are you talking about?

2663
01:29:18,025 --> 01:29:19,564
(Acting, breaking up... It's all new to her.)

2664
01:29:19,565 --> 01:29:21,325
(Mimi is going last.)

2665
01:29:21,965 --> 01:29:23,445
So what, we're breaking up like this?

2666
01:29:24,335 --> 01:29:25,335
(Mimi plays Kim Mi Hyun, )

2667
01:29:25,336 --> 01:29:26,696
(new to both acting and breakups.)

2668
01:29:27,265 --> 01:29:31,205
(What would Mimi's breakup performance be like?)

2669
01:29:31,505 --> 01:29:33,074
(Mimi's audition starts.)

2670
01:29:33,075 --> 01:29:34,075
Hello?
- Mi Hyun. - Hi.

2671
01:29:35,076 --> 01:29:37,275
- What are you doing? - Right now? I'm in a shoot.

2672
01:29:37,645 --> 01:29:39,014
- I need to tell you something. - What is it?

2673
01:29:39,015 --> 01:29:40,575
- Please take it seriously. - Go ahead.

2674
01:29:40,785 --> 01:29:41,984
Mi Hyun.

2675
01:29:41,985 --> 01:29:43,425
I'm kind of busy, can we talk later?

2676
01:29:44,085 --> 01:29:45,424
(Spoken like a true breakup rookie)

2677
01:29:45,425 --> 01:29:46,825
- Just hear me out first. - Okay.

2678
01:29:46,955 --> 01:29:48,225
I want to stop seeing you.

2679
01:29:49,025 --> 01:29:50,371
So what, we're breaking up like this?

2680
01:29:50,395 --> 01:29:51,925
How else would we break up?

2681
01:29:52,225 --> 01:29:53,524
We shouldn't go out anymore.

2682
01:29:53,525 --> 01:29:54,765
Did we ever go out?

2683
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:57,465
This is it for us.

2684
01:29:57,595 --> 01:29:59,665
I really don't like how much sweet stuff you eat.

2685
01:30:00,505 --> 01:30:01,935
- That's harsh. - I know.

2686
01:30:03,775 --> 01:30:05,444
(A colorful ending for the couple and the audition)

2687
01:30:05,445 --> 01:30:07,105
(End of auditions)

2688
01:30:07,305 --> 01:30:08,374
- You're too kind. - I didn't expect you to have...

2689
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:09,444
such a clear diction.

2690
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:11,174
- It was unexpected. - Thank you!

2691
01:30:11,175 --> 01:30:12,384
The way I see it,

2692
01:30:12,385 --> 01:30:15,354
he doesn't mean a single word he says.

2693
01:30:15,355 --> 01:30:16,355
- That's not it. - Now you have to...

2694
01:30:16,356 --> 01:30:17,714
- pick the main lead. - It's better than I thought.

2695
01:30:17,715 --> 01:30:19,284
Pick your favorite performer.

2696
01:30:19,285 --> 01:30:21,024
Tap the shoulder of the one you chose.

2697
01:30:21,025 --> 01:30:22,355
(Cast your female lead!)

2698
01:30:23,055 --> 01:30:24,824
- Seriously? - Yes.

2699
01:30:24,825 --> 01:30:26,324
(Inching closer)

2700
01:30:26,325 --> 01:30:28,001
- Young Ji... - Lee Young Ji, go back up there.

2701
01:30:28,025 --> 01:30:29,295
(Inching closer too)

2702
01:30:29,665 --> 01:30:31,435
Wait, why does this matter?

2703
01:30:31,935 --> 01:30:32,964
(It does mean nothing, to be honest.)

2704
01:30:32,965 --> 01:30:34,911
- This is all for fun. - We still need to be cast.

2705
01:30:34,935 --> 01:30:36,204
Let's go.

2706
01:30:36,205 --> 01:30:37,234
(The hardest decision of his life)

2707
01:30:37,235 --> 01:30:39,144
So I can be really honest?

2708
01:30:39,145 --> 01:30:40,505
- Yes. - Gosh!

2709
01:30:41,475 --> 01:30:43,144
(This is all for fun.)

2710
01:30:43,145 --> 01:30:44,175
Let's see.

2711
01:30:44,215 --> 01:30:46,114
Who will be...

2712
01:30:46,115 --> 01:30:47,591
(But they're actually a little nervous.)

2713
01:30:47,615 --> 01:30:48,615
Producer Shin's choice?

2714
01:30:48,616 --> 01:30:51,085
(Who will be his choice?)

2715
01:30:52,014 --> 01:30:53,753
Who will be...

2716
01:30:53,754 --> 01:30:55,194
(They're actually a little nervous.)

2717
01:30:55,284 --> 01:30:56,323
Producer Shin's choice?

2718
01:30:56,324 --> 01:30:58,554
(Who will be his choice?)

2719
01:30:59,202 --> 01:31:00,732
(Shocked)

2720
01:31:01,232 --> 01:31:02,341
(Producer Shin...)

2721
01:31:02,342 --> 01:31:04,371
(picked Mimi!)

2722
01:31:04,372 --> 01:31:05,372
- Gosh! - Oh my.

2723
01:31:06,072 --> 01:31:07,941
(No, she wasn't nominated for an Oscar.)

2724
01:31:07,942 --> 01:31:09,541
- Mimi! - Thank you so much!

2725
01:31:09,542 --> 01:31:10,981
Let's hear why.

2726
01:31:10,982 --> 01:31:12,752
Let's go write our contract!

2727
01:31:12,982 --> 01:31:14,051
Let's go.

2728
01:31:14,052 --> 01:31:17,181
I've always liked unique characters.

2729
01:31:17,182 --> 01:31:19,222
- Unique characters? - Yes.

2730
01:31:19,652 --> 01:31:21,421
And I also think...

2731
01:31:21,422 --> 01:31:24,791
I could make a really fun character based on Mimi.

2732
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:25,992
- I see. - That's nice.

2733
01:31:26,192 --> 01:31:27,831
You gave me inspiration.

2734
01:31:27,832 --> 01:31:29,131
(Producer Shin casts you!)

2735
01:31:29,132 --> 01:31:30,161
Okay, then...

2736
01:31:30,162 --> 01:31:31,562
(Really heading to the airport now)

2737
01:31:31,662 --> 01:31:33,502
What are those glasses, by the way?

2738
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:36,101
Ms. Yang came on "Lee Young Ji's Rainbow..."

2739
01:31:36,102 --> 01:31:37,571
- and told me she loves our show. - Oh, they're sunglasses.

2740
01:31:37,572 --> 01:31:39,571
She wanted me to wear her glasses on the show.

2741
01:31:39,572 --> 01:31:41,411
And she gave me some that she actually wore.

2742
01:31:41,412 --> 01:31:43,311
- That's amazing. - But they're so my style.

2743
01:31:43,312 --> 01:31:45,041
(Young Ji was gifted with Hee Eun's collection.)

2744
01:31:45,042 --> 01:31:46,151
(She also commented on Eun Ji's social media page, )

2745
01:31:46,152 --> 01:31:47,211
(proving that she's a real fan.)

2746
01:31:47,212 --> 01:31:48,951
(I'll be sure to catch the show on air!)

2747
01:31:48,952 --> 01:31:50,792
(I watched every episode from the 1st season!)

2748
01:31:50,982 --> 01:31:52,722
- "You guys are so fun!" - Right!

2749
01:31:52,822 --> 01:31:53,822
(A little imitation)

2750
01:31:53,823 --> 01:31:55,921
"How did the four of you get together?"

2751
01:31:55,922 --> 01:31:57,262
You sound just like her.

2752
01:31:57,422 --> 01:32:00,262
Ms. Yang! Could I also visit your home and have dinner with you?

2753
01:32:00,392 --> 01:32:03,032
"I can't promise you a home-cooked meal."

2754
01:32:03,862 --> 01:32:06,372
- It's uncanny. - "Let's go out to eat."

2755
01:32:06,572 --> 01:32:07,901
That's so funny.

2756
01:32:07,902 --> 01:32:09,741
(Yang Hee Eun Ji)

2757
01:32:09,742 --> 01:32:11,471
Thank you for the meal, Ms. Yang.

2758
01:32:11,472 --> 01:32:13,341
Could you hand me the third one?

2759
01:32:13,342 --> 01:32:14,342
- This one? - Yes.

2760
01:32:14,343 --> 01:32:15,371
- Could you... - With this pair,

2761
01:32:15,372 --> 01:32:17,332
I can really become the film critic Lee Dong Jin.

2762
01:32:18,782 --> 01:32:21,881
I saw you from that brand!

2763
01:32:21,882 --> 01:32:22,951
- Thank you. - Sure.

2764
01:32:22,952 --> 01:32:24,321
Isn't it a luxury brand?

2765
01:32:24,322 --> 01:32:26,291
- It is. - Gosh, that's so cool.

2766
01:32:26,292 --> 01:32:28,691
(Shout out to Ms. Yang!)

2767
01:32:28,692 --> 01:32:31,622
Woo Jung, I really want to act.

2768
01:32:32,232 --> 01:32:33,992
I want to be in a sitcom!

2769
01:32:34,162 --> 01:32:35,861
I want to play a role...

2770
01:32:35,862 --> 01:32:36,931
that gets bullied by Yu Jin.

2771
01:32:36,932 --> 01:32:38,701
I want to play that role. The bad guy.

2772
01:32:38,702 --> 01:32:40,772
- It really suits her. - A villain!

2773
01:32:41,232 --> 01:32:42,372
(Vicious)

2774
01:32:42,472 --> 01:32:44,172
- Let's give it a go. - Shall we?

2775
01:32:44,272 --> 01:32:45,842
What should we act out?

2776
01:32:46,342 --> 01:32:48,112
- Go. - I said I was sorry.

2777
01:32:48,642 --> 01:32:49,642
Give me your phone.

2778
01:32:50,112 --> 01:32:51,242
Why would you need my phone?

2779
01:32:51,342 --> 01:32:53,451
- Just hand it over. - My mother got me this phone!

2780
01:32:53,452 --> 01:32:54,511
Come on, we're all friends here.

2781
01:32:54,512 --> 01:32:55,722
I said my mother gave me this!

2782
01:32:56,152 --> 01:32:59,192
- We're... - I don't want to be played...

2783
01:32:59,592 --> 01:33:00,922
by you anymore.

2784
01:33:01,552 --> 01:33:03,121
- Hey... - I truly despise...

2785
01:33:03,122 --> 01:33:04,122
everything you do!

2786
01:33:04,123 --> 01:33:07,432
Why... How is she more chatty than the bully?

2787
01:33:08,232 --> 01:33:10,602
You talk too much! Let the bully talk!

2788
01:33:10,862 --> 01:33:13,202
- Hey, give me your phone. - Why?

2789
01:33:13,302 --> 01:33:15,471
- This is a new model, right? - You...

2790
01:33:15,472 --> 01:33:16,472
Give it!
(Grunting)

2791
01:33:17,473 --> 01:33:19,142
(Her comedic side keeps coming out.)

2792
01:33:19,412 --> 01:33:20,412
Studying.

2793
01:33:20,942 --> 01:33:21,942
Scribble, scribble.

2794
01:33:21,943 --> 01:33:23,311
"Scribble, scribble?"

2795
01:33:23,312 --> 01:33:25,582
- Scribble, scribble. - Scribble, scribble.

2796
01:33:26,152 --> 01:33:27,712
Why would you say that out loud?

2797
01:33:27,812 --> 01:33:28,881
You have to act out the stage directions,

2798
01:33:28,882 --> 01:33:30,562
- not read them! - She read them out loud.

2799
01:33:30,682 --> 01:33:32,692
- Do it again. - What are you doing? Studying?

2800
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:33,792
Yes.

2801
01:33:34,122 --> 01:33:36,062
But you don't have to study.

2802
01:33:36,722 --> 01:33:37,722
What do you mean?

2803
01:33:38,522 --> 01:33:41,431
You always get good grades, even when you don't study.

2804
01:33:41,432 --> 01:33:42,762
How is this bullying?

2805
01:33:44,102 --> 01:33:46,532
- Seriously. - Thanks for the encouragement.

2806
01:33:46,772 --> 01:33:48,971
Eun Ji, you always see the best in me.

2807
01:33:48,972 --> 01:33:50,171
She's complimenting.

2808
01:33:50,172 --> 01:33:51,341
You put makeup on?

2809
01:33:51,342 --> 01:33:54,272
You don't need it. You're already perfect!

2810
01:33:54,812 --> 01:33:55,881
(The sweetest)

2811
01:33:55,882 --> 01:33:57,212
I'm so sorry, Eun Ji.

2812
01:33:57,712 --> 01:33:59,312
- You can hit me. - Keep your head down.

2813
01:33:59,582 --> 01:34:01,982
Lower your head! The top of your head is so pretty!

2814
01:34:02,482 --> 01:34:05,082
(Young Ji has the prettiest top of the head.)

2815
01:34:05,222 --> 01:34:06,652
I love these lines!

2816
01:34:06,752 --> 01:34:09,161
They're so weird.

2817
01:34:09,162 --> 01:34:12,391
I'm scared these lines might show up in your next show.

2818
01:34:12,392 --> 01:34:13,431
My stomach hurts from laughing too much.

2819
01:34:13,432 --> 01:34:14,862
Young Ji, can you do dialects?

2820
01:34:14,962 --> 01:34:16,432
I can! Of course I can.

2821
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,601
Of course I can!

2822
01:34:18,602 --> 01:34:20,001
- I can do a dialect! - Is that so?

2823
01:34:20,002 --> 01:34:21,331
- Is that so? - I can even do a Jeju dialect!

2824
01:34:21,332 --> 01:34:22,341
Goodness!

2825
01:34:22,342 --> 01:34:24,241
(Dialects she picked up from TV shows)

2826
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:26,242
- Come again? - Why are you clenching your fist?

2827
01:34:26,672 --> 01:34:27,672
What did you say?

2828
01:34:28,012 --> 01:34:30,512
Yes, this is Shinji.

2829
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:34,882
Have you eaten? You girls, you're so loud.

2830
01:34:36,122 --> 01:34:38,782
(This attempt isn't even close to Gyeongsang Province dialect.)

2831
01:34:39,252 --> 01:34:41,121
(Lee Young Ji's Into the World of Dialects)

2832
01:34:41,122 --> 01:34:42,921
- Hello? - Hello? Is that you, Eun Ji?

2833
01:34:42,922 --> 01:34:44,962
- Eun Ji, what are you up to? - What?

2834
01:34:45,062 --> 01:34:46,132
Why do you ask?

2835
01:34:46,462 --> 01:34:48,261
(Untranslatable)

2836
01:34:48,262 --> 01:34:49,431
You're so loud!

2837
01:34:49,432 --> 01:34:50,662
Eun Ji, what are you doing?

2838
01:34:50,762 --> 01:34:52,732
- Nothing. - Come out to the yard until 3pm.

2839
01:34:52,832 --> 01:34:54,501
- Where? - The yard!

2840
01:34:54,502 --> 01:34:56,341
- The yard? - The yard?

2841
01:34:56,342 --> 01:34:57,401
Do you two live together?

2842
01:34:57,402 --> 01:34:58,871
They live in the same house.

2843
01:34:58,872 --> 01:35:01,212
Why would you call? Just come over and talk to me!

2844
01:35:01,842 --> 01:35:03,211
Let's do the Chungcheon dialect.

2845
01:35:03,212 --> 01:35:04,212
Chungcheong Province?

2846
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:05,711
(Into the world of Chungcheong dialect)

2847
01:35:05,712 --> 01:35:08,582
- Get the dialect right. - Hello.

2848
01:35:09,922 --> 01:35:11,781
Yu Jin is from Daejeon.

2849
01:35:11,782 --> 01:35:12,951
You're from Daejeon!

2850
01:35:12,952 --> 01:35:14,321
Yu Jin, are you in Daejeon?

2851
01:35:14,322 --> 01:35:15,991
- Goodness. When do you get here? - Yu Jin.

2852
01:35:15,992 --> 01:35:18,561
I'm on my way. Just 20 minutes left.

2853
01:35:18,562 --> 01:35:20,231
Goodness, did you make the car you're driving in?

2854
01:35:20,232 --> 01:35:21,761
Well... I'm walking over.

2855
01:35:21,762 --> 01:35:23,061
But are you at the yard?

2856
01:35:23,062 --> 01:35:25,732
- I am at the yard! - You are?

2857
01:35:25,772 --> 01:35:27,901
Yu Jin is so detail-oriented. Did you get it?

2858
01:35:27,902 --> 01:35:29,542
"Did you make the car you're driving in?"

2859
01:35:31,202 --> 01:35:33,371
- She's a native. - She's indeed from Chungcheong.

2860
01:35:33,372 --> 01:35:35,311
Dialects were my thing, but she stole them.

2861
01:35:35,312 --> 01:35:36,818
- "Did you make the car?" - I'll try Jeju, then.

2862
01:35:36,842 --> 01:35:39,051
- Jeju? - Their dialect is like this.

2863
01:35:39,052 --> 01:35:40,951
- Got it. - Mimi's from Jeju Island.

2864
01:35:40,952 --> 01:35:42,211
That's right!

2865
01:35:42,212 --> 01:35:43,822
Then... Mi Hyun?

2866
01:35:44,652 --> 01:35:45,821
(The dialect machine is breaking down.)

2867
01:35:45,822 --> 01:35:46,851
- "What are you doing?" Like this. - Okay.

2868
01:35:46,852 --> 01:35:48,351
- What did you say? - Did you eat?

2869
01:35:48,352 --> 01:35:50,121
- Yes... You should eat too. - What did you have?

2870
01:35:50,122 --> 01:35:51,122
I'm going to hang up now.

2871
01:35:51,922 --> 01:35:53,561
(She ran out of Jeju dialect words she knows.)

2872
01:35:53,562 --> 01:35:54,562
- Sorry. - The end.

2873
01:35:54,563 --> 01:35:56,761
Thank you. I think we're done here.

2874
01:35:56,762 --> 01:35:58,001
You were great.

2875
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,301
- A one-woman show. - Young Ji's one-woman show.

2876
01:35:59,302 --> 01:36:00,431
This is crazy.

2877
01:36:00,432 --> 01:36:02,072
They won't cast me even when I do this.

2878
01:36:02,442 --> 01:36:03,772
(Slate)

2879
01:36:04,302 --> 01:36:05,912
(Cameras off for a second)

2880
01:36:06,472 --> 01:36:08,042
(But in just a moment...)

2881
01:36:08,172 --> 01:36:09,711
We'll arrive in ten minutes now.

2882
01:36:09,712 --> 01:36:11,741
- Ten minutes? Already? - That was quick.

2883
01:36:11,742 --> 01:36:15,612
Goodness gracious, would you look at the time?

2884
01:36:17,082 --> 01:36:18,681
I feel great!

2885
01:36:18,682 --> 01:36:20,392
My gosh.

2886
01:36:20,652 --> 01:36:22,251
Thank you. Goodbye!

2887
01:36:22,252 --> 01:36:23,361
- Thank you! - It's so cold.

2888
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:24,362
(They arrived at Incheon Airport.)
Hello.

2889
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:26,991
It's been so long since I've been at the airport.

2890
01:36:26,992 --> 01:36:27,992
Me too.

2891
01:36:28,092 --> 01:36:30,232
What? You came here yesterday!

2892
01:36:30,632 --> 01:36:32,592
- What's wrong with you? - Sorry, force of habit.

2893
01:36:33,072 --> 01:36:34,792
- Yes. - The airport is empty at this hour.

2894
01:36:35,702 --> 01:36:36,702
This is great.

2895
01:36:37,142 --> 01:36:39,242
Right? We always came at the busiest time.

2896
01:36:39,772 --> 01:36:41,912
(They're boarding the 12:20am flight.)

2897
01:36:42,042 --> 01:36:43,242
They must be celebrities.

2898
01:36:43,882 --> 01:36:45,981
- Yes. Hello. - You're right, sir.

2899
01:36:45,982 --> 01:36:47,281
- We are entertainers. - Me too.

2900
01:36:47,282 --> 01:36:49,098
(They're departing with no makeup since they might be noticed.)

2901
01:36:49,122 --> 01:36:50,122
Hello.

2902
01:36:50,123 --> 01:36:51,252
(Shy)

2903
01:36:51,852 --> 01:36:53,812
Let's see if there's anything I can take with me.

2904
01:36:54,222 --> 01:36:56,622
Anything you can take?

2905
01:36:56,992 --> 01:36:58,162
You never know.

2906
01:36:59,062 --> 01:37:01,191
Facial mist! We have a facial mist!

2907
01:37:01,192 --> 01:37:02,802
- Facial mist? - Yes, it's great.

2908
01:37:03,532 --> 01:37:04,601
(A sudden shower)

2909
01:37:04,602 --> 01:37:05,632
How is it?

2910
01:37:05,732 --> 01:37:06,901
(Eun Ji is also checking the amenities.)

2911
01:37:06,902 --> 01:37:08,371
(Sleep mask)

2912
01:37:08,372 --> 01:37:09,602
I should take this with me.

2913
01:37:10,372 --> 01:37:12,342
I might share a room with Young Ji.

2914
01:37:13,142 --> 01:37:14,862
(She gained wisdom during the two seasons.)

2915
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,841
I even brought earplugs in case I got paired with Young Ji.

2916
01:37:16,842 --> 01:37:18,002
But they have it in here too.

2917
01:37:18,782 --> 01:37:20,381
She's looking at me.

2918
01:37:20,382 --> 01:37:22,082
(She can't hide her presence.)

2919
01:37:22,482 --> 01:37:23,981
(Thug-like noises)

2920
01:37:23,982 --> 01:37:26,492
What would we do for E-cade?

2921
01:37:27,022 --> 01:37:28,822
- It's been a while. - Right?

2922
01:37:29,722 --> 01:37:30,722
I'm excited!

2923
01:37:31,022 --> 01:37:32,422
I'm so excited.

2924
01:37:33,492 --> 01:37:35,052
Eun Ji, you brought your laptop, right?

2925
01:37:35,862 --> 01:37:37,932
- Stop messing with me. - I forgot to bring it.

2926
01:37:38,162 --> 01:37:39,172
- Really? - Yes.

2927
01:37:39,932 --> 01:37:40,932
Eun Ji!

2928
01:37:41,032 --> 01:37:42,401
(Biggest crisis for E-cade)

2929
01:37:42,402 --> 01:37:43,971
I would've brought my tablet if I knew.

2930
01:37:43,972 --> 01:37:45,702
What should we do? Guys?

2931
01:37:46,112 --> 01:37:47,752
- It's an emergency. - It's an emergency.

2932
01:37:47,812 --> 01:37:49,942
- What's wrong? - I forgot my laptop.

2933
01:37:50,042 --> 01:37:51,281
Come on, Eun Ji.

2934
01:37:51,282 --> 01:37:52,382
You forgot what?

2935
01:37:52,482 --> 01:37:53,988
- Her laptop! - She forgot her laptop.

2936
01:37:54,012 --> 01:37:55,281
I completely forgot. What should we do?

2937
01:37:55,282 --> 01:37:58,082
We have no choice but to just do it ourselves.

2938
01:37:58,322 --> 01:38:01,321
I didn't even bring my tablet because I thought you would.

2939
01:38:01,322 --> 01:38:03,862
- What should we do? I forgot. - Eun Ji, come on!

2940
01:38:04,292 --> 01:38:05,762
(Thailand, )

2941
01:38:05,862 --> 01:38:07,392
(Finland, )

2942
01:38:07,692 --> 01:38:09,732
(Bali)

2943
01:38:10,202 --> 01:38:16,342
(The laptop was their essential item wherever they went.)

2944
01:38:16,672 --> 01:38:19,071
I don't think this season would work without that laptop.

2945
01:38:19,072 --> 01:38:20,671
(Sighing)

2946
01:38:20,672 --> 01:38:23,511
I'm in trouble. The shoot is for 15 days.

2947
01:38:23,512 --> 01:38:25,541
(Something big is going to happen in 6 minutes with a laptop at stake.)

2948
01:38:25,542 --> 01:38:26,552
What a pickle.

2949
01:38:27,252 --> 01:38:28,751
I was torn whether I should bring it or not.

2950
01:38:28,752 --> 01:38:30,522
- Really - Yes. What?

2951
01:38:30,782 --> 01:38:31,952
I'm yawning already.

2952
01:38:32,652 --> 01:38:34,192
- We're going to sleep, right? - Yes.

2953
01:38:34,522 --> 01:38:37,492
(And so they slept like babies until they arrived.)

2954
01:38:37,592 --> 01:38:39,862
(Korea)

2955
01:38:40,162 --> 01:38:43,432
(Abu Dhabi)

2956
01:38:43,632 --> 01:38:46,172
(Abu Dhabi)

2957
01:38:53,442 --> 01:38:58,012
(A kingdom of endless desert)

2958
01:38:59,882 --> 01:39:02,782
(In the middle of the desert...)

2959
01:39:05,552 --> 01:39:07,592
(stands the oasis of civilization.)

2960
01:39:08,222 --> 01:39:10,491
(A mixture of modern landscapes...)

2961
01:39:10,492 --> 01:39:13,062
(and traditional aspects)

2962
01:39:13,562 --> 01:39:15,192
(Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque)

2963
01:39:15,432 --> 01:39:17,002
(Emirates Palace)

2964
01:39:17,232 --> 01:39:19,002
(Louvre Abu Dhabi)

2965
01:39:19,432 --> 01:39:21,132
(A world-renowned city of architecture, )

2966
01:39:22,002 --> 01:39:23,872
(and the capital city of the UAE)

2967
01:39:25,572 --> 01:39:27,071
(With sports...)

2968
01:39:27,072 --> 01:39:29,681
(and grand performances that the whole world watches)

2969
01:39:29,682 --> 01:39:31,012
(Hummus)

2970
01:39:31,112 --> 01:39:32,652
(Falafel)

2971
01:39:33,312 --> 01:39:36,682
(A city filled with delicious dishes)

2972
01:39:37,652 --> 01:39:39,922
(Welcome to Abu Dhabi!)

2973
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:43,361
(4 secret agents have arrived in this city.)

2974
01:39:43,362 --> 01:39:47,031
(Current hour 6am, before sunrise)

2975
01:39:47,032 --> 01:39:48,191
The weather is so nice!

2976
01:39:48,192 --> 01:39:49,561
Just the temperature we like!

2977
01:39:49,562 --> 01:39:51,031
- Yes! - It's just right!

2978
01:39:51,032 --> 01:39:52,562
- This is it! - It's perfect.

2979
01:39:52,972 --> 01:39:55,001
- We love this temperature. - It's so nice.

2980
01:39:55,002 --> 01:39:56,502
The air conditioner isn't on, right?

2981
01:39:56,642 --> 01:39:58,341
- It's the best. - This is so "Love is an Open Door."

2982
01:39:58,342 --> 01:40:01,172
(Starting right away)

2983
01:40:02,812 --> 01:40:03,941
(The woman's verse)

2984
01:40:03,942 --> 01:40:05,041
(The man's verse)

2985
01:40:05,042 --> 01:40:06,712
(The enthusiastic chorus)

2986
01:40:08,152 --> 01:40:09,321
- Door - With you

2987
01:40:09,322 --> 01:40:10,421
- With you! - With you!

2988
01:40:10,422 --> 01:40:11,422
With you!

2989
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:16,112
You were actually okay for some parts.

2990
01:40:16,392 --> 01:40:18,291
(Starting again)

2991
01:40:18,292 --> 01:40:19,292
We have arrived

2992
01:40:19,293 --> 01:40:21,692
We're really, truly, excited

2993
01:40:21,792 --> 01:40:23,792
(Surprisingly, this is how hyped they are at 6am.)

2994
01:40:24,132 --> 01:40:26,701
- We've arrived in Abu Dhabi! - Abu Dhabi!

2995
01:40:26,702 --> 01:40:28,332
(Harmonizing)

2996
01:40:28,732 --> 01:40:30,972
(Let's get in the car.)

2997
01:40:31,372 --> 01:40:32,841
We have arrived in Abu Dhabi!

2998
01:40:32,842 --> 01:40:34,511
- Yes! - Let's go!

2999
01:40:34,512 --> 01:40:36,612
- Abu Dhabi! - Abu Dhabi!

3000
01:40:36,942 --> 01:40:39,581
(For the hyped members, we prepared...)

3001
01:40:39,582 --> 01:40:41,152
(Nana's city tour!)

3002
01:40:41,552 --> 01:40:42,882
This is great.

3003
01:40:43,352 --> 01:40:46,921
We're going to tour the city from here,

3004
01:40:46,922 --> 01:40:49,422
- Great! - and then we can get brunch.

3005
01:40:49,662 --> 01:40:50,991
The sun hasn't come up yet, right?

3006
01:40:50,992 --> 01:40:51,992
It's so dark.

3007
01:40:51,993 --> 01:40:53,631
I think it'll come up soon.

3008
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,638
(It's still dark before sunrise.)

3009
01:40:54,662 --> 01:40:57,562
The windows are tinted since the sun is so bright here.

3010
01:40:58,402 --> 01:41:00,502
- The whole country? - It looks darker in the car.

3011
01:41:01,302 --> 01:41:04,102
(It may not be the ideal tour that they want.)

3012
01:41:04,372 --> 01:41:07,072
Producer Na! Are we going to ride camels?

3013
01:41:07,172 --> 01:41:08,371
I don't think we're going to ride camels.

3014
01:41:08,372 --> 01:41:09,781
I'd still like to see them.

3015
01:41:09,782 --> 01:41:11,741
We might be able to see them passing by.

3016
01:41:11,742 --> 01:41:13,011
- Passing by? - Okay.

3017
01:41:13,012 --> 01:41:15,151
- We're passing the coin building. - Yes, the coin building.

3018
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:16,582
The coin building? What's that?

3019
01:41:17,722 --> 01:41:18,751
(The Aldar Headquarters)

3020
01:41:18,752 --> 01:41:19,791
(The first circular skyscraper in the world)

3021
01:41:19,792 --> 01:41:20,868
(It's called the coin building because of its shape.)

3022
01:41:20,892 --> 01:41:23,252
(At 110m, the size is overwhelming when seen in real life.)

3023
01:41:23,762 --> 01:41:25,221
It's the first circular building...

3024
01:41:25,222 --> 01:41:27,431
- to be built in the world. - Gosh.

3025
01:41:27,432 --> 01:41:28,461
Where? What part of it is circular?

3026
01:41:28,462 --> 01:41:30,108
- We just passed it on the right. - I see.

3027
01:41:30,132 --> 01:41:31,961
You told us we could tour the city,

3028
01:41:31,962 --> 01:41:33,282
but you're just passing right by.

3029
01:41:33,902 --> 01:41:35,071
What are we supposed to be seeing?

3030
01:41:35,072 --> 01:41:37,201
Could you do something with these tinted windows?

3031
01:41:37,202 --> 01:41:39,542
And we can only see the camels by chance.

3032
01:41:40,212 --> 01:41:41,441
- I mean... - Okay, in just a few minutes,

3033
01:41:41,442 --> 01:41:43,782
the Grand Mosque of Abu Dhabi will show up.

3034
01:41:44,142 --> 01:41:46,011
Keep your eyes open, guys. It's going to go by in a flash.

3035
01:41:46,012 --> 01:41:47,012
Right.

3036
01:41:47,013 --> 01:41:48,111
It's still dark,

3037
01:41:48,112 --> 01:41:49,722
- so really try and focus. - Okay.

3038
01:41:50,382 --> 01:41:51,821
- Where? - Is that it?

3039
01:41:51,822 --> 01:41:53,751
- It's at ten o'clock. - It's at eight o'clock.

3040
01:41:53,752 --> 01:41:54,752
(Excited)

3041
01:41:54,753 --> 01:41:56,022
There! That's it!

3042
01:41:56,322 --> 01:41:57,391
(The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque)

3043
01:41:57,392 --> 01:41:58,591
(One of the largest Islamic mosques in the world)

3044
01:41:58,592 --> 01:42:00,552
(It's famous for its luxurious and grand design.)

3045
01:42:00,632 --> 01:42:02,161
(As a landmark of Abu Dhabi, it is a sight to behold...)

3046
01:42:02,162 --> 01:42:04,522
(with its pristine white marbles paired with the blue sky.)

3047
01:42:06,272 --> 01:42:07,272
Wait, where?

3048
01:42:07,273 --> 01:42:09,502
- Over there at ten o'clock. - Oh, those circles.

3049
01:42:09,742 --> 01:42:11,342
- At ten o'clock. - That?

3050
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:12,842
Is that it, then?

3051
01:42:12,942 --> 01:42:14,012
- Oh, my. - But...

3052
01:42:14,172 --> 01:42:16,681
I think we were scammed with this package deal.

3053
01:42:16,682 --> 01:42:18,381
We need to get a refund.

3054
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:20,211
- We should leave a review. - Right?

3055
01:42:20,212 --> 01:42:21,951
It's fading away.

3056
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:24,251
"The Egg Is Coming Tour is really terrible."

3057
01:42:24,252 --> 01:42:25,651
(This travel agency is the worst.)

3058
01:42:25,652 --> 01:42:26,752
Seriously.

3059
01:42:27,352 --> 01:42:29,022
We can't go there, right?

3060
01:42:29,092 --> 01:42:31,561
Well, we might visit later.

3061
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:32,592
I see.

3062
01:42:32,722 --> 01:42:34,661
- That means we won't go. - That's right. We won't go.

3063
01:42:34,662 --> 01:42:35,742
(They see through the lie.)

3064
01:42:35,832 --> 01:42:38,101
(They head over to the next location.)

3065
01:42:38,102 --> 01:42:39,131
That must be it.

3066
01:42:39,132 --> 01:42:40,732
- Is that it? It might fall. - Yes.

3067
01:42:40,932 --> 01:42:43,471
(They trust the package tour once more.)

3068
01:42:43,472 --> 01:42:44,841
It's called ADNOC.

3069
01:42:44,842 --> 01:42:45,972
- ADNOC. - ADNOC.

3070
01:42:46,112 --> 01:42:47,411
It's a national oil company.

3071
01:42:47,412 --> 01:42:49,011
- I see. It's an oil company. - My goodness.

3072
01:42:49,012 --> 01:42:50,012
- What's that? - I see.

3073
01:42:50,013 --> 01:42:51,241
- Gosh. - It's cool.

3074
01:42:51,242 --> 01:42:52,341
- It's cool. - It isn't that building,

3075
01:42:52,342 --> 01:42:53,451
- Hyun Yong. - ADNOC.

3076
01:42:53,452 --> 01:42:55,151
- It isn't that building. - Is it the wrong building?

3077
01:42:55,152 --> 01:42:56,851
Is that so? I can't believe it.

3078
01:42:56,852 --> 01:42:58,451
- What's up with this package tour? - We marveled...

3079
01:42:58,452 --> 01:43:01,122
- at the wrong building. - I couldn't see it.

3080
01:43:01,222 --> 01:43:02,962
What's up with this package tour?

3081
01:43:03,122 --> 01:43:05,592
(This is what the real ADNOC building looks like.)

3082
01:43:05,692 --> 01:43:08,232
(It looks like a wafer cookie.)

3083
01:43:08,362 --> 01:43:10,702
(They passed by ADNEC, a national exhibition company.)

3084
01:43:13,232 --> 01:43:15,402
(The buildings look completely different.)

3085
01:43:15,632 --> 01:43:18,571
- I'm sorry. - We should get a partial refund.

3086
01:43:18,572 --> 01:43:19,611
- Seriously. - For real.

3087
01:43:19,612 --> 01:43:21,841
This is a place where...

3088
01:43:21,842 --> 01:43:23,642
all the funds gather.

3089
01:43:24,142 --> 01:43:27,212
(The lambs get dazzled by his glibness.)

3090
01:43:27,382 --> 01:43:29,882
I can feel the wealth.

3091
01:43:30,152 --> 01:43:33,022
(The city view of Abu Dhabi catches their eyes.)

3092
01:43:33,352 --> 01:43:35,791
Gosh, it's so big.

3093
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:37,061
I want to live in a place like this.

3094
01:43:37,062 --> 01:43:38,761
I think it'll be nice.

3095
01:43:38,762 --> 01:43:40,691
If we're still single even after ten years,

3096
01:43:40,692 --> 01:43:42,661
- let's live together. - No, Eun Ji.

3097
01:43:42,662 --> 01:43:44,261
- All four of us? - In Abu Dhabi.

3098
01:43:44,262 --> 01:43:45,832
I think it'll get tiring.

3099
01:43:46,472 --> 01:43:48,202
(Her actual thought comes out.)

3100
01:43:48,232 --> 01:43:49,972
(Glaring)

3101
01:43:50,172 --> 01:43:51,672
I think it'll get tiring.

3102
01:43:52,572 --> 01:43:54,311
(Her excessive honesty...)

3103
01:43:54,312 --> 01:43:56,282
(makes Eun Ji laugh.)

3104
01:43:56,942 --> 01:43:58,841
We'd be happier to see each other if we get a break in between.

3105
01:43:58,842 --> 01:44:00,581
The maximum duration is six days, to be honest.

3106
01:44:00,582 --> 01:44:02,481
- Exactly. - The maximum duration is four days.

3107
01:44:02,482 --> 01:44:03,521
Is it four days?

3108
01:44:03,522 --> 01:44:05,521
If we do our best and hold out, it's six days.

3109
01:44:05,522 --> 01:44:06,951
- Six days. - This is only the first day.

3110
01:44:06,952 --> 01:44:08,291
That's why we need a laptop.

3111
01:44:08,292 --> 01:44:09,491
- Exactly. - That's right.

3112
01:44:09,492 --> 01:44:11,391
No matter how hard I think about it, we need a laptop.

3113
01:44:11,392 --> 01:44:12,991
- We need a laptop. - I know.

3114
01:44:12,992 --> 01:44:14,262
In that case,

3115
01:44:14,492 --> 01:44:16,301
why don't we play a simple game to determine...

3116
01:44:16,302 --> 01:44:17,961
whether we or you guys buy...

3117
01:44:17,962 --> 01:44:19,261
- the laptop? - Now?

3118
01:44:19,262 --> 01:44:20,601
- Now? - Right now.

3119
01:44:20,602 --> 01:44:22,471
- Right now? - Get ready.

3120
01:44:22,472 --> 01:44:24,341
- Hold on. - It isn't a new game.

3121
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:25,402
This is incredible.

3122
01:44:26,002 --> 01:44:27,971
It's a very simple game. Play the Hunminjeongeum Game...

3123
01:44:27,972 --> 01:44:29,882
- until you arrive. - What was that game?

3124
01:44:30,312 --> 01:44:33,081
In about ten minutes,

3125
01:44:33,082 --> 01:44:35,051
we'll arrive at the cafe.

3126
01:44:35,052 --> 01:44:36,681
If you use English or other foreign languages,

3127
01:44:36,682 --> 01:44:38,022
- you lose. - I see.

3128
01:44:38,052 --> 01:44:39,592
I see. Okay.

3129
01:44:39,792 --> 01:44:40,851
- Oh, no. - This is insane.

3130
01:44:40,852 --> 01:44:42,391
- It's our biggest weakness. - Yes.

3131
01:44:42,392 --> 01:44:44,591
- You might stop talking altogether. - Yes.

3132
01:44:44,592 --> 01:44:46,791
If you stay silent for three seconds, you lose.

3133
01:44:46,792 --> 01:44:48,431
Do all four of us need to talk?

3134
01:44:48,432 --> 01:44:50,201
- You need to talk nonstop. - Okay.

3135
01:44:50,202 --> 01:44:51,261
- Okay. - Okay?

3136
01:44:51,262 --> 01:44:52,631
- Are you ready? - Yes.

3137
01:44:52,632 --> 01:44:53,902
Let's begin.

3138
01:44:54,772 --> 01:44:56,841
So that we can acquire an electronic device,

3139
01:44:56,842 --> 01:44:58,041
- let's do our best. - That's right.

3140
01:44:58,042 --> 01:44:59,341
That's right.

3141
01:44:59,342 --> 01:45:01,011
- Let's do that. - Let's go.

3142
01:45:01,012 --> 01:45:02,911
- Why did I forget to bring... - Let's do our best.

3143
01:45:02,912 --> 01:45:04,481
My electronic device?

3144
01:45:04,482 --> 01:45:06,581
- It's okay, Eun Ji. - It's okay.

3145
01:45:06,582 --> 01:45:08,411
We can acquire it now.

3146
01:45:08,412 --> 01:45:09,451
- We can acquire it. - Yes.

3147
01:45:09,452 --> 01:45:11,151
- Let's go. - Let's do our best.

3148
01:45:11,152 --> 01:45:12,921
- Let's go. - This particular game is...

3149
01:45:12,922 --> 01:45:14,621
- my weakness. - It's your big weakness.

3150
01:45:14,622 --> 01:45:16,461
So I'll be a bit quiet.

3151
01:45:16,462 --> 01:45:17,521
- Okay. - It's okay.

3152
01:45:17,522 --> 01:45:19,561
- Speak less. - Since you came all the way here,

3153
01:45:19,562 --> 01:45:20,831
enjoy sightseeing.

3154
01:45:20,832 --> 01:45:22,631
- Thank you. - We're going...

3155
01:45:22,632 --> 01:45:24,401
to Emirates Palace.

3156
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:25,808
(They're on their guard right away.)

3157
01:45:25,832 --> 01:45:27,271
- It's a pretty name. - Yes.

3158
01:45:27,272 --> 01:45:29,401
- It's a palace. - Palace.

3159
01:45:29,402 --> 01:45:31,641
- What? In the message... - Suddenly...

3160
01:45:31,642 --> 01:45:33,641
- we received earlier, - Okay.

3161
01:45:33,642 --> 01:45:35,172
- Torong was there. - Yes.

3162
01:45:35,442 --> 01:45:37,412
- Is it the place... - Yes.

3163
01:45:37,512 --> 01:45:39,411
- in Torong's message? - Is that the place?

3164
01:45:39,412 --> 01:45:40,811
- Yes, it's a hotel. - A luxury hotel.

3165
01:45:40,812 --> 01:45:43,181
It's incredibly big for a hotel.

3166
01:45:43,182 --> 01:45:45,252
It must be very expensive.

3167
01:45:46,182 --> 01:45:47,652
Will we go there too?

3168
01:45:47,822 --> 01:45:50,322
- Will we stay for a night? - Will we do that?

3169
01:45:50,362 --> 01:45:51,362
We'll pass by.

3170
01:45:51,363 --> 01:45:52,791
- We'll pass by. - Will we only pass by?

3171
01:45:52,792 --> 01:45:54,661
In which place...

3172
01:45:54,662 --> 01:45:56,031
- will we sleep? - Where will we sleep?

3173
01:45:56,032 --> 01:45:57,961
You need to meet Agent F.

3174
01:45:57,962 --> 01:46:00,231
- We know the agent by that name. - A secret agent.

3175
01:46:00,232 --> 01:46:01,671
- That agent. - By the way,

3176
01:46:01,672 --> 01:46:02,771
where do you guys want to sleep?

3177
01:46:02,772 --> 01:46:04,101
Somewhere grand.

3178
01:46:04,102 --> 01:46:07,242
Torong went to an eight-star hotel,

3179
01:46:07,542 --> 01:46:09,012
so we're jealous.

3180
01:46:09,312 --> 01:46:11,011
- We're very jealous. - You speak...

3181
01:46:11,012 --> 01:46:13,411
- in a fast and accurate way. - You speak fast.

3182
01:46:13,412 --> 01:46:14,951
- I'm good, right? - Yes.

3183
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:16,821
- I'm good. - Mimi can speak as she wants.

3184
01:46:16,822 --> 01:46:18,151
- She doesn't make a mistake. - No.

3185
01:46:18,152 --> 01:46:19,152
(3 seconds)
(2 seconds)

3186
01:46:20,292 --> 01:46:22,122
Does our hotel have...

3187
01:46:22,152 --> 01:46:25,122
a swimming pool?

3188
01:46:25,362 --> 01:46:26,531
- All right. - It's very important.

3189
01:46:26,532 --> 01:46:27,692
Our hotel...

3190
01:46:29,492 --> 01:46:31,031
(Please...)

3191
01:46:31,032 --> 01:46:33,931
has the best swimming pool in Abu Dhabi.

3192
01:46:33,932 --> 01:46:34,971
(Mouthing)

3193
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:36,642
- I love it. - Let's clap.

3194
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:38,141
(Clapping wordlessly)

3195
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:39,341
Let's clap.

3196
01:46:39,342 --> 01:46:40,941
- Did you guys bring a swimsuit? - Yes.

3197
01:46:40,942 --> 01:46:42,772
- Really? - Of course.

3198
01:46:43,182 --> 01:46:44,182
Yes.

3199
01:46:44,212 --> 01:46:45,812
How many did you bring?

3200
01:46:45,842 --> 01:46:46,881
Two.

3201
01:46:46,882 --> 01:46:47,951
(Well done.)

3202
01:46:47,952 --> 01:46:49,482
Good.

3203
01:46:49,722 --> 01:46:51,152
Yes.

3204
01:46:51,752 --> 01:46:54,252
- Yes. I said, "Yes." - What?

3205
01:46:54,752 --> 01:46:55,791
Yes.

3206
01:46:55,792 --> 01:46:57,692
You were answering.

3207
01:46:57,792 --> 01:47:00,391
We're doing an incredible job right now.

3208
01:47:00,392 --> 01:47:01,991
- Yes. - How are we so good...

3209
01:47:01,992 --> 01:47:03,331
- at this game? - Today...

3210
01:47:03,332 --> 01:47:05,232
Don't say that.

3211
01:47:05,662 --> 01:47:08,132
That's foreshadowing.

3212
01:47:08,502 --> 01:47:10,501
"How are we so good at this game?"

3213
01:47:10,502 --> 01:47:12,372
- Such a comment... - Young Ji.

3214
01:47:12,442 --> 01:47:15,312
You're the one...

3215
01:47:15,472 --> 01:47:19,511
- who mostly say such words. - Yes.

3216
01:47:19,512 --> 01:47:21,411
- That's right. - I'll be careful.

3217
01:47:21,412 --> 01:47:22,551
Refrain from talking.

3218
01:47:22,552 --> 01:47:23,751
I'll be careful.

3219
01:47:23,752 --> 01:47:25,181
- Okay. - I think it'll be a success.

3220
01:47:25,182 --> 01:47:26,751
We're past the halfway point.

3221
01:47:26,752 --> 01:47:28,591
Exactly. We're doing well.

3222
01:47:28,592 --> 01:47:30,122
(Remaining time: 4 minutes)

3223
01:47:30,222 --> 01:47:32,921
Young Ji, you visited Dubai not too long ago.

3224
01:47:32,922 --> 01:47:35,491
- That's right. - Did you try...

3225
01:47:35,492 --> 01:47:38,161
some local dishes? Do you have any recommendations?

3226
01:47:38,162 --> 01:47:41,471
Is there a dish we must try here?

3227
01:47:41,472 --> 01:47:42,501
I'm so curious.

3228
01:47:42,502 --> 01:47:43,801
A dish we must try.

3229
01:47:43,802 --> 01:47:45,101
- There are many. - Yes.

3230
01:47:45,102 --> 01:47:48,871
Dubai chocolate comes from a neighboring city.

3231
01:47:48,872 --> 01:47:51,611
Dubai snack.

3232
01:47:51,612 --> 01:47:52,682
(Nodding)

3233
01:47:53,482 --> 01:47:54,851
(No one heard it, right?)

3234
01:47:54,852 --> 01:47:57,082
(I'm sure no one heard it.)

3235
01:47:57,182 --> 01:47:59,952
(Glancing over)

3236
01:48:00,022 --> 01:48:01,792
- I think she did something. - What is it?

3237
01:48:02,152 --> 01:48:03,321
(Laughing)

3238
01:48:03,322 --> 01:48:05,022
I think Young Ji did something.

3239
01:48:05,462 --> 01:48:07,161
- Young Ji. - Come on.

3240
01:48:07,162 --> 01:48:08,591
- Hold on. - Wait a second.

3241
01:48:08,592 --> 01:48:11,061
- You know... - Hold on.

3242
01:48:11,062 --> 01:48:12,931
There was...

3243
01:48:12,932 --> 01:48:15,101
- a big confusion. - What?

3244
01:48:15,102 --> 01:48:17,202
You know, I'm curious.

3245
01:48:17,772 --> 01:48:19,771
- How much is forgivable? - That's right.

3246
01:48:19,772 --> 01:48:21,311
Let me explain what happened.

3247
01:48:21,312 --> 01:48:24,581
- I didn't hear it. - Producer Yeong Seok...

3248
01:48:24,582 --> 01:48:26,142
- What? - What?

3249
01:48:26,482 --> 01:48:27,911
"Producer Yeong Seok?"

3250
01:48:27,912 --> 01:48:29,752
- Before that... - You failed!

3251
01:48:30,322 --> 01:48:32,481
What? "Producer Yeong Seok?"

3252
01:48:32,482 --> 01:48:33,952
(Looking away right away)

3253
01:48:34,022 --> 01:48:35,391
- You failed. - There was...

3254
01:48:35,392 --> 01:48:36,791
- already a fraudulent act. - But...

3255
01:48:36,792 --> 01:48:37,921
- it was forgiven. - Let me explain.

3256
01:48:37,922 --> 01:48:38,991
- Seriously. - Producer Yeong Seok...

3257
01:48:38,992 --> 01:48:40,331
talked about Dubai chocolate...

3258
01:48:40,332 --> 01:48:41,891
and Eun Ji said, "Dubai snack."

3259
01:48:41,892 --> 01:48:43,762
She said that.

3260
01:48:44,102 --> 01:48:45,531
If I hadn't heard it,

3261
01:48:45,532 --> 01:48:47,702
I would've gritted my teeth and ignored it.

3262
01:48:47,772 --> 01:48:48,871
- But both of us heard it. - Dubai...

3263
01:48:48,872 --> 01:48:50,271
- snack. - Eun Ji.

3264
01:48:50,272 --> 01:48:52,571
"Producer Yeong Seok" was the finishing touch.

3265
01:48:52,572 --> 01:48:53,572
- Seriously. - I'm sorry.

3266
01:48:53,573 --> 01:48:55,511
I was going to let "Dubai" pass...

3267
01:48:55,512 --> 01:48:57,211
- because it was a neighboring city. - What?

3268
01:48:57,212 --> 01:48:58,982
But "Producer Yeong Seok..."

3269
01:48:59,112 --> 01:49:00,112
(Blaming)

3270
01:49:00,113 --> 01:49:02,812
- Sir Yeong Seok. - No.

3271
01:49:04,152 --> 01:49:05,451
- Mr. Yeong Seok. - Big Brother. Mr. Yeong Seok.

3272
01:49:05,452 --> 01:49:06,621
Sir Yeong Seok.

3273
01:49:06,622 --> 01:49:07,951
Sir Yeong Seok. Sir Hyun Yong.

3274
01:49:07,952 --> 01:49:09,021
(They fail the Hunminjeongeum Game.)

3275
01:49:09,022 --> 01:49:10,421
- You're too cruel to me. - Yeong Seok.

3276
01:49:10,422 --> 01:49:11,721
At this moment...

3277
01:49:11,722 --> 01:49:13,368
- The wafer cookie? - We're passing by ADNOC.

3278
01:49:13,392 --> 01:49:15,832
(ADNOC appears in the sad moment.)

3279
01:49:15,892 --> 01:49:16,961
- The wafer cookie. - The wafer cookie.

3280
01:49:16,962 --> 01:49:18,301
ADNOC. What's the building name?

3281
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:19,701
- ADNOC. - What's the building name?

3282
01:49:19,702 --> 01:49:21,671
- Oh, my gosh. I'm really upset. - I think...

3283
01:49:21,672 --> 01:49:23,301
it's so straight and so long.

3284
01:49:23,302 --> 01:49:25,171
- Yes. Oh, my gosh. - It's so straight and so long.

3285
01:49:25,172 --> 01:49:26,948
(A member who's suddenly angry and a member who just exclaims)

3286
01:49:26,972 --> 01:49:29,111
- So gorgeous. It looks so crunchy. - Yes.

3287
01:49:29,112 --> 01:49:31,011
- Yes. - What you see...

3288
01:49:31,012 --> 01:49:32,681
on the left is the Emirates Palace.

3289
01:49:32,682 --> 01:49:34,111
- Emirates Palace. - Emirates Palace.

3290
01:49:34,112 --> 01:49:36,011
- Yes. - I knew it.

3291
01:49:36,012 --> 01:49:37,081
Holy...

3292
01:49:37,082 --> 01:49:39,022
- Do you guys want anything? - Yes.

3293
01:49:39,352 --> 01:49:41,351
- It's so pretty. - It looks like a palace.

3294
01:49:41,352 --> 01:49:42,792
It's so brown.

3295
01:49:43,152 --> 01:49:45,191
- It cost 3 to 4 billion dollars. - I want to buy it.

3296
01:49:45,192 --> 01:49:47,631
- Three billion dollars. - Three billion dollras.

3297
01:49:47,632 --> 01:49:49,132
Infinite.

3298
01:49:49,232 --> 01:49:52,602
(They go to a photo spot.)

3299
01:49:52,732 --> 01:49:53,831
Let's drop by the photo spot...

3300
01:49:53,832 --> 01:49:55,101
- for a photo. - Let's take a photo.

3301
01:49:55,102 --> 01:49:56,872
- In this state? - Our faces aren't ready.

3302
01:49:56,902 --> 01:49:59,342
- We aren't in the mood right. - It's for promotions, right?

3303
01:49:59,402 --> 01:50:01,082
- In this state? - Our faces aren't ready.

3304
01:50:01,542 --> 01:50:03,412
I don't get these kids.

3305
01:50:04,412 --> 01:50:05,481
I mean...

3306
01:50:05,482 --> 01:50:06,842
(It's so fun to tease Yeong Seok.)

3307
01:50:06,912 --> 01:50:08,711
Earlier, they took...

3308
01:50:08,712 --> 01:50:10,881
so many photos.

3309
01:50:10,882 --> 01:50:12,121
- They complained about... - I mean...

3310
01:50:12,122 --> 01:50:13,321
not being able to see anything.

3311
01:50:13,322 --> 01:50:14,921
- When we offer to drop them off, - Producer.

3312
01:50:14,922 --> 01:50:16,391
- they don't want it. - Producer.

3313
01:50:16,392 --> 01:50:17,661
- Our faces aren't ready. - That's right.

3314
01:50:17,662 --> 01:50:19,521
- We aren't wearing any makeup. - Right now...

3315
01:50:19,522 --> 01:50:21,361
Our faces are ruined.

3316
01:50:21,362 --> 01:50:23,401
- It's our faces. - It's okay. Thank you, Yeong Seok.

3317
01:50:23,402 --> 01:50:24,901
- Thank you, Yeong Seok. - Thank you for your consideration.

3318
01:50:24,902 --> 01:50:26,061
By the way, thank you.

3319
01:50:26,062 --> 01:50:27,471
- We love you. - Thank you for your consideration.

3320
01:50:27,472 --> 01:50:28,931
We appreciate the thought.

3321
01:50:28,932 --> 01:50:31,272
- We appreciate the thought. - We appreciate it.

3322
01:50:32,602 --> 01:50:33,741
(It's fun to tease him.)

3323
01:50:33,742 --> 01:50:36,311
Stay in the bus. We'll go and take some photos.

3324
01:50:36,312 --> 01:50:37,911
Can we really live without a laptop?

3325
01:50:37,912 --> 01:50:39,511
- No. - How about Kendrick Lamar?

3326
01:50:39,512 --> 01:50:40,811
- We must watch the performance. - We must watch it.

3327
01:50:40,812 --> 01:50:42,752
(Their bodies are itching already.)

3328
01:50:42,882 --> 01:50:44,651
- We must watch it. - What should we do?

3329
01:50:44,652 --> 01:50:46,452
- We must watch it. - We need a laptop.

3330
01:50:46,592 --> 01:50:47,691
Let's pay half each.

3331
01:50:47,692 --> 01:50:48,692
- Half? - Half.

3332
01:50:48,693 --> 01:50:50,121
But the Hunminjeongeum Game...

3333
01:50:50,122 --> 01:50:51,761
- Paying half each won't be fun. - Okay.

3334
01:50:51,762 --> 01:50:52,762
Then...

3335
01:50:53,962 --> 01:50:56,491
- My goodness. - Woo Jung wants me to stop.

3336
01:50:56,492 --> 01:50:57,631
Woo Jung...

3337
01:50:57,632 --> 01:50:59,971
Woo Jung went, "Stop talking and come on out."

3338
01:50:59,972 --> 01:51:00,972
"Okay."

3339
01:51:00,973 --> 01:51:02,278
(Yeong Seok turned around right away.)

3340
01:51:02,302 --> 01:51:04,242
How does he listen so well?

3341
01:51:04,442 --> 01:51:05,841
Yeong Seok is...

3342
01:51:05,842 --> 01:51:07,372
Woo Jung's ChatGPT.

3343
01:51:07,542 --> 01:51:09,771
(She has been steering the wheel for a while.)

3344
01:51:09,772 --> 01:51:10,812
NaGPT.

3345
01:51:11,312 --> 01:51:12,412
NaGPT.

3346
01:51:12,542 --> 01:51:14,111
We should've filmed it.

3347
01:51:14,112 --> 01:51:15,911
- It's too bad that only I saw it. - You didn't film it, right?

3348
01:51:15,912 --> 01:51:17,681
Yeong Seok turned around. It's too bad.

3349
01:51:17,682 --> 01:51:19,151
The teamwork was so funny.

3350
01:51:19,152 --> 01:51:20,291
It was unbelievable.

3351
01:51:20,292 --> 01:51:21,591
It would've been the second-best short video.

3352
01:51:21,592 --> 01:51:23,862
- It's too bad that only I saw it. - I feel the same.

3353
01:51:23,962 --> 01:51:25,421
Would you show us the teamwork again?

3354
01:51:25,422 --> 01:51:27,032
- Would you do it again? - Yes.

3355
01:51:27,162 --> 01:51:28,431
- Do it again. - Seriously.

3356
01:51:28,432 --> 01:51:30,238
- What do you want me to do? - Do the same thing. "Okay."

3357
01:51:30,262 --> 01:51:31,301
All right.

3358
01:51:31,302 --> 01:51:35,731
But the Hunminjeongeum Game isn't much of a game, to be honest.

3359
01:51:35,732 --> 01:51:38,141
- In that case... - You didn't do that.

3360
01:51:38,142 --> 01:51:39,571
- You didn't do that. - That wasn't it.

3361
01:51:39,572 --> 01:51:41,311
Say "Okay" and turn around.

3362
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,941
- Try it again once more. - "Okay."

3363
01:51:42,942 --> 01:51:44,411
- Yeong Seok. - Yes.

3364
01:51:44,412 --> 01:51:46,011
The Hunminjeongeum Game isn't much of a game, to be honest.

3365
01:51:46,012 --> 01:51:47,051
Yes?

3366
01:51:47,052 --> 01:51:48,311
(The timing is the worst.)

3367
01:51:48,312 --> 01:51:49,351
He can't do it.

3368
01:51:49,352 --> 01:51:50,921
- You said, "Okay." - For goodness' sake.

3369
01:51:50,922 --> 01:51:53,002
How did he win an award at the Baeksang Arts Awards?

3370
01:51:53,722 --> 01:51:54,851
How did he win an award at the Baeksang Arts Awards?

3371
01:51:54,852 --> 01:51:57,522
(Na Yeong Seok, Best Male Variety Performer Award)

3372
01:51:58,022 --> 01:52:00,432
(Joking)

3373
01:52:00,832 --> 01:52:02,561
I didn't win it for my acting skills, okay?

3374
01:52:02,562 --> 01:52:04,002
(Laughing)

3375
01:52:04,602 --> 01:52:05,831
I won it for a variety show.

3376
01:52:05,832 --> 01:52:06,832
You guys...

3377
01:52:06,902 --> 01:52:09,532
Hey, I won the award because you guys did well.

3378
01:52:09,732 --> 01:52:12,141
- Isn't it what Eun Ji did earlier? - Yes.

3379
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:15,041
"Look down. The top of your head is pretty."

3380
01:52:15,042 --> 01:52:16,271
"I won the award because you guys did well."

3381
01:52:16,272 --> 01:52:17,441
- "You guys did well." - That was sudden.

3382
01:52:17,442 --> 01:52:19,281
- That's right. - "I won it thanks to you guys."

3383
01:52:19,282 --> 01:52:20,881
That's my job.

3384
01:52:20,882 --> 01:52:22,752
(His rebellion begins.)

3385
01:52:22,912 --> 01:52:24,852
(The theme of the Morning Mission is...)

3386
01:52:25,252 --> 01:52:26,482
(a digital detox.)

3387
01:52:26,922 --> 01:52:28,591
(Your phones...)

3388
01:52:28,592 --> 01:52:30,121
(will be confiscated.)

3389
01:52:30,122 --> 01:52:31,122
(Is this a school trip?)

3390
01:52:31,123 --> 01:52:32,562
(I'm 23 years old.)

3391
01:52:32,792 --> 01:52:34,662
(The homeroom teacher is angry.)

3392
01:52:35,032 --> 01:52:38,501
(Everyone's phone gets confiscated.)

3393
01:52:38,502 --> 01:52:39,902
(They get locked away.)

3394
01:52:42,202 --> 01:52:43,942
(I need to take selfies.)

3395
01:52:44,002 --> 01:52:45,341
(She's getting the withdrawal symptoms right away.)

3396
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:47,072
(It isn't the end.)

3397
01:52:47,442 --> 01:52:48,512
(A mouth detox)

3398
01:52:48,642 --> 01:52:50,122
(Now, he even controls their mouths.)

3399
01:52:50,282 --> 01:52:52,411
(Hold on. No, hold on.)

3400
01:52:52,412 --> 01:52:54,211
(It's too personal.)

3401
01:52:54,212 --> 01:52:56,082
(You just want to make us go quiet.)

3402
01:52:56,282 --> 01:52:57,282
(What kind of a variety show...)

3403
01:52:57,283 --> 01:52:59,282
(tells the cast members not to speak?)

3404
01:52:59,552 --> 01:53:01,222
(That's what I'm saying.)

3405
01:53:06,292 --> 01:53:08,591
(Finger lickin' good.)

3406
01:53:08,592 --> 01:53:10,432
(Then comes the biggest one.)

3407
01:53:10,932 --> 01:53:13,102
(If you fail this mission, )

3408
01:53:13,332 --> 01:53:15,971
(you'll follow the same schedule.)

3409
01:53:15,972 --> 01:53:17,802
(- Won't it get aired? - We won't film it.)

3410
01:53:17,972 --> 01:53:19,672
(The final boss: Camera detox)

3411
01:53:19,802 --> 01:53:22,071
(I hate it so much!)

3412
01:53:22,072 --> 01:53:25,382
(I work hard because there are cameras!)

3413
01:53:25,642 --> 01:53:28,081
(A match of the century...)

3414
01:53:28,082 --> 01:53:30,082
(with a camera detox on the line)

3415
01:53:30,322 --> 01:53:31,352
It's okay.

3416
01:53:33,222 --> 01:53:35,052
(Coming soon)

3417
01:53:35,207 --> 01:53:37,477
(The first restaurant suits their tastes.)

3418
01:53:37,847 --> 01:53:40,346
(It's what the royals of Abu Dhabi enjoy.)

3419
01:53:40,347 --> 01:53:42,046
(Royal breakfast set)

3420
01:53:42,047 --> 01:53:43,047

(Siot, bieup)

3423
01:53:46,917 --> 01:53:49,056
(The members break down before the initials.)

3424
01:53:49,057 --> 01:53:50,263
(Do you get to eat the dishes we lose?)

3425
01:53:50,287 --> 01:53:51,407
(No one else will claim it.)

3426
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:54,596
(Yeong Seok explodes before food.)

3427
01:53:54,597 --> 01:53:55,597
(What are you doing?)

3428
01:53:55,598 --> 01:53:56,757
(It's our food!)

3429
01:53:57,197 --> 01:53:58,767
(Forget it. We won't do anything.)

3430
01:53:58,867 --> 01:54:02,567
(The angry members refuse to keep filming. What will happen?)

3431
01:54:02,997 --> 01:54:07,507
(The first hotel that'll cool down the agents' fury)

3432
01:54:07,977 --> 01:54:08,977
(Is this our hotel?)

3433
01:54:08,978 --> 01:54:10,447
(Their eyes go wide.)

3434
01:54:10,677 --> 01:54:12,507
(In the middle of the desert, )

3435
01:54:13,177 --> 01:54:16,616
(they enjoy a private pool party.)

3436
01:54:16,617 --> 01:54:20,046
(The original Middle Eastern meal is on the line.)

(I don't know.)

3443
01:54:32,068 --> 01:54:34,197
(Mimi struggles since she isn't in her element.)

3444
01:54:34,337 --> 01:54:35,596
(I have a question.)

3445
01:54:35,597 --> 01:54:37,637
- A question? - Can't I do that?

3446
01:54:37,667 --> 01:54:40,007
(Mimi's wrong answer makes everyone laugh.)

3447
01:54:40,237 --> 01:54:42,207
(But one person can't laugh.)

- Let's go! - Did you really not know

3456
01:55:03,497 --> 01:55:04,696
- That we were dating? - Clap!

3457
01:55:04,697 --> 01:55:06,096
Get off the bus if you aren't going to clap!

3458

- Yes! - Let's go!

3460
01:55:09,697 --> 01:55:11,666
Why do you make him waver?

3461
01:55:11,667 --> 01:55:14,236
Why do you try to take him from me?

3462
01:55:14,237 --> 01:55:17,847
- Do you need him now? - My goodness.
