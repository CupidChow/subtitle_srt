1
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,929
(Earth Arcade 3)

2
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:13,729
(Previously)

3
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:16,558
(The agents flew to Lisbon to catch Torong and Cheol Yong.)

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,005
(Today, we'll go to the place where Torong left his first trace!)

5
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:20,569
(The egg tart shop Torong visited)

6
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:22,738
(Telepathy Game for egg tarts)

7
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,508
(You Are an Open Book)

8
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:27,909
(Young Ji had a lot of interest in the members.)

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,478
(She's right.)

10
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:30,808
(Yu Jin can be pretty relaxed.)

11
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,410
(Young Ji got the hang of the game and gave everyone a showtime.)

12
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:34,649
(Correct)

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,779
(Young Ji, well done.)

14
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,819
(Gosh, what's this?)

15
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:42,589
(A pink-colored lodging that contains the romance of Lisbon)

16
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:44,958
(They decided to have a relaxing time.)

17
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:46,128
(Young Ji, go inside and get some rest.)

18
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,129
(Why?)

19
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,498
(I'm not sleepy.)

20
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:50,475
(The E-cade members refused to rest even when they were told to...)

21
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:51,859
(and caused a mayhem of mischief.)

22
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,209
(At 1:30pm, they stole the production crew's egg tarts.)

23
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,799
Let's have a battle!

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,640
(At 1:35pm, they suddenly had a dance battle.)

25
00:00:57,669 --> 00:00:58,945
(At 2:10pm, they suddenly enjoyed jegichagi.)

26
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,489
(At 2:20pm, they suddenly jump roped.)

27
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,108
(For your information, the unruly girls already had...)

28
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,438
(The production crew versus the E-cade members?)

29
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,439
Rock-paper...

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,649
(A game where the losers enter the water)

31
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:11,219
(For goodness' sake)

32
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,688
(These girls are crazy.)

33
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,648
(Since things were so distracting...)

34
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:16,558
Here. Isn't it cute?

35
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:17,888
(Young Ji was given a crew member's phone.)

36
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,629
What do you think, Young Ji? Isn't it cute?

37
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:21,898
It's cute.

38
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:23,658
There are icons.

39
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,419
- Okay. - One is for the hidden object game.

40
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:28,028
Basically, there are two modes.

41
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,938
- Okay. - One is the hidden object game.

42
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,068
I'm bad at it.

43
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:32,638
- Here. - Why did you call me here?

44
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,159
I'm bad at finding the hidden objects.

45
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,059
If you look here. there's the Reverse Rock-Paper-Scissors.

46
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:38,449
That's right.

47
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,448
(It's full of games Young Ji is bad at.)

48
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:41,479
I won.

49
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:43,248
- It's a tie. - It's a tie.

50
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:45,319
- Ribbit. Come on. - It's a tie.

51
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:47,249
(The phone gets confiscated.)

52
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:48,458
Let's go.

53
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,488
(The E-cade members rush over to the front yard.)

54
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:53,059
- Let's go. - Come on.

55
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:54,998
(Scanning the surroundings)

56
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,258
- Let's go. - Come on.

57
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,798
- Let's go. - Producer Na hasn't come out.

58
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,928
- Tonight, I'm having an affair - Tonight, I'm having an affair

59
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:01,838
- I followed a friend to Gangnam - Gangnam

60
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,939
Will he come out later?

61
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:06,438
With Young Ji's phone as the prize,

62
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,008
- you'll play the 3, 6, 9 Game. - Okay!

63
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,138
Why, Producer An? It's Young Ji's phone.

64
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,908
Why do we need to play the game with her?

65
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,225
- Just this once... - Then I'll change the prize.

66
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:14,879
- Okay. - With the laptop as the prize,

67
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,119
the three of you...

68
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,918
(Mocking)

69
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,248
- All right. - Digital detox is so hard.

70
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:21,759
All right. What's the game?

71
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,558
It's the Charades.

72
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,588
- Okay. - A round of applause.

73
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:27,228
(They're making so much content by themselves today.)

74
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,228
Young Ji, you'll begin. Please come out one at a time...

75
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,059
and act out the keyword.

76
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:32,698
- Let's do well. - Okay.

77
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:33,699
(Delivering the keyword)

78
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,938
- Let's begin. - You can do it.

79
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,169
It's impossible to guess.

80
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:38,168
(Viewers, please guess with the members.)

81
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:39,169
(Hopping)
Horse.

82
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,169
(Nodding)

83
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,499
(It must be a kind of horse.)

84
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,108
(All over the place)

85
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:46,709
Horse. Seatbelt. Horse with a seatbelt.

86
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,049
Carousel.

87
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,319
Tearing.

88
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,379
Zebra.

89
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:53,318
(Zebra)

90
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,319
Correct.

91
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:56,718
(Eun Ji and Young Ji are in sync.)

92
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,789
Here comes the next one.

93
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:00,388
(Delivering the next keyword to the one who answered correctly)

94
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,929
What is it?

95
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:03,729
Set, go.

96
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,228
- Chipmunk. - Chipmunk.

97
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,269
Correct.

98
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,468
(The next person to act out the keyword, Kim Mi Hyun)

99
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:12,739
King Kong or a gorilla.

100
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:13,869
(Shouting)

101
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,939
(Growling)

102
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:16,738
What? Puppy.

103
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:17,939
- Parrot. - Jindo dog.

104
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,578
Chihuahua.

105
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,878
(She howls to let them know that they're wrong.)

106
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,179
- Hyena. - Maltese dog.

107
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,619
Correct.

108
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:27,248
(Impressive expressions)

109
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,459
My knees are wet.

110
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:29,859
Look at this.

111
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,289
(Aftermath on her knees)

112
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:32,889
Let's play a game now.

113
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,129
Brother Yeong Seok!

114
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,558
Must we come up with games by ourselves?

115
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,998
- Brother Yeong Seok! - Brother Yeong Seok!

116
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,798
- Stop it. - We're bored.

117
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,968
- We produced content nonstop. - Yes.

118
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,569
Apparently, this is how we rest.

119
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,739
Here's the deal.

120
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,508
Weren't you guys playing Charades just now?

121
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:46,509
- Yes. - Yes.

122
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,608
Since the day before yesterday, Eun Ji and Young Ji have had...

123
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,578
- a telepathic connection. - That's right.

124
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,609
Neurons.

125
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:55,179
- What does that mean? - "Thank you..."

126
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:56,749
- "for noticing." - "For noticing."

127
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,018
Young Ji's throat...

128
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,019
- I have an issue. - It's gone.

129
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,618
Her throat hurts,

130
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:03,688
- so we have been doing this. - We developed it.

131
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:06,688
- You come up with new functions... - Yes.

132
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,059
- through training. - Yes.

133
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,558
- Since you now have that function, - Okay.

134
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,499
We should play Charades...

135
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,628
- in a simple way. - I love the idea.

136
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,338
- We'll go outside soon. - Okay.

137
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,309
We weren't going to go shopping today.

138
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:20,969
Another shopping trip is scheduled for tomorrow,

139
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,308
so we weren't going to go today.

140
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:23,515
(The talk of shopping makes them twist their bodies.)

141
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,179
Let's make it a 2-on-2 match.

142
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:26,779
(2-on-2 matches have made her both the victim and the winner.)

143
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,109
Kim Mi Hyun.

144
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,519
Young Ji.

145
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:34,318
Let's have a 2-on-2 match. The winning team...

146
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,259
- We can do this. - What was the famous thing?

147
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:42,228
(Portugal)

148
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:44,329
(Famous thing)

149
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:46,399
(Soccer)

150
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,399
(For a soccer uniform of Ronaldo, )

151
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:54,109
(they'll have a 2-on-2 match.)

152
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:57,338
(Torong bought one too.)

153
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,648
- I really want it. - I really want it.

154
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:01,718
The two winners can buy it.

155
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,425
- Mimi, we must wear it. - We must wear it.

156
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,448
(2-on-2 Charades for a soccer uniform)

157
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:06,449
(Questioner, answerer)

158
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,018
(The questioner acts out the keyword with her body.)

159
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,019
(Swimming!)

160
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,759
(The answerer guesses the keyword.)

161
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:14,058
Once Young Ji acts it out and has Mimi answer,

162
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:15,558
Mimi must act it out and have Young Ji answer.

163
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:18,059
- We must take turns. - You guys must take turns.

164
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,829
(However!)

165
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,938
But there's no time limit. You must get all of them right.

166
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:23,168
There's no pass.

167
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:24,475
- There's no pass. - There are ten questions.

168
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:25,839
Even if you use a pass,

169
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:28,538
you must go back to the question later on.

170
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,179
- You must get all of them right. - Okay.

171
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:32,690
(The game will go on until they get all questions right.)

172
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:33,949
What?

173
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:35,379
One. Two.

174
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,619
Why did you do this?

175
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:45,429
(You fool!)

176
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:51,768
(One round takes them more than ten minutes.)

177
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,699
(What will we do if this goes on until winter?)

178
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:55,969
Imagine snow piling up here.

179
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,409
(This is an impossible record in the variety show scene.)

180
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:02,278
(Now begins the slowest Speed Quiz...)

181
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,785
(in the history of the variety shows.)

182
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:06,248
This is the moment when...

183
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:08,525
- we start turning tables. - That's right. It begins today.

184
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:10,279
- You're confident, right? - Totally.

185
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:11,749
- Hey, Eun Ji Tonton. - Hey.

186
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,449
Nice to meet you, Yu Jin Tonton.

187
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:14,849
Nice to meet you.

188
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,859
(Staring)

189
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,089
I can't lose to those fools.

190
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,389
(I see you.)

191
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,928
(Oh, my)

192
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:24,929
(They become annoyed.)
- Let go! - Let go of me!

193
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,999
- Never! - Let go!

194
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,798
- What? - Let go!

195
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,899
- Hey, I get that I'm lacking. - Calm down.

196
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,869
Put your hand on my shoulder, Yu Jin Tonton.

197
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,468
We're like the Watson Sisters.

198
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:36,108
- We're the Tonton Sisters. - We're the Tonton Sisters.

199
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:37,638
This is like "Mean Girls."

200
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,149
You guys are Regina George and her sidekick number one.

201
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,478
"Her sidekick number one?"

202
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,449
(The queen bee and her follower)

203
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:47,618
(Her sidekick number 1?)

204
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:49,818
- Eun Ji, calm down. - She's annoyed.

205
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:50,918
What do you think?

206
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,189
Do you really think I'm your sidekick number one?

207
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:54,429
No!

208
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,099
I'm asking you if you think I'm your sidekick number one!

209
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:00,699
(She's more mad at Regina than the one who teased her.)

210
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,038
(Chuckling)

211
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,039
Selena.
(She quickly gives her a name.)

212
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,468
You're my best friend.

213
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:07,009
I'm her best friend.

214
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:10,078
Your friendship is as fragile as a thread.

215
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,479
A thread?

216
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:12,879
Fools are tight!

217
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:14,179
"Fools are tight."

218
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,395
(The thread sisters burst out laughing.)

219
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,659
(The tight fools become happy.)

220
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,378
We're best friends.

221
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,418
- We're best friends. - Our team name...

222
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:21,749
- will be BF. - BF.

223
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,119
- Best friends. - Best friends.

224
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:25,089
- We'll be BB. - BB.

225
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:26,689
It stands for "Babo," or "Fool."

226
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,028
(Team BB)

227
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:31,458
Will Team BB or Team BF go first?

228
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,569
Which one will it be?

229
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:34,699
- Rock-paper-scissors? - Yes.

230
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:35,899
Hold on.

231
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,580
We should go first to avoid playing rock-paper-scissors with fools.

232
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,908
(Oh, snap)

233
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,779
I really seem like her sidekick number one.

234
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,678
(She became aware of herself.)

235
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:47,008
- What are you saying, Selena? - It isn't like that, right?

236
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,408
We're best friends.

237
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,249
- Are you okay? - I just feel that way, right?

238
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,519
They even use the same bags.

239
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:53,518
- They get passed down, right? - They get passed down.

240
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,359
- They get passed down. - School uniforms too.

241
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:57,518
We should make them go first.

242
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,288
That way, we can see how it goes...

243
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:00,928
and come up with a strategy.

244
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:01,929
Fools.

245
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:04,198
We'll give you a chance to go first.

246
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,869
Okay. What nonsense is that?

247
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,798
Hold on.

248
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:10,299
- Wait. You guys weren't fools. - We aren't that foolish.

249
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,968
Let's play rock-paper-scissors for fairness.

250
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:13,939
Okay. She's the master of rock-paper-scissors.

251
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,639
- All right. - Are all of us playing?

252
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,908
- That was nonsense. - All of us should play.

253
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:19,448
Play... Play or lose,

254
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:21,509
- rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

255
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:26,019
Big fool!

256
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,448
(Team BB will decide on the order.)

257
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:31,418
Since we lost, you guys can go first.

258
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:32,899
- Okay. - What are you talking about?

259
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,959
- That's nonsense. - They think we have an IQ of 20.

260
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:38,629
It would've been funny had they said, "Sure."

261
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:42,368
(A senior comedienne teaches them how to do comedy.)

262
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,398
Sure.

263
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,998
(This comedienne is satisfied.)

264
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:46,368
- They'll go 1st. - Go 1st.

265
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:48,309
Sure. Let's show them our skills.

266
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,749
- Ba, bo, cross. - Babo, cross.

267
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,649
(Scheming)

268
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:57,149
- Ba! - Babo!
No.

269
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,765
(Gesturing at her to say one syllable)

270
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:01,789
- Ba! - Bo!
- Cross! - Cross!

271
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,989
- Did it take you guys that long? - Yes.

272
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:06,339
Who will be the questioner?

273
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,489
Mimi will go first, right?

274
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,699
We'll take turns. Yes.

275
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:11,969
Mimi.

276
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:14,628
(Yu Jin is absorbed in her own world.)

277
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:17,569
Someone films Yu Jin when she's like this, right?

278
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:19,009
Everyone films me.

279
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,908
(Her sidekick number 1 joins.)

280
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:22,279
- Focus, Mimi. - Okay.

281
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:23,579
- I'll answer well. - Okay.

282
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,548
Even if you pass a keyword, you'll go back to it.

283
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:26,869
- Okay. - You guys will be timed.

284
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:28,309
Get ready.

285
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:30,019
Set, go.

286
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:31,649
Set, go.

287
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,989
(Soju and beer)

288
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:36,859
Liquor. Soju and beer.

289
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,159
Correct.

290
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,259
(Answering at lightning speed)

291
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:43,758
What?

292
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,299
(They suddenly switch positions.)

293
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:46,629
What?

294
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,769
- Keep going. - Mimi will keep going.

295
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:51,038
- What was that, guys? - Stay in your position.

296
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,539
Hey, Team BB.

297
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:55,239
Team BB, what's wrong with you?

298
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,179
(The next keyword: Detox)

299
00:09:58,339 --> 00:09:59,579
(Torn)

300
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:01,249
Me. Young Ji.

301
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,778
Detox. Digital detox.

302
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:03,779
Correct.

303
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:06,619
(Answering at lightning speed twice in a row)

304
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:08,388
(Team BB is going faster than they imagined.)

305
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,159
You guys are going too fast.

306
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,618
(A difficult food item)

307
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:12,779
(Aged kimchi and tuna gimbap)

308
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:14,458
(Unsure)

309
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:15,959
It's a hard one.

310
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,169
Three. Roll.

311
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,399
Horse. Kalguksu.

312
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,739
(She's saying whatever she sees.)

313
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:24,439
- Kalguksu. - Long.

314
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,669
Roll. Gimbap. Triangular gimbap.

315
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:28,569
(She gets "Gimbap!")

316
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:30,078
(Now, she needs to explain "Aged kimchi and tuna.")

317
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,508
Hold on a second.

318
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:33,149
(Halting)

319
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:34,349
Mimi, don't give up.

320
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:35,725
- It's gimbap. - You can't pass it.

321
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:37,578
(It's hard to act out "Aged kimchi and tuna.")

322
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:39,119
- Do one at a time. - Eat.

323
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:40,489
(Sighing)

324
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,518
- It's food. Triangular gimbap. - I'll pass it for now.

325
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,819
- Let's move on for now. - Yes.

326
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,458
- Let's move on for now. - Yes.

327
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:47,959
(The most difficult keyword: Vegetarian)

328
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:49,958
Well...

329
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:50,999
You can do it!

330
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:02,038
(Oinking)

331
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,479
Not chicken. Lamb.

332
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:05,609
Not chicken. Lamb.

333
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:08,249
(Disappearing)

334
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:10,819
Chicken.

335
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:12,349
Dog.

336
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:16,119
Pig. Pork.

337
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:18,289
Pig. Pork.

338
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:20,128
Not pig?

339
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,059
(You don't eat it.)

340
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,629
Pork noodles?

341
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:26,829
(Where did noodles come from?)

342
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,398
(There's pork, )

343
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,469
(but you don't eat it.)

344
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,909
(Vegetarian)

345
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,809
(This is how Young Ji takes it.)

346
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:41,579
Not pork noodles.

347
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,379
Cow.

348
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:46,319
Not beef noodles.

349
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:48,149
(Slurping)

350
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:51,159
(Young Ji keeps going back to the noodles.)

351
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:52,788
Why did you do this?

352
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:53,889
You fool!

353
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:55,798
You fool!

354
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,659
(She was talking about her team.)

355
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,399
(Team BF is having fun.)

356
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:01,369
- Think about it slowly. - Cow. Pork.

357
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:03,399
- Moo. Cow. - Okay.

358
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,198
(Grilling meat)

359
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:08,709
(You don't eat it.)

360
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,438
Grilled meat.

361
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,738
(You don't grill meat.)

362
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:13,209
That isn't it.

363
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:14,479
Raw meat.

364
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:15,579
(For goodness' sake!)

365
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,979
No!

366
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:18,849
(Even the rivaling team feels bad.)

367
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:22,518
Eating.

368
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,158
Is she eating grass for real?

369
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,589
- Seriously. - Meat substitute.

370
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:29,399
(Mimi eats grass.)

371
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,499
You eat it.

372
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:33,399
(Moo)

373
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:34,769
Fodder?

374
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:38,698
- What will we do... - Eat.

375
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,239
If this goes on until winter?

376
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:43,079
Imagine snow piling up here.

377
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:46,299
(They've been at "Vegetarian" for 1 minute and 53 seconds.)

378
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:47,478
You eat grass.

379
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,318
(You eat grass.)

380
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,448
(What's that?)

381
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:52,849
- Grass. Grass cow. - You eat grass.

382
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,519
For goodness' sake.

383
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:56,689
Pass for now.

384
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:58,929
Pass. It sounded like "PET bottle."

385
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:00,188
("Love Scout," Korean title: "My Perfect Secretary")

386
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:01,629
(Now comes a drama.)

387
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:05,058
- She doesn't know it. - You can do it.

388
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:06,699
(She didn't watch it either.)

389
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,469
Mimi.

390
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:09,739
Mimi. Me.

391
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,039
Me.

392
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:12,339
(Perfect)

393
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,368
Sexy.

394
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:14,739
(Instinctive)

395
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,278
- I. - Okay.

396
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,279
- You. - Okay.

397
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,949
This person.

398
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,719
(Checking)

399
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,018
You write things down and say, "Thank you."

400
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:25,619
Money. You received money. Tip.

401
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:27,689
Study.

402
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,188
- Call. - You...

403
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:30,958
will be at it in your 40s.

404
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,158
(They haven't turned 40, but they've gone past 4 minutes.)

405
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,229
- Me. You. - You will be at it in your 40s.

406
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,799
Sit down.

407
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,669
- Hello. - Hello.

408
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,629
(Manners)

409
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:44,169
(Crying)

410
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:46,909
- She's crying. Young Ji is crying. - Hold on.

411
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,839
(Are you crying?)

412
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:51,179
- Me. Next to me. - Okay.

413
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:52,609
- Next to me. - Yes.

414
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:54,949
Secretary.

415
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:56,648
Secretary.

416
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,018
(She gets "Secretary" by chance.)

417
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,319
(So far, she has gotten "Me" and "Secretary.")

418
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:02,019
Me.

419
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,789
Slice.

420
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:05,589
Doctor. "Hospital Playlist."

421
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,029
Doctor. "Hospital Playlist."

422
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,869
- Why is she doing this? - To get the syllable for "My."

423
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:11,199
- My. - Fingers.

424
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,345
(She wants the first syllable of "Doctor" for "My.")

425
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:13,929
- Will she go for each syllable? - Yes.

426
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:16,669
One. Doctor. Nurse.

427
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:18,799
(The first syllable)

428
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:20,649
Next to the doctor and nurse is a patient.

429
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:22,139
(Frustrated)

430
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:24,339
Walk.

431
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,009
Who's that?

432
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:27,809
- Doc... Nurse. - Then...

433
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,579
(Mimi gets annoyed.)

434
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,048
- Not nurse. - What's the first syllable.

435
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:32,889
- Doc. My. - Yes.

436
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,859
(Young Ji finally understands the doctor performance.)

437
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,189
What will you do now?

438
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:40,829
(The next syllable: Per)

439
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:44,099
- She had no plans. - This is unexpected.

440
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,499
A movie title?

441
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:47,599
A drama title?

442
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,799
"My Mister."

443
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:52,669
(Acting out "Secretary" once more)

444
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:54,309
"My Secretary."

445
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:56,039
"My Secretary."

446
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:57,909
Sir.

447
00:14:58,309 --> 00:14:59,379
Friend.

448
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,108
My.

449
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,748
("My 'Blank' Secretary")

450
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:04,279
"My Companion Secretary."

451
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:06,449
("My 'Blank' Secretary")

452
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:07,589
My box.

453
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:09,889
My.

454
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,418
Secretary.

455
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:12,689
("My 'Blank' Secretary")

456
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:17,228
(The mirror mode)

457
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:18,759
- But... - What goes in the blank?

458
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:20,929
What goes between "My" and "Secretary?"

459
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,369
My. Secretary. Between.

460
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,909
(Laughing)

461
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,638
All right. Keep going.

462
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,039
(Acting out what goes in the blank)

463
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:35,579
"My Pretty Secretary."

464
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:38,218
- My... - See what the secretary is like.

465
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:39,248
- What's the secretary like? - Smart.

466
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:40,518
- Okay. - Pretty.

467
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,618
- Go on. - She's wearing glasses.

468
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:43,339
- What's the word then? - What is she like?

469
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:45,119
(What am I like?)

470
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,289
- "My Smart..." - Okay.

471
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,299
"My Perfect Secretary."

472
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:52,059
- There you go. - Correct.

473
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:54,399
(Team BB's perfect answer)

474
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,238
She's crying.

475
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,299
(Tearful)

476
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:59,809
(They've spent 7 minutes on 5 keywords including 2 passes.)

477
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,209
(The following keywords)

478
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:08,008
Pole vault.

479
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,419
Correct.

480
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,789
Goldfish. How did you know?

481
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:15,189
(Guess the keyword.)

482
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,319
Money.

483
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,828
(Beatboxing)

484
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:20,858
Money.

485
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:22,829
(Answer: Bitcoin)

486
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:24,598
(Beatboxing)

487
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,469
- Money. - That's right.

488
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:27,928
Bitcoin?

489
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:28,999
Correct.

490
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:31,369
Four syllables.

491
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:32,639
One.

492
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:34,669
One, two.

493
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,639
Two.

494
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,179
Two.

495
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,948
She got it. That's good.

496
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:43,649
- Keep going. - Two.

497
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,449
One, two,

498
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:47,188
three, four,

499
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:48,789
five, six,

500
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,988
seven, eight, nine.

501
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,018
Iguana.

502
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,659
(Iguana)

503
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,929
It was a new way to solve a question.

504
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,828
(Team BB plays the game in a new way...)

505
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:59,399
(and reaches the tenth keyword.)

506
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:01,569
(Screen time)

507
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,469
Me.

508
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:04,769
Cellphone.

509
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,069
Two, two.

510
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,509
My time. Clock Spirit.

511
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:09,979
Two, two.

512
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,579
- You. Cellphone. - Clock Spirit.

513
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,778
(21 hours and 22 minutes)

514
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:17,579
(Acting out Young Ji's shocking screen time)

515
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,319
Two. Time. Screen time.

516
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,159
- Screen time. - Correct.

517
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:28,229
I got that keyword again!

518
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,498
(Sad versus Happy)

519
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:30,558
(Aged kimchi and tuna gimbap)

520
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,705
(It's time for the keywords they skipped.)

521
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:33,528
- The ones you passed. - The ones you passed.

522
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,069
- The ones you passed. - Two keywords.

523
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:36,499
Two keywords remain.

524
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,739
(She starts by rolling gimbap.)

525
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:42,109
(Thankfully, Young Ji hasn't forgotten about "Gimbap.")

526
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,279
Gimbap.

527
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:44,639
Gimbap.

528
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,279
Something and something gimbap.

529
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:49,578
(Something and something gimbap)

530
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:50,919
Three syllables.

531
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:52,278
(3 syllables, 2 syllables)

532
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,689
Gimbap. Three syllables.

533
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:56,819
Gimbap. Ko Bong Min Gimbap.

534
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:01,028
("Blank" and something gimbap)

535
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:02,829
("Blank" and "Blank" gimbap)

536
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:05,199
Three syllables and two syllables gimbap.

537
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:08,728
(After much effort, she communicates the number of syllables.)

538
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:10,669
("Blank" and "Blank" gimbap)

539
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,539
(Lost)

540

(Tearing)

541
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:20,149
(She's good!)

542
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:21,579
Noodles.

543
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,319
(She starts with kimchi-making.)

(Gloves)

545
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,119
Doctor.

Doing the dishes.

547
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,519
(She hears sad news while making kimchi.)

548
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:32,059
(Her cheekbones hurt from laughing.)

549
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:34,389
Doing the dishes.

550
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,999
Look at her. What is she doing?

551
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:38,928
What is she doing?

552
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:40,599
- She's eating. - I mean...

553
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:41,669
(She's eating indeed.)

554
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,638
- What is she eating? - Cheese?

555
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:45,298
- No. Show her again. - Show me again.

556
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,808
Stretching.

557
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:47,869
Webfoot octopus.

558
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:49,309
Webfoot octopus.

559
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:52,648
You can do it. Don't give up.

560
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:55,008
- She's getting a reality check. - Don't give up.

561
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,519
- That's so funny. - Start from here.

562
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:58,219
(Sidekick number 1 explains it.)

563
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:00,249
- She's ripping it. - Kimchi.

564
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:01,588
(Explaining things on Young Ji's level)

565
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:02,589
Kimchi.

566
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:04,389
What kind of kimchi is it?

567
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:05,489
Aged kimchi.

568
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:07,929
Aged kimchi and tuna gimbap.

569
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:10,799
Aged kimchi and tuna gimbap.

570
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:15,929
- There's another one. - One keyword remains.

571
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,569
(One keyword remains.)

572
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:20,868
I tried it earlier.

573
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,038
(Last keyword: Vegetarian)

574
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,809
It's the one you passed earlier.

575
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,079
(Oink)

576
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:31,479
(Moo)

577
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:33,748
The one you passed.

578
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:35,549
(I recognize this one!)

579
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:38,019
(Oh, "Vegetarian" is back.)

580
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,788
Pig.

581
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:40,828
(Mimi brings livestock first this time as well.)

582
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:42,828
- Cow. - It's back.

583
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:45,299
- Sizzling. - You grill it. Grilled beef.

584
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:46,799
(No.)

585
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,969
You grill it. Grilled beef.

586
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:49,769
No.

587
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,338
(Picking grass again)

588
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:54,039
Beans. Grass.

589
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:56,609
- Fodder. Grass. - Grass.

590
00:19:56,939 --> 00:19:58,439
Cow grass.

591
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:01,149
Cow grass.

592
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:03,879
Me. You.

593
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:05,749
Me.

594
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,019
(She suddenly checked her identity.)

595
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:11,419
What was that?

596
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,529
What was that? Let's start from the beginning.

597
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:18,459
- It must be an animal. - This is driving me crazy.

598
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:22,199
- Beef. - I don't like beef.

599
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,238
(Docent)

600
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:27,538
- I don't eat it. - I don't like beef. I don't eat it.

601
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:28,539
I...

602
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:30,579
- What's that? - Vegetarian.

603
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:32,848
Vegetarian.

604
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:33,889
- Correct. - There you go.

605
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,619
(Round 1 for Team BB is over.)

606
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,119
Thank you for your hard work.

607
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,658
The record is 14 minutes and 45 seconds.

608
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,359
Gosh, 14 minutes.

609
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:45,918
(An incredible record)

610
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,459
She's teary-eyed.

611
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:50,358
This is an impossible record...

612
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,198
in the variety show scene. It's 14 minutes and 45 seconds.

613
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:54,068
- They took so long. - Both of them are bad at it.

614
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:55,069
They're the worst pair.

615
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,299
(Round 1 for Team BB, 14 minutes and 45 seconds)

616
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,538
I want to thank Mimi...

617
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:00,868
as well as our rivals who waited for us.

618
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:01,869
- Don't mention it. - Seriously.

619
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,878
- Thank you so much. - It was fun.

620
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:04,315
- It was so much fun. - Don't mention it.

621
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:06,278
We might do just as badly. The keywords are difficult.

622
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,455
- They are. Hey, we did well. - The keywords are difficult.

623
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,719
(Round 1 of charades for Team BF)

624
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,049
Selena.

625
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,319
- Let's go. - I'm your friend, right?

626
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:16,418
- Yes. We're best friends. - "I'm your friend, right?"

627
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:18,088
- I'm her friend. - Must you continue checking...

628
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:20,128
- if you guys are friends? - Yes, I get curious.

629
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:21,129
Oh, my.

630
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,489
Get ready.

631
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:25,328
Set, go.

632
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:26,769
(Red wine)

633
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,755
Get ready.

634
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:33,494
Set, go.

635
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:35,025
(Red wine)

636
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,125
(It's the category Eun Ji likes.)

637
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:39,512
(Eun Ji with a glass)

638
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:41,735
Coffee. Espresso.

639
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:43,545
(No.)

640
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:45,975
(Tasting)

641
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:47,574
(Swirling)

642
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:48,575
Tea.

643
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:51,085
Wine.

644
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:53,715
Two words.

645
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:57,785
- Red wine. - Correct.

646
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:02,395
(Abu Dhabi)

647
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:06,935
Everyone, we...

648
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:11,165
(She's practically a simultaneous interpreter.)

649
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:12,805
Here.

650
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,744
(Bringing back the seal of Abu Dhabi)

651
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:18,745
Abu Dhabi.

652
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:20,515
Correct. What's up with them?

653
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:23,275
(All production crew members are surprised.)

654
00:22:23,645 --> 00:22:25,485
(How will she explain "First birthday party?")

655
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,215
Me.

656
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:31,685
Before.

657
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:35,355
"Hello, everyone." Emceeing at a wedding?

658
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:37,625
Emceeing at the first birthday party?

659
00:22:37,995 --> 00:22:40,095
(They go through 3 keywords in less than 1 minute.)

660
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,965
(Team BB is shocked.)

661
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:45,335
(Bitcoin)

662
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,435
Beat. Club.

663
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,705
Yes. Rhythm.

664
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,645
Young Ji? Rapper.

665
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:55,245
Two of them? Fools?

666
00:22:56,815 --> 00:22:57,815
Two of them? Fools?

667
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:00,055
(Annoyed)

668
00:23:01,155 --> 00:23:02,655
(Visiting to complain)

669
00:23:05,055 --> 00:23:06,995
Four syllables. Rapper.

670
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:09,795
Rhythm. Beat.

671
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:12,224
- Why are you making sounds? - You're cheating.

672
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,434
- You're cheating. - Why are you making sounds?

673
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,865
Beatbox.

674
00:23:16,565 --> 00:23:17,565
Beat.

675
00:23:18,805 --> 00:23:19,805
Beat.

676
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:22,335
Beat money.

677
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:25,744
- Bitcoin. - Correct.

678
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:27,775
(A difficult food item, gamjatang)

679
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:31,445
(Bring me gamjatang.)

680
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:32,785
(She enters and says hello.)

681
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:35,855
"Hello. Yes. Hello"

682
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:38,425
Lee Young Ji?

683
00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:40,195
"Nothing Much Prepared."

684
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:41,595
(Downing a drink)

685
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:46,335
(Grabbing the pork backbone)

686
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:48,595
Lamb skewers? Ribs?

687
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:55,175
- She's good. That's it. - Yes.

688
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:57,916
(Eun Ji's gamjatang restaurant skit is quite believable.)

689
00:23:58,305 --> 00:23:59,305
It's detailed.

690
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:01,226
(Spitting out the bones into the bone container)

691
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:04,185
Chicken feet. Boneless chicken feet?

692
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:06,755
Soupy chicken feet? Blank?

693
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:09,824
- Blank? - My goodness.

694
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,555
Whole chicken feet? Spicy chicken feet?

695
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:14,655
She's good. It's as if there's actually food.

696
00:24:16,595 --> 00:24:18,225
- She's good. - Cartilage?

697
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:20,935
"Auntie."

698
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:23,165
"Please fry some rice."

699
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:26,035
"Auntie."

700
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:29,435
(Fried rice is a must.)

701
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:30,804
(Moved)

702
00:24:30,805 --> 00:24:33,545
Fried rice.

703
00:24:34,115 --> 00:24:36,014
- It's hard. - It's a hard one.

704
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:38,115
We...

705
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,685
Before.

706
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,014
(They ate gamjatang right before departure.)

707
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:43,785
Rice. Spicy stir-fried chicken?

708
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:49,395
(Sputtering)

709
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:51,724
(She made a sound as if she was spitting out bones.)

710
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:52,965
- What was that? - No.

711
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:54,535
Head. Think.

712
00:24:54,635 --> 00:24:55,835
Be careful not to make sounds.

713
00:24:56,435 --> 00:24:58,265
What we ate yesterday? Gamjatang?

714
00:24:58,365 --> 00:24:59,365
Correct.

715
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:01,511
- Still, they got the answer. - Yes.

716
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:02,535
(Dried young pollack)

717
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:03,545
(It's another food item.)

718
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:05,145
(Taking a big breath)

719
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:07,245
- How will she get it right? - Password. Home.

720
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:11,084
(This time, Eun Ji Theater begins at home.)

721
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:13,045
- It's "Comedy Big League" again. - Fridge. Beer.

722
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:16,114
Fridge. Beer. Draft beer. Canned beer.

723
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:18,585
(Yu Jin fires off incorrect answers.)

724
00:25:18,825 --> 00:25:19,825
(But the skit continues on.)

725
00:25:19,826 --> 00:25:21,555
- She's good. - She's good.

726
00:25:23,725 --> 00:25:25,994
It's a snack you eat with beer.

727
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:28,135
(The president of K-mime is proud.)

728
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:29,765
- I'm sorry, Mimi. - It's okay.

729
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:31,935
I didn't do that well.

730
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:34,304
You dip it in something.

731
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:35,305
(Dipping in a sauce)

732
00:25:36,405 --> 00:25:37,405
It's tough.

733
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:39,405
I feel like she's actually eating it.

734
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:42,115
It's a dried snack. It isn't dried squid, right?

735
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,845
(It isn't dried squid.)

736
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:45,585
Squid's friend?

737
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:47,614
(Friend number 1)

738
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:49,085
Gosh, the first syllable.

739
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:50,355
The first syllable.

740
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:52,755
Nobody... Dried young pollack!

741
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:57,695
(She explained "Dried young pollack" through K-pop.)

742
00:25:57,965 --> 00:25:59,641
- They're good. - They have good teamwork.

743
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:00,665

00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:07,904
(She's happy that her answer is correct.)

747
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:09,905
(She spots a problem.)

748
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,144

752

Okay.

753
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:20,685
(She goes through a strong gust of wind.)

754
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,125
You got rained on.

755
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:25,225
(She boards something.)

756
00:26:25,325 --> 00:26:26,824
(Clattering)

757
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:28,695

(Doctor Baek Kang Hyeok boards a firefighting helicopter...)

761
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:40,135
(and drives it himself.)

762
00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:43,874
(Eun Ji's helicopter arrives at the scene of the accident.)

763
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,275
Emergency vehicle. Ambulance.

764
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,114
Calling 911.

765
00:26:47,115 --> 00:26:48,115
(The helicopter can't land due to the incorrect answers.)

766
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:49,545
(Jumping off)

767
00:26:49,645 --> 00:26:51,615

(Fascinated)

771

A drama.

772
00:26:59,755 --> 00:27:00,895
Is it by Writer Woo Jung?

(Making a square)

774
00:27:05,795 --> 00:27:06,795

775
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:09,264
No. Television.

She's good.

787
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:32,685
Sad. Sentimental.

788
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:35,595
Twenty?

- She's good. - I know.

796
00:27:48,635 --> 00:27:49,635
What's this?

Twenty.

798
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:53,874
I haven't been in love.

799
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:54,875
(She doesn't have a clue yet.)

800
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:56,075
I'm so sad.

801
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,484

810
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,744
(It's practically an episode of "EXchange.")

811
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,745
A breakup.

812
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:28,915
You saw it on TV.

813
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:32,285

Fun group activities.

821
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:50,734

(Meow)

828
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:01,015
- She's good. - Slow down.

829
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:03,484
(This one.)

830
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:04,485
Tag.

831
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:05,715
Taek?

832
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:08,255
Tag.

(This one.)

834
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:10,925
Name tag?

835
00:29:11,655 --> 00:29:13,355
That was good.

836
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:16,255

Reset.

840
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:22,365
Sorry.

841
00:29:23,735 --> 00:29:25,034
She says she's sorry, but she keeps doing it.

842
00:29:25,035 --> 00:29:27,035
Erase everything from your mind.

843
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:28,535
Let's start over.

844
00:29:28,705 --> 00:29:30,204
- You're starting over. - We're starting over.

845
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:31,375
Forget everything.

846
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,144
Start from the beginning. You got this.

847
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:35,575
At home. Hello.

848

- I'm not sure about this. - Curling iron.

855
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:52,565
(Eun Ji Theater, Episode 5, The Hair Salon)

856
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:54,935
- This will be about 14 minutes. - Right.

857
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:56,835
- We'll end up doing a rematch. - Sewing.

858
00:29:56,865 --> 00:29:58,634
(Puma)

859
00:29:58,635 --> 00:30:00,835
What is that?

860
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:02,375
(Cut)

861
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:04,004
- Start over again. - You don't think that's it either.

862
00:30:04,005 --> 00:30:06,244
- Let's start fresh. - You got this.

863
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:08,114
(Erase everything again.)

864
00:30:08,115 --> 00:30:10,444
- Erase everything. - Erase everything.

(Focused)

866
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:14,214
- Clothing. - She really doesn't know.

867
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:15,585
Salty?

868
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:18,425
(This isn't a vision test.)

869
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:20,395
A brand.

870
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:23,925
(She's finally getting closer to the answer!)

871
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:26,064
(This is the brand!)

872
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:27,995
I don't know what this is.

873
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:30,265
What is this brand?

874
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:33,265
(Gosh)

875
00:30:33,475 --> 00:30:34,534
This brand?

876
00:30:34,535 --> 00:30:36,404
(Her desperate best friend)

877
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:37,765
Is it an alligator? Is it Lacoste?

878
00:30:37,945 --> 00:30:39,305
Is it an alligator? Is it Lacoste?

879
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:42,944
(Two syllables)

880
00:30:42,945 --> 00:30:44,114
Two syllables? Laco?

881
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:46,345
(Laco?)

882
00:30:47,355 --> 00:30:48,355
(You think?)

883
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:51,585
It's a brand.

884
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:53,695
It's a brand with two syllables.

885
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:54,894
And it looks like this.

886
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,125
(The clues)

887
00:30:56,825 --> 00:30:57,825
It's a cat.

888
00:30:57,826 --> 00:30:58,906
(Yu Jin is getting closer.)

889
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:01,064
(Eun Ji perfectly imitates a growling puma.)

890
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:02,435
What kind of brand is that?

891
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:07,004
(She's perfectly in sync with a running puma.)

892
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:09,075
- Is that a monkey? - That's great, Eun Ji.

893
00:31:09,305 --> 00:31:10,444
Yu Jin, what is that?

894
00:31:10,445 --> 00:31:11,704
A cheetah? Puma!

895
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,145
(Puma)

896
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:14,915
Puma!

897
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:18,485
(Round 1 for Team BF is over.)

898
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:21,385
- Gosh, that was so hard. - You did great.

899
00:31:21,655 --> 00:31:23,114
You took 12 minutes and 26 seconds.

900
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:24,124
- That's similar to us. - Gosh.

901
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,154
- It's neck and neck. - It's close.

902
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:26,835
- We're on similar levels. - That means...

903
00:31:27,495 --> 00:31:29,224
there's only a 2-minute difference.

904
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:30,625
You can still turn the game around.

905
00:31:30,895 --> 00:31:33,224
- This is so hard. - You're good at guessing correctly.

906
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,194
- You really were good at it. - She was.

907
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:37,435
You guessed everything quickly except for Puma.

908
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:39,104
(Round 1)

909
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,504
(Team BB: 14 minutes 45 seconds, Team BF: 12 minutes 26 seconds)

910
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:42,075
(Round 2 of charades for Team BB)

911
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,545
- All right. - We got this.

912
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:44,675
This is going to be fun.

913
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:47,575
- Babo. Babo. Ba! - Babo! Bo!

914
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:51,025
(It looks like we're in for another tough one.)

915
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:54,554
- Just say "BB." - That was so out of sync.

916
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:56,061
- We should practice our chant. - Yes.

917
00:31:56,085 --> 00:31:57,725
Begin!

918
00:31:57,855 --> 00:31:59,185
(Whiskey)

919
00:31:59,425 --> 00:32:00,425
Begin!

920
00:32:02,425 --> 00:32:04,225
Alcohol! Is it alcohol?

921
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:06,995
(Surprisingly, she guessed the correct category right away.)

922
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:08,595
Three syllables.

923
00:32:08,835 --> 00:32:11,004
- Tequila. - She said tequila.

924
00:32:11,005 --> 00:32:12,005
Whiskey.

925
00:32:12,235 --> 00:32:13,304
- Gosh, nice. - Correct.

926
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:15,074
(They're off to a decent start.)

927
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:16,434
(Attorney)

928
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,444
Nice.

929
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:19,104
(A 6-star level word)

930
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,515
She's loving this.

931
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:23,374
(How will Young Ji act out "attorney?")

932
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,484
She must love this word.

933
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:27,115
(Step 1. She's in custody.)

934
00:32:32,055 --> 00:32:34,055
(Mimi is just watching her in awe.)

935
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:37,395
(She's starting off with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution.)

936
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:39,485
You got something wrong once.

937
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,095
- What are you doing? - Wait.

938
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:43,395
- What are you doing? - Wait.

939
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:45,205
What is she doing?

940
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:46,311
(She's been arrested again.)

941
00:32:46,335 --> 00:32:47,934
What is she trying to say?

942
00:32:47,935 --> 00:32:49,835
- What is that? - What is she doing?

943
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:51,285
(This isn't going to work.)

944
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:53,004
(Young Ji suddenly arrests the camera director.)

945
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,415
You're going to start there?

946
00:32:54,815 --> 00:32:56,074
(She's acting out the first step of the criminal procedure.)

947
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,184
Gosh.

948
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:58,414
(Young Ji quickly backs out of it.)

949
00:32:58,415 --> 00:33:00,185
Prosecutor?

950
00:33:01,185 --> 00:33:02,385
It's three syllables.

951
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:03,754
Policeman.

952
00:33:03,755 --> 00:33:04,755
(Policeman)

953
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:06,025
Right here?

954
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,694
(This is as difficult as the bar exam.)

955
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:08,754
She's starting over.

956
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:10,271
You're locked inside. Hitting the gavel. Judge!

957
00:33:10,295 --> 00:33:12,415
(Mimi is shouting out everything besides "attorney.")

958
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:15,335
- Attorney! - Correct!

959
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:18,111
(She got the right answer by process of elimination.)

960
00:33:18,135 --> 00:33:19,564
(The next word is "product placement.")

961
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,604
Gosh.

962
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:22,704
(I got it.)

963
00:33:22,705 --> 00:33:23,705
(We...)

964
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:26,975
We. Before. Something we ate.

965
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:28,315
It's hot. Gosh.

966
00:33:28,415 --> 00:33:29,515
- Tteokbokki. - It's hot.

967
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:30,885
Spicy tteokbokki.

968
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:32,015
Yeopgi Tteokbokki?

969
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:33,445
What did we eat here?

970
00:33:33,915 --> 00:33:35,561
(The product placement Young Ji has in mind)

971
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:37,155
(Back in Abu Dhabi, )

972
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:39,424
(they ate this around the time they were missing Korean food.)

973
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:40,994
(Gosh, this is good!)

974
00:33:40,995 --> 00:33:42,155
(It's cup tteokbokki.)

975
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:45,365
(Mimi enjoyed it as well.)

976
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,064
(This is so good.)

977
00:33:47,065 --> 00:33:48,571
(The cheese tteokbokki is really good.)

978
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:51,834
(Young Ji really enjoyed it.)

979
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:53,205
(Back to "product placement")

980
00:33:53,605 --> 00:33:55,234
(Young Ji is acting out product placement...)

981
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:56,944
(based on that shared memory.)

982
00:33:56,945 --> 00:33:58,104
- Cup tteokbokki. - Cup tteokbokki?

983
00:33:58,105 --> 00:33:59,145
(Is what?)

984
00:33:59,775 --> 00:34:00,975
(How should I know?)

985
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:04,245
- Gosh. - Gosh.

986
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:06,244
(Hey.)

987
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,684
(Sorry.)

988
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:09,155
Bibigo's tteokbokki.

989
00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:12,731
- I don't know what it's called. - I don't know what it's called.

990
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:15,095
Bibigo's delicious cheese tteokbokki.

991
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:17,025
Spicy...

992
00:34:20,465 --> 00:34:22,694
(An explicit way to explain product placement)

993
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:23,835
What is that?

994
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:25,435
- Yes, that's it. - What is it?

995
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:26,765
That's it.

996
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:28,804
(Television)

997
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:29,805
(Tteokbokki)

998
00:34:32,245 --> 00:34:34,214
- That's so precise. - It is.

999
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:35,575
- That's precise. - On TV?

1000
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:37,345
Advertisement.

1001
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:39,485
(She said a keyword.)

1002
00:34:39,915 --> 00:34:41,415
- What is that? - What is it?

1003
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:43,315
Three syllables. Tteokbokki.

1004
00:34:43,785 --> 00:34:45,385
(This is getting heated.)

1005
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:48,054
(She's not wrong. Tteokbokki is three syllables.)

1006
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:49,255
Tteokbokki.

1007
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:50,965
(Eun Ji is addicted.)

1008
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:53,224
So it's cup tteokbokki and you're advertising it.

1009
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:55,335
- Tteokbokki. - You're advertising it, right?

1010
00:34:55,495 --> 00:34:56,535
This tastes...

1011
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:58,205
Flip advertising.

1012
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:00,334
Advert... Wait, no.

1013
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:01,405
Did she just say airport?

1014
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:02,875
Where did airport come from?

1015
00:35:03,305 --> 00:35:04,674
At the airport. Cup tteokbokki.

1016
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:06,375
Tteokbokki. Ramyeon tteokbokki?

1017
00:35:07,715 --> 00:35:08,745
No!

1018
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:10,445
Cup tteokbokki.

1019
00:35:10,446 --> 00:35:11,984
(This 3rd keyword is causing them quite a lot of delay.)

1020
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:12,985
- No. - Pass.

1021
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:14,284
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1022
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:16,085
I really don't know what it is. What is that?

1023
00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:17,325
- Pass. - Gosh.

1024
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:19,605
(The next keyword is an easy one, portable charger.)

1025
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,194
Your cell phone. Hey.

1026
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:22,954
Hey, you shouldn't be on your cell phone.

1027
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,065
She said, "Hey. Hey."

1028
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:26,995
Does anyone have my phone?

1029
00:35:28,165 --> 00:35:29,195
Portable charger.

1030
00:35:30,235 --> 00:35:32,034
(Team BB's Mimi did it.)

1031
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:33,065
That was good.

1032
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:34,905
(Cherry tomato)

1033
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,945
Pieces of fruit. It's not a grape.

1034
00:35:39,075 --> 00:35:40,914
- You're washing it. Dishwashing. - This is...

1035
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:41,975
Dishwasher.

1036
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,344
It's five syllables. Got it.

1037
00:35:44,345 --> 00:35:46,105
It's like she's Lee Eun Gyeol, the magician.

1038
00:35:46,915 --> 00:35:47,985
You're eating something.

1039
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,685
("Cherry tomato" is too hard.)

1040
00:35:51,255 --> 00:35:52,624
You're hungry. You're so hungry.

1041
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,625
No? There's something there.

1042
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:56,654
An egg tart. No.

1043
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,125
(You really think so?)

1044
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,735
What is that?

1045
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:02,735
Is it a pastry?

1046
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:03,935
Wait.

1047
00:36:03,936 --> 00:36:05,205
(Five syllables)

1048
00:36:06,035 --> 00:36:07,475
She says it's five syllables.

1049
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:09,511
- Maybe it's time for a reset. - The first one.

1050
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:11,444
- Erase everything. - The first syllable.

1051
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:12,775
Yes, the first syllable.

1052
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:14,344
(The first syllable is "bang," which means "room.")

1053
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:15,445
A door. Open the door.

1054
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:16,875
Gosh.

1055
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,414
(Mun, which means "door")

1056
00:36:18,415 --> 00:36:20,215
Gosh. It's a syllable.

1057
00:36:21,185 --> 00:36:22,185
(There are five syllables.)

1058
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:23,315
Five syllables.

1059
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:24,485
(And this is the first one.)
The first syllable.

1060
00:36:25,486 --> 00:36:26,785
She's angry.

1061
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:28,294
(She's not angry.)

1062
00:36:28,295 --> 00:36:29,425
She's angry.

1063
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:31,424
(Bang)

1064
00:36:31,425 --> 00:36:32,525
She's angry.

1065
00:36:32,765 --> 00:36:34,595
- Enter. - Enter?

1066
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,864
(It's 1 syllable.)

1067
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:39,335
One!

1068
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,204
(This is a nightmare.)

1069
00:36:41,205 --> 00:36:42,334
The first syllable.

1070
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:43,944
(This exchange fits the meaning of their team name, "BB.")

1071
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:45,005
The first syllable.

1072
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:46,505
- Goodness. - Is that...

1073
00:36:46,506 --> 00:36:48,144
the only way you can express it?

1074
00:36:48,145 --> 00:36:50,345
(Young Ji begins with "house.")

1075
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:52,984
- Television. TV? - How is that a television?

1076
00:36:52,985 --> 00:36:53,985
Castle. Television.

1077
00:36:53,986 --> 00:36:55,784
(They went from cherry tomato, to room, to television.)

1078
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:57,185
(Mimi didn't guess anything right.)

1079
00:36:57,255 --> 00:36:58,325
Castle.

1080
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,555
Mountain. Desert.

1081
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:02,794
Pass.

1082
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:04,424
Pass, again? There's one more.

1083
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:05,495
("The Glory")

1084
00:37:05,695 --> 00:37:07,165
(Finally, something manageable.)

1085
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:09,594
- Clapping. - Clapping.

1086
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,135
Clapping. You're being congratulated.

1087
00:37:11,735 --> 00:37:12,965
The Entertainment Awards.

1088
00:37:13,235 --> 00:37:14,875
(Lee Young Ji, you can do this.)

1089
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:16,505
Four syllables.

1090
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:19,775
Television. You turned it on.

1091
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:21,474
- "Gayo Daejeon." - She said, "Gayo Daejeon."

1092
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:22,545
MBC?

1093
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,385
- M? - Ta-dum.

1094
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:28,015
Netflix!

1095
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:29,265
(They clicked on this one.)

1096
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:30,385
(They're at the streaming platform now.)

1097
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:32,625
Four syllables.

1098
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:34,755
Clapping.

1099
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:36,225
It's an awards ceremony.

1100
00:37:36,395 --> 00:37:37,395
Gosh.

1101
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:40,465
(A perfect recreation of a famous scene in "The Glory")

1102
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:42,265
This must be that scene.

1103
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:43,785
She's acting out that scene.

1104
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,335
"The Glory!"

1105
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,374
(They got back on track with "The Glory.")

1106
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,375
Four syllables.

1107
00:37:49,376 --> 00:37:51,275
- She needs water, I think. - It's food.

1108
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:53,845
- Dumplings. - Yes.

1109
00:37:54,545 --> 00:37:55,675
What kind of dumplings?

1110
00:37:57,045 --> 00:37:59,544
- Kimchi dumplings. - Correct.

1111
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:00,985
(This one is hard too. "Submarine.")

1112
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,815
Yes, you're inside something.

1113
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,055
(Sinking)

1114
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:08,955
- Submarine! - Correct.

1115
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:10,924
(2 keywords left)

1116
00:38:10,925 --> 00:38:12,341
(Plus the 2 keywords they passed on)

1117
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:14,735
(They're now on their 9th word.)

1118
00:38:14,965 --> 00:38:15,965
Are you sleepy?
(Seal)

1119
00:38:16,966 --> 00:38:18,766
(This is an animal that is hard to describe.)

1120
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:20,775
(In despair)

1121
00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:22,234
(How do you act that one out?)

1122
00:38:22,235 --> 00:38:24,175
It's four characters. Five. Four characters.

1123
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:25,345
Two.

1124
00:38:25,545 --> 00:38:27,144
(Squeezing her eyes shut)

1125
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:28,185
What are you trying to do?

1126
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:30,785
Roly-poly toy. Pupa.

1127
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:33,444
(There's a seal on the grass.)

1128
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:34,455
Four characters.

1129
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:35,815
You look just like it.

1130
00:38:36,755 --> 00:38:37,784
Gosh, you look exactly like it.

1131
00:38:37,785 --> 00:38:38,785
(She's even clapping like a seal.)

1132
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:39,925
Sea lion.

1133
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,224
- She looks just like it. - I got it. Aquarium!

1134
00:38:41,225 --> 00:38:42,255
No, that's not it.

1135
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:43,824
(Since when is "seal" such a sad word?)

1136
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:45,524
Sea lion!

1137
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:46,765
"Animal Kingdom!"

1138
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,795
What? Prince Animal?

1139
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:51,064
Is it a TV show like that? About animals?

1140
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:52,605
No? What?

1141
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:53,875
Sea lion.

1142
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:56,005
A whale?

1143
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:57,474
(She's finally getting closer.)

1144
00:38:57,475 --> 00:38:58,944
Whale?

1145
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,105
Sea lion?

1146
00:39:01,245 --> 00:39:02,745
(Mimi is so close!)

1147
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:06,414
She said "whale."

1148
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:08,054
(Young Ji's only way to describe seals)

1149
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,385
You're by the sea, right?

1150
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,825
Does the word end with "lion?" No?

1151
00:39:13,825 --> 00:39:14,895
Sea...

1152
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,754
Sea... Gosh.

1153
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,495
- Sea. - You should study.

1154
00:39:18,595 --> 00:39:19,665
Otter.

1155
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:20,965
(Change of plans)

1156
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:22,435
Sea something.

1157
00:39:23,065 --> 00:39:24,104
The last syllable.

1158
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:26,705
(She'll be acting out a tiger to explain the word.)

1159
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,535
(An angry tiger)

1160
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:29,605
Gorilla.

1161
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:35,014
She's having a reality check.

1162
00:39:35,015 --> 00:39:37,484
(She's having a major reality check.)

1163
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:39,245
(I'm sorry.)

1164
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:40,891
- She's having a reality check. - Tiger.

1165
00:39:40,915 --> 00:39:42,755
Lion. Tiger. The first syllable of tiger?

1166
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:44,584
Which one? The second syllable?

1167
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:46,345
(She's overcome with the energy of a tiger.)

1168
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:48,654
Just spell the whole thing out.

1169
00:39:48,655 --> 00:39:50,375
She's already having trouble with this one.

1170
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:53,295
Four syllables. Sea.

1171
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:54,495
The third one.

1172
00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:55,535
(Facial expression)

1173
00:39:55,665 --> 00:39:56,795
Ugly.

1174
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:01,705
(She's hit with another reality check right away.)

1175
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:03,734
(Do I look like I'm laughing?)

1176
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,204
You were scrunching up your face.

1177
00:40:05,205 --> 00:40:06,705
Goodness.

1178
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:09,545
No, that's not what... You were scrunching up your face.

1179
00:40:09,715 --> 00:40:12,275
(Just in case you forgot, we're reminding you what the word is.)

1180
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:14,085
The third syllable.

1181
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:17,754
Smiling, sad. Smiling, sad. You're happy.

1182
00:40:17,755 --> 00:40:19,325
- What's this? - A face.

1183
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,155
Facial expression.

1184
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:22,525
Seal.

1185
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,295
(Young Ji feels drained.)

1186
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:26,964
(Gosh)

1187
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:29,635
(Try guessing the word with Mimi.)

1188
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:33,005
Thug.

1189
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:35,934
Television. Four syllables.

1190
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,495
Is this that cup-tteokbokki word again?

1191
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:39,175
Netflix.

1192
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:41,374
(Thug)

1193
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,075
There are four syllables.

1194
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:45,384
(Action-packed scenes)

1195
00:40:45,385 --> 00:40:46,415
Beating someone up.

1196
00:40:46,515 --> 00:40:47,584
Lots of tattoos.

1197
00:40:47,585 --> 00:40:49,115
(Thick, muscular arms)

1198
00:40:49,985 --> 00:40:52,185
Is it a movie? It's a movie.

1199
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,495
(Action is seemingly the heart of this movie.)

1200
00:40:56,595 --> 00:40:58,325
Fist-fighting.

1201
00:40:58,395 --> 00:40:59,594
(That is not a movie title.)

1202
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:00,994
There's no such movie.

1203
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:02,435
(We'll reveal the title to you.)

1204
00:41:02,465 --> 00:41:04,205
("The Roundup")

1205
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:06,405
She's fighting someone.

1206
00:41:06,735 --> 00:41:08,504
- Men with tattoos. - Men with tattoos.

1207
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:09,704
- Thugs. Gangsters. - Yes.

1208
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:10,774
- Criminal organizations. - Criminal organizations.

1209
00:41:10,775 --> 00:41:12,695
- Someone with thick arms. - Everyone, be quiet!

1210
00:41:13,245 --> 00:41:14,344
- Criminal organizations. - Someone with thick arms.

1211
00:41:14,345 --> 00:41:16,115
(Everyone, be quiet!)

1212
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:17,744
(Check this out. This is a fight between the BBs.)

1213
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:19,161
Young Ji wants to accomplish this by herself.

1214
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,954
- Bulking? - Don't give Mimi any hints.

1215
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:22,091
- "Captain America?" - She wants to do this alone.

1216
00:41:22,115 --> 00:41:23,915
Is it a Korean show? A Korean movie?

1217
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:26,255
Thick arms. Ma Dong Seok.

1218
00:41:27,925 --> 00:41:29,125
(The title is 4 syllables.)

1219
00:41:29,495 --> 00:41:31,095
(Will Mimi guess it correctly?)

1220
00:41:31,695 --> 00:41:34,165
(MimPT is running at full capacity.)

1221
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:36,065
Wait.

1222
00:41:36,465 --> 00:41:38,605
- "The Roundup." - Correct!

1223
00:41:38,905 --> 00:41:41,111
(It's like a weight has been lifted off all their chests.)

1224
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:42,975
(And now, it's time for...)

1225
00:41:46,345 --> 00:41:49,045
(Product placement)

1226
00:41:50,215 --> 00:41:51,944
Three syllables. This is that cup-tteokbokki word from earlier.

1227
00:41:51,945 --> 00:41:53,945
Yes, it is.

1228
00:41:54,355 --> 00:41:55,954
- Yes, this is it. - This is so good.

1229
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:57,655
- This is good. - This is good.

1230
00:41:57,785 --> 00:41:59,525
This is the best. Advertisement.

1231
00:41:59,555 --> 00:42:00,624
(Gosh)

1232
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:02,055
(Young Ji is completely drained.)

1233
00:42:02,355 --> 00:42:03,854
It's a song. You're singing. You feel joyful.

1234
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,255
(Time is slipping away helplessly.)

1235
00:42:05,495 --> 00:42:06,495
(She has run out of patience.)

1236
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:07,935
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do.

1237
00:42:08,435 --> 00:42:10,234
(Young Ji continues to act out eating and enjoying food.)

1238
00:42:10,235 --> 00:42:11,934
- The food is good. - Ramyeon. It's good.

1239
00:42:11,935 --> 00:42:13,035
Super delicious!

1240
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,875
(She's filtering her words less and less.)

1241
00:42:15,905 --> 00:42:17,574
- We do this all the time. - We...

1242
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:18,781
- "Let's shoot the..." - "Let's shoot the..."

1243
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:20,145
Hyun Yong says this.

1244
00:42:20,715 --> 00:42:22,215
- Product placement! - Correct.

1245
00:42:22,545 --> 00:42:24,921
(Mimi finally guesses the word they first passed correctly.)

1246
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:26,445
(This is the very last word.)

1247
00:42:27,015 --> 00:42:28,185
(Gosh)

1248
00:42:29,585 --> 00:42:31,124
- It's 5 syllables. - It's 5 syllables.

1249
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,125
It's that one from earlier, right?

1250
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:33,161
(Yes, this is "cherry tomato.")

1251
00:42:33,185 --> 00:42:36,354
(This is the last one she has to get for this round to be over!)

1252
00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:37,464
(Young Ji starts off with "tomato," which are the last three syllables.)

1253
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:39,595
The last three syllables.

1254
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,595
- You wash this. - You wash this.

1255
00:42:44,435 --> 00:42:45,464
(Then, you pluck off the stem and eat it.)

1256
00:42:45,465 --> 00:42:46,545
- You eat it. - You eat it.

1257
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,934
- Yes, you eat it. - Isn't that too big, though?

1258
00:42:48,935 --> 00:42:50,575
Jumbo dumpling.

1259
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:52,604
Why would you wash jumbo dumplings?

1260
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:53,881
Something you pluck off and eat.

1261
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,105
What do you pluck off and eat?

1262
00:42:55,815 --> 00:42:57,855
- Something that bruises. - Is it something I like?

1263
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:00,485
(Sucking in)

1264
00:43:00,815 --> 00:43:01,915
Detox?

1265
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,014
- When you're on a diet. - When you're on a diet.

1266
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:05,084
(Tomatoes are famous for its weight-loss benefits.)

1267
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:07,254
- This is good for losing weight. - It's good for losing weight.

1268
00:43:07,255 --> 00:43:08,595
- It's a fruit. - Cherry tomato.

1269
00:43:09,725 --> 00:43:12,295
(Round 2 for Team BB is over.)

1270
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:13,795
(Falling to the ground)

1271
00:43:15,495 --> 00:43:16,894
(She used up all her energy.)

1272
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:18,804
Hey, you fools.

1273
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,104
(Thank you for your hard work.)

1274
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:21,105
Gosh.

1275
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:22,974
(We can't watch this without getting teary-eyed.)

1276
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,104
Young Ji, thank you for your hard work.

1277
00:43:24,105 --> 00:43:25,745
My nose is running.

1278
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:27,815
- Gosh. - You worked so hard.

1279
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:29,915
I feel like that took 40 minutes.

1280
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:31,315
This is...

1281
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,945
so hard to tell who'll win.

1282
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:36,155
They took 12 minutes and 19 seconds.

1283
00:43:36,255 --> 00:43:37,954
- That's less time than earlier. - That's less time than earlier.

1284
00:43:37,955 --> 00:43:39,254
- That's less time than earlier. - Your time record improved.

1285
00:43:39,255 --> 00:43:41,295
I can't tell who'll win either.

1286
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,195
(Round 2 of charades for Team BF)

1287
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:45,365
- Selena. - Yes?

1288
00:43:45,595 --> 00:43:46,595
I'm your friend, right?

1289
00:43:46,596 --> 00:43:47,734
- You're Friend One. - Yes.

1290
00:43:47,735 --> 00:43:49,671
- You're my best friend forever. - You're Friend One.

1291
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:50,695
Let's go.

1292
00:43:50,965 --> 00:43:51,965
Ready.

1293
00:43:52,235 --> 00:43:54,035
(Nervous)

1294
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:55,435
Begin.

1295
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:56,535
(White wine)

1296
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,675
(They got "red wine" during the first round.)

1297
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,015
It's five syllables.

1298
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:02,874
(What Eun Ji did earlier)

1299
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:04,544
Wine. Red wine. White wine.

1300
00:44:04,545 --> 00:44:05,545
Correct.

1301
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:07,291
(She easily guessed the first one correctly.)

1302
00:44:07,315 --> 00:44:08,485
(The next one...)

1303
00:44:08,655 --> 00:44:09,754
(is "60th birthday.")

1304
00:44:09,755 --> 00:44:11,585
(It got way more difficult right away.)

1305
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,154
(How will Yu Jin describe "60th birthday" with her body?)

1306
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:17,395
Is it 6 syllables? Is it 60 syllables?

1307
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:20,835
Numbers 6 and 0.

1308
00:44:21,135 --> 00:44:22,165
Clapping.

1309
00:44:22,795 --> 00:44:24,505
(Eun Ji hasn't caught on yet.)

1310
00:44:27,135 --> 00:44:28,174
(In that moment, Yu Jin's eyes landed on...)

1311
00:44:28,175 --> 00:44:29,205
Na Yeong Seok.

1312
00:44:29,775 --> 00:44:31,175
(Na Yeong Seok's age: 60 minus 11)

1313
00:44:32,175 --> 00:44:33,445
She's so mean.

1314
00:44:33,475 --> 00:44:35,045
(I'm sorry, Brother Yeong Seok.)

1315
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,615
Numbers 6 and 0.

1316
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:39,545
Six.

1317
00:44:40,715 --> 00:44:41,815
Six.

1318
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:43,615
Is it 60?

1319
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:45,155
(Congratulations!)

1320
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:46,784
The answer is 60th birthday.

1321
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:48,755
(They made that difficult one look easy.)

1322
00:44:48,855 --> 00:44:50,395
(Tiramisu)

1323
00:44:50,725 --> 00:44:52,625
(Tiramisu?)

1324
00:44:52,795 --> 00:44:54,735
(This was a viral dance challenge.)

1325
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:56,195
(Tiramisu cake)

1326
00:44:56,265 --> 00:44:57,534
Tiramisu

1327
00:44:57,535 --> 00:44:59,064
- Gosh. - cake.

1328
00:44:59,065 --> 00:45:00,334
- It's tiramisu. - Correct.

1329
00:45:00,335 --> 00:45:01,975
(Eun Ji gave 3 correct answers in a row.)

1330
00:45:02,135 --> 00:45:03,274
(Organic)

1331
00:45:03,275 --> 00:45:05,021
(It just got way harder all of a sudden, again.)

1332
00:45:05,045 --> 00:45:06,104
(It's so difficult to express that Yu Jin can't help but laugh.)

1333
00:45:06,105 --> 00:45:07,105
What?

1334
00:45:07,106 --> 00:45:09,715
(A rough lies ahead for them.)

1335
00:45:10,045 --> 00:45:12,785
(Yu Jin starts off by pretending to plant seeds.)

1336
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:14,684
- This one's hard. - This is a tough one.

1337
00:45:14,685 --> 00:45:15,931
- It's difficult to express. - Too hard.

1338
00:45:15,955 --> 00:45:17,155
Planting seedlings?

1339
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:19,455
She has a long way to go from here.

1340
00:45:19,585 --> 00:45:21,024
(Seeding, watering, germination, weeding, fertilizing, pesticide)

1341
00:45:21,025 --> 00:45:22,455
(Yu Jin is still at seeding.)

1342
00:45:23,195 --> 00:45:25,225
(Spraying)

1343
00:45:25,465 --> 00:45:27,564
Firefighter. Fire station.

1344
00:45:27,565 --> 00:45:28,595
Rice transplanting.

1345
00:45:29,265 --> 00:45:31,411
I'm guessing this doesn't have to do with rice paddies or fields.

1346
00:45:31,435 --> 00:45:32,565
"Green Bean, Red Bean?"

1347
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,805
(Silently screaming)

1348
00:45:36,405 --> 00:45:38,275
Let's slow down. You're planting.

1349
00:45:39,505 --> 00:45:40,605
Now you're spraying.

1350
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:43,415
No spraying? Don't spray pesticide.

1351
00:45:43,475 --> 00:45:44,515
Pesticide-free?

1352
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:45,945
Pesticide.

1353
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,315
Three syllables?

1354
00:45:47,655 --> 00:45:48,985
(It's "organic.")

1355
00:45:49,785 --> 00:45:50,925
Pest-pesticide?

1356
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:53,155
You're almost there.

1357
00:45:53,255 --> 00:45:54,255
You.

1358
00:45:56,325 --> 00:45:57,964
You. Organic.

1359
00:45:57,965 --> 00:45:59,224
Correct.

1360
00:45:59,225 --> 00:46:00,394
(Eun Ji is Quick-Witted Friend 1.)

1361
00:46:00,395 --> 00:46:01,664
- She's good. - Right.

1362
00:46:01,665 --> 00:46:02,864
(Judicial examination)

1363
00:46:02,865 --> 00:46:04,665
(It keeps getting harder and harder.)

1364
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:06,504
This is a hard one.

1365
00:46:06,505 --> 00:46:07,635
Four syllables.

1366
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:09,735
Four syllables.

1367
00:46:10,305 --> 00:46:11,345
Four syllables?

1368
00:46:12,675 --> 00:46:13,675
- What? - This is a hard one.

1369
00:46:13,676 --> 00:46:16,815
(What Yu Jin meant was...)

1370
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:19,415
(the first syllable of "judicial examination.")

1371
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:21,015
(Four syllables?)

1372
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:22,384
(It is true that the word has four syllables.)

1373
00:46:22,385 --> 00:46:24,784
What? Is there...

1374
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,055
a total of 16 syllables?

1375
00:46:26,455 --> 00:46:27,554
(Eun Ji misunderstood big time.)

1376
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:29,554
Four syllables. It does have four syllables,

1377
00:46:29,555 --> 00:46:31,495
but the first syllable...

1378
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:32,565
is "sa."

1379
00:46:34,335 --> 00:46:35,935
(How am I supposed to explain the rest?)

1380
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:38,505
Judge.

1381
00:46:38,965 --> 00:46:39,965
Attorney.

1382
00:46:40,405 --> 00:46:41,405
No.

1383
00:46:41,575 --> 00:46:42,575
Prosecutor?

1384
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,345
(It seems as if Yu Jin wants to express "judicial.")

1385
00:46:46,445 --> 00:46:48,145
(Doing so is quite hard.)

1386
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:49,175
The second syllable.

1387
00:46:49,745 --> 00:46:50,844
Forget about it for now?

1388
00:46:50,845 --> 00:46:52,805
We're moving on to the third syllable? All right.

1389
00:46:54,385 --> 00:46:55,385
All right.

1390
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,254
(Yu Jin, you "go," girl.)

1391
00:46:58,255 --> 00:46:59,655
That's just Yu Jin being Yu Jin.

1392
00:46:59,725 --> 00:47:01,254
Hey. Go.

1393
00:47:01,255 --> 00:47:02,495
Go where?

1394
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:05,725
I see. "Go" is the third syllable.

1395
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:07,094
(Eun Ji has the 1st and 3rd syllables, so far.)

1396
00:47:07,095 --> 00:47:09,765
"Sa" is the 1st syllable and the 3rd is "go."

1397
00:47:10,365 --> 00:47:11,434
- This is a hard one. - Yes.

1398
00:47:11,435 --> 00:47:14,435
(Trying to express "si.")

1399
00:47:14,775 --> 00:47:15,775
(I see.)

1400
00:47:16,775 --> 00:47:20,604
(Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti.)

1401
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:21,615
(This last one.)

1402
00:47:22,445 --> 00:47:25,885
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti.

1403
00:47:26,485 --> 00:47:28,814
"Sa" is the 1st syllable, the 3rd is "go," and...

1404
00:47:28,815 --> 00:47:30,354
- Judicial examination. - Correct.

1405
00:47:30,355 --> 00:47:31,524
(Eun Ji finally got the answer after Yu Jin described each syllable.)

1406
00:47:31,525 --> 00:47:32,585
Correct.

1407
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,285
(Sighing)

1408
00:47:34,355 --> 00:47:35,654
- Judicial examination. - Correct.

1409
00:47:35,655 --> 00:47:37,965
("The Tale of Lady Ok")

1410
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:40,864
- That's a tough one. - Screen. It's a TV show.

1411
00:47:40,865 --> 00:47:42,065
It consists of five syllables.

1412
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,835
You didn't watch it. Yu Jin didn't watch it.

1413
00:47:46,105 --> 00:47:47,135
- What? - What?

1414
00:47:48,705 --> 00:47:49,805
Is it a historical drama?

1415
00:47:50,005 --> 00:47:51,205
I think it is.

1416
00:47:53,175 --> 00:47:54,721
The title of a historical drama with five syllables.

1417
00:47:54,745 --> 00:47:55,915
The second one.

1418
00:47:56,615 --> 00:47:58,345
We'll do the second syllable.

1419
00:47:58,515 --> 00:48:00,345
No, we'll start with the third syllable.

1420
00:48:00,385 --> 00:48:02,555
We'll do the 3rd and 4th syllables.

1421
00:48:02,785 --> 00:48:04,705
- She's good at understanding her. - She's good.

1422
00:48:05,455 --> 00:48:06,455
Marriage.

1423
00:48:06,585 --> 00:48:08,425
The groom. The bride.

1424
00:48:08,895 --> 00:48:10,055
The bride.

1425
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,225
It is the bride. Dirbe?

1426
00:48:13,365 --> 00:48:15,265
- "Bu?" - You're moving further away.

1427
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:16,435
"Bu?"

1428
00:48:17,335 --> 00:48:19,565
(It's the Chinese character pronounced "in" in Korean.)

1429
00:48:19,665 --> 00:48:20,705
Busan.

1430
00:48:22,005 --> 00:48:23,805
"Bu." Is that an "s" sound?

1431
00:48:24,005 --> 00:48:25,105
It's not an "s" sound.

1432
00:48:25,275 --> 00:48:26,444
(Yu Jin is doing calligraphy in midair.)

1433
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,645
It is an "s" sound.

1434
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:30,875
(She draws it again from Eun Ji's perspective.)

1435
00:48:31,015 --> 00:48:32,915
You could just do that on paper.

1436
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:35,814
Let's start over.

1437
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:37,684
It has five syllables and is on Netflix.

1438
00:48:37,685 --> 00:48:39,285
You also said it was a historical drama.

1439
00:48:41,995 --> 00:48:44,155
- The fifth syllable. - This is the last syllable.

1440
00:48:45,665 --> 00:48:47,965
Rain. Snow.

1441
00:48:52,635 --> 00:48:54,805
Green onion jeon. It must be green onion jeon.

1442
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,181
(She got the fifth syllable right.)

1443
00:48:57,205 --> 00:48:59,474
It must be a kind of jeon. "The Tale of Lady Ok?"

1444
00:48:59,475 --> 00:49:00,805
- Correct. - Correct.

1445
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:02,345
(From "jeon,")

1446
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:03,851
(she moved onto "The Tale of Lady Ok.")

1447
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:06,195
(As expected, she knows a lot about Korean media content.)

1448
00:49:06,315 --> 00:49:08,285
(Respect)

1449
00:49:08,455 --> 00:49:09,455
(An excellent performance by Selena)
Keep going.

1450
00:49:11,555 --> 00:49:12,825
The sea. Waves.

1451
00:49:13,025 --> 00:49:14,154
(Flatfish)

1452
00:49:14,155 --> 00:49:16,954
It's a type of raw fish.

1453
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:17,965
Flatfish?

1454
00:49:18,595 --> 00:49:20,265
- How did you know? - How?

1455
00:49:20,995 --> 00:49:22,264
(Summer vacation)

1456
00:49:22,265 --> 00:49:24,865
Is it tiring? It's hot.

1457
00:49:25,305 --> 00:49:26,935
You're eating watermelon. Vacation.

1458
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:30,605
- Summer vacation. - Goodness.

1459
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:32,674
- Gosh. - How did she get it?

1460
00:49:32,675 --> 00:49:33,675
She's good at guessing.
(Only 2 questions remain.)

1461
00:49:34,676 --> 00:49:35,836
(They didn't skip any words.)

1462
00:49:36,345 --> 00:49:38,885
It's a word with three syllables. Bus?

1463
00:49:39,385 --> 00:49:40,645
(Gangnam Station)

1464
00:49:40,915 --> 00:49:43,115
Bus? Subway.

1465
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:44,755
(She got all the way to subway.)

1466
00:49:45,455 --> 00:49:46,455
Two syllables?

1467
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:48,655
Three syllables.

1468
00:49:49,555 --> 00:49:50,555
Subway.

1469
00:49:56,095 --> 00:49:57,965
(What does the V sign mean?)

1470
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:00,465
This is incredible.

1471
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:02,975
- What's that? - What's that?

1472
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,351
You aren't saying that it has two syllables, are you?

1473
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:07,505
It's three syllables.

1474
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,125
Among the three, which syllable is it?

1475
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:11,045
(Did you figure it out?)

1476
00:50:12,215 --> 00:50:13,215
Bus. Subway.

1477
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:15,785
(Line Two)

1478
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:19,325
(A popular place on Line 2 with foot traffic of 180,000 people per day)

1479
00:50:19,425 --> 00:50:23,025
(This station, Gangnam Station)

1480
00:50:23,455 --> 00:50:25,695
(Will Eun Ji recognize this gesture?)

1481
00:50:25,795 --> 00:50:26,865
Bus. Subway.

1482
00:50:27,895 --> 00:50:28,895
Subway Two?

1483
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:31,805
Subway Two? KTX?

1484
00:50:32,335 --> 00:50:34,065
KTX? Subway Two?

1485
00:50:34,935 --> 00:50:36,675
(Team BF hit the brakes.)

1486
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:39,204
- I see what she means. - Two things.

1487
00:50:39,205 --> 00:50:41,051
(She stretches out the V sign heartbreakingly.)

1488
00:50:41,075 --> 00:50:42,215
Two syllables?

1489
00:50:42,315 --> 00:50:43,491
(She also got the number of syllables wrong.)

1490
00:50:43,515 --> 00:50:44,515
Two.

1491
00:50:45,885 --> 00:50:46,885
Two.

1492
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:49,784
(Did something pass by?)

1493
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:50,785
Number two?

1494
00:50:51,185 --> 00:50:52,185
Two.

1495
00:50:52,585 --> 00:50:53,585
Ho.

1496
00:50:53,755 --> 00:50:55,055
(Line 2!)

1497
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:56,155
Number two?

1498
00:50:56,855 --> 00:50:58,265
(What comes after number 2?)

1499
00:50:59,225 --> 00:51:00,345
What does "number two" mean?

1500
00:51:01,965 --> 00:51:02,965
Number two.

1501
00:51:03,535 --> 00:51:04,905
Is there a number two train?

1502
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:08,874
Do you want to skip it?

1503
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,834
We'll be successful. We're fine.

1504
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:12,545
- The chances aren't bad. - I agree.

1505
00:51:13,545 --> 00:51:14,614
(Groaning)

1506
00:51:14,615 --> 00:51:15,615
(Puppy An howls.)

1507
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:18,244
How many syllables? It has three syllables.

1508
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:20,645
What's the first syllable?

1509
00:51:23,155 --> 00:51:24,155
Wave.

1510
00:51:24,885 --> 00:51:25,925
Ripple.

1511
00:51:26,485 --> 00:51:27,855
Ripple. Wave.

1512
00:51:29,095 --> 00:51:30,095
Groove?

1513
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,064
Rhythm. It's not rhythm.

1514
00:51:33,065 --> 00:51:34,935
Calm.

1515
00:51:35,565 --> 00:51:36,565
Swimming.

1516
00:51:37,435 --> 00:51:38,805
- Swimming... - Skip.

1517
00:51:39,435 --> 00:51:40,605
Gosh, they're in trouble.

1518
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:42,635
Driving.

1519
00:51:43,275 --> 00:51:45,104
(They finally reach the last question.)

1520
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:46,145
It's a four-syllable word.

1521
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:49,815
Meat.

1522
00:51:50,815 --> 00:51:51,845
Thin.

1523
00:51:52,715 --> 00:51:54,884
(Explaining intuitively)

1524
00:51:54,885 --> 00:51:55,885
A complimentary dish?

1525
00:51:56,715 --> 00:51:58,355
You eat it very quickly.

1526
00:52:00,155 --> 00:52:01,155
Shabu-shabu?

1527
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:02,994
(2 minutes passed without getting anything correct.)

1528
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:03,995
Beef.

1529
00:52:04,725 --> 00:52:06,685
Something thin like brisket or shaved pork belly?

1530
00:52:06,925 --> 00:52:08,464
(She finally mentioned brisket.)

1531
00:52:08,465 --> 00:52:11,435
Brisket. Four syllables.

1532
00:52:11,905 --> 00:52:13,134
What comes after that?

1533
00:52:13,135 --> 00:52:14,264
They're in trouble.

1534
00:52:14,265 --> 00:52:15,575
What comes after that?

1535
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:17,334
(What kind of question is that?)

1536
00:52:17,335 --> 00:52:18,845
Brisket meat?

1537
00:52:19,775 --> 00:52:21,005
(Eun Ji?)

1538
00:52:21,415 --> 00:52:22,415
(Selena?)

1539
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:25,045
Brisket... Shaved brisket?

1540
00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:27,645
(Gasping)

1541
00:52:27,885 --> 00:52:29,354
Maybe she doesn't know.

1542
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:30,585
Brisket doenjang stew?

1543
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:32,725
Brisket ssamjang?

1544
00:52:32,985 --> 00:52:34,895
- Nice. - Nice.

1545
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:37,054
What comes after brisket?

1546
00:52:37,055 --> 00:52:38,895
- I didn't expect this to happen. - Brisket...

1547
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,024
She got stuck on something totally unexpected.

1548
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:42,134
(In search for beef that's missing)

1549
00:52:42,135 --> 00:52:45,135
You aren't explaining what comes before.

1550
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:47,665
Two brisket.

1551
00:52:48,605 --> 00:52:50,005
What is two brisket?

1552
00:52:50,105 --> 00:52:51,575
(It's not Cha Du Ri either.)

1553
00:52:51,675 --> 00:52:53,315
Could you lower the keyword for a minute?

1554
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,815
Keep it out of sight.

1555
00:52:55,575 --> 00:52:58,545
- Can I turn around? - Yes.

1556
00:52:58,985 --> 00:53:01,755
(Producer Park Hyun Yong)

1557
00:53:01,785 --> 00:53:02,785
Brisket Hyun Yong?

1558
00:53:04,725 --> 00:53:05,725
No.

1559
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:06,885
Brisket Hyun Yong?

1560
00:53:07,825 --> 00:53:09,555
(They're completely stuck.)

1561
00:53:09,925 --> 00:53:10,925
No.

1562
00:53:12,365 --> 00:53:14,565
Brisket something something.

1563
00:53:15,665 --> 00:53:17,365
- The answer has been said. - Park?

1564
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:21,135
- Beef brisket? - Correct.

1565
00:53:21,805 --> 00:53:24,235
I know the word, but how could she explain it like that?

1566
00:53:24,845 --> 00:53:26,444
- It's the last one. - It's the last question.

1567
00:53:26,445 --> 00:53:28,575
They have one left.

1568
00:53:29,315 --> 00:53:30,815
(They still have hope.)

1569
00:53:31,215 --> 00:53:33,245
It's the subway, but what does this mean?

1570
00:53:33,515 --> 00:53:35,085
- Subway. - Eun Ji, what's this?

1571
00:53:35,555 --> 00:53:36,585
The hand.

1572
00:53:37,185 --> 00:53:38,624
(The infernal subway)

1573
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:39,784
She's angry.

1574
00:53:39,785 --> 00:53:40,925
She looks angry.

1575
00:53:41,925 --> 00:53:43,855
- Two? - This is impossible.

1576
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,495
- Hand, two? - Nothing is working.

1577
00:53:47,195 --> 00:53:48,195
Two.

1578
00:53:48,535 --> 00:53:49,865
(Begging desperately)

1579
00:53:51,405 --> 00:53:52,705
Subway Line Two?

1580
00:53:53,735 --> 00:53:56,175
(She finally got on Line 2 after making a detour.)

1581
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:58,575
(Now, how will she explain Gangnam Station?)

1582
00:53:58,675 --> 00:54:00,805
In the direction of Soyosan Station. That's Line One.

1583
00:54:01,175 --> 00:54:03,144
She even said Soyosan Station, but she didn't get the answer.

1584
00:54:03,145 --> 00:54:04,145
(Back to Subway Line 2)

1585
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:07,545
It's Subway Line Two.

1586
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:11,055
You hear the announcement.

1587
00:54:11,155 --> 00:54:12,584
(The screen door is opening.)

1588
00:54:12,585 --> 00:54:13,955
It tells you to get off.

1589
00:54:14,955 --> 00:54:17,125
- "It's so crowded." - You're doing well.

1590
00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:18,465
"What should I do?"

1591
00:54:19,565 --> 00:54:20,565
(Grunting)

1592
00:54:21,765 --> 00:54:23,395
(Clearing her throat)

1593
00:54:23,495 --> 00:54:25,064
(An unkempt puppy)

1594
00:54:25,065 --> 00:54:26,564
They'll also play until they turn 60.

1595
00:54:26,565 --> 00:54:27,965
(Taking revenge for a moment ago)

1596
00:54:28,205 --> 00:54:30,604
You even said Soyosan Station, so you should know this.

1597
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:32,045
In the direction of Soyosan Station.

1598
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:33,975
- No, forget about that. - Line Two.

1599
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:38,285
Gangnam on Line Two.

1600
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:40,161
(She finally mentioned Gangnam.)

1601
00:54:40,185 --> 00:54:41,625
(Did she finally arrive in Gangnam?)

1602
00:54:42,585 --> 00:54:45,354
Gangnam District Office.

1603
00:54:45,355 --> 00:54:46,584
(Three syllables)

1604
00:54:46,585 --> 00:54:48,695
- Three syllables? Gangnam Station. - Correct.

1605
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:51,565
(Team BF's Round 2 is over.)

1606
00:54:51,825 --> 00:54:52,864
(Eun Ji...)

1607
00:54:52,865 --> 00:54:54,264
- What's the result? - It was Gangnam Station.

1608
00:54:54,265 --> 00:54:56,065
- How did it turn out? - Gangnam...

1609
00:54:56,795 --> 00:54:59,005
Gangnam. Well done. What was this about?

1610
00:54:59,105 --> 00:55:01,365
- Well done. - Good job.

1611
00:55:01,975 --> 00:55:03,574
We all played exceptionally.

1612
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:06,174
- The answer was Gangnam Station. - Gangnam Station.

1613
00:55:06,175 --> 00:55:08,414
- That was a great game. - A great game.

1614
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:09,845
Everyone, you worked very hard.

1615
00:55:09,945 --> 00:55:11,274
What's the result?

1616
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:13,784
Eun Ji and Yu Jin's...

1617
00:55:13,785 --> 00:55:15,505
- record is... - I have to buy the T-shirt.

1618
00:55:16,085 --> 00:55:17,085
Fourteen minutes...

1619
00:55:17,685 --> 00:55:20,185
The difference must be a few seconds.

1620
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:22,324
- And nine minutes. - That's good.

1621
00:55:22,325 --> 00:55:25,125
Mimi and Young Ji's record is 27 minutes and 4 seconds.

1622
00:55:25,595 --> 00:55:28,895
Eun Ji and Yu Jin's record is 26 minutes and 35 seconds.

1623
00:55:29,635 --> 00:55:32,305
Eun Ji and Yu Jin are the winners.

1624
00:55:32,405 --> 00:55:34,665
(Team Best Friends wins.)

1625
00:55:35,105 --> 00:55:37,675
- Get on my back. - Eun Ji.

1626
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:43,944
We only took 29 more seconds than they did,

1627
00:55:43,945 --> 00:55:45,284
so we can't call ourselves fools.

1628
00:55:45,285 --> 00:55:46,984
- Of course not. - Right, we aren't stupid.

1629
00:55:46,985 --> 00:55:48,114
We're geniuses.

1630
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:49,391
- You aren't fools. - We're geniuses.

1631
00:55:49,415 --> 00:55:50,754
- Ge. - Nuises.

1632
00:55:50,755 --> 00:55:51,885
- Cross. - Cross.

1633
00:55:53,185 --> 00:55:55,025
- I have a question. - Yes?

1634
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:57,225
Do the winners get to go shopping only?

1635
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,995
The losers will only watch.

1636
00:55:59,665 --> 00:56:00,894
I want them to come.

1637
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:02,835
- Join us. - Would you like to come?

1638
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:05,395
Do we have to carry your bags?

1639
00:56:06,205 --> 00:56:08,005
(Cowardly and yet endearing)

1640
00:56:12,705 --> 00:56:14,105
These look pretty.

1641
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:16,714
Before going out to shop,

1642
00:56:16,715 --> 00:56:18,685
the lip makeup is important.

1643
00:56:19,615 --> 00:56:21,854
You should fix your makeup before going shopping.

1644
00:56:21,855 --> 00:56:23,355
Exactly.

1645
00:56:25,255 --> 00:56:27,225
- The color is so pretty. - Yes.

1646
00:56:28,025 --> 00:56:29,025
It stings.

1647
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,195
It really stings.

1648
00:56:33,425 --> 00:56:34,865
(Exclaiming)

1649
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,164
Do I look like Angelina Jolie?

1650
00:56:37,165 --> 00:56:40,135
Your lips look full and sexy.

1651
00:56:42,835 --> 00:56:45,775
(She has a strong presence.)

1652
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:49,844
(After Mimi, everyone puts on some makeup.)

1653
00:56:49,845 --> 00:56:51,815
- Eun Ji. - It stings.

1654
00:56:52,845 --> 00:56:55,014
Young Ji, you look pretty. Your lips are sparkling.

1655
00:56:55,015 --> 00:56:56,815
(They finish fixing their look harmoniously.)

1656
00:56:57,155 --> 00:56:59,755
(They're ready to go out.)

1657
00:56:59,855 --> 00:57:01,485
Hello. Put on your seatbelt, please.

1658
00:57:01,895 --> 00:57:03,225
Producer Hyun Yong.

1659
00:57:03,325 --> 00:57:04,855
I'll buy the soccer uniform.

1660
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:06,365
But you can't shop.

1661
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,195
I thought that we could.

1662
00:57:08,295 --> 00:57:09,334
But you lost.

1663
00:57:09,335 --> 00:57:10,541
(Deeply distressed Young Ji makes the eldest burst out laughing.)

1664
00:57:10,565 --> 00:57:12,364
Everything looks European.

1665
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:14,065
I agree. The street looks beautiful.

1666
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:16,304
- On the ground, - It's so beautiful.

1667
00:57:16,305 --> 00:57:18,944
- do you see the train railroad? - Yes.

1668
00:57:18,945 --> 00:57:20,044
It's the tram railroad.

1669
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:22,075
- Tram? - It's so pretty.

1670
00:57:22,915 --> 00:57:25,445
(The railroad is on every street in Lisbon.)

1671
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:28,855
(It's the tram track.)

1672
00:57:29,585 --> 00:57:31,984
(A symbolic mode of transportation in Lisbon)

1673
00:57:31,985 --> 00:57:35,325
(It crosses narrow and steep alleyways.)

1674
00:57:36,155 --> 00:57:39,064
(The tram carrying romance)

1675
00:57:39,065 --> 00:57:41,295
What's this motif called?

1676
00:57:41,665 --> 00:57:43,135
He told us the name of the motif.

1677
00:57:43,235 --> 00:57:44,764
Azubaju.

1678
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:46,965
- Azuleju. - We're almost there.

1679
00:57:47,065 --> 00:57:48,635
- Azulejo. - Correct.

1680
00:57:49,905 --> 00:57:52,045
(The name of the motif is hard to remember.)

1681
00:57:53,675 --> 00:57:56,215
(Azulejo is a traditional tilework in Portugal.)

1682
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:03,455
(There are many geometric patterns or patterns of nature.)

1683
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:08,455
(Pieces of time engraved on the streets)

1684
00:58:09,495 --> 00:58:13,395
(You can easily find them at souvenir shops.)

1685
00:58:13,965 --> 00:58:15,734
(Lisbon romance on the palm of your hand)

1686
00:58:15,735 --> 00:58:18,664
Everything looks so romantic.

1687
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:19,935
This place is so lovely.

1688
00:58:22,635 --> 00:58:24,634
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1689
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:27,045
(While sightseeing, they arrived before they knew it.)

1690
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:31,645
It's beautiful. Look at the street. It's so romantic.

1691
00:58:32,015 --> 00:58:33,514
- Look over there. That's insane. - It's so beautiful.

1692
00:58:33,515 --> 00:58:34,515
It's beautiful.

1693
00:58:34,516 --> 00:58:37,885
(The place that caught their eye)

1694
00:58:39,355 --> 00:58:41,755
(Figueira Square)

1695
00:58:42,595 --> 00:58:45,795
(A square for meetings at the center of Lisbon)

1696
00:58:46,795 --> 00:58:50,495
(A vibrant place with various markets)

1697
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:55,004
(A place with a lot to see and eat)

1698
00:58:55,005 --> 00:58:57,134
Ronaldo is over there.

1699
00:58:57,135 --> 00:58:58,175
- It's Ronaldo. - Ronaldo.

1700
00:58:58,845 --> 00:59:00,145
It's very...

1701
00:59:01,945 --> 00:59:04,915
(A popular soccer souvenir shop in Lisbon)

1702
00:59:05,885 --> 00:59:07,414
(As a soccer mecca, )

1703
00:59:07,415 --> 00:59:08,985
(it boasts an extraordinary scale.)

1704
00:59:09,985 --> 00:59:11,214
(With various merchandise...)

1705
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,525
(related to Ronaldo, it's very popular among tourists.)

1706
00:59:14,355 --> 00:59:16,895
(An assembly of various uniforms)

1707
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:20,094
(It's also possible to engrave any initials.)

1708
00:59:20,095 --> 00:59:21,364
Cristiano Ronaldo.

1709
00:59:21,365 --> 00:59:22,605
(They enter the souvenir shop.)

1710
00:59:22,765 --> 00:59:23,795
Ronaldo.

1711
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:25,404
It looks so scary.

1712
00:59:25,405 --> 00:59:27,864
Yu Jin, you should wear something short like this.

1713
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:28,974
(Eun Ji and Yu Jin start shopping right away.)

1714
00:59:28,975 --> 00:59:32,245
Isn't this hooded sweatshirt nice too?

1715
00:59:32,345 --> 00:59:33,775
Eun Ji, look.

1716
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,914
(Playing Charades here too)

1717
00:59:35,915 --> 00:59:37,444
If we can't buy anything,

1718
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:38,525
why did they bring us here?

1719
00:59:39,045 --> 00:59:40,525
- Why are we here? - Why are we here?

1720
00:59:40,585 --> 00:59:41,684
We can't buy anything.

1721
00:59:41,685 --> 00:59:43,885
Is it true that all we can do is look?

1722
00:59:44,515 --> 00:59:46,685
(Yes, I think so...)

1723
00:59:47,255 --> 00:59:49,195
(She keeps noticing must-have items.)

1724
00:59:49,655 --> 00:59:51,025
You can't buy it. Put it down.

1725
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:52,664
(Still attached)

1726
00:59:52,665 --> 00:59:53,665
The green one.

1727
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:56,465
I want to have this.

1728
00:59:57,065 --> 00:59:58,065
Is it a bag?

1729
00:59:58,066 --> 00:59:59,204
(Young Ji also finds a must-have item.)

1730
00:59:59,205 --> 01:00:00,305
It's cute, but...

1731
01:00:00,535 --> 01:00:02,605
- Young Ji, you can't buy it. - You're right.

1732
01:00:03,405 --> 01:00:04,605
Mimi, what do you want to buy?

1733
01:00:04,905 --> 01:00:06,145
I want a tumbler.

1734
01:00:06,445 --> 01:00:07,445
Tumbler?

1735
01:00:07,446 --> 01:00:09,606
- I saw pretty tumblers a while ago. - There are many.

1736
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:11,045
- Hey, Yu Jin. - Yes?

1737
01:00:11,545 --> 01:00:14,545
Can we buy a tumbler and a shoe pouch?

1738
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:16,855
Wait, let me ask my friend.

1739
01:00:17,115 --> 01:00:18,155
- Eun Ji. - Yes?

1740
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:19,731
- You called me your friend. - By the way...

1741
01:00:19,755 --> 01:00:20,755
- My friend. - Am I Sally?
- Sally. - Yes?

1742
01:00:22,025 --> 01:00:24,924
They want to buy a shoe pouch and a tumbler.

1743
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:26,085
What do you think about that?

1744
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:27,394
I'm really curious.

1745
01:00:27,395 --> 01:00:29,995
You really want to buy a shoe pouch and a tumbler...

1746
01:00:30,395 --> 01:00:32,665
- here? - They won't let us buy anything.

1747
01:00:33,465 --> 01:00:36,375
Why don't you pick out a T-shirt instead?

1748
01:00:36,475 --> 01:00:38,644
- Isn't that better? - Thank you.

1749
01:00:38,645 --> 01:00:39,744
(Bowing politely)

1750
01:00:39,745 --> 01:00:41,105
Just pick what you want.

1751
01:00:41,345 --> 01:00:43,265
You can pick, but I didn't say you could buy it.

1752
01:00:43,615 --> 01:00:44,615
Yes!

1753
01:00:44,945 --> 01:00:47,085
(Team BB also goes off to shop.)

1754
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:49,954
Sally, how about matching T-shirts?

1755
01:00:49,955 --> 01:00:51,384
I like it.

1756
01:00:51,385 --> 01:00:52,854
- I like it, girl. - Yes.

1757
01:00:52,855 --> 01:00:53,984
Let's try it.

1758
01:00:53,985 --> 01:00:55,425
(Laughing)

1759
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:57,495
I'm her friend, right?

1760
01:00:58,395 --> 01:00:59,825
Sally, what did you say?

1761
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,765
Yes. Oh, yes.

1762
01:01:02,735 --> 01:01:04,465
Sister, you're very much a girl.

1763
01:01:04,665 --> 01:01:06,465
- Very much a girl. - Put it on and come out.

1764
01:01:07,065 --> 01:01:08,775
Three, two, one.

1765
01:01:09,935 --> 01:01:10,935
Hello.

1766
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:12,875
Hello, everyone.

1767
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:17,275
- My name is Sally. - My name is Cathy.

1768
01:01:17,475 --> 01:01:19,845
- We are best friends. - Best friends.

1769
01:01:23,655 --> 01:01:24,655
Bye.

1770
01:01:24,656 --> 01:01:26,416
(It turned into a teenage drama right away.)

1771
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,455
- Look down while glaring. - Okay.

1772
01:01:28,955 --> 01:01:29,995
Bye.

1773
01:01:30,225 --> 01:01:31,494
(Executed)

1774
01:01:31,495 --> 01:01:33,265
(Laughing)

1775
01:01:33,465 --> 01:01:35,564
We must keep it forever. BB.

1776
01:01:35,565 --> 01:01:36,664
- B. - B

1777
01:01:36,665 --> 01:01:37,695
- Cross. - Cross.

1778
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:39,165
When shall we wear this?

1779
01:01:39,365 --> 01:01:40,734
- Shall we wear it tomorrow? - Tomorrow?

1780
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,765
All of us.

1781
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:43,434
New.

1782
01:01:43,435 --> 01:01:45,351
(They plan to wear matching clothes like these.)

1783
01:01:45,375 --> 01:01:46,505
Thank you, Team BF.

1784
01:01:47,705 --> 01:01:48,744
Thank you.

1785
01:01:48,745 --> 01:01:51,174
(Everyone's shopping ended happily.)

1786
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:52,184
- Siu. - Siu.

1787
01:01:52,185 --> 01:01:53,245
One, two, three.

1788
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:54,645
- Siu. - Siu.

1789
01:01:55,515 --> 01:01:58,485
We're going to the observatory now.

1790
01:01:58,585 --> 01:02:00,484
- Observatory. - You'll take a tuk tuk.

1791
01:02:00,485 --> 01:02:01,525
Tuk tuk.

1792
01:02:02,195 --> 01:02:03,355
- Tuk tuk. - Tuk tuk.

1793
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:05,765
- Is that it? - The tuk tuk looks amazing.

1794
01:02:06,365 --> 01:02:07,594
- That's it. - When you take a tuk tuk,

1795
01:02:07,595 --> 01:02:09,394
- they say Torong comes out. - Hi.

1796
01:02:09,395 --> 01:02:10,794
(Tuk tuk is a popular mode of transportation that allows you...)

1797
01:02:10,795 --> 01:02:12,064
(to travel narrow streets and hills in Lisbon.)

1798
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:13,235
- Hello. - Hello.

1799
01:02:13,305 --> 01:02:14,864
(They are going to the observatory which is 10 minutes away.)

1800
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:15,905
- Hello. - Hello.

1801
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:17,335
Let's go.

1802
01:02:17,336 --> 01:02:19,405
(The tuk tuk sets off.)

1803
01:02:20,045 --> 01:02:21,274
- It feels nice and cool. - This way...

1804
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:23,014
It'd be nice to come here also in the summer.

1805
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:24,614
I'd lose my mind if I came here...

1806
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:25,814
- in hot weather. - I see.

1807
01:02:25,815 --> 01:02:27,544
- It looks so beautiful. - That looks cute.

1808
01:02:27,545 --> 01:02:29,545
- It's like we're in Europe. - It's really pretty.

1809
01:02:29,615 --> 01:02:30,984
I love things like this.

1810
01:02:30,985 --> 01:02:32,454
It's so pretty.

1811
01:02:32,455 --> 01:02:34,055
It's pretty.

1812
01:02:34,155 --> 01:02:35,825
We're passing Lisbon Cathedral.

1813
01:02:36,225 --> 01:02:37,254
(Cathedral)

1814
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:38,454
I want to visit there.

1815
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:39,694
(The cathedral era is here)

1816
01:02:39,695 --> 01:02:41,094
(Startled)

1817
01:02:41,095 --> 01:02:43,294
Eun Ji, why are you so excited right now?

1818
01:02:43,295 --> 01:02:44,335
I don't know.

1819
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:47,204
(The majesty of the cathedral that makes you ecstatic)

1820
01:02:47,205 --> 01:02:49,204
Who's that? It's our director.

1821
01:02:49,205 --> 01:02:50,974
(Hello)

1822
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,244
- We're here. - This is so pretty.

1823
01:02:53,245 --> 01:02:54,245
(They've arrived.)

1824
01:02:54,246 --> 01:02:56,474
It's an observatory called Portas do Sol.

1825
01:02:56,475 --> 01:02:57,715
Portas do Sol.

1826
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:00,084
(In Lisbon, the city of hills, )

1827
01:03:00,085 --> 01:03:01,985
(there are over 10 observatories.)

1828
01:03:02,385 --> 01:03:04,884
(Among them, it's the most popular one.)

1829
01:03:04,885 --> 01:03:07,785
(Portas do Sol Observation Deck)

1830
01:03:08,795 --> 01:03:12,464
(A place that offers a sweeping view...)

1831
01:03:12,465 --> 01:03:16,395
(of Lisbon's red rooftops and the blue Tagus River)

1832
01:03:17,135 --> 01:03:18,935
(National Pantheon)

1833
01:03:19,865 --> 01:03:21,705
(Sao Jorge Castle)

1834
01:03:22,505 --> 01:03:24,275
(Lisbon Cathedral)

1835
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:26,144
(A place full of attractions...)

1836
01:03:26,145 --> 01:03:27,975
(that keeps travelers coming back)

1837
01:03:28,675 --> 01:03:31,815
(As the gate of the sun, you can see beautiful sunsets from here.)

1838
01:03:32,085 --> 01:03:33,844
Mimi, what's going on?

1839
01:03:33,845 --> 01:03:36,315
You could find someone.

1840
01:03:36,585 --> 01:03:37,854
- Right. - At this place,

1841
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,355
you could find someone easily.

1842
01:03:39,455 --> 01:03:40,485
It's romantic.

1843
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,025
(Gasping)

1844
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,706
- It looks so beautiful. - This is insane.

1845
01:03:43,755 --> 01:03:44,895
It's insane.

1846
01:03:45,365 --> 01:03:46,925
- It looks so pretty. - It's so pretty.

1847
01:03:47,195 --> 01:03:49,065
It's so beautiful.

1848
01:03:49,295 --> 01:03:50,564
- I don't have my phone with me. - This is insane.

1849
01:03:50,565 --> 01:03:51,765
(With the endless Tagus River)

1850
01:03:52,565 --> 01:03:53,665
It's so beautiful.

1851
01:03:53,805 --> 01:03:55,405
This place is so pretty.

1852
01:03:56,535 --> 01:03:58,704
(A group photo is a must.)

1853
01:03:58,705 --> 01:04:00,205
One, two.

1854
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:04,655
It looks like a composite photo.

1855
01:04:05,445 --> 01:04:07,365
I definitely look like I'm in a composite photo.

1856
01:04:07,785 --> 01:04:09,655
(They make another memory.)

1857
01:04:10,015 --> 01:04:11,455
- Goodness. - It looks so beautiful.

1858
01:04:13,825 --> 01:04:15,354
We're the couple who repaired old houses...

1859
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:16,795
on "Architectural Exploration."

1860
01:04:18,695 --> 01:04:19,795
We should go that way.

1861
01:04:20,525 --> 01:04:21,894
Why do you want to take a photo here?

1862
01:04:21,895 --> 01:04:23,664
- Let's take a photo. - We should go that way.

1863
01:04:23,665 --> 01:04:26,164
Do you know how hard it is to get here?

1864
01:04:26,165 --> 01:04:27,764
- Take a photo together. - Okay.

1865
01:04:27,765 --> 01:04:30,035
Pose like you love me.

1866
01:04:30,635 --> 01:04:31,705
One, two, three.

1867
01:04:32,105 --> 01:04:33,175
(Laughing)

1868
01:04:33,445 --> 01:04:34,944
(Grumpy, endearing)

1869
01:04:34,945 --> 01:04:37,275
I always have to ask you to pose like this.

1870
01:04:38,145 --> 01:04:39,885
Honey, listen.

1871
01:04:40,285 --> 01:04:41,784
- It was perfect until the end. - It was perfect.

1872
01:04:41,785 --> 01:04:42,785
It was perfect.

1873
01:04:42,786 --> 01:04:43,854
My mom always says,

1874
01:04:43,855 --> 01:04:45,925
"Pose for the camera like you love me."

1875
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:48,485
(The skit was based on reality.)

1876
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:51,454
(They discover another popular spot while walking.)

1877
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,465
Young Ji.

1878
01:04:53,665 --> 01:04:58,395
(Random Play Dance in the middle of Lisbon)

1879
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:00,335
It's "Besame Mucho."

1880
01:05:00,705 --> 01:05:01,865
- Besame - Eun Ji.

1881
01:05:02,205 --> 01:05:05,205
(We can't resist Random Play Dance.)

1882
01:05:05,745 --> 01:05:08,004
(The loving couple tries to make up.)

1883
01:05:08,005 --> 01:05:09,174
(Starting to dance)

1884
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:10,515
Mother and Father.

1885
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:12,245
Goodness.

1886
01:05:13,515 --> 01:05:15,414
(The wife who practiced dancesport)

1887
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:16,884
(Huffing)

1888
01:05:16,885 --> 01:05:19,355
(It seems hard to manage.)

1889
01:05:19,525 --> 01:05:20,584
Hide.

1890
01:05:20,585 --> 01:05:22,255
(In the agent mode)

1891
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:23,795
(They keep forgetting about their agent identity.)

1892
01:05:23,796 --> 01:05:25,155
We're drawing too much attention.

1893
01:05:25,995 --> 01:05:27,324
(They're too excited to hide their identity.)

1894
01:05:27,325 --> 01:05:28,325
Hello.

1895
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:32,035
(The mom is excited.)

1896
01:05:32,665 --> 01:05:35,235
(They move to the next location with full of excitement.)

1897
01:05:35,475 --> 01:05:37,635
I want to live here.

1898
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:39,375
- I want to live here. - Really?

1899
01:05:39,775 --> 01:05:41,205
I want to live in Lisbon.

1900
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:42,575
It's so nice here.

1901
01:05:43,345 --> 01:05:45,344
This is Commerce Square.

1902
01:05:45,345 --> 01:05:46,985
- "Commerce Square." - "Commerce Square."

1903
01:05:50,855 --> 01:05:54,655
(Commerce Square)

1904
01:05:55,595 --> 01:05:58,725
(The heart of Lisbon where history is still alive)

1905
01:06:00,365 --> 01:06:02,534
(The starting point that led Portugal...)

1906
01:06:02,535 --> 01:06:06,565
(to the Age of Exploration 500 years ago)

1907
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:10,604
(Where Lisbon's past...)

1908
01:06:10,605 --> 01:06:13,675
(and present converge)

1909
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:20,544
(The biggest square in Portugal that tourists and locals love)

1910
01:06:20,545 --> 01:06:23,154
People must be waiting to see the sunset.

1911
01:06:23,155 --> 01:06:24,715
This is the place.

1912
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:26,954
They drink wine here.

1913
01:06:26,955 --> 01:06:28,655
And they're kissing.

1914
01:06:28,855 --> 01:06:30,695
Those down there on the left are also kissing.

1915
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:32,625
Where?

1916
01:06:32,795 --> 01:06:34,594
- Goodness. - Yes.

1917
01:06:34,595 --> 01:06:36,794
(The age when you love kissing)

1918
01:06:36,795 --> 01:06:37,795
Look at that.

1919
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:40,404
(They move to the ideal spot to watch the sunset.)

1920
01:06:40,405 --> 01:06:42,105
This is amazing. It's insane.

1921
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:45,274
(A view that takes your breath away)

1922
01:06:45,275 --> 01:06:46,875
The waves are big.

1923
01:06:47,805 --> 01:06:49,315
This is incredible.

1924
01:06:50,045 --> 01:06:52,614
- Suddenly, I feel grateful. - We should be thankful.

1925
01:06:52,615 --> 01:06:53,684
- We are... - You feel a sense of reverence.

1926
01:06:53,685 --> 01:06:55,525
- Yes, reverence. - So we can come back again.

1927
01:06:55,855 --> 01:06:57,985
Two days from now?

1928
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:01,884
We should catch Torong quickly and get our suitcases.

1929
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:03,994
Eun Ji, let's catch Torong a little later.

1930
01:07:03,995 --> 01:07:05,094
I'd like to do that too.

1931
01:07:05,095 --> 01:07:07,376
- To stay here longer? - Yes, let's stay a little longer.

1932
01:07:07,525 --> 01:07:09,264
The treasures of Earth Arcade.

1933
01:07:09,265 --> 01:07:10,464
(They take photos to keep as souvenirs.)

1934
01:07:10,465 --> 01:07:11,635
You look lovely.

1935
01:07:12,965 --> 01:07:14,005
Sit down.

1936
01:07:14,265 --> 01:07:16,135
- I love this place. - Me too.

1937
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:19,145
Forget it. He doesn't take photos of me.

1938
01:07:19,545 --> 01:07:20,804
- Who? - Never mind.

1939
01:07:20,805 --> 01:07:22,045
Who doesn't take photos of you?

1940
01:07:22,245 --> 01:07:23,874
You always complain...

1941
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:25,235
when you come to places like this.

1942
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,484
Who complained?

1943
01:07:26,485 --> 01:07:27,844
- Yu Jin, don't worry about him. - You wanted beer yesterday...

1944
01:07:27,845 --> 01:07:29,184
Mimi, don't worry about him.

1945
01:07:29,185 --> 01:07:30,584
How much did we spend to come here?

1946
01:07:30,585 --> 01:07:31,754
About 2,000 dollars...

1947
01:07:31,755 --> 01:07:33,685
- That's enough. - You can buy land with that.

1948
01:07:33,885 --> 01:07:35,284
- Children, I'll take photos of you. - This darn woman...

1949
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:36,855
I'll take photos of you.

1950
01:07:37,325 --> 01:07:39,125
When will we ever get to come back to Lisbon?

1951
01:07:39,225 --> 01:07:40,725
- Mom. - Mom.

1952
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:43,494
(The dad shows his anger with his whole body as he goes up.)

1953
01:07:43,495 --> 01:07:45,564
You look pretty. Get out of the frame.

1954
01:07:45,565 --> 01:07:47,135
Let me take photos of the children.

1955
01:07:47,365 --> 01:07:48,534
- What's wrong with Dad? - What's with him?

1956
01:07:48,535 --> 01:07:49,704
It's useless...

1957
01:07:49,705 --> 01:07:51,175
to give birth and raise children.

1958
01:07:51,505 --> 01:07:52,805
They always stick to their mom.

1959
01:07:53,345 --> 01:07:54,474
Stay here.

1960
01:07:54,475 --> 01:07:56,875
- Mom, Dad is being strange. - Don't worry about him.

1961
01:07:57,315 --> 01:07:58,815
Just look at me.

1962
01:07:59,345 --> 01:08:00,884
(Mom and her daughters who get along well)

1963
01:08:00,885 --> 01:08:02,885
(And Dad who got alienated while getting angry)

1964
01:08:03,685 --> 01:08:06,454
- Why do you keep insisting? - Take a photo.

1965
01:08:06,455 --> 01:08:07,484
Goodness.

1966
01:08:07,485 --> 01:08:09,725
- Take a photo with me. - Seriously...

1967
01:08:10,155 --> 01:08:12,055
Pose like you love me.

1968
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:14,995
(The mom is always yearning for love.)

1969
01:08:15,365 --> 01:08:16,694
- Can you... - You're embarrassing me.

1970
01:08:16,695 --> 01:08:18,164
Stay away. Goodness.

1971
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:19,165
Look.

1972
01:08:19,365 --> 01:08:20,665
(Giggling)

1973
01:08:21,365 --> 01:08:23,374
(You can forget the pose, but don't forget love.)

1974
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:24,535
The photo came out well.

1975
01:08:25,035 --> 01:08:27,144
Dad, let's go eat.

1976
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:28,805
- Dad. - Aren't you the dad?

1977
01:08:29,175 --> 01:08:30,714
You're the dad. Why am I a dad?

1978
01:08:30,715 --> 01:08:31,774
I'm only 24 years old.

1979
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:33,115
- Dad. - Yes?

1980
01:08:33,315 --> 01:08:35,314
- I'm hungry. - You'll be dead meat...

1981
01:08:35,315 --> 01:08:37,485
if you ask for Korean food at a place like this.

1982
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:39,384
Dad, I want some kimchi stew.

1983
01:08:39,385 --> 01:08:41,054
I said that you'd be dead meat, An Yu Jin.

1984
01:08:41,055 --> 01:08:42,954
(The grumpy man of Lisbon)

1985
01:08:42,955 --> 01:08:44,754
Come on, dad. We came all the way here.

1986
01:08:44,755 --> 01:08:45,865
I don't hear you.

1987
01:08:46,565 --> 01:08:49,634
Just buy what Yu Jin wants for once.

1988
01:08:49,635 --> 01:08:51,864
Yu Jin, tell us how much you spent since you got here.

1989
01:08:51,865 --> 01:08:53,625
How much Lunar New Year’s money did you get?

1990
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:55,234
Why are you bringing up that now?

1991
01:08:55,235 --> 01:08:56,375
I know you got a lot.

1992
01:08:56,705 --> 01:08:58,174
- If... - You silly woman...

1993
01:08:58,175 --> 01:09:00,144
If only you hadn't canceled that insurance,

1994
01:09:00,145 --> 01:09:01,744
we wouldn't have come to Lisbon...

1995
01:09:01,745 --> 01:09:03,175
riding a train.

1996
01:09:03,675 --> 01:09:06,015
You gave birth to a daughter just like yourself.

1997
01:09:06,215 --> 01:09:07,814
She doesn't only take after me. I didn't make her by myself.

1998
01:09:07,815 --> 01:09:10,331
(Our program is rated 15 and up. Viewer discretion is advised.)

1999
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:12,985
I sound exactly like my mom.

2000
01:09:14,385 --> 01:09:16,825
- I believe that. - This is what my mom says.

2001
01:09:16,895 --> 01:09:19,325
Quit whining and let’s go eat.

2002
01:09:19,525 --> 01:09:21,464
- I'm hungry. - You'll say, "Did we come..."

2003
01:09:21,465 --> 01:09:23,464
"all the way here to eat this?" and start complaining again.

2004
01:09:23,465 --> 01:09:25,135
Let’s not complain about food.

2005
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:26,964
- We came all this way. - I'm sick of this.

2006
01:09:26,965 --> 01:09:28,234
So, let’s not get on each other’s nerves.

2007
01:09:28,235 --> 01:09:29,675
Your dad’s holding back a lot now.

2008
01:09:29,905 --> 01:09:31,834
As if he can really hold back that much.

2009
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:32,945
(Grumbling)

2010
01:09:32,975 --> 01:09:34,575
I can hear you, woman.

2011
01:09:35,145 --> 01:09:37,714
- Dad, just go. - Mom, come here.

2012
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,714
- Always going on about snacks. - You know what she's like.

2013
01:09:39,715 --> 01:09:41,485
She's not spending just a few dollars.

2014
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:43,185
You think money grows on trees?

2015
01:09:43,255 --> 01:09:44,714
It doesn't spring up from a hole in the ground, you know.

2016
01:09:44,715 --> 01:09:45,755
Dad!

2017
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,585
That's enough for you too, Dad.

2018
01:09:49,195 --> 01:09:51,455
- You go and tell him. - Oh, dear.

2019
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:52,794
- Money doesn't grow on trees. - Dad.

2020
01:09:52,795 --> 01:09:55,665
(The 2nd daughter is handling Dad and the 1st is handling Mom.)

2021
01:09:55,995 --> 01:09:57,235
Really...

2022
01:09:58,035 --> 01:10:00,465
- No wonder he's like that. - Why you...

2023
01:10:00,835 --> 01:10:01,964
(I'm not taking this anymore.)

2024
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:03,304
- You! - Mom, stop!

2025
01:10:03,305 --> 01:10:05,904
- What did I ever say? - Mom!

2026
01:10:05,905 --> 01:10:08,575
(In the end, it turns into an all-out brawl.)

2027
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:11,315
- Are you okay? - I mean...

2028
01:10:11,445 --> 01:10:14,314
This is turning into "Divorce Camp."

2029
01:10:14,315 --> 01:10:15,754
- There's always... - "Divorce Camp."

2030
01:10:15,755 --> 01:10:17,715
leftover stuff that lingers.

2031
01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:20,454
Then it flares up from time to time.

2032
01:10:20,455 --> 01:10:22,084
It's "Divorce Camp."

2033
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:23,094
They have scenes like this?

2034
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:24,894
- Yes. - We should do "Divorce Camp."

2035
01:10:24,895 --> 01:10:26,194
But Dad listens to you, Mom.

2036
01:10:26,195 --> 01:10:27,494
I know.

2037
01:10:27,495 --> 01:10:30,065
But he’s got that weird pride thing going on.

2038
01:10:30,095 --> 01:10:31,934
That’s why he messed up all his businesses.

2039
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:34,164
- I told you not to talk about that. - His tteokbokki business.

2040
01:10:34,165 --> 01:10:35,934
He messed up the tteokbokki shop.

2041
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:37,905
If you hadn't done that, our Mimi...

2042
01:10:38,075 --> 01:10:39,075
(It went from divorce reality show to full-blown soap opera.)

2043
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:40,905
- Dad! - Calm down!

2044
01:10:41,275 --> 01:10:42,874
Dad, what are you doing in front of so many people?

2045
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:45,315
If it weren’t for that, Mimi would have gone to college!

2046
01:10:45,345 --> 01:10:46,384
Tell her not to cry!

2047
01:10:46,385 --> 01:10:47,744
If it weren’t for that, Mimi would have gone to college!

2048
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:48,815
Tell her...

2049
01:10:48,885 --> 01:10:51,414
Yu Jin would have learned Korean dance and everything!

2050
01:10:51,415 --> 01:10:52,484
- Mom, get up. - She would have.

2051
01:10:52,485 --> 01:10:54,054
(Mom is bursting with years of pent-up resentment.)

2052
01:10:54,055 --> 01:10:55,155
Dad!

2053
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:56,501
- She could have done everything! - Okay, Mom.

2054
01:10:56,525 --> 01:10:59,664
(Dad, fuming with rage, is pounding the ground for no reason.)

2055
01:10:59,665 --> 01:11:01,465
(Pounding)

2056
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:03,134
(This is chillingly real.)

2057
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:04,735
I'm going crazy.

2058
01:11:05,265 --> 01:11:06,864
- This is real. - Why are all the skits...

2059
01:11:06,865 --> 01:11:08,604
- we're doing so intense? - I don't know.

2060
01:11:08,605 --> 01:11:10,085
- This is so funny. - It's too tense.

2061
01:11:10,505 --> 01:11:12,034
It's because you don't have your phone.

2062
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:14,005
- That's true. - It's because you don't have it.

2063
01:11:14,505 --> 01:11:16,045
You guys are so good.

2064
01:11:16,575 --> 01:11:17,815
It's amazing.

2065
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:19,744
- I'm hungry. - Me too.

2066
01:11:19,745 --> 01:11:21,284
- I'm so hungry. - All that fighting made me hungry.

2067
01:11:21,285 --> 01:11:22,754
I'm really hungry.

2068
01:11:22,755 --> 01:11:24,915
- Laughing makes you hungry. - True.

2069
01:11:25,855 --> 01:11:28,555
(The members' first dinner spot in Lisbon.)

2070
01:11:29,295 --> 01:11:31,576
(It is a popular restaurant always packed with tourists.)

2071
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:34,895
(There is only one dish here.)

2072
01:11:35,565 --> 01:11:38,365
(Arroz de Marisco)

2073
01:11:39,465 --> 01:11:42,875
(Cooked with plenty of seafood, )

2074
01:11:43,275 --> 01:11:45,395
(it is a representative traditional Portuguese dish.)

2075
01:11:46,045 --> 01:11:49,975
(It is a must-eat when visiting Lisbon.)

2076
01:11:50,045 --> 01:11:51,544
(It's like seafood stew with rice. It tastes incredibly good.)

2077
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:53,591
(For Koreans, it should be familiar. It's like adding rice to ramyeon.)

2078
01:11:53,615 --> 01:11:55,935
(Backed by countless reviews, it suits the Korean palate.)

2079
01:11:56,655 --> 01:11:59,155
(Arroz de Marisco has a certified taste.)

2080
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:02,225
(Rich aroma of olive oil and garlic)

2081
01:12:02,855 --> 01:12:05,695
(Savory gambas a guilho)

2082
01:12:06,265 --> 01:12:08,725
(This restaurant is famous for Arroz de Marisco in Lisbon.)

2083
01:12:09,395 --> 01:12:11,494
(Hungry E-cade members have arrived.)

2084
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:12,735
Hello.

2085
01:12:13,005 --> 01:12:15,765
- The aroma! - This delicious smell.

2086
01:12:16,305 --> 01:12:18,405
(Delicious smell hits them the moment they walk in.)

2087
01:12:18,675 --> 01:12:19,845
It seems delicious.

2088
01:12:20,145 --> 01:12:21,545
The aroma is insane.

2089
01:12:22,175 --> 01:12:23,275
I love it.

2090
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:26,444
- Did you enjoy the tour? - Yes!

2091
01:12:26,445 --> 01:12:28,861
We’ve been fighting and walking around all day. I’m exhausted.

2092
01:12:28,885 --> 01:12:31,115
(First, time for a refreshing drink.)

2093
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:36,895
This is refreshing!

2094
01:12:37,295 --> 01:12:38,655
It's so crisp and refreshing!

2095
01:12:39,495 --> 01:12:41,495
(They have a refreshing drink.)

2096
01:12:41,665 --> 01:12:44,364
Honestly, you guys came to Lisbon...

2097
01:12:44,365 --> 01:12:45,694
suddenly as agents.

2098
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,034
- We were kidnapped. - So you probably don't know.

2099
01:12:47,035 --> 01:12:49,374
- Yes. - Among Korean tourists,

2100
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:51,175
this is the most popular restaurant.

2101
01:12:51,905 --> 01:12:53,504
What is the main menu of this restaurant?

2102
01:12:53,505 --> 01:12:55,005
(What is the menu?)

2103
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:56,545
It's Arroz de Marisco.

2104
01:12:57,745 --> 01:12:58,814
Arroz de Marisco.

2105
01:12:58,815 --> 01:13:00,715
I'm craving carbs.

2106
01:13:00,815 --> 01:13:02,244
The dish is being served.

2107
01:13:02,245 --> 01:13:03,315
It smells so good.

2108
01:13:03,855 --> 01:13:05,354
(The main dish is served.)

2109
01:13:05,355 --> 01:13:07,025
- Hi! - Hi!

2110
01:13:09,255 --> 01:13:11,825
- The smell is... - It's a bit like porridge.

2111
01:13:12,695 --> 01:13:15,824
Shrimp, crab, mussels, and more...

2112
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:19,134
are all simmered with rice for over 30 minutes, stirring nonstop.

2113
01:13:19,135 --> 01:13:21,335
- It's cooked with care. - It must be so good.

2114
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:24,265
(A pot full of rice and seafood added to tomato puree sauce)

2115
01:13:25,205 --> 01:13:27,845
(They are simmered for a long time to bring out rich flavors.)

2116
01:13:29,205 --> 01:13:32,645
(It is known for its deep and savory flavor.)

2117
01:13:33,545 --> 01:13:36,785
(Arroz de Marisco)

2118
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:38,084
What am I going to do?

2119
01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:40,054
- This is insane. - Do you think it will be good?

2120
01:13:40,055 --> 01:13:41,624
I know it will be so good.

2121
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:42,995
(Exploding with savory flavor)

2122
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:45,554
- The mussel... - The aroma is incredible.

2123
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:48,164
Since you might not get to eat it, you should taste it at least.

2124
01:13:48,165 --> 01:13:49,165
- Agreed. - Yes.

2125
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:50,541
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2126
01:13:50,565 --> 01:13:52,334
- I'm having a bad day with this. - Yu Jin is...

2127
01:13:52,335 --> 01:13:53,535
I’m not having any luck today.

2128
01:13:53,635 --> 01:13:55,241
- Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

2129
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:56,705
- I told you. - Right.

2130
01:13:57,105 --> 01:13:59,034
- My gosh. - Nice!

2131
01:13:59,035 --> 01:14:00,374
I think this is the first time.

2132
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:02,244
- She always wins the taste tests. - Right.

2133
01:14:02,245 --> 01:14:03,991
- Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors. - Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors.

2134
01:14:04,015 --> 01:14:05,375
Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors.

2135
01:14:06,015 --> 01:14:07,644
- My goodness. - Mimi got it this time.

2136
01:14:07,645 --> 01:14:08,714
Mimi won again.

2137
01:14:08,715 --> 01:14:10,195
She shouldn't be the winner for this.

2138
01:14:10,455 --> 01:14:12,684
I heard you recently developed a crab allergy.

2139
01:14:12,685 --> 01:14:14,854
- Yes, very recently. - You can't eat this.

2140
01:14:14,855 --> 01:14:17,195
- Then I'll name someone. - Good idea.

2141
01:14:17,255 --> 01:14:19,054
Mimi, I really love you.

2142
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:20,394
You know how I feel already.

2143
01:14:20,395 --> 01:14:23,264
Your existence itself is our great fortune.

2144
01:14:23,265 --> 01:14:25,494
- Parrot Mim! - You know who to name.

2145
01:14:25,495 --> 01:14:27,334
- No. - Yes, Princess.

2146
01:14:27,335 --> 01:14:28,335
(Auto-summoned!)

2147
01:14:28,365 --> 01:14:30,574
I'm so curious to know who your choice is.

2148
01:14:30,575 --> 01:14:31,905
I really want to know.

2149
01:14:31,975 --> 01:14:33,745
- B! - B!

2150
01:14:33,905 --> 01:14:35,604
- Cross! - Cross!

2151
01:14:35,605 --> 01:14:37,044
(Team BB stayed loyal to each other.)

2152
01:14:37,045 --> 01:14:38,215
How beautiful.

2153
01:14:38,345 --> 01:14:40,715
She didn't get to eat anything because of me before.

2154
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:42,715
You have to eat.

2155
01:14:43,155 --> 01:14:45,314
I'll eat this plump one.

2156
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:46,461
(She takes a spoonful with plump seafood.)

2157
01:14:46,485 --> 01:14:47,825
Be careful. It could be hot.

2158
01:14:48,555 --> 01:14:49,954
- It's hot. - They say it's very hot.

2159
01:14:49,955 --> 01:14:51,255
- It's very hot. - Blow on it.

2160
01:14:51,325 --> 01:14:53,195
- It's hot. - Blow on it.

2161
01:14:53,925 --> 01:14:55,064
- Blow some more. - Calm down.

2162
01:14:55,065 --> 01:14:57,034
That is yours!

2163
01:14:57,035 --> 01:14:58,735
- Take it slow. - Blow on it for longer.

2164
01:14:59,065 --> 01:15:00,635
- Is it okay? - Okay.

2165
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:03,634
(Watch out for the roof of your mouth!)

2166
01:15:03,635 --> 01:15:05,004
I told you it was hot.

2167
01:15:05,005 --> 01:15:06,174
Blow on it for longer.

2168
01:15:06,175 --> 01:15:07,205
It's that good?

2169
01:15:07,945 --> 01:15:09,205
Chew it properly.

2170
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:11,335
(This is product placement for Arroz de Marisco.)

2171
01:15:11,815 --> 01:15:14,285
- This tastes incredible! - Incredible.

2172
01:15:15,145 --> 01:15:16,254
This tastes amazing!

2173
01:15:16,255 --> 01:15:18,255
Yu Jin, you'll love this.

2174
01:15:18,415 --> 01:15:19,555
My mouth is watering.

2175
01:15:20,355 --> 01:15:22,185
- Is it spicy? - It is.

2176
01:15:22,725 --> 01:15:25,194
- It's like jjamppong rice! - It's spicy?

2177
01:15:25,195 --> 01:15:28,094
It has that spicy kick and it's delicious.

2178
01:15:28,095 --> 01:15:30,164
- I need to eat it. - It must be tasty then.

2179
01:15:30,165 --> 01:15:32,234
- I want to eat something spicy. - It's spicy.

2180
01:15:32,235 --> 01:15:34,404
It's perfect for the Korean palate.

2181
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:36,734
- It's perfect! - That’s what we heard about it.

2182
01:15:36,735 --> 01:15:38,374
I really hope you guys succeed...

2183
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:40,305
- and get to eat it quickly. - Me too.

2184
01:15:40,505 --> 01:15:42,744
(The next dish is for Mimi who is allergic to crabs.)

2185
01:15:42,745 --> 01:15:43,745
Thank you.

2186
01:15:43,815 --> 01:15:44,974
- Amazing! - Amazing!

2187
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:47,315
I've never seen gambas a guilho like this before.

2188
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:48,884
- Amazing! - Amazing!

2189
01:15:48,885 --> 01:15:50,761
I've never seen gambas a guilho like this before.

2190
01:15:50,785 --> 01:15:52,515
This will taste amazing for sure!

2191
01:15:53,055 --> 01:15:55,125
(Infused with the aroma of olive oil and garlic)

2192
01:15:56,325 --> 01:15:58,855
(Soaked with nutty flavor)

2193
01:15:59,565 --> 01:16:02,065
(Shrimp packed with rich taste)

2194
01:16:02,495 --> 01:16:04,495
(This is gambas a guilho.)

2195
01:16:04,665 --> 01:16:06,234
- This will taste amazing for sure. - Aren't we tasting this?

2196
01:16:06,235 --> 01:16:08,004
- Let us taste it. - Let them.

2197
01:16:08,005 --> 01:16:09,774
Okay. Play rock-paper-scissors.

2198
01:16:09,775 --> 01:16:11,695
- Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

2199
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:13,375
- You won. - Mimi!

2200
01:16:13,405 --> 01:16:15,721
- Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2201
01:16:15,745 --> 01:16:16,745
Mimi lost.

2202
01:16:16,746 --> 01:16:17,914
- B! - B!

2203
01:16:17,915 --> 01:16:18,915
- Cross! - Cross!

2204
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:20,285
Mi Hyun, you eat!

2205
01:16:20,745 --> 01:16:22,044
(Team BB lives and dies by loyalty.)

2206
01:16:22,045 --> 01:16:23,254
So beautiful.

2207
01:16:23,255 --> 01:16:25,055
- Very beautiful. - We are nice people.

2208
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:27,155
Let me just smell it.

2209
01:16:27,655 --> 01:16:30,055
- Such nutty smell... - I bet it's good.

2210
01:16:30,155 --> 01:16:31,155
Looks so good.

2211
01:16:31,156 --> 01:16:32,725
This shrimp looks so good.

2212
01:16:36,695 --> 01:16:37,794
How is it?

2213
01:16:37,795 --> 01:16:40,334
It's sweet, isn't it? It had a sweet smell.

2214
01:16:40,335 --> 01:16:41,335
(She can't hear a thing.)

2215
01:16:41,336 --> 01:16:42,405
Mimi.

2216
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:43,805
- Beauty. - Flavor.

2217
01:16:44,305 --> 01:16:47,304
This is completely different from the gambas we've been eating.

2218
01:16:47,305 --> 01:16:49,145
- Really? - How is it?

2219
01:16:49,275 --> 01:16:52,044
It’s shrimp, but you know that plumpy squid?

2220
01:16:52,045 --> 01:16:53,114
It tastes like that too.

2221
01:16:53,115 --> 01:16:55,444
It must be super chewy and firm.

2222
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:56,515
Plumpy?

2223
01:16:56,755 --> 01:16:57,954
(She means it’s plump and has a nice bite to it.)

2224
01:16:57,955 --> 01:16:59,254
- It's plump. - And in addition to that...

2225
01:16:59,255 --> 01:17:00,855
it has a chewy taste.

2226
01:17:00,985 --> 01:17:02,684
- It must be good - There's a reason why...

2227
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:04,054
dishes like that taste good here.

2228
01:17:04,055 --> 01:17:06,194
Portugal is really famous for...

2229
01:17:06,195 --> 01:17:07,664
- olive oil. - That's right.

2230
01:17:07,665 --> 01:17:08,865
It's Mediterranean-influenced.

2231
01:17:08,965 --> 01:17:10,534
So what's the game?

2232
01:17:10,535 --> 01:17:12,134
- I'll tell you about the game. - Quickly.

2233
01:17:12,135 --> 01:17:14,264
We've come up with a new game for today.

2234
01:17:14,265 --> 01:17:15,634
A new game?

2235
01:17:15,635 --> 01:17:17,581
Of all times, it has to be at this important moment.

2236
01:17:17,605 --> 01:17:18,804
- It's an important moment. - It's always like this.

2237
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:21,074
They give us a new game at the most important time.

2238
01:17:21,075 --> 01:17:23,675
The new game is called "Three-Syllable Karaoke."

2239
01:17:23,845 --> 01:17:25,815
(Three-Syllable Karaoke)

2240
01:17:26,115 --> 01:17:27,984
You'll divide three-syllable chunks.

2241
01:17:27,985 --> 01:17:30,255
You have to sing three syllables at a time

2242
01:17:30,355 --> 01:17:32,114
(Butterfly, butterfly, fly over here)

2243
01:17:32,115 --> 01:17:34,201
(Listen to the song and sing it in three-syllable chunks.)

2244
01:17:34,225 --> 01:17:36,705
(If they sing anything other than three syllables, they fail.)

2245
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:40,524
(If they make it through the first verse without a mistake, )

2246
01:17:40,525 --> 01:17:42,325
(it's a success!)

2247
01:17:42,495 --> 01:17:45,495
To make it easier for you to follow the lyrics,

2248
01:17:45,635 --> 01:17:46,834
we picked children's songs.

2249
01:17:46,835 --> 01:17:48,905
- We’ll play it for you once. - Okay.

2250
01:17:49,335 --> 01:17:51,504
But if you get the lyrics wrong even after listening to the song,

2251
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:53,204
then, it's a fail.

2252
01:17:53,205 --> 01:17:54,774
Starting with Yu Jin,

2253
01:17:54,775 --> 01:17:57,344
you will keep going in turns until the song ends.

2254
01:17:57,345 --> 01:17:59,014
It's exactly like "Metal Tray Karaoke Room."

2255
01:17:59,015 --> 01:18:00,144
Once you listen to the song,

2256
01:18:00,145 --> 01:18:01,885
there won't be any more discussions.

2257
01:18:01,945 --> 01:18:04,014
Yu Jin will jump right in as the music starts.

2258
01:18:04,015 --> 01:18:06,785
I'm sure the girls won't know what "Metal Tray Karaoke Room" is.

2259
01:18:06,885 --> 01:18:08,054
Considering our age...

2260
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:09,794
(Yu Jin was around 3 years old, and Young Ji was around 4 years old.)

2261
01:18:09,795 --> 01:18:11,871
(Practice Session: "School Bell Rings Ding Dong Ding")

2262
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:14,365
Start with Yu Jin with "School Bell Rings Ding Dong Ding."

2263
01:18:14,465 --> 01:18:15,524
School bell rings

2264
01:18:15,525 --> 01:18:16,764
Ding dong ding

2265
01:18:16,765 --> 01:18:18,694
Let's all

2266
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:20,405
Gather now

2267
01:18:20,435 --> 01:18:21,805
Friends

2268
01:18:21,865 --> 01:18:23,265
- It's "teacher." - It's "teacher."

2269
01:18:23,705 --> 01:18:25,334
(The lyrics have to be absolutely accurate.)

2270
01:18:25,335 --> 01:18:26,674
She even got this wrong.

2271
01:18:26,675 --> 01:18:28,144
Teacher

2272
01:18:28,145 --> 01:18:29,574
Is

2273
01:18:29,575 --> 01:18:31,544
Waiting

2274
01:18:31,545 --> 01:18:33,184
For us

2275
01:18:33,185 --> 01:18:34,744
- That's how you do it. - Right.

2276
01:18:34,745 --> 01:18:36,954
- This is good. - You can start eating immediately.

2277
01:18:36,955 --> 01:18:38,684
- Really? - Frankly,

2278
01:18:38,685 --> 01:18:40,124
we made this game so you can enjoy your meal.

2279
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:42,054
- Okay. - As it's your first day in Lisbon.

2280
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:45,054
We made it so easy for you.

2281
01:18:45,055 --> 01:18:47,194
But nevertheless, you may fail.

2282
01:18:47,195 --> 01:18:49,124
Since you have to eat this when it's hot,

2283
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,665
it will be such a pity if you can't.

2284
01:18:51,235 --> 01:18:53,464
So we intend to take some of it and eat while it's hot.

2285
01:18:53,465 --> 01:18:54,604
- What? - You're eating it?

2286
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:56,034
- Right here? - Right in front of us?

2287
01:18:56,035 --> 01:18:58,204
Yes, we'll take some and eat it here.

2288
01:18:58,205 --> 01:19:00,144
- One ladleful? - That's right.

2289
01:19:00,145 --> 01:19:02,321
(The staff will take out a ladleful whenever the members fail.)

2290
01:19:02,345 --> 01:19:04,144
- Can we reveal the song? - Yes, please.

2291
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:05,745
- Yes. - The song you'll challenge is...

2292
01:19:06,385 --> 01:19:08,315
- "My Little Brother." - What's that?

2293
01:19:09,415 --> 01:19:11,455
(She knows this children's song.)

2294
01:19:12,055 --> 01:19:14,955
What's that? I don't have a little brother.

2295
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:16,994
What song are you talking about?

2296
01:19:16,995 --> 01:19:18,395
- I don't have one either. - Right.

2297
01:19:18,955 --> 01:19:21,725
You're not a blood sibling, but...

2298
01:19:21,995 --> 01:19:23,194
- I don't have one either. - You get it?

2299
01:19:23,195 --> 01:19:24,265
- Yes. - Yes.

2300
01:19:24,365 --> 01:19:25,365
I have to memorize.

2301
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:28,234
As soon as the song is over, you'll start without discussing.

2302
01:19:28,235 --> 01:19:29,235
- Okay. - Let's go.

2303
01:19:29,605 --> 01:19:32,835
(Listening to the full song, "My Little Brother.")

2304
01:19:33,775 --> 01:19:37,945
(We only play the song once.)

2305
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:43,354
(My little brother, with curly hair My naughty little brother)

2306
01:19:43,355 --> 01:19:44,415
He's naughty.

2307
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:53,364
(He has 1 name but 3 or 4 nicknames)

2308
01:19:53,365 --> 01:19:57,165
(Mom calls him Honey Pig)

2309
01:19:57,265 --> 01:20:00,034
(Dad calls him Toad)

2310
01:20:00,035 --> 01:20:01,035
A toad.

2311
01:20:01,036 --> 01:20:06,074
(And I call him Prince)

2312
01:20:06,075 --> 01:20:08,444
(Lal-la, lal-la, lal-la, lal-la)

2313
01:20:08,445 --> 01:20:12,174
(Which one is real?)

2314
01:20:12,175 --> 01:20:15,314
(I don't know, I don't know)

2315
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:17,114
Wait. Lal-la, lal-la, lal-la...

2316
01:20:17,115 --> 01:20:18,314
We can't have a discussion.

2317
01:20:18,315 --> 01:20:20,784
- This song is long. - We'll start the challenge now.

2318
01:20:20,785 --> 01:20:22,284
- Take it slow. - We got this.

2319
01:20:22,285 --> 01:20:23,965
- Take it slow. - Let's start with Yu Jin.

2320
01:20:24,055 --> 01:20:25,454
If you succeed, you'll get to eat.

2321
01:20:25,455 --> 01:20:27,025
Take it slow, girls.

2322
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:29,341
You have to get the pitch and rhythm accurately too.

2323
01:20:29,365 --> 01:20:33,834
- My little brother - With curly

2324
01:20:33,835 --> 01:20:34,864
(Hair, naughty)

2325
01:20:34,865 --> 01:20:37,834
- Hair - My naughty

2326
01:20:37,835 --> 01:20:38,934
(Brother)

2327
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:39,944
Wrong!

2328
01:20:39,945 --> 01:20:42,075
(She had the wrong rhythm.)

2329
01:20:42,175 --> 01:20:45,075
- This is so hard. - It is.

2330
01:20:45,645 --> 01:20:47,244
You’ve got to stay on beat?

2331
01:20:47,245 --> 01:20:49,614
Of course. Aren't you a singer?

2332
01:20:49,615 --> 01:20:51,114
(Trying to stay on beat makes it even harder.)

2333
01:20:51,115 --> 01:20:52,954
- Can we hold a discussion now? - Now you can.

2334
01:20:52,955 --> 01:20:54,161
(They can hold a discussion now.)

2335
01:20:54,185 --> 01:20:55,455
Mom calls him

2336
01:20:56,355 --> 01:20:58,795
(I'm taking some of the food.)

2337
01:20:58,895 --> 01:21:01,224
(One ladleful is taken out.)

2338
01:21:01,225 --> 01:21:03,665
She took so much.

2339
01:21:04,265 --> 01:21:06,134
(Unfortunately, they got stuck with a by-the-book staff member.)

2340
01:21:06,135 --> 01:21:08,305
She took so much.

2341
01:21:09,505 --> 01:21:12,005
(The younger girls are focused on memorizing the lyrics.)

2342
01:21:12,105 --> 01:21:14,044
(Dad calls him Toad)

2343
01:21:14,045 --> 01:21:16,104
(And I call him Prince)

2344
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:17,614
(Lal-la, lal-la, lal-la, lal-la)

2345
01:21:17,615 --> 01:21:18,844
- Thanks for the food. - What is?

2346
01:21:18,845 --> 01:21:20,184
- You like it so much. - Eun Ji.

2347
01:21:20,185 --> 01:21:21,684
- I know all the lyrics. - Which one is

2348
01:21:21,685 --> 01:21:22,844
- Real - Real

2349
01:21:22,845 --> 01:21:24,154
- I don't know, I don't know - Okay.

2350
01:21:24,155 --> 01:21:25,761
- I don't know, I don't know - Let's practice.

2351
01:21:25,785 --> 01:21:27,224
- One, two, start. - Start.

2352
01:21:27,225 --> 01:21:30,554
(My little brother, with curly, hair my naughty)

2353
01:21:30,555 --> 01:21:31,795
- That's wrong. - My naughty...

2354
01:21:31,995 --> 01:21:33,194
(She steals someone else's part.)

2355
01:21:33,195 --> 01:21:34,964
Little brother

2356
01:21:34,965 --> 01:21:37,064
- I start with little? - That's right.

2357
01:21:37,065 --> 01:21:38,594
(Starting again)

2358
01:21:38,595 --> 01:21:40,564
(Brother)

2359
01:21:40,565 --> 01:21:44,735
(He has 1 name but 3 or 4...)

2360
01:21:45,175 --> 01:21:46,944
(It's smoothly done this time.)

2361
01:21:46,945 --> 01:21:48,344
- Is this how it's done? - Absolutely!

2362
01:21:48,345 --> 01:21:50,185
Isn't it easy? That's enough practice for now.

2363
01:21:50,445 --> 01:21:52,614
- It's very easy. - You didn't really get that, right?

2364
01:21:52,615 --> 01:21:53,615
What's wrong, Eun Ji?

2365
01:21:53,885 --> 01:21:55,444
- I'll give it a go. - You can do it.

2366
01:21:55,445 --> 01:21:56,754
- We'll do it. - You know the lyrics.

2367
01:21:56,755 --> 01:21:58,431
- I know all the lyrics. - You can do it, right?

2368
01:21:58,455 --> 01:22:00,255
Wait. It's mom, dad, and I?

2369
01:22:00,355 --> 01:22:02,185
- That's right. - That's right.

2370
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:03,954
- What's that fat little? - Honey Pig.

2371
01:22:03,955 --> 01:22:06,194
- Right. - Honey Pig, Toad,

2372
01:22:06,195 --> 01:22:07,555
- and Prince. - Honey Pig. Got it.

2373
01:22:07,925 --> 01:22:08,925
Let's eat it in one go.

2374
01:22:09,695 --> 01:22:10,695
Get ready.

2375
01:22:11,295 --> 01:22:12,435
- Let's do this. - Start.

2376
01:22:13,335 --> 01:22:19,275
(The lyrics, pitch, and rhythm all have to be accurate.)

2377
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:23,874
(My little brother with curly hair)

2378
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:25,644
(Cunaughty little)

2379
01:22:25,645 --> 01:22:26,685
- Wrong! - No.

2380
01:22:27,615 --> 01:22:29,585
(She says a word no one’s ever heard before.)

2381
01:22:29,985 --> 01:22:31,654
(She covers her nose.)

2382
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:34,285
No. This doesn't count.

2383
01:22:34,485 --> 01:22:36,954
I have a dry throat.

2384
01:22:36,955 --> 01:22:38,724
- I never heard of "cunaughty." - Cunaughty.

2385
01:22:38,725 --> 01:22:40,564
- I meant naughty. - Cunaughty.

2386
01:22:40,565 --> 01:22:43,194
I think you combined "curly" and "naughty."

2387
01:22:43,195 --> 01:22:44,195
- Yes. - Funny word.

2388
01:22:45,295 --> 01:22:46,295
I'm sorry.

2389
01:22:46,735 --> 01:22:48,635
Yu Jin.

2390
01:22:48,765 --> 01:22:52,374
- Look Yu Jin. - That's too much. No.

2391
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:53,874
(Another ladleful of food is taken out.)

2392
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:55,945
- You're taking the mussels. - No!

2393
01:22:56,345 --> 01:22:58,114
Our Bo Gyeong is very greedy.

2394
01:22:58,115 --> 01:22:59,115
Yu Jin.

2395
01:22:59,116 --> 01:23:00,996
Bo Gyeong, I didn't think you could be so mean.

2396
01:23:02,585 --> 01:23:03,585
(Before and after)

2397
01:23:03,586 --> 01:23:05,715
(The rice has shrunk a lot after just two rounds.)

2398
01:23:05,815 --> 01:23:07,555
- I'm sorry. - Eun Ji, let's trade places.

2399
01:23:07,655 --> 01:23:09,994
- That's a difficult spot. - Let's go to the back.

2400
01:23:09,995 --> 01:23:11,295
- Okay. - Okay.

2401
01:23:11,655 --> 01:23:13,095
- We'll move. - Let's change places.

2402
01:23:13,525 --> 01:23:15,364
- Let's practice. - Start.

2403
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:17,194
- My little brother - With curly

2404
01:23:17,195 --> 01:23:19,034
- Hair, my - Naughty little

2405
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:21,034
- Brother, He has - He has

2406
01:23:21,035 --> 01:23:22,035
No, that's her line.

2407
01:23:22,165 --> 01:23:23,204
(Oops!)

2408
01:23:23,205 --> 01:23:24,575
You have to listen carefully.

2409
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:27,905
- Now, we... It's fine. Don't worry. - I'll do it.

2410
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:29,705
- You can do it. - I can do it.

2411
01:23:30,345 --> 01:23:32,974
(Spartan-style training)

2412
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:36,214
(I don't know, I don't know)

2413
01:23:36,215 --> 01:23:37,215
- That's right. - Great.

2414
01:23:37,455 --> 01:23:39,214
(Of all people, the brutal section had to be set for Mimi.)

2415
01:23:39,215 --> 01:23:40,754
- Don't worry about it. - It's okay if you get it wrong.

2416
01:23:40,755 --> 01:23:41,755
- You can do it. - It's okay.
I'm so nervous.

2417
01:23:42,756 --> 01:23:44,824
- It looks so good. - It really is.

2418
01:23:44,825 --> 01:23:47,194
- This is really tasty. - It's getting cold.

2419
01:23:47,195 --> 01:23:48,995
- Let's do this! - We got this!

2420
01:23:49,465 --> 01:23:50,465
Let's do it!

2421
01:23:50,535 --> 01:23:51,535
Music, please.

2422
01:23:53,265 --> 01:23:54,404
(Determined)

2423
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:56,065
Keep the rhythm.

2424
01:23:57,035 --> 01:23:58,804
- Start. - In 5, 6, 7, and 8.

2425
01:23:58,805 --> 01:24:04,044
(My little brother, with curly, hair my naughty)

2426
01:24:04,045 --> 01:24:08,444
(Little brother, he has)

2427
01:24:08,445 --> 01:24:09,614
(One name)

2428
01:24:09,615 --> 01:24:10,615
Wrong!

2429
01:24:11,115 --> 01:24:13,396
(She boldly steals someone else's part for the 2nd time.)

2430
01:24:14,025 --> 01:24:15,424
(Mimi just opens and closes her mouth.)

2431
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:16,954
- Oh, no. - It's my part.

2432
01:24:16,955 --> 01:24:18,194
- It's my turn. - "One name."

2433
01:24:18,195 --> 01:24:20,424
Wait, can't you take the gambas?

2434
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:21,425
Gambas.

2435
01:24:21,426 --> 01:24:23,335
(They want to keep Arroz de Marisco.)

2436
01:24:24,195 --> 01:24:25,734
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2437
01:24:25,735 --> 01:24:26,765
- What? - No.

2438
01:24:27,105 --> 01:24:28,634
(You want to give me all of it?)

2439
01:24:28,635 --> 01:24:31,305
- No, my mistake. - Keep still.

2440
01:24:31,835 --> 01:24:33,605
- Put it down. - You're so generous.

2441
01:24:34,305 --> 01:24:35,844
(A ladleful of gambas)

2442
01:24:35,845 --> 01:24:37,374
- Oh, no. - Stop.

2443
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:41,084
- Just 1 ladleful. - Just 1 ladleful.

2444
01:24:41,085 --> 01:24:42,814
- You only get 1 ladleful. - Just 1 ladleful.

2445
01:24:42,815 --> 01:24:44,885
Young Eun.

2446
01:24:45,555 --> 01:24:46,785
(Go back.)

2447
01:24:46,885 --> 01:24:48,601
(Under pressure from the seniors, she makes a U-turn to get more.)

2448
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:50,425
(She’s fighting an uphill battle.)

2449
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:51,924
(What are you doing?)

2450
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:55,325
- No! - What are you doing?

2451
01:24:55,895 --> 01:24:57,795
- Just 1 ladleful. - Just 1.

2452
01:24:58,195 --> 01:25:00,365
(They have one less ladleful of gambas.)

2453
01:25:00,565 --> 01:25:02,604
- I can't believe it. - Just one spoonful.

2454
01:25:02,605 --> 01:25:04,175
That was almost a disaster.

2455
01:25:04,835 --> 01:25:06,135
Keep calm and let's go on.

2456
01:25:06,235 --> 01:25:07,945
- Right now? - Focus!

2457
01:25:09,775 --> 01:25:10,775
We got this.

2458
01:25:12,515 --> 01:25:16,044
(The lyrics, pitch, and rhythm all have to be accurate.)

2459
01:25:16,045 --> 01:25:17,784
In 5, 6, 7, and 8.

2460
01:25:17,785 --> 01:25:23,084
(My little brother, with curly, hair my naughty)

2461
01:25:23,085 --> 01:25:24,324
(Little brother)

2462
01:25:24,325 --> 01:25:25,325
That's good.

2463
01:25:25,326 --> 01:25:28,524
(He has, one name)

2464
01:25:28,525 --> 01:25:31,094
(But 3 or 4, nicknames)

2465
01:25:31,095 --> 01:25:32,095
Great.

2466
01:25:32,096 --> 01:25:35,134
(Mom calls, him)

2467
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:36,164
(Honey Pig)

2468
01:25:36,165 --> 01:25:37,175
Wrong!

2469
01:25:38,405 --> 01:25:39,804
(The honey pig was so carefree.)

2470
01:25:39,805 --> 01:25:40,805
- You missed a syllable. - Honey Pig.

2471
01:25:40,806 --> 01:25:42,145
You missed a syllable.

2472
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,815
(I didn't know.)

2473
01:25:45,575 --> 01:25:47,515
Let's just laugh.

2474
01:25:47,985 --> 01:25:49,184
Let us laugh.

2475
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:50,215
Go and get some.

2476
01:25:50,315 --> 01:25:51,985
We can stay strong and do this.

2477
01:25:52,515 --> 01:25:53,725
I can't smile right now.

2478
01:25:53,825 --> 01:25:56,225
- What are you doing? - Oh, no!

2479
01:25:56,325 --> 01:25:58,495
(She's sweeping it all up.)

2480
01:25:58,795 --> 01:26:00,595
(They're furious.)

2481
01:26:01,025 --> 01:26:02,965
(She walks out feeling a lot prouder.)

2482
01:26:03,065 --> 01:26:05,434
(They have one less ladleful of gambas.)

2483
01:26:05,435 --> 01:26:07,805
- Honey Pig - What's with the wrist?

2484
01:26:07,905 --> 01:26:09,765
Can she turn her wrist like that?

2485
01:26:10,275 --> 01:26:12,035
Can she do that?

2486
01:26:12,405 --> 01:26:13,405
- Great! - We got this.
You have a difficult spot.

2487
01:26:14,406 --> 01:26:16,075
Mom calls him

2488
01:26:16,175 --> 01:26:18,215
Kkugo-gi?

2489
01:26:19,445 --> 01:26:20,445
What's that?

2490
01:26:20,645 --> 01:26:22,525
(Even though it's funny, practice comes first!)

2491
01:26:22,645 --> 01:26:23,684
- Let me see. - Mom calls him

2492
01:26:23,685 --> 01:26:25,125
(This is learner-centered teaching.)

2493
01:26:25,155 --> 01:26:26,484
(Calls him Toad)

2494
01:26:26,485 --> 01:26:28,754
- It's Honey Pig. - Let's try it again.

2495
01:26:28,755 --> 01:26:30,424
- In 1, 2, 3, and 4. - Take your time.

2496
01:26:30,425 --> 01:26:33,395
(Mom calls him, Honey Pig)

2497
01:26:33,495 --> 01:26:35,371
(They safely pass through the "Honey Pig" section.)

2498
01:26:35,395 --> 01:26:37,795
(Intense training)

2499
01:26:37,965 --> 01:26:40,164
(I don't know, I don't know)

2500
01:26:40,165 --> 01:26:43,535
- This is so hard. - It's hard.

2501
01:26:43,905 --> 01:26:44,905
Honey Pig.

2502
01:26:44,906 --> 01:26:47,044
This spot is no joke.

2503
01:26:47,045 --> 01:26:48,644
It really isn't.

2504
01:26:48,645 --> 01:26:49,805
My turn comes way too fast.

2505
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:53,144
(They check the temperature of the rice.)

2506
01:26:53,145 --> 01:26:54,684
Honey Pig.

2507
01:26:54,685 --> 01:26:56,291
If I were you and failed this round, I wouldn't eat it.

2508
01:26:56,315 --> 01:26:57,784
We can do this, girls. Let's do the E-cade chant.

2509
01:26:57,785 --> 01:26:58,785
Let's do it.

2510
01:26:58,786 --> 01:26:59,914
- E-cade! - E-cade!

2511
01:26:59,915 --> 01:27:01,324
- Let's do it. - We got this.

2512
01:27:01,325 --> 01:27:02,454
- We can do it. - Let's go.

2513
01:27:02,455 --> 01:27:03,694
We just have to pass through the section...

2514
01:27:03,695 --> 01:27:04,994
- about Mom. - Mimi, are you ready?

2515
01:27:04,995 --> 01:27:06,595
- Let's do it. - Mimi.

2516
01:27:06,625 --> 01:27:07,625
- Yes? - Are you ready?
- I am. - Are you sure?

2517
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:09,625
Yes.

2518
01:27:09,665 --> 01:27:10,665
- Mimi is the best! - Don't...

2519
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,295
- Don't pressure her. - Her Honey Pig

2520
01:27:12,495 --> 01:27:14,004
What's that?

2521
01:27:14,005 --> 01:27:15,705
- Oh, that's right. - It's my part.

2522
01:27:16,035 --> 01:27:18,234
- Isn't it "Him Honey Pig"? - Right.

2523
01:27:18,235 --> 01:27:20,105
- Mom calls him. - You're right. I'm sorry.

2524
01:27:20,205 --> 01:27:21,205
- You got this. - Yes.

2525
01:27:21,206 --> 01:27:22,444
(Confused)

2526
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,914
- Mom calls him Honey Pig - Honey Pig

2527
01:27:24,915 --> 01:27:26,544
- Honey Pig. - Mom calls him.

2528
01:27:26,545 --> 01:27:28,114
It's okay.

2529
01:27:28,115 --> 01:27:29,884
If we can't eat it, I'll buy it for you with my money.

2530
01:27:29,885 --> 01:27:31,284
- Right. We got this. - Don't worry about anything.

2531
01:27:31,285 --> 01:27:32,815
Don’t let them intimidate you!

2532
01:27:33,425 --> 01:27:34,924
- My daughter, you can do this? - Yes, Mom.

2533
01:27:34,925 --> 01:27:36,054
- Right. - Let's do it.

2534
01:27:36,055 --> 01:27:37,595
- This is nothing. - Right.

2535
01:27:37,855 --> 01:27:39,015
Keep your shoulders straight!

2536
01:27:39,455 --> 01:27:40,464
- Let's go! - We got this.

2537
01:27:40,465 --> 01:27:41,465
- Mom. - Let's do this.

2538
01:27:42,795 --> 01:27:43,795
Music, please.

2539
01:27:44,765 --> 01:27:47,104
(Can they succeed this time?)

2540
01:27:47,105 --> 01:27:49,005
- Ready? - Yes.

2541
01:27:49,165 --> 01:27:50,475
In 5, 6, 7, and 8.

2542
01:27:52,059 --> 01:27:53,059
Music, please.

2543
01:27:53,929 --> 01:27:57,528
(Will they succeed this time?)

2544
01:27:57,529 --> 01:27:59,229
- Yes. - In 5, 6, 7, and 8.

2545
01:27:59,799 --> 01:28:05,468
(My little brother, with curly, hair my naughty)

2546
01:28:05,469 --> 01:28:08,838
(Little brother, he has)

2547
01:28:08,839 --> 01:28:09,908
(Almost missed)

2548
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:12,508
(He has one name)

2549
01:28:12,509 --> 01:28:13,848
(But 3 or 4 nicknames)

2550
01:28:13,849 --> 01:28:15,118
- Good! - We're doing great.

2551
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:17,418
(Mom calls, him, Honey Pig)

2552
01:28:17,419 --> 01:28:18,419
(Pass)

2553
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:23,288
(Dad, calls, him, Toad)

2554
01:28:23,289 --> 01:28:24,488
(And I, call him, Prince)

2555
01:28:24,489 --> 01:28:25,929
(She missed a beat.)

2556
01:28:26,289 --> 01:28:28,159
(But the staff didn't stop them.)

2557
01:28:28,559 --> 01:28:30,479
(Young Seok doesn't even know they were wrong, )

2558
01:28:31,099 --> 01:28:32,099
Oh, sorry.

2559
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,460
(while his junior called them out but thinks he was wrong.)

2560
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,339
(So the game continues.)

2561
01:28:37,639 --> 01:28:39,608
(Singing)

2562
01:28:39,609 --> 01:28:41,579
(Which one)

2563
01:28:41,809 --> 01:28:43,179
(Scared)

2564
01:28:43,609 --> 01:28:45,478
(Again, they don't realize the members were wrong.)

2565
01:28:45,479 --> 01:28:48,778
(Which one, is real?)

2566
01:28:48,779 --> 01:28:51,649
(I don't know, I don't know)

2567
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:53,489
Successful!

2568
01:28:55,659 --> 01:28:57,759
- Good work. - Gosh.

2569
01:28:58,659 --> 01:29:00,629
You almost failed in some parts.

2570
01:29:00,729 --> 01:29:01,898
- Yes, we're aware! - Yes.

2571
01:29:01,899 --> 01:29:03,628
- We know. - But I thought it was okay.

2572
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:04,968
- I think this is passable. - Yes, thank you.

2573
01:29:04,969 --> 01:29:06,198
- We know. Thank you! - Thank you.

2574
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:07,538
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you!

2575
01:29:07,539 --> 01:29:09,398
- Thank you! - Eun Ji, you should eat first.

2576
01:29:09,399 --> 01:29:11,008
- It looks so good. - Eldest sister!

2577
01:29:11,009 --> 01:29:12,069
Thank you!

2578
01:29:12,539 --> 01:29:14,738
- Thank you for the meal. - It tastes amazing.

2579
01:29:14,739 --> 01:29:16,019
(A spoonful of Arroz de Marisco)

2580
01:29:21,519 --> 01:29:22,649
This tastes...

2581
01:29:23,319 --> 01:29:25,019
so spicy in a good way.

2582
01:29:25,849 --> 01:29:27,719
- It's amazing. - It tastes so good.

2583
01:29:29,459 --> 01:29:30,688
You like it? Is it just like before?

2584
01:29:30,689 --> 01:29:31,689
(Totally!)

2585
01:29:32,459 --> 01:29:33,829
This looks so good.

2586
01:29:34,459 --> 01:29:37,969
(She cools it down and takes a big bite.)

2587
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:41,599
Yu Jin is so happy right now!

2588
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:42,939
(It brings a smile to your face.)

2589
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,139
It smells so good, too.

2590
01:29:44,309 --> 01:29:45,338
How is it?

2591
01:29:45,339 --> 01:29:46,438
How is it, Yu Jin?

2592
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:47,759
You're the Korean cuisine expert.

2593
01:29:47,979 --> 01:29:49,009
Well...

2594
01:29:50,549 --> 01:29:52,548
It's like kimchi octopus porridge.

2595
01:29:52,549 --> 01:29:55,678
- You're right! - It really does taste like that.

2596
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,349
And also like jjamppong rice.

2597
01:29:57,619 --> 01:29:59,049
- I see. - Sounds great.

2598
01:29:59,319 --> 01:30:00,758
I think kimchi octopus porridge...

2599
01:30:00,759 --> 01:30:02,188
- is the most accurate way... - Exactly.

2600
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:03,628
To describe the taste.

2601
01:30:03,629 --> 01:30:05,559
That must be why Koreans like this dish so much.

2602
01:30:06,059 --> 01:30:07,619
(Mimi dips bread into the olive oil...)

2603
01:30:07,929 --> 01:30:09,629
(and puts a shrimp on it.)

2604
01:30:10,299 --> 01:30:11,928
(Then they go straight into her mouth.)

2605
01:30:11,929 --> 01:30:13,739
- This is so good. - It really is.

2606
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:16,139
This bread tastes amazing!

2607
01:30:16,669 --> 01:30:18,068
(Young Ji also tries the gambas a guilho.)

2608
01:30:18,069 --> 01:30:19,069
(Exclaiming)

2609
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:21,055
- Yu Jin! This is really good. - Eun Ji should try it.

2610
01:30:21,079 --> 01:30:22,408
(Yu Jin, this is really good.)

2611
01:30:22,409 --> 01:30:23,649
The gambas a guilho is so good.

2612
01:30:27,879 --> 01:30:29,919
Why does this shrimp taste so good?

2613
01:30:30,619 --> 01:30:31,619
I know, right?

2614
01:30:31,789 --> 01:30:33,289
The flavor itself is unmatched.

2615
01:30:33,419 --> 01:30:36,589
Maybe it's the olive oil that makes it taste so refined.

2616
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:38,529
This is so delicious.

2617
01:30:38,959 --> 01:30:41,079
- It's really delicious. - The bread tastes good too.

2618
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:42,429
The food in Abu Dhabi...

2619
01:30:42,699 --> 01:30:43,898
Where's Abu Dhabi?

2620
01:30:43,899 --> 01:30:45,569
I'm from Portugal.

2621
01:30:46,369 --> 01:30:47,539
The food here is great.

2622
01:30:48,339 --> 01:30:50,099
The dishes we had in both cities were great.

2623
01:30:51,309 --> 01:30:52,838
(Spicing up the Arroz de Marisco with pepper)

2624
01:30:52,839 --> 01:30:53,879
I'm so happy right now.

2625
01:30:56,379 --> 01:30:59,179
(The pepper helps her eat more.)

2626
01:31:01,619 --> 01:31:03,589
(Eun Ji also prefers it with pepper.)

2627
01:31:04,249 --> 01:31:06,449
- Eun Ji, you're having a lot. - It's so good.

2628
01:31:06,789 --> 01:31:08,388
(Scraping the pot)

2629
01:31:08,389 --> 01:31:09,888
- I'm sorry, but Yu Jin? - Yes?

2630
01:31:09,889 --> 01:31:11,229
Are you scraping the crust?

2631
01:31:11,329 --> 01:31:12,329
No, I'm not!

2632
01:31:12,889 --> 01:31:13,929
Yes, I am.

2633
01:31:14,529 --> 01:31:17,069
I haven't seen them enjoy their meals so much in a while.

2634
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:19,279
- This dish was especially good. - It was delicious.

2635
01:31:19,499 --> 01:31:22,399
Then could you give us the share you guys took earlier?

2636
01:31:22,739 --> 01:31:24,309
That was for us!

2637
01:31:24,409 --> 01:31:25,939
That was the deal.

2638
01:31:28,579 --> 01:31:29,778
This was so yummy.

2639
01:31:29,779 --> 01:31:30,879
It was really good!

2640
01:31:33,879 --> 01:31:35,918
Wasn't today really peaceful?

2641
01:31:35,919 --> 01:31:36,919
It was!

2642
01:31:37,019 --> 01:31:39,688
It feels like an ordinary trip, not Earth Arcade.

2643
01:31:39,689 --> 01:31:40,689
- I know! - Really?

2644
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:42,318
- Lisbon especially feels like that. - Right?

2645
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:43,419
We're more at ease here.

2646
01:31:43,589 --> 01:31:44,589
(Exclaiming)

2647
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:45,789
It's so pretty.

2648
01:31:46,289 --> 01:31:47,599
The nights are romantic, too.

2649
01:31:49,429 --> 01:31:52,269
(Lisbon is famous for its nightscape.)

2650
01:31:53,029 --> 01:31:56,438
(Pictures taken at night are a must.)

2651
01:31:56,439 --> 01:31:59,739
(Taking pictures)

2652
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:01,739
(Clicking)

2653
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:05,609
(People can't take their eyes off, even in a tram.)

2654
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:10,419
(The scenery is too beautiful to be seen only in a picture.)

2655
01:32:13,959 --> 01:32:15,989
(While taking in the nightscape of Lisbon...)

2656
01:32:16,259 --> 01:32:18,128
- We're here. - Already?

2657
01:32:18,129 --> 01:32:19,449
(They've arrived at the lodging.)

2658
01:32:20,459 --> 01:32:23,129
This place looks totally different at night!

2659
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:24,868
- It's so pretty at night. - Gosh!

2660
01:32:24,869 --> 01:32:26,869
- Should we dive again? - Goodness.

2661
01:32:27,169 --> 01:32:28,339
You're going to dive again?

2662
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:30,868
It's so aesthetic.

2663
01:32:30,869 --> 01:32:32,309
(The pool beckons for another dive.)

2664
01:32:32,809 --> 01:32:35,579
- It's so pretty. - It's amazing, beautiful, stunning.

2665
01:32:36,579 --> 01:32:38,459
I feel so good because this place is so pretty.

2666
01:32:40,279 --> 01:32:42,949
(The current time is 8pm.)

2667
01:32:43,019 --> 01:32:45,419
We don't have any more schedules tonight.

2668
01:32:45,889 --> 01:32:47,188
You can rest until the morning.

2669
01:32:47,189 --> 01:32:48,988
- You should rest too. - When should we wake up?

2670
01:32:48,989 --> 01:32:52,229
- You can sleep until 8am. - Gosh!

2671
01:32:52,929 --> 01:32:55,959
(Yu Jin gets ready for bed early in the evening.)

2672
01:32:56,729 --> 01:33:00,439
(It's 8:30pm in Lisbon, 4:30am in Korea.)

2673
01:33:00,799 --> 01:33:03,138
(She passed out the moment she got in bed.)

2674
01:33:03,139 --> 01:33:04,508
(What Yu Jin did today)

2675
01:33:04,509 --> 01:33:06,068
(Taking a plane, eating egg tarts, charades, buying soccer a uniform, )

2676
01:33:06,069 --> 01:33:07,308
(going to the observatory, eating Arroz de Marisco, diving in a pool)

2677
01:33:07,309 --> 01:33:08,379
(Knocking)

2678
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:10,479
(It's Eun Ji.)

2679
01:33:11,249 --> 01:33:14,149
(But Yu Jin doesn't even notice and keeps sleeping.)

2680
01:33:14,349 --> 01:33:16,229
(The other members gathered in the other room.)

2681
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:18,018
- Is Yu Jin asleep? - Yes.

2682
01:33:18,019 --> 01:33:19,418
We're in trouble. She's going to wake up at 6am...

2683
01:33:19,419 --> 01:33:20,819
and complain that she's hungry.

2684
01:33:21,219 --> 01:33:22,859
I should wear my earplugs tonight.

2685
01:33:23,459 --> 01:33:25,029
(Soon)

2686
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:26,688
I'm hungry!

2687
01:33:26,689 --> 01:33:28,559
(Eun Ji's predictions become reality.)

2688
01:33:31,329 --> 01:33:33,399
(Yu Jin is out of control.)

2689
01:33:33,569 --> 01:33:35,299
(I'm fully energized.)

2690
01:33:35,499 --> 01:33:37,168
(Tired of this)

2691
01:33:37,169 --> 01:33:38,315
- Leave her be. - But she's too energetic.

2692
01:33:38,339 --> 01:33:39,339
(Hey!)

2693
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,580
(You should bring her just before IVE makes a comeback.)

2694
01:33:42,179 --> 01:33:44,878
(Childish An is enjoying her break.)

2695
01:33:44,879 --> 01:33:46,509
(Coming soon)

2696
01:33:47,819 --> 01:33:50,489
(The dawn breaks on the second day in Lisbon.)

2697
01:33:51,649 --> 01:33:54,389
(The current time is 7:30am.)

2698
01:33:54,989 --> 01:33:56,519
(Tossing)

2699
01:33:57,959 --> 01:33:59,489
(And turning)

2700
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:02,159
(Yu Jin woke up after sleeping 11 hours.)

2701
01:34:03,729 --> 01:34:07,839
(For a while, she checks her phone, which Young Ji doesn't have.)

2702
01:34:08,569 --> 01:34:10,069
(Getting up)

2703
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:13,739
- Yu Jin. - Yes?

2704
01:34:15,179 --> 01:34:16,238
(She checks outside.)

2705
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:17,279
Yu Jin.

2706
01:34:19,349 --> 01:34:21,919
(She spots Mimi, who was just on her way to the other room.)

2707
01:34:22,179 --> 01:34:24,499
- Did you get up just now? - No, I've been up for a while.

2708
01:34:24,689 --> 01:34:25,719
When?

2709
01:34:26,149 --> 01:34:27,858
- I kept waking up. - You did?

2710
01:34:27,859 --> 01:34:28,989
Where are you going, Mimi?

2711
01:34:29,219 --> 01:34:30,459
Why? What can I do for you?

2712
01:34:31,659 --> 01:34:32,659
What should I do?

2713
01:34:35,329 --> 01:34:36,929
(Changing her clothes)

2714
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:39,199
- What time is it? - It's 8am.

2715
01:34:40,199 --> 01:34:42,599
(Yu Jin is going to check on Eun Ji and Mimi.)

2716
01:34:43,939 --> 01:34:45,839
- Hello. - I'm hungry.

2717
01:34:46,839 --> 01:34:48,408
I knew this would happen.

2718
01:34:48,409 --> 01:34:50,579
You went to bed so early, Yu Jin.

2719
01:34:51,109 --> 01:34:52,249
I am hungry!

2720
01:34:52,849 --> 01:34:53,849
I'm hungry.

2721
01:34:55,349 --> 01:34:56,748
Please wake up!

2722
01:34:56,749 --> 01:34:57,925
(The other members are hungry, too.)

2723
01:34:57,949 --> 01:35:00,389
Wake up, whoever you are!

2724
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:03,728
- We're all awake. - Wake up!

2725
01:35:03,729 --> 01:35:04,758
(Realizing what's going on)

2726
01:35:04,759 --> 01:35:06,229
Please wake up.

2727
01:35:06,389 --> 01:35:07,929
We're so hungry.

2728
01:35:08,099 --> 01:35:09,599
We're so hungry!

2729
01:35:09,729 --> 01:35:11,799
We woke up at 8am as you told us to.

2730
01:35:12,069 --> 01:35:14,498
We woke up at 8am as you told us to!

2731
01:35:14,499 --> 01:35:16,339
But it's almost 9am, and there's still no one.

2732
01:35:16,499 --> 01:35:17,769
Brother Yeong Seok!

2733
01:35:18,269 --> 01:35:20,479
- Where are you? - Where are you?

2734
01:35:21,039 --> 01:35:22,439
I'm hungry!

2735
01:35:23,409 --> 01:35:24,449
We're hungry. Oh, hello.

2736
01:35:24,979 --> 01:35:25,979
He's here.

2737
01:35:26,309 --> 01:35:28,848
Why did you make us get up at 8am?

2738
01:35:28,849 --> 01:35:30,989
Why don't we eat at 8:30am?

2739
01:35:31,219 --> 01:35:32,618
- Okay! - What time is it now?

2740
01:35:32,619 --> 01:35:33,718
I don't have my phone.

2741
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:35,119
It's 8:12am.

2742
01:35:38,429 --> 01:35:40,799
(Breakfast is ready.)

2743
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,529
(A variety of bread and pastry)

2744
01:35:43,869 --> 01:35:45,999
(Along with fresh fruit)

2745
01:35:48,039 --> 01:35:50,539
(The first breakfast in Lisbon)

2746
01:35:50,909 --> 01:35:52,408
- I'll get a plate for this side. - Okay.

2747
01:35:52,409 --> 01:35:53,878
Who wants egg tarts?

2748
01:35:53,879 --> 01:35:55,339
- I do! - Me too.

2749
01:35:55,739 --> 01:35:57,378
(There are egg tarts even at breakfast in Lisbon.)

2750
01:35:57,379 --> 01:35:58,379
What else?

2751
01:36:02,379 --> 01:36:05,149
(A plate full of bread)

2752
01:36:06,589 --> 01:36:10,389
(And a plate full of fruits on the other side)

2753
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:14,859
(Cold milk is at the ready, too.)

2754
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:16,859
Thank you for the meal.

2755
01:36:18,099 --> 01:36:19,268
We got one of each.

2756
01:36:19,269 --> 01:36:21,169
(Mimi tries the bread first.)

2757
01:36:21,599 --> 01:36:23,339
(Yummy)

2758
01:36:23,809 --> 01:36:24,839
This is good.

2759
01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:26,869
I'll try it too, Mimi.

2760
01:36:27,339 --> 01:36:28,408
Try it!

2761
01:36:28,409 --> 01:36:29,538
(The second egg tart in Lisbon)

2762
01:36:29,539 --> 01:36:30,548
This is good.

2763
01:36:30,549 --> 01:36:31,578
It's so good!

2764
01:36:31,579 --> 01:36:33,059
(This place has good egg tarts, too.)

2765
01:36:33,109 --> 01:36:34,279
Yu Jin is enjoying the food.

2766
01:36:34,619 --> 01:36:36,449
(Yu Jin is taking a big bite.)

2767
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:39,818
Can we take as much as we want?

2768
01:36:39,819 --> 01:36:41,319
(Yu Jin was the hungriest...)

2769
01:36:41,489 --> 01:36:42,589
(Sneaking)

2770
01:36:42,919 --> 01:36:44,389
(Shush!)

2771
01:36:45,129 --> 01:36:47,229
(She's secretly getting seconds.)

2772
01:36:48,059 --> 01:36:49,729
(Excited)

2773
01:36:50,359 --> 01:36:52,629
(The camera is looking for Yu Jin.)

2774
01:36:53,129 --> 01:36:55,169
(She was hiding to put syrup on her pancakes.)

2775
01:36:55,499 --> 01:36:57,099
(It's her guilty pleasure.)

2776
01:36:57,869 --> 01:36:59,839
(She dives right in.)

2777
01:37:00,169 --> 01:37:02,289
(This idol is really enjoying her non-active season.)

2778
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:05,049
(Biting)

2779
01:37:05,379 --> 01:37:06,508
(After Yu Jin had her fill...)

2780
01:37:06,509 --> 01:37:07,669
- Already? - Is it that good?

2781
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:09,649
- Popular! - Popular!

2782
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:13,119
(She starts singing musical numbers with Eun Ji.)

2783
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:16,589
(She feels great with her sugar rush.)

2784
01:37:18,059 --> 01:37:19,089
(Exclaiming)

2785
01:37:19,429 --> 01:37:21,628
(Yu Jin is enjoying her morning thanks to Eun Ji.)

2786
01:37:21,629 --> 01:37:23,598
- Everything that really counts - Everything that really counts

2787
01:37:23,599 --> 01:37:24,768
- To be popular - To be popular

2788
01:37:24,769 --> 01:37:27,199
(But it's starting to become too much for Eun Ji.)

2789
01:37:27,439 --> 01:37:28,568
(Tired)

2790
01:37:28,569 --> 01:37:29,669
What next?

2791
01:37:29,769 --> 01:37:30,769
(Laughing)

2792
01:37:30,939 --> 01:37:33,539
(Act 2 begins.)

2793
01:37:34,109 --> 01:37:36,479
(Eun Ji raises her energy level in the morning.)

2794
01:37:38,579 --> 01:37:40,349
(Yu Jin is just having fun.)

2795
01:37:40,549 --> 01:37:42,479
(Jazz)

2796
01:37:42,979 --> 01:37:44,119
(Are we done now?)

2797
01:37:44,449 --> 01:37:46,089
(Mannerism)

2798
01:37:46,219 --> 01:37:47,418
Come on, baby

2799
01:37:47,419 --> 01:37:49,859
- Why don't we paint the town? - Why don't we paint the town?

2800
01:37:49,889 --> 01:37:51,388
I can't do this!

2801
01:37:51,389 --> 01:37:52,789
(Eun Ji is done babysitting.)

2802
01:37:52,959 --> 01:37:53,959
(Young Ji is her second target.)

2803
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:55,528
(Bean ladybug)

2804
01:37:55,529 --> 01:37:57,428
- Do you have the charger? - I do.

2805
01:37:57,429 --> 01:37:58,969
(Yu Jin wants to play with Young Ji.)

2806
01:37:59,769 --> 01:38:01,129
(Young Ji goes into the bathroom.)

2807
01:38:01,269 --> 01:38:02,469
(Getting up)

2808
01:38:02,599 --> 01:38:04,439
(Bean ladybug)

2809
01:38:05,139 --> 01:38:06,909
(That's my piercing)

2810
01:38:07,609 --> 01:38:08,639
What are you doing?

2811
01:38:09,109 --> 01:38:10,508
(Bean ladybug)

2812
01:38:10,509 --> 01:38:12,349
Why are you calling for a ladybug?

2813
01:38:12,809 --> 01:38:14,209
- Ladybug... - Where are you going?

2814
01:38:14,279 --> 01:38:15,919
Yu Jin, where is Eun Ji?

2815
01:38:16,119 --> 01:38:17,388
She's probably in the other room.

2816
01:38:17,389 --> 01:38:18,389
(Following)

2817
01:38:18,489 --> 01:38:19,688
What's up?

2818
01:38:19,689 --> 01:38:21,158
(Mimi is her third target.)

2819
01:38:21,159 --> 01:38:22,259
Let's play, Mimi.

2820
01:38:22,359 --> 01:38:25,129
Where is Eun Ji?

2821
01:38:25,389 --> 01:38:27,528
- Instead of being bothered - I can't find her.

2822
01:38:27,529 --> 01:38:29,569
(The idol responds to seeing a full-length mirror.)

2823
01:38:29,799 --> 01:38:32,029
(The other idol also joins in.)

2824
01:38:33,029 --> 01:38:34,299
What's this song?

2825
01:38:34,699 --> 01:38:36,038
It's "Attitude."

2826
01:38:36,039 --> 01:38:38,309
(My bad.)

2827
01:38:38,609 --> 01:38:40,539
Where's Eun Ji?

2828
01:38:40,609 --> 01:38:42,278
Where did she go?

2829
01:38:42,279 --> 01:38:43,509
I don't know where she is.

2830
01:38:43,609 --> 01:38:45,149
Eun Ji!

2831
01:38:46,009 --> 01:38:48,049
Lee Eun Ji!

2832
01:38:48,149 --> 01:38:50,789
(Loud Yu Jin is back.)

2833
01:38:51,749 --> 01:38:53,489
Am I hearing things right now?

2834
01:38:54,819 --> 01:38:55,919
Eun Ji!

2835
01:38:56,619 --> 01:38:58,529
Why are you looking for me?

2836
01:38:58,689 --> 01:39:00,559
Why did you leave in the first place?

2837
01:39:01,159 --> 01:39:02,258
Why?

2838
01:39:02,259 --> 01:39:03,758
Yu Jin, what do you want to do? Just tell me.

2839
01:39:03,759 --> 01:39:05,168
What do you want to do?

2840
01:39:05,169 --> 01:39:06,569
(Do you want to see me dance?)

2841
01:39:08,899 --> 01:39:10,239
Mimi!

2842
01:39:11,939 --> 01:39:13,309
I found Eun Ji.

2843
01:39:13,509 --> 01:39:15,078
Young Ji!

2844
01:39:15,079 --> 01:39:16,378
(Caught right away)

2845
01:39:16,379 --> 01:39:17,449
Did Mimi leave?

2846
01:39:17,849 --> 01:39:19,209
She's hiding.

2847
01:39:19,349 --> 01:39:22,119
Weren't you going to handle her, Eun Ji?

2848
01:39:22,179 --> 01:39:24,719
- We were hiding. - Come here.

2849
01:39:25,389 --> 01:39:27,119
Take this out with you!

2850
01:39:28,959 --> 01:39:31,359
Does anyone want to play with Yu Jin?

2851
01:39:31,629 --> 01:39:33,289
(Both pretend they didn't hear.)

2852
01:39:33,429 --> 01:39:35,498
Let's play hide and seek.

2853
01:39:35,499 --> 01:39:37,099
- Let's play hide and seek! - Seriously?

2854
01:39:37,629 --> 01:39:40,299
We're going to play hide and seek.

2855
01:39:40,629 --> 01:39:42,699
(Yu Jin is the seeker.)

2856
01:39:43,069 --> 01:39:45,549
(They're having a blast while the staff are having breakfast.)

2857
01:39:45,839 --> 01:39:47,778
What now?

2858
01:39:47,779 --> 01:39:50,108
- Yu Jin kept looking for us, - Nine, ten.

2859
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:52,079
- so we're playing hide and seek. - Eleven.

2860
01:39:52,709 --> 01:39:54,919
(If you can't hide from Yu Jin, just enjoy the game.)

2861
01:39:55,419 --> 01:39:57,919
(This is Mimi.)

2862
01:39:58,419 --> 01:40:00,689
Six! Seven!

2863
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:02,159
Eight!

2864
01:40:02,489 --> 01:40:04,689
(Time to go find them)

2865
01:40:04,889 --> 01:40:06,628
- Mimi! - She's coming!

2866
01:40:06,629 --> 01:40:08,458
Lee Eun Ji, Lee Young Ji!

2867
01:40:08,459 --> 01:40:10,099
Mimi!

2868
01:40:10,629 --> 01:40:13,529
(Yu Jin comes into the room where Young Ji is hiding.)

2869
01:40:13,699 --> 01:40:14,969
(She looks there first.)

2870
01:40:15,069 --> 01:40:16,669
Why is she going that way?

2871
01:40:17,569 --> 01:40:19,339
Lee Young Ji!

2872
01:40:19,369 --> 01:40:21,079
(Spotted right away)

2873
01:40:21,309 --> 01:40:23,809
Lee Young Ji!

2874
01:40:23,939 --> 01:40:26,279
(Young Ji, just give up and play with me!)

2875
01:40:27,149 --> 01:40:28,949
(Young Ji is caught.)

2876
01:40:29,519 --> 01:40:30,849
I got you.

2877
01:40:31,149 --> 01:40:32,419
I'm not going to look anymore.

2878
01:40:32,789 --> 01:40:34,319
I found a playmate already.

2879
01:40:34,889 --> 01:40:36,419
I'm not going to look! Do I have to?

2880
01:40:37,059 --> 01:40:38,389
Don't look for Eun Ji.

2881
01:40:39,259 --> 01:40:40,528
Why shouldn't I?

2882
01:40:40,529 --> 01:40:41,529
(Eun Ji comes out on her own.)

2883
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:43,059
(No one can stop Yu Jin.)

2884
01:40:43,959 --> 01:40:44,999
Kim Mimi.

2885
01:40:45,869 --> 01:40:47,839
(Yu Jin is looking under the stairs.)

2886
01:40:48,469 --> 01:40:50,199
(She found Mimi.)

2887
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:53,539
- I'm so scared! - Kim Mimi!

2888
01:40:53,809 --> 01:40:56,179
Wait, attention staff members!

2889
01:40:56,479 --> 01:40:58,508
You should all take turns to play with Yu Jin.

2890
01:40:58,509 --> 01:41:01,349
- We're just too tired! - I know!

2891
01:41:01,879 --> 01:41:04,088
It's not like...

2892
01:41:04,089 --> 01:41:05,949
I'm working at an indoor playground for kids.

2893
01:41:07,019 --> 01:41:09,459
(And so began...)

2894
01:41:09,819 --> 01:41:10,929
Please.

2895
01:41:11,159 --> 01:41:13,629
Please make Yu Jin less energetic.

2896
01:41:14,529 --> 01:41:16,659
I can't tell if this is Earth Arcade...

2897
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:19,229
or an indoor playground for kids.

2898
01:41:19,799 --> 01:41:20,999
I beg of you,

2899
01:41:21,569 --> 01:41:22,899
STARSHIP Entertainment!

2900
01:41:24,339 --> 01:41:27,369
(A prayer to the sky and STARSHIP)

2901
01:41:29,109 --> 01:41:31,579
- Come to the middle. - Bring her here.

2902
01:41:33,649 --> 01:41:37,349
(The ritual is reaching its climax.)

2903
01:41:37,649 --> 01:41:41,459
(Chanting)

2904
01:41:41,689 --> 01:41:43,819
(What will Yu Jin's destiny bring?)

2905
01:41:43,919 --> 01:41:47,089
(The exorcism was successful!)

2906
01:41:47,959 --> 01:41:50,259
(Yu Jin came back after a shower.)

2907
01:41:52,099 --> 01:41:54,939
Gosh, your hair is so soft!

2908
01:41:55,139 --> 01:41:56,669
(Exclaiming)

2909
01:41:56,999 --> 01:41:58,468
You can apply this to your scalp.

2910
01:41:58,469 --> 01:42:01,509
It completely nourishes your hair.

2911
01:42:01,709 --> 01:42:03,679
(Young Ji is envious of her hair.)

2912
01:42:04,149 --> 01:42:06,449
(All ready to go out!)

2913
01:42:07,449 --> 01:42:09,779
(Start your day full of nourishment and softness.)

2914
01:42:10,015 --> 01:42:12,085
(It's time to go out and enjoy Lisbon.)

2915
01:42:12,185 --> 01:42:13,661
(The next mission is a photography contest.)

2916
01:42:13,685 --> 01:42:15,761
(Their first solo time in Lisbon, competing to be the ending fairy)

2917
01:42:15,785 --> 01:42:17,655
(This place is pretty!)

2918
01:42:17,855 --> 01:42:19,485
(Yu Jin wants to be the ending fairy.)

2919
01:42:19,625 --> 01:42:21,325
(She takes her photos passionately.)

2920
01:42:21,495 --> 01:42:22,971
(Eun Ji also wants to win the contest.)

2921
01:42:22,995 --> 01:42:24,471
(Are you getting Ronaldo in the frame, too?)

2922
01:42:24,495 --> 01:42:27,395
(Eun Ji's strategy is comedy.)

2923
01:42:27,425 --> 01:42:29,295
(Mimi!)

2924
01:42:29,365 --> 01:42:31,605
(Mimi, look! No!)

2925
01:42:31,735 --> 01:42:34,405
(Mimi and Young Ji are faced with a pigeon attack.)

2926
01:42:34,475 --> 01:42:35,875
(Mimi, this place is so dangerous.)

2927
01:42:36,035 --> 01:42:37,975
(Look, they're after us!)

2928
01:42:38,075 --> 01:42:40,445
(Their mission is filled with chaotic birds.)

2929
01:42:40,475 --> 01:42:46,015
(Who will be the winner of the photography contest?)

2930
01:42:46,245 --> 01:42:50,455
(Riding along the endless Tagus...)

2931
01:42:50,685 --> 01:42:52,755
(with a cup of beer)

2932
01:42:52,855 --> 01:42:56,025
(The members go on a cycling trip.)

2933
01:42:56,095 --> 01:42:57,395
(I'm so tired already.)

2934
01:42:57,495 --> 01:42:59,995
(Do you want to stop pedaling and want someone else to do it?)

2935
01:43:00,065 --> 01:43:03,695
(2-on-2 in a common-sense quiz to get out of pedaling)

2936
01:43:03,995 --> 01:43:05,705
(Correct!)

2937
01:43:05,735 --> 01:43:07,775
(Could you go faster, please?)

2938
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:11,505
(The victorious team enjoys the scenery.)

2939
01:43:11,675 --> 01:43:13,545
(Stop celebrating and pick the next theme!)

2940
01:43:13,575 --> 01:43:15,915
(The losers can't stop pedaling.)

2941
01:43:15,945 --> 01:43:19,815
(Which team will be the one to pedal endlessly?)

2942
01:43:19,985 --> 01:43:21,754
(A famous Portuguese restaurant)

2943
01:43:21,755 --> 01:43:25,525
(The walls are filled with pictures of celebrities.)

2944
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:27,955
(We will test your ability in recognizing the culprit.)

2945
01:43:27,995 --> 01:43:29,425
("Guess Who?" quiz)

2946
01:43:29,455 --> 01:43:31,395
(I'm going to get it this time.)

2947
01:43:31,525 --> 01:43:34,465
(The new Mimi aces the quiz.)

2948
01:43:34,595 --> 01:43:35,635
One, two, three!

2949
01:43:36,195 --> 01:43:37,234
No!

2950
01:43:37,235 --> 01:43:40,135
(But Yu Jin starts to be bad.)

2951
01:43:40,205 --> 01:43:41,235
One, two, three!

2952
01:43:41,475 --> 01:43:45,045
(I'd rather be laughing)

2953
01:43:45,145 --> 01:43:47,275
(Yu Jin, this is unacceptable.)

2954
01:43:47,375 --> 01:43:52,845
(What will happen to Yu Jin and the "Guess Who?" quiz?)

2955
01:43:53,085 --> 01:43:54,715
Hey, looking good!

2956
01:43:58,255 --> 01:43:59,485
Rock-paper-scissors!

2957
01:44:01,155 --> 01:44:02,554
Whose pants are those?

2958
01:44:02,555 --> 01:44:03,594
They're Producer Hyun Yong's.

2959
01:44:03,595 --> 01:44:05,025
- And the jacket? - Hyun Yong's.

2960
01:44:05,825 --> 01:44:06,825
What about the cap?

2961
01:44:06,826 --> 01:44:08,035
It's Producer Na's.

2962
01:44:10,565 --> 01:44:12,564
Producer Na, you're so dapper today.

2963
01:44:12,565 --> 01:44:14,204
- I love your jacket. - Me too.

2964
01:44:14,205 --> 01:44:15,804
- Will you... Yes! - Wear it.

2965
01:44:15,805 --> 01:44:16,805
You guys can switch.

2966
01:44:18,145 --> 01:44:20,604
- Let's go! - They're taking everything from me.

2967
01:44:20,605 --> 01:44:22,791
- I'll give you my hoodie. - Young Ji took my cap, too.

2968
01:44:22,815 --> 01:44:24,744
Yes, but I'll give you my hoodie.

2969
01:44:24,745 --> 01:44:26,084
- No, just wear yours. - You'll be cold.

2970
01:44:26,085 --> 01:44:27,314
You'll be cold. Just switch jackets.

2971
01:44:27,315 --> 01:44:28,784
- Why would you switch? - Yours is pretty.

2972
01:44:28,785 --> 01:44:30,484
- This one's prettier. - It's really nice.

2973
01:44:30,485 --> 01:44:31,755
- Right? - Yes, it's pretty.

2974
01:44:32,225 --> 01:44:33,585
Gosh!
