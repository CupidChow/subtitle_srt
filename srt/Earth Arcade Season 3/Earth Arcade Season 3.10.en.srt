1
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:12,001
(Earth Arcade 3)

2
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:14,600
(Previously)

3
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:17,201
(You completed the mission successfully.)

4
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,341
(A trip to a vacation spot in Portugal as a reward)

5
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:23,540
(The emerald sea and cliffs called for them...)

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,211
(at Albufeira.)

7
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:28,010
(This is insane!)

8
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:31,481
(Albufeira stole the hearts of the E-cade members.)

9
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:34,690
(A poolside villa from Jade Emperor was a bonus present!)

10
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:37,720
(Jade Emperor, thank you.)

11
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:39,460
(To win the familiar taste of fast food...)

12
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:41,090
(that they craved, )

13
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:42,931
(they played the Random Play Dance.)

14
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:45,391
(A show time by the members who know the Random Play Dance)

15
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:50,630
(This is...)

16
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:53,371
(the teamwork of the members who have been together for 4 years.)

17
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:55,570
(Relaxed)

18
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:57,857
(With the synchronized group dance that showed their teamwork, )

19
00:00:57,881 --> 00:01:01,011
(they finished playing the evening game splendidly.)

20
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,310
Binge-watching "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

21
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,421
Binge-watching.

22
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:05,981
Episode 11.

23
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:07,380
We've watched this episode, right?

24
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:10,151
(They begin watching "I'm Sorry, I Love You.")

25
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:11,561
Eun Chae.

26
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:17,190
(They make various facial expressions...)

27
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:19,000
(as they become absorbed in the drama.)

28
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:20,061
(Laser-focused)

29
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:22,571
(Meanwhile, downstairs)

30
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,741
(The production crew is busy in a suspicious manner.)

31
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,471
(They hide things.)

32
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:30,411
(They hide more things.)

33
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,411
(They're busy setting things up.)

34
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:38,321
(Earth Arcade 3)

35
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,481
(Judging by the setup, it seems like the members won't sleep tonight.)

36
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:44,620
(For the first time in a while, )

37
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,781
(they'll have the classic version of Morning Mission.)

38
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:51,031
(It's time for a sleepless night during a vacation.)

39
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,531
(Knocking)

40
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:54,901
- Come on in. - Come on in.

41
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,740
It's 1st come, 1st served. Come on down 1 at a time.

42
00:01:57,741 --> 00:01:59,240
Come on down one at a time.

43
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,241
Okay.

44
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:02,571
(Were they really crying just a moment ago?)

45
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:03,970
(The 1st member is Yu Jin.)

46
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:05,340
I guess we need to go to the basement.

47
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:07,110
- Shall we stay on the 2nd floor? - Stay on the 2nd floor.

48
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:08,111
Okay.

49
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:10,981
- I'm so curious. - Go to the basement floor.

50
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:12,721
What is it?

51
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:14,321
What is this?

52
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:15,750
(The basement prop room)

53
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:17,021
Yu Jin is the first one.

54
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:18,891
Welcome, warrior.

55
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:21,730
- My goodness. - Come closer.

56
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:22,961
Hello.

57
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,501
I came first on a rare occasion.

58
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:28,071
The mission is What Are You Doing Right Now.

59
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,901
(What Are You Doing Right Now)

60
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:32,401
(Pick 1 of the 4 mission cards.)

61
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,741
Complete the given mission.

62
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:37,040
At 8am tomorrow, I'll be somewhere in the villa.

63
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,940
Run to me after completing the mission.

64
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:40,980
Okay.

65
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:42,110
(They won't know the time.)

66
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,831
When the sun rises tomorrow morning, your phones will be returned...

67
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:46,951
in the living room of the second floor.

68
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:50,250
It's a success if you're included in the 1st 2 members.

69
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:51,861
Then you can go and enjoy breakfast.

70
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,481
If you fail, you'll receive a penalty.

71
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:55,031
The two members who fail...

72
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:58,161
must run 5km along the coast on an empty stomach.

73
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:00,401
Why are you doing this?

74
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:04,501
(We had to do it since the coast was so beautiful.)

75
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,771
(Which 2 members will join the running crew tomorrow?)

76
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:10,910
It's good for your health.

77
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:12,580
- The trip is going so well. - It isn't even a penalty.

78
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,610
We're sleeping well...

79
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:14,757
- and eating well. - It's a reward.

80
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:16,527
(Let's have a sneak peek of 33 seconds and 5 frames.)

81
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:17,551
(You betrayed me.)

82
00:03:17,552 --> 00:03:18,651
(What?)

83
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:20,421
(Don't betray me, okay?)

84
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,291
(Full of betrayals)

85
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,161
(Gosh, I was so startled.)

86
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:30,661
(Spying on each other)

87
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,601
(But I don't want to lose.)

88
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:36,000
(When everyone is asleep, )

89
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:39,101
(someone will stay awake.)

90
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:48,981
(What will happen in the middle of the night?)

91
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,220
What time is it right now?

92
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,551
It's 10:40pm.

93
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,750
- Go ahead and pick one. - Please.

94
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:57,120
This one stood out to me, but I'll choose this one instead.

95
00:03:57,121 --> 00:03:59,637
(She picks 1 of the 4 mission cards that speaks to her the most.)

96
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:00,721
Take a look.

97
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:04,290
(Oh, my.)

98
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,300
(The mission makes her smile.)

99
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:06,461
You got a really nice one.

100
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:07,900
(Eat cup tteokbokki alone.)

101
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09,077
(Difficulty level: Two stars, They eat it almost every day.)

102
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:10,600
It won't be surprising at all.

103
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:12,440
I could go to Young Ji right now and say,

104
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:14,540
"I dare you to eat cup tteokbokki with me."

105
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,111
Then she'll do it right away. "Let's eat two."

106
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,481
Here's the problem.

107
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:20,451
- Alone? - You must eat cup tteokbokki...

108
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,011
alone.

109
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,310
- One cup? - Yes.

110
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:25,320
Eat one cup tteokbokki alone.

111
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:27,827
Let's say someone comes and goes, "It looks good. Give me a bite."

112
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,750
- I'll eat like this. - If she even tries the sauce,

113
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:31,861
- Is it not allowed? - you'll fail the mission.

114
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:35,291
You know where the island table is, right?

115
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:37,561
There are three cup tteokbokki on that table.

116
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,401
Eat one alone...

117
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:41,930
and bring the empty cup...

118
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:44,001
to me tomorrow as proof.

119
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:45,741
You can't go out in the yard.

120
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:48,181
You must complete the mission inside the house.

121
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:50,210
If you want to go outside, you can do it...

122
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:52,011
- on the second-floor terrace. - The terrace.

123
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:53,381
Thank you.

124
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:55,511
Go upstairs in one minute.

125
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:56,850
Are you running?

126
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:58,020
(Here comes Yu Jin-bokki.)

127
00:04:58,021 --> 00:04:59,181
This is an exercise.

128
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:02,220
(She jogs upstairs...)

129
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:04,761
(and checks the location of the cup tteokbokki.)

130
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:07,931
(Then she goes to the 2nd floor.)

131
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:10,141
(Back to being the "I'm Sorry, I Love You" fanatics)

132
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:11,931
What's taking Yu Jin so long?

133
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:14,830
- Next person. - I'll be back.

134
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:17,231
It's cold.

135
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:18,741
(Young Ji falls for it.)

136
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,501
I'll go outside.

137
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:22,141
What? Hold on. Why?

138
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:25,110
- Why go outside when you're cold? - I should enjoy the sauna.

139
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:26,540
- It's too cold. - Why enjoy the sauna?

140
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,150
- Why? Where are you going? - Why enjoy the sauna?

141
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,251
It's so cold.

142
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:30,980
Did she hide something?

143
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:33,481
Yu Jin isn't the type to enjoy the sauna.

144
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,091
Yu Jin, the thing is,

145
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:37,750
your shirt has become dirty. I guess you were in the bushes.

146
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:39,190
Come on. It's because it's a black T-shirt.

147
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:40,191
(Bad hunch)

148
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:42,961
- Did she hide something? - Look.

149
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:45,860
- That must be it. Suddenly... - What? I guess we got you.

150
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,330
Right? She must have an outside mission.

151
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:49,130
- Let's go outside. - She said that she was cold.

152
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:50,570
- It's an outside mission. - She can't go outside now.

153
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:51,940
It's an outside mission. It has to be.

154
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:54,241
(The second member, Young Ji, sets off in the meanwhile.)

155
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:58,611
Yu Jin took a very long time.

156
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:00,780
(What kind of a mission awaits Young Ji?)

157
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:02,551
Why is it so dark?

158
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:05,250
- Today, I had good energy. - Yes.

159
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:07,220
- That's right. - I was very lucky with the drawing.

160
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:09,050
The thing is, I know the location...

161
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:11,320
of the worst mission. Please go ahead and pick one.

162
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:14,491
I think the one in front of me is my fate.

163
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:18,201
(She picks the mission card right in front of her.)

164
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:21,160
(Chuckling)

165
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:22,507
How would you rank the mission in terms of difficulty?

166
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:24,277
(Draw a dot of at least 0.5cm on each member's face.)

167
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,000
"On each member's face."

168
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,401
Does it have to be at least 0.5cm?

169
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:29,271
(Sucking in a breath)

170
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:30,811
I think I'll need to jog.

171
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:33,280
The face refers...

172
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:34,750
to the space between the forehead and chin.

173
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,180
If you draw a dot on the neck or back of the head,

174
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:38,481
it won't count.

175
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:41,050
- It has to be the front side. - Draw a dot on the front side.

176
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:42,820
Is there a tool? Which tool...

177
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:43,921
Yes, there is.

178
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,191
It's a water-based marker.

179
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:47,721
On the first floor,

180
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:49,860
there is a stair that puts you one step down.

181
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:52,500
Right next to it are bookshelves with designer books.

182
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:53,630
- On the first floor? - Yes.

183
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,231
- There is a hand-shaped object. - Okay.

184
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:59,901
In that object, you'll find a water-based marker.

185
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:03,311
Use it to complete the mission by 8am tomorrow morning.

186
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:05,687
(Eat 1 cup ttteokbokki alone. Put a dot on each member's face.)

187
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:06,781
Understood.

188
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:09,481
I really want to succeed in it this time.

189
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:10,681
Producer Na.

190
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:13,780
Even if I draw the dots, I need to come in first.

191
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:15,690
- That's right. - I have to be included.

192
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:17,967
But I think many members will fail to complete the mission.

193
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,721
- Akh. - Akh.

194
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:21,911
- For success! Young Ji, good luck. - Good luck.

195
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:27,101
(Artist Lee heads straight to the water-based marker.)

196
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,330
(After looking around, )

197
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:32,971
(she puts it in a pocket of her vest.)

198
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:35,041
(Halting)

199
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:37,741
(Checking the pen once more)

200
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,851
(She seems to be complaining about the difficult mission.)

201
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:46,551
(She spots something.)

202
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:49,621
(She walks over and gets something.)

203
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:54,931
(Yu Jin's cup tteokbokki)

204
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:59,801
(Why did she have to choose Yu Jin's cup tteokbokki?)

205
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:03,171
The next person can go.

206
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:04,971
Young Ji, what did you do?

207
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:07,821
- Show us what you're hiding. - Young Ji, what did you do?

208
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,870
- Hold on. - Hey, what's that?

209
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:12,710
- What's that? Why did you... - Hold on.

210
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:15,551
- What's going on? - What's this?

211
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:20,321
- It's just cup tteokbokki. - She brought it as a feint.

212
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:22,621
- It's a feint, right? Come on. - It's a feint.

213
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:24,320
- Come on. - It's a feint.

214
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,660
Don't lie.

215
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:27,620
Why... Why did you hide it?

216
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:29,191
Can we go to the hot tub?

217
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:33,300
(Yu Jin leaves the area, )

218
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:36,931
(but Artist Lee follows her.)

219
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,440
What's this cup tteokbokki?

220
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,040
- What's this? Don't lie! - I wanted to eat it.

221
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,040
Why did you hide it? Did you want us to be suspicious?

222
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,940
- This one... - I wanted to eat it, okay?

223
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,780
- It's a feint. - I'll confiscate it.

224
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:47,980
Don't take it. Don't touch it.

225
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:49,210
- I'll go to the sauna. - No touching.

226
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:51,181
- Understood? - This is a checkpoint.

227
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:54,551
(She enters the room amidst confusion...)

228
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:56,351
(and hides it deep in her bag.)

229
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:57,491
What is it?

230
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,691
(Will the cup tteokbokki be safe?)

231
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:02,391
Please pick one.

232
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,461
(She picks one!)

233
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:10,930
(Sighing)

234
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:12,570
(An unreadable sigh...)

235
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,011
(and a spoonful of despair)

236
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,510
(2 or more people go in the hot tub.)

237
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,187
(However, their bodies must be underwater up to the neck.)

238
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:20,110
If it has to be up to the neck, we'll need to go in like this.

239
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:22,980
No. If you slide in, the water will come up to here.

240
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:24,251
Is that so?

241
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:27,481
(The hot tub is located on the 2nd-floor terrace.)

242
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,821
(There is enough water.)

243
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:33,961
Here is the problem. You won't go in alone.

244
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:36,561
You must go in with one...

245
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:38,261
or more people.

246
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:41,130
Will you be able to do it? Come up with a good plan. Mimi.

247
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:42,730
Show us your brain.

248
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:44,101
I don't have a brain to show you.

249
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:45,570
(I see.)

250
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:47,671
- Good luck. Succeed in it. - Okay.

251
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:49,540
Riddle Master, bye.

252
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,071
- Bye. - Bye.

253
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:53,881
Gosh, the worst one remains.

254
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,980
(The one who will receive the last mission card, )

255
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:59,451
(Eun Ji is going downstairs.)

256
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:01,280
- Mimi is back. - What?

257
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,320
- Show me what you're hiding. - Let me search you first.

258
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:05,821
- Are you hiding something? - Is it eating cup tteokbokki?

259
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:07,361
Be honest.

260
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:08,631
Mimi, what's this?

261
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:11,251
I don't know. I think the mission is entering the hot tub.

262
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:13,930
I've never run 5km in my life.

263
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:16,330
The production crew will push you, carry you, and pull you.

264
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:18,801
What will I do if I strain my ankles?

265
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:21,400
What will I do if I get fastidious plantar?

266
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,970
- It's plantar fasciitis. - Plantar fasciitis.

267
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,211
I don't know what to do.

268
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:26,880
Shall I open it? Only one remains.

269
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:28,151
Yes. Are you ready?

270
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:32,781
(Hold on a second.)

271
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:36,021
(Make 1L of lemon juice. Difficulty level: Highest)

272
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:38,521
You picked the worst one.

273
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:41,361
Think of it as a killer option.

274
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,831
I'll explain the mission in detail.

275
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:46,601
If you go to the first floor...

276
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:49,630
and go down the platform, you'll see a table.

277
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:50,801
- A wooden table. - Yes.

278
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:53,300
On that table is a mountain of lemons.

279
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:56,411
Right next to that table is a cupboard.

280
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,611
Open the cupboard.

281
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:00,511
If you look down,

282
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:03,111
you'll see a lemon squeezer...

283
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:06,151
and a 1L bottle.

284
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:07,620
To be secretive,

285
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,690
- I'll move during the night. - We wish you success.

286
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:10,890
- I can't do it now. - Good luck.

287
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:12,561
(Make 1L of lemon juice.)

288
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:14,591
(Everyone got the mission.)

289
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,291
- When is Eun Ji coming back? - What do you need to do?

290
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:19,531
- I hope Eun Ji comes back soon. - I know.

291
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:23,471
I'm here, warriors.

292
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,340
Warriors.

293
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:27,900
(In a natural way, she checks the location of the lemons.)

294
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,871
Warriors.

295
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,010
(Then she goes up to the 2nd floor.)

296
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:34,081
Girls.

297
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:35,451
Shall we enter the hot tub?

298
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:36,981
Shall we enter the hot tub?

299
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:39,250
- Why do you want to do that? - Why do you want to do that?

300
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:41,051
Young Ji wanted to enter the hot tub earlier.

301
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:42,390
- Young Ji. - Yes?

302
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:44,027
Young Ji, why did you want to enter the hot tub?

303
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,160
I didn't say that.

304
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:46,321
(They search her right away.)

305
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:47,820
Hold on. Let me go to my room first.

306
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:48,830
- No. - Why?

307
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:49,960
I want to pee. I want to use the restroom.

308
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:51,601
- Let's go together. - Let's go together.

309
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:55,831
(The younger members take care of the oldest member.)

310
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:59,370
Why would you go to the restroom with me?

311
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:00,870
We can't go together.

312
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:02,170
(Taking over the restroom)

313
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,341
- I can't believe it. - Come on in.

314
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:06,281
We aren't high schoolers.

315
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:08,210
- Come on in. - It's the restroom.

316
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:09,681
(Get out.)

317
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:11,311
I'll go to the first floor.

318
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:12,520
I'll go to the first floor too.

319
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:13,920
Why? There must be something on the first floor.

320
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:15,751
- Yu Jin. - Did you hide something there?

321
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,350
I'll look for it this time.

322
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:19,791
- Look for what? - The members' traces.

323
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:21,860
Are you doing your mission...

324
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:23,837
while pretending to search for other people's missions?

325
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:25,060
I bet Riddle Master told her...

326
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,060
- where something was located. - That must be it.

327
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,000
While pretending to search for other people's traces,

328
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:31,600
Young Ji is looking...

329
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:32,801
for her mission item.

330
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:34,401
You can't fool me!

331
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,410
- That must be it. - That must be it.

332
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:38,331
- That must be it. - Yes. She's doing something.

333
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:41,881
(Yu Jin-bokki gets close to the remaining cup tteokbokki.)

334
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,150
I guess we need these.

335
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:44,280
- Earlier, Young Ji brought cup... - I think the cup...

336
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:45,751
(They pick it up at the same time.)

337
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:49,651
(Mimi intercepted.)

338
00:12:49,821 --> 00:12:51,890
- This must be it. Cup tteokbokki. - We must hide them.

339
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:53,320
- I confiscated one earlier. - Let's not eat it.

340
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:54,391
(Did you catch that?)

341
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,630
(Yu Jin picked one up first...)

342
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:59,001
(and took the one in Mimi's hand!)

343
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:01,000
(That way, she took the remaining 2 cup tteokbokki.)

344
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:03,871
Don't try to look for them.

345
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:05,701
I'm confiscating them.

346
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:10,311
(She quickly moves to the 2nd floor.)

347
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:15,181
(She hides 2 cup tteokbokki she brought in her suitcase.)

348
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:18,150
(She moves the cup tteokbokki Young Ji brought...)

349
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:19,781
(to a deeper spot.)

350
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,221
(Yu Jin hid all 3 cup tteokbolkki.)

351
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:24,250
(On the 1st floor, the members are still marking Young Ji.)

352
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:27,160
I bet Producer Na told her where her mission item was.

353
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:28,161
Okay.

354
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:30,660
- There must be something. - I bet he gave her the location.

355
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:32,341
- That's why she's looking for it. - What?

356
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,661
- What? - What is it?

357
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:35,730
- What's this? - What is it?

358
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,471
(Young Ji finds something.)

359
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:38,870
- What's this? - What is it?

360
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:40,740
I don't know. What's this?

361
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:41,981
(Nothing has been hidden here.)

362
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:43,140
(Answer: A feint)

363
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:44,441
(Young Ji laughs.)

364
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:49,450
(Meanwhile, Eun Ji wants to check up on the lemon kit.)

365
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,780
(Lemon kit)

366
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:52,450
She'll go through the cupboards...

367
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:53,780
- and find something. - She's looking for something.

368
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:55,697
- She's doing that, right? - She's looking for something.

369
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:56,951
She's looking for something.

370
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:58,890
I'll eat this.

371
00:13:58,891 --> 00:13:59,921
Go ahead and eat it.

372
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:01,160
I guess this isn't it.

373
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:02,767
(Eun Ji gets Young Ji away from the cupboard.)

374
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,891
In my opinion, what Young Ji is doing...

375
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:06,861
seems like a feint.

376
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:10,571
(She juggles lemons in a suspicious manner.)

377
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:14,100
It's funny that there's a mountain of lemons.

378
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:16,941
It's funny that there's a mountain of lemons.

379
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:18,210
I know.

380
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:19,880
I think she needs to do something with lemons.

381
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,650
I... I guess her mission involves lemons.

382
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:23,711
That must be it.

383
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:25,721
I bet she needs to use them.

384
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,921
(Eun Ji looks away.)

385
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,591
It makes no sense for there to be so many lemons.

386
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:32,320
We suddenly got lemons.

387
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:34,161
(Laughing)

388
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:36,631
(Grinning)

389
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:42,671
Judging by how we suddenly got these lemons, Young Ji...

390
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:46,041
(Letting out the remainder of her laughter)

391
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:48,810
I bet her mission is peeling and eating a lemon.

392
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:50,640
I bet she needs to eat it. Hey, don't let Young Ji eat it.

393
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,680
Her mission is eating a lemon.

394
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:53,910
- Her mission involves eating. - Why would I...

395
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:55,111
Why would I eat a lemon?

396
00:14:55,681 --> 00:14:57,321
- Does your mission involve eating? - No.

397
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:00,880
Don't you think there's a mission about making a fruit juice?

398
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:02,120
- Squeezing lemons? - Fruits.

399
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:03,727
- There are many lemons. - Squeezing lemons.

400
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:07,021
(The younger members became too smart.)

401
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:09,031
Let's hide all of them.

402
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:12,231
Let's hide all of them.

403
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:14,230
- That's a good idea. - Let's hide all of them.

404
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:15,330
- Here. - That's a good idea.

405
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,530
Let's put them here.

406
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:17,870
- You want to be thorough. - Yes.

407
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:19,570
Young Ji will faint. These lemons are out of place.

408
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:20,741
- They're so strange. - Yes.

409
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:27,410
You know, Eun Ji seems to be obsessed with lemons.

410
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:29,180
My mission doesn't involve lemons. What's up with Eun Ji?

411
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,701
Don't you think it's Eun Ji's mission?

412
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:31,950
- What do you mean? - Lemons.

413
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:33,727
It isn't my mission. I don't need these lemons.

414
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:34,871
Isn't it Young Ji's mission?

415
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:36,120
Don't you care about them then?

416
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:37,820
You seem to be fine. You aren't giving a reaction.

417
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,637
That's right, Eun Ji. My mission doesn't involve lemons.

418
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,590
- Then... - Someone's mission involves lemons.

419
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:42,891
Perhaps Mimi was wrong.

420
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,211
Who wants to watch "I'm Sorry, I Love You?"

421
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:46,461
Why do you ask?

422
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:48,201
I just wanted to check.

423
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,770
We do need to watch the ending.

424
00:15:49,771 --> 00:15:53,600
Yes. I'm still absorbed in "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

425
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:55,141
- We're still absorbed. - Yes.

426
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:58,111
("I'm Sorry, I Love You" is an infallible cheat code.)

427
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,780
(Artist Lee juggles the lemons once more.)

428
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:02,481
The juggling is fake.

429
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:05,451
It's fake. The juggling is fake, in my opinion.

430
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:07,481
Young Ji, juggling the lemons...

431
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:10,320
Mimi is looking for something. She's looking for her...

432
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:12,821
(This is the location...)

433
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:16,861
(where Eun Ji's lemon kit is.)

434
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:18,630
(Lemon kit)

435
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:22,570
(She's close to finding it.)

436
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:26,341
Hey, the lemons are Mimi's mission.

437
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:30,170
(Lemon Eun Ji's second crisis)

438
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,470
Hey, the lemons are Mimi's mission.

439
00:16:31,471 --> 00:16:33,540
- She's laughing. It's lemons. - Lemons.

440
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,250
Maybe she needs to protect all the lemons.

441
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:36,280
I think that's the mission.

442
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,057
- Let's hide them. - Let's put them somewhere else.

443
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,121
That's right. We should put them somewhere else.

444
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:43,191
Mimi, isn't it your mission? We got you.

445
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,691
Mimi kept going,

446
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:48,391
"Eun Ji, why are these lemons here?"

447
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:52,101
(Mim-Hot Tub hasn't found the kit yet.)

448
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:55,100
(Eun Ji goes to hide the lemons.)

449
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,771
Let's hide them.

450
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:59,371
The lemons are Mimi's mission, Yu Jin.

451
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:02,971
(Mimi found everything!)

452
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,080
(Eun Ji goes to hide the lemons.)

453
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:07,581
Let's hide them.

454
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:10,281
The lemons are Mimi's mission, Yu Jin.

455
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,051
(Mimi found everything!)

456
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:20,761
(Eun Ji didn't know that her lemon kit was getting stolen.)

457
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:27,831
(Lemon Eun Ji went upstairs happily without knowing anything.)

458
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:34,541
(Proud)

459
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:39,581
(Eun Ji's room)

460
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,951
(Giggling)

461
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:49,191
(She seems to be happy with her acting from a moment ago.)

462
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:51,721
What? Where did Eun Ji go?

463
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:54,361
(She feels like she's missing something.)

464
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,330
(Wait right there, Eun Ji.)

465
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:57,961
Eun Ji.

466
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,031
Eun Ji.

467
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:05,271
(She retreats from her room.)

468
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:09,341
(She comes out to the terrace with the lemon bag.)

469
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:12,581
- Eun Ji. - Yes?

470
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:14,480
(A quick turn)

471
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:16,081
What are you doing?

472
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:17,681
I'm looking for Young Ji.

473
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:19,420
I'm looking for Young Ji and hiding this.

474
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:21,320
(She hides it under the sunbed since she is in a hurry.)

475
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:22,321
I'll put them here.

476
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,361
(What will happen to the hidden lemon bag?)

477
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:27,521
You aren't looking for Young Ji.

478
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:29,301
(Yu Jin arrives on the 2nd-floor terrace.)

479
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:30,991
I don't trust you either.

480
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:34,111
Why did you become so anxious when I entered the second floor?

481
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:36,600
You were the only one who entered the second floor.

482
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:38,471
Is that so? I thought Young Ji was here.

483
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:41,741
I should turn the hot tub cold.

484
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:43,310
Maybe someone's mission involves the hot tub.

485
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:45,671
But I'll enjoy the hot tub even though it isn't my mission.

486
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:47,480
You'll do it because it's your mission.

487
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:49,511
I need to enjoy it like they do in "The Sims."

488
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:51,951
I like "The Sims" I need to enjoy the hot tub.

489
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:53,351
I can't let that happen.

490
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:56,220
(Artist Lee enters the 2nd floor.)

491
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:59,121
Hey, Yu Jin!

492
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:02,761
There goes Young Ji. She is going to her room.

493
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:06,231
(Yu Jin-bokki reacts right away.)

494
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:08,360
(Young Ji appears.)

495
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:09,501
I guess I was wrong.

496
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:12,041
I thought you were going to your room.

497
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:15,040
Does that mean Mimi is alone on the first floor?

498
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,741
- That's right. - Hey, go secretly.

499
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:19,110
Watch your footsteps. Take off your slippers.

500
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:21,110
(Hide well...)

501
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:24,111
(so that I can't see your hair.)

502
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:25,850
(Mimi is hiding the lemon kit...)

503
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:27,821
(of the lemons, lemon squeezer, and the bottle.)

504
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:30,191
(She picks a cabinet.)

505
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,661
(She hides them without knowing whose mission it is.)

506
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:40,661
(Team Chasers go down quietly.)

507
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:44,001
(Spotting Mimi)

508
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:46,801
(Breathing hard)

509
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:50,471
(She hid the kit, but she feels anxious.)

510
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:54,641
(She goes back to the hiding place...)

511
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:59,151
(and takes out the lemon squeezer.)

512
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:03,121
(She looks for a different place to hide it.)

513
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:08,761
(They're about to see each other.)

514
00:20:09,591 --> 00:20:12,061
(Their eyes meet.)

515
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:15,301
(Peeking)

516
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:16,771
(Laughing)

517
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:18,670
- Eun Ji! - Yes?

518
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:21,570
- Mimi's mission is about lemons. - Really?

519
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:24,910
There's a squeezer.

520
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:26,780
- Let me see it! Where is it? - She has it.

521
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:27,881
Hide it.

522
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:29,110
I saw her...

523
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:31,150
- when she was hiding it. - Where is it?

524
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:32,351
(That's my squeezer.)

525
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,080
Mimi, come on.

526
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:35,550
I knew that she was suspicious.

527
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:36,851
She was hiding it.

528
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:39,090
- Why are you... - She was taking it out.

529
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:41,061
Give it to me. Let me see it.

530
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:43,191
The lemons were so obvious.

531
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:45,500
Mimi, give it to me.

532
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:47,430
- Let me see it. - Your mission isn't about lemons.

533
00:20:47,431 --> 00:20:49,877
Will you give us the squeezer? Shall we get rid of the lemons?

534
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:51,677
- Let's get rid of the lemons. - Let's do that.

535
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:52,801
We need to get rid of them.

536
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:56,371
(Using Mimi as an excuse, she begins to bag more lemons.)

537
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:01,641
(Meanwhile, Yu Jin goes through the spot Mimi was at.)

538
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:04,111
What? There are lemons.

539
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:09,851
- Did you hide lemons here? - No.

540
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,321
(Hold on. Are you talking about my lemons?)

541
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,490
There are two lemons inside. It's so suspicious.

542
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:15,531
Let's cut them right away.

543
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,561
(Laughing)

544
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:20,161
(Yu Jin doesn't hold back.)

545
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:24,431
(She cuts the lemons happily.)

546
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,071
Don't the lemons smell nice? Let's make some lemon water.

547
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:29,571
Shall we do that?

548
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:30,941
Shall we blend all of them?

549
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,481
(She isn't joking around.)

550
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:35,281
Let's make some lemon water.

551
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:39,551
(Actual insanity)

552
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:43,891
(Lemon Eun Ji bags the remaining lemons.)

553
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:47,861
(I can squeeze these lemons with my hands.)

554
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:50,191
Let's hurry up and get rid of them.

555
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:53,260
(She runs away after making a useless comment.)

556
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:54,800
Where are you going?

557
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:57,071
I'm going to hide them, okay?

558
00:21:57,201 --> 00:21:59,241
(Upon hearing the angry tone in her voice, )

559
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:03,941
(Young Ji goes to spy on her.)

560
00:22:06,211 --> 00:22:07,211
What?

561
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:09,550
(They never leave her alone.)

562
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,811
- Put them in the hot tub. - Let's do that.

563
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:13,251
(Laughing)

564
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:14,481
It's a good idea.

565
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:15,802
- It's a good idea, right? - Yes.

566
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:17,391
Let's put them in there.

567
00:22:17,551 --> 00:22:21,491
You keep talking about the hot tub for some reason.

568
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,130
Is that so?

569
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:24,490
(Eun Ji becomes talkative when she is flustered.)

570
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:26,460
I'll go into the hot tub today no matter what.

571
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:27,831
You can enjoy it with the lemons.

572
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:29,271
Okay.

573
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:32,271
(The lemons go in.)

574
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:34,271
- Let's put all of them inside. - Okay.

575
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:37,971
(It's not like they'll disappear.)

576
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,681
(All the lemons go into the hot tub.)

577
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:44,810
(Eat cup tteokbokki alone. Yu Jin hid all 3 cup tteokbokki.)

578
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:45,850
(Make 1L of lemon juice.)

579
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:47,297
(All the lemons are stored in the hot tub.)

580
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:48,457
Your mission is ruined, right?

581
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:50,090
What? It isn't ruined.

582
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:52,391
Your mission is ruined, right? Be honest.

583
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:54,321
- Young Ji. - Do you want my help?

584
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:55,860
- Young Ji. - Yes?

585
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:57,460
Shall I put oranges in the hot tub?

586
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:58,461
Yes.

587
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,201
- Okay. - Put all of them in the hot tub.

588
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:02,500
Did you put the lemons in the hot tub?

589
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:03,531
Yes.

590
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:06,771
The lemons and oranges are in the hot tub.

591
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:08,400
We thought about putting them in the pool,

592
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:09,711
but we stopped ourselves.

593
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:12,341
(Laughing so hard)

594
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:14,141
How should I cut them?

595
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:19,281
How should I cut them so that Mimi can't use them?

596
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:22,021
(Yu Jin also thinks that the lemons are Mimi's mission.)

597
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:23,121
What are the two of them doing?

598
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:24,291
(Laughing)

599
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:26,991
(They seem to be having a serious conversation.)

600
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:29,091
- Dum. - My.

601
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:30,191
- Cross. - Cross.

602
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:33,131
(Team BB has been formed for the Morning Mission.)

603
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:35,501
(The lemons are for your mission, right?)

604
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:37,531
(What are you talking about?)

605
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:39,047
Are you asking me if the lemons are for my mission?

606
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:41,101
- Aren't they? - They aren't for my mission.

607
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:43,871
- No? - No. Aren't they for your mission?

608
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:45,821
They aren't for my mission.

609
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:48,311
What are the two of you doing?

610
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,780
Eun Ji, it must be Yu Jin's mission.

611
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:51,881
It seems that way, right?

612
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:53,951
Mimi said to me,

613
00:23:54,281 --> 00:23:55,690
"These lemons aren't for my mission."

614
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:59,621
- Seriously. - Why would you fall for that?

615
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:02,861
I don't think it's Yu Jin's mission. She squeezed the lemons diligently.

616
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:05,530
- It isn't her mission. - She got rid of them earnestly.

617
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:07,201
- It isn't her mission. - My goodness.

618
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:11,530
Eun Ji, will you enter the hot tub today?

619
00:24:11,531 --> 00:24:12,541
Yes.

620
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:15,670
(Mimi calmly begins to work on her mission.)

621
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:16,810
(Mimi's mission)

622
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:17,811
(Two or more people go in the hot tub.)

623
00:24:17,812 --> 00:24:19,340
Eun Ji, will you enter the hot tub today?

624
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:20,341
Yes.

625
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:21,880
- Do you want to do it with me? - Eun Ji, it's closed today.

626
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:23,381
Why? I really want...

627
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:24,910
(She didn't think that Yu Jin would be a hindrance.)

628
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:28,081
Why? I really want to use the hot tub and sauna.

629
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:31,091
You know that I've been obsessed!

630
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:34,890
Please. Don't touch the hot tub and sauna.

631
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,131
My mission has nothing to do with the hot tub and sauna.

632
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:39,260
Let me use them. Please.

633
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:40,421
(One person is in their way.)

634
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:41,660
Do it tomorrow.

635
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:44,701
No, today is the day to do it.

636
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:47,700
I warmed up the water for today.

637
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:48,971
Today is the best day to do it.

638
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:50,440
(Today is the best day to do it.)

639
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:51,640
Please, I have to do it today.

640
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:53,341
I even brought my swimsuit.

641
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:54,541
Do it tomorrow.

642
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:57,851
Please!

643
00:24:58,281 --> 00:24:59,581
(Childish Eun Ji)

644
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:01,281
I'm going to throw up.

645
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:02,321
(Throwing up)

646
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:04,951
(Disarmed)

647
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:08,221
(Good job, Eun Ji.)

648
00:25:08,891 --> 00:25:09,891
(Thanks to the lemons inside the hot tub)

649
00:25:09,892 --> 00:25:11,590
Mom, I'm going to throw up.

650
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:14,560
I want to go in the hot tub and the Finnish sauna today.

651
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:16,071
Please, Mom.

652
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:18,401
Fine, go ahead.

653
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:19,901
- Thank you. - Go ahead.

654
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:21,340
(Two or more people go in the hot tub.)

655
00:25:21,341 --> 00:25:22,470
(Permission granted)

656
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:23,831
Eun Ji, did you warm up the water?

657
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,241
It's getting warmed up now.

658
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,580
Do you want to go into the hot tub right now?

659
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:27,810
That sounds good. We might as well do it fast.

660
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:29,080
We might as well do it fast, Mimi.

661
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:30,387
(While the girls leave to get in the hot tub)

662
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:31,710
Hey, are you sleeping?

663
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:32,750
We might as well do it fast, Mimi.

664
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:34,851
- Hey, are you sleeping? - I'm going to sleep here.

665
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:37,050
(It's 12:05am.)

666
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:38,667
(Yu Jin Bokki lies down to sleep on the 1st floor.)

667
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:39,691
I'm going to sleep here.

668
00:25:39,692 --> 00:25:40,890
- Are you going to sleep? - I'm going to sleep here.

669
00:25:40,891 --> 00:25:42,431
Is sleeping here your mission?

670
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:43,891
Yes.

671
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,330
(Young Ji can start her mission only when everyone is asleep.)

672
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:48,030
(Draw a dot of at least 0.5cm on each member's face.)

673
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:50,111
(The face is under the forehead and above the chin.)

674
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:53,341
(She leaves Yu Jin alone so she can fall asleep quickly.)

675
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:56,871
(Will Yu Jin Bokki fall asleep like this?)

676
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:59,041
(Lights out on the 1st floor)

677
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:03,150
(Sighing)

678
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:04,751
- Are you going into the hot tub? - Yes.

679
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:07,080
Mimi, get changed into your swimsuit.

680
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:08,751
- I'll hurry and get changed. - Okay.

681
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:10,520
Do you want to go into the hot tub with me?

682
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:12,597
(Artist Lee is the first one to come out to the terrace.)

683
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:15,191
Honestly, how will I draw a dot on everyone's face?

684
00:26:16,061 --> 00:26:18,231
(She's starting to get worried about her mission.)

685
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:21,860
(Bursting out laughing)

686
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:23,000
They're here.

687
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,630
Is this okay? It's not here.

688
00:26:24,631 --> 00:26:26,041
Hurry up and go.

689
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:27,701
(They're ready to go in the water.)

690
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:31,870
(As they get closer to the hot tub, )

691
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:34,781
(Hot Tub Mim gets more nervous.)

692
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,281
- Goodness. - Wait a minute.

693
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:40,751
Gosh, it's cold.

694
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:41,950
- Is it cold? - Yes.

695
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:43,590
- This feels good. - There's a place for champagne.

696
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:44,691
I can't believe it.

697
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:46,931
(It looks like she succeeded without much trouble.)

698
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:50,060
(However, Hot Tub Mim looks uncomfortable.)

699
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:51,230
(Two or more people go in the hot tub.)

700
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:53,660
(However, their bodies must be underwater up to the neck.)

701
00:26:53,661 --> 00:26:55,831
- Go underwater up to your neck. - Up to my neck?

702
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:57,900
(Both hands)

703
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:59,141
You should go all the way in.

704
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:00,677
Why do you keep making me go deeper?

705
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:02,140
(Pressing)

706
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:04,471
(Mission cleared)

707
00:27:04,811 --> 00:27:06,411
(Current Time: 12:30am)

708
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:08,310
- Come in. - Is it warm?

709
00:27:08,311 --> 00:27:09,351
- Is it nice? - Yes.

710
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:11,450
What are you going to do in the hot tub?

711
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:13,957
I want to stay in the hot tub. I'm going to have some champagne.

712
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:15,480
Is drinking champagne in the hot tub your mission?

713
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:16,521
No.

714
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,720
Go downstairs and see what Yu Jin is up to.

715
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:18,750
I'll go downstairs.

716
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:20,590
Neither of you can move right now.

717
00:27:20,591 --> 00:27:22,060
(Neither of you can move right now.)

718
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:25,831
(So I'll start my mission.)

719
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:30,001
(Exhaling)

720
00:27:31,571 --> 00:27:34,301
(She needs to draw a dot on Yu Jin's face while she's sleeping.)

721
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:37,241
What are you up to?

722
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:39,071
Tell me honestly.

723
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,461
- Why aren't you... - Who's in the hot tub?

724
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:43,081
Eun Ji and Mimi.

725
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:44,501
(She's not getting scolded.)

726
00:27:44,651 --> 00:27:45,781
Why are you sleeping here?

727
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:49,321
To catch people like you who come to clear their mission.

728
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:50,920
I can't clear my mission here.

729
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:51,950
Where can you do it?

730
00:27:51,951 --> 00:27:53,791
(I can't do it because you aren't sleeping.)

731
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:55,520
I thought of sleeping here,

732
00:27:55,521 --> 00:27:58,091
but what if Mimi's mission is making lemon juice?

733
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:01,430
In case she makes lemon juice comfortably in the room,

734
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:02,831
I might have to sleep upstairs.

735
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:05,031
It's hard to decide.

736
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:07,171
(Weirdo...)

737
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:10,271
(She's really a weirdo.)

738
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:12,471
Sleep well. You looked sleepy...

739
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:14,781
since we started watching "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

740
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,410
Young Ji, go upstairs.

741
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,111
I can sleep only when you go upstairs.

742
00:28:18,851 --> 00:28:21,421
(I can do it only when you're sleeping.)

743
00:28:21,881 --> 00:28:23,550
- Sleep well. - Thank you.

744
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:25,520
(Sleep well.)

745
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:27,761
(Please)

746
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:29,491
Darn it.

747
00:28:31,331 --> 00:28:34,301
(Sighing)

748
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:38,371
(Someone isn't asleep, and some are in the water.)

749
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:43,971
(She waited anxiously for Yu Jin to fall asleep.)

750
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:49,141
(20 minutes passed.)

751
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:52,881
(Is she asleep now?)

752
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:57,951
(Artist Lee enters.)

753
00:29:05,261 --> 00:29:07,831
(She takes off her slippers gently.)

754
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:13,571
(She approaches her while holding her breath.)

755
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:19,281
(Is she dead or alive?)

756
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:23,381
(Her heart almost bursts out of her chest.)

757
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:28,681
(She doesn't feel confident.)

758
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:31,191
(Coughing)

759
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:34,291
(A staff member coughs.)

760
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:36,831
(Snorting)

761
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:39,760
(Who was that? Come out right now.)

762
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:42,430
(Why did you have to cough now?)

763
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:43,431
(Laughing)

764
00:29:46,371 --> 00:29:49,071
(Fortunately, it didn't wake her up.)

765
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,971
(Sighing)

766
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:53,711
Should I just go for it and draw it?

767
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:59,951
(This time, she strides over to her.)

768
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:03,651
(Removing the lid)

769
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:08,691
(She goes for it without hesitating.)

770
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:13,101
(Artist Lee's first touch)

771
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:17,200
(She drew a dot.)

772
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:18,800
(Young Ji...)

773
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:20,871
(made it.)

774
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:24,141
(Retreating 4 steps)

775
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:29,241
(She gasps for air after holding her breath for 30 seconds.)

776
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:31,180
(Draw a dot on each member's face.)

777
00:30:31,181 --> 00:30:32,281
(One-third successful)

778
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:34,351
I really want to win.

779
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:35,950
In order to win,

780
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:38,291
I abandoned my friend, Mimi.

781
00:30:38,821 --> 00:30:40,991
A moment ago, Mimi kept telling me...

782
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:47,261
(Why does it feel so creepy?)

783
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:50,471
(Right behind her)

784
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:53,701
(She was watching her.)

785
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:56,811
(What?)

786
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,641
Gosh, she startled me.

787
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:02,580
(What are you talking about, Young Ji?)

788
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:03,741
Doesn't she look frightening?

789
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:07,121
(Shaking her head)

790
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:11,491
(She gets up and disappears leisurely.)

791
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,490
(Laughing)

792
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:15,121
(There are enemies everywhere.)

793
00:31:16,131 --> 00:31:17,530
- Mimi. - Let's go to the sauna.

794
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:18,661
Go into the sauna.

795
00:31:19,401 --> 00:31:22,001
(The sauna is as important as her mission.)

796
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:23,930
(Inhaling)

797
00:31:23,931 --> 00:31:26,540
I want to clear my mission...

798
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:29,041
and win by playing fair,

799
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:31,871
but I don't think I'll be able to succeed.

800
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,311
I apologize beforehand, but I'll disrupt everyone else.

801
00:31:36,181 --> 00:31:38,651
(While the older girls are busy enjoying the sauna, )

802
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:41,881
(Artist Lee comes out to the terrace leisurely.)

803
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,621
(She starts fidgeting with the lemons.)

804
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:48,061
I can't throw the lemons all the way there, can I?

805
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:49,321
- Where? - Over there.

806
00:31:50,031 --> 00:31:52,160
(What Young Ji meant by "over there")

807
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,161
It doesn't matter.

808
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:58,231
(Outside the Morning Mission's boundary)

809
00:31:58,971 --> 00:32:00,901
(I don't care anymore.)

810
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:09,210
(Eun Ji's lemons are...)

811
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:13,981
(falling from the sky.)

812
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:18,391
I won't let anyone succeed.

813
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:20,960
No one.

814
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:22,790
(The shot put of madness)

815
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:25,291
If I can't clear my mission,

816
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:29,030
who else will?

817
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:30,630
(Outside, the lemons are being stolen.)

818
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:33,941
(Eun Ji is sweating without knowing what's going on.)

819
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,671
I cannot succeed.

820
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:39,311
Instead,

821
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:41,910
I will throw...

822
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:43,380
(Laughing)

823
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:44,450
The lemons.

824
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:45,451
(Laughing)

825
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:50,791
(She threw almost all the lemons.)

826
00:32:54,121 --> 00:32:56,661
(Will she stop here?)

827
00:32:57,391 --> 00:32:58,831
I'll leave one lemon for you.

828
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:03,831
(The last one)

829
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:05,771
(Laughing)

830
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:06,941
Actually, no.

831
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:09,301
Who knows what you'll do with the last lemon?

832
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:15,311
(All the lemons go outside the Morning Mission's boundary.)

833
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:18,251
(Her madness exploded.)

834
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:21,821
(Make 1L of lemon juice, lemons are lost.)

835
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:25,451
(She goes to report it to the girls in the sauna.)

836
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,890
(Sauna)

837
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:29,061
Come in.

838
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,190
- What is it? - When you open the door,

839
00:33:31,191 --> 00:33:32,391
you'll let the warmth out.

840
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:34,901
- Stay inside. - What's wrong?

841
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:36,731
You look so scary.

842
00:33:36,901 --> 00:33:38,800
(Saying everything with her facial expression)

843
00:33:38,801 --> 00:33:39,971
Did you find something?

844
00:33:40,571 --> 00:33:43,841
(Laughing)

845
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:44,971
What?

846
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:47,611
(She goes away after leaving a powerful presence behind.)

847
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:49,480
What is it?

848
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:51,411
(Anxiety at its peak)

849
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:52,911
Can you come out for a moment?

850
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:55,520
I want to show you a spectacular sight.

851
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:56,961
- Let's go and see it. - What is it?

852
00:33:57,491 --> 00:33:58,551
Can I come too?

853
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:00,621
The more people see it, the better it is.

854
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,520
- What is it? - Come here for a minute.

855
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:04,937
(Young Ji still thinks that Mimi's mission is making lemon juice.)

856
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,861
Let me show you a spectacular sight.

857
00:34:08,731 --> 00:34:11,371
(The girls follow Young Ji.)

858
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:12,771
There aren't any lemons.

859
00:34:12,971 --> 00:34:14,491
Don't you want to know where they are?

860
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:17,441
(The hot tub is completely empty.)

861
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:18,771
There aren't any lemons.

862
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:20,840
(There aren't any lemons? What do you mean?)

863
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,780
- She took out all the lemons. - Come this way.

864
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:24,711
- Let me show you an amazing sight. - Wait.

865
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:26,210
(Right in front of them)

866
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:28,421
- Look. - What have you done?

867
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:35,591
(The devastating scene of the lemon theft)

868
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:38,131
(Screaming)

869
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:40,730
(Fake sadness...)

870
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:42,361
(and someone who faces the reality)

871
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:44,171
What have you done?

872
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:47,401
- Well done. - A moment ago...

873
00:34:47,741 --> 00:34:50,610
- Well done. - A moment ago...

874
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:52,641
- I shouldn't have looked at it. - Goodness.

875
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:55,781
- Shall we go? - I feel so relieved.

876
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:59,581
(It isn't her mission, but Mimi is also shocked.)

877
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:04,091
I had a lot of fun.

878
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:05,821
Good job, Young Ji.

879
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:09,290
- Well done. - Whose mission...

880
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:11,191
should I destroy next?

881
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:14,401
(Sighing)

882
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:18,231
(There's a moment of silence.)

883
00:35:19,771 --> 00:35:20,771
(Eun Ji, who is done for, goes to take a shower.)

884
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:22,771
- Sleep well, Eun Ji. - Thanks.

885
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:26,681
(She's having too much fun so she can't sleep.)

886
00:35:27,011 --> 00:35:28,510
I feel so good.

887
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:30,311
Goodness, I feel amazing.

888
00:35:31,181 --> 00:35:34,181
I didn't know that it felt this good to disrupt someone's success.

889
00:35:35,581 --> 00:35:37,651
Other people always stopped me from succeeding.

890
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:40,191
This is wonderful.

891
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,090
I'll pick them up in the morning.

892
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:43,191
Don't worry.

893
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:46,061
Goodness, what a relief.

894
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:48,901
- Young Ji, are you going to bed? - No.

895
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:50,671
Where are you sleeping tonight? Here?

896
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,130
I don't know yet.

897
00:35:52,131 --> 00:35:53,800
Why not? Aren't you done with your mission yet?

898
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:56,301
No, I haven't even started it.

899
00:35:56,741 --> 00:35:58,911
(It's because you aren't sleeping.)

900
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:00,641
Then I'm going to sleep here.

901
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:01,941
Okay.

902
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:05,951
(Current Time: 2:10am)

903
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:09,181
(Meanwhile, Eun Ji comes out after taking a shower.)

904
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:12,921
(She goes down to the 1st floor without thinking much.)

905
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:18,131
(She notices Yu Jin who's sleeping.)

906
00:36:22,301 --> 00:36:24,401
(Let's see.)

907
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:30,571
(She stares intently at something.)

908
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:39,110
By the way...

909
00:36:39,111 --> 00:36:40,921
(Young Ji's room)

910
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:41,951
You know what?

911
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:44,321
(Strangely, Eun Ji is hesitating.)

912
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:46,351
Yu Jin got a mole on her face.

913
00:36:48,191 --> 00:36:49,621
Yu Jin got a mole on her face.

914
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:51,731
(Smiling)

915
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:54,501
Right?

916
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:57,501
She suddenly got a mole in her sleep.

917
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:01,441
(Rummaging)

918
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:05,111
(Opening her marker)

919
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:09,281
(Nothing can stop me now. Come over here right now.)

920
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:12,581
You're so scary.

921
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:14,081
You're scary.

922
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:17,091
This is like a scene from a horror movie.

923
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:20,761
(Young Ji's mission is detected by Eun Ji.)

924
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:24,230
I can remove it tomorrow morning, right?

925
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:25,661
(Giggling)

926
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:28,331
- I can remove it tomorrow, right? - Go ahead.

927
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:33,000
(She picked a similar Morning Mission on Season 1.)

928
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,671
(Give pedicure to 3 people except yourself.)

929
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:39,070
(Before dawn while everyone was sleeping, )

930
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:41,811
(she woke up without the alarm.)

931
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:47,351
(She cleared her mission perfectly without anyone realizing it.)

932
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:53,561
(Will she be able to do it again while everyone is asleep?)

933
00:37:56,021 --> 00:37:58,031
- Sleep well. - Thanks.

934
00:37:58,161 --> 00:37:59,460
It's almost 3am.

935
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:01,131
It's possible that I don't wake up.

936
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:02,460
(Young Ji, Mimi)

937
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:03,531
We can do it.

938
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:04,871
We can do it.

939
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:11,011
(The members finally fall asleep at 3 in the morning.)

940
00:38:13,011 --> 00:38:16,211
(Yu Jin is slightly tossing and turning on the 1st floor.)

941
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:21,320
(Everyone falls asleep.)

942
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:23,591
(Right after everyone falls asleep)

943
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:27,261
(Current Time: 5:32am)

944
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:31,361
(Opening wide)

945
00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:37,371
(Her body springs up automatically as soon as she opens her eyes.)

946
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:45,741
(She heads upstairs to the 2nd floor where cup tteokbokki is.)

947
00:38:46,881 --> 00:38:49,881
(2 cup tteokbokki, 1 cup tteokbokki)

948
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:52,811
(Yu Jin enters.)

949
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:56,551
(Did Young Ji wake up?)

950
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:59,691
(She retreats for now.)

951
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:06,431
(She starts tossing and turning more.)

952
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:09,101
(Waiting for the right time)

953
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,671
(An antenna is set up.)

954
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:13,941
(Smiling)

955
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:18,541
(She goes toward the cup tteokbokki while avoiding the foot antenna.)

956
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,981
(Fast-forward by 7 times)

957
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:26,181
(Reaching for her target)

958
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:27,951
(Rustling)

959
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:36,460
(She takes one out...)

960
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:39,931
(and hides it under her t-shirt.)

961
00:39:41,731 --> 00:39:46,031
(Going away as quickly as possible)

962
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,071
(She returns safely to the 1st floor.)

963
00:39:49,501 --> 00:39:53,641
(Giggling)

964
00:39:54,111 --> 00:39:56,081
(She also finds it funny.)

965
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:58,551
It's 5:44am.

966
00:39:59,311 --> 00:40:00,881
Tteokbokki.

967
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:04,991
(She refers to the cooking instructions on the back.)

968
00:40:05,451 --> 00:40:06,691
(Spicy Cup Tteokbokki)

969
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:15,101
(First, she boils some water in the electric kettle.)

970
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:19,571
(1. Remove the lid completely.)

971
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:23,671
(2. Add the rice cakes and powdered seasoning in the container.)

972
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:27,481
(3. Pour in some hot water.)

973
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:29,540
(4. It's ready once it's microwaved.)

974
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,281
(Whirring)

975
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:34,381
(Covering her mouth)

976
00:40:36,181 --> 00:40:38,451
(I don't care. Let's just dance.)

977
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:41,691
(She looks inside the microwave.)

978
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:45,291
(She clears the mission once she eats it without getting caught.)

979
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:49,361
(Yu Jin's cup tteokbokki is ready.)

980
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:53,571
(Chewy rice cakes marinated in the sauce)

981
00:40:54,941 --> 00:40:59,311
(The delicious eating sound that breaks the silence at dawn)

982
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,241
It's so delicious.

983
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:04,881
(She spots the staff who arrived at work.)

984
00:41:08,851 --> 00:41:11,391
(Please stay quiet.)

985
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:15,721
(I still have some left.)

986
00:41:16,161 --> 00:41:18,290
(Laughing)

987
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:20,501
(Chuckling)

988
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:25,131
(She can't stop laughing.)

989
00:41:27,471 --> 00:41:29,641
What wealth would I gain from this anyway?

990
00:41:30,111 --> 00:41:31,441
At 6am.

991
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:44,421
(She finished it all by herself.)

992
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:47,621
(Mission cleared)

993
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:49,691
(Thumbs-up)

994
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:53,401
(Now that she ate, it's time to sleep for the 2nd time.)

995
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:57,131
(She comes back to her bed with excitement.)

996
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:59,171
(Flopping)

997
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:00,741
I'm bored.

998
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:04,911
Why aren't the girls getting up?

999
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:07,941
(It's because it's 6am.)

1000
00:42:09,341 --> 00:42:11,311
I'm going to sleep right after eating tteokbokki.

1001
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:13,681
(Laughing)

1002
00:42:14,021 --> 00:42:16,651
What's the point of doing cardio on an empty stomach?

1003
00:42:16,991 --> 00:42:20,020
I ate an entire cup tteokbokki at 6am.

1004
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:21,160
(Possible to lose 61kcal)

1005
00:42:21,161 --> 00:42:23,391
This isn't a detox.

1006
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:25,091
I'm going back to sleep.

1007
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:32,031
(Will Yu Jin be able to get up?)

1008
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:38,041
(The morning of Morning Mission is here.)

1009
00:42:39,211 --> 00:42:40,780
(Current Time: 7:15am)

1010
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:42,781
(45 minutes remain before the announcement.)

1011
00:42:42,911 --> 00:42:45,181
(However, the problem is...)

1012
00:42:45,281 --> 00:42:48,851
(that no one set the alarm.)

1013
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:52,551
(When the sun rises, as promised)

1014
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:55,190
(Their mobile phones were placed...)

1015
00:42:55,191 --> 00:42:57,031
(in the 2nd floor living room.)

1016
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:03,531
(It doesn't look like anyone will get up anytime soon.)

1017
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:07,201
(Artist Lee...)

1018
00:43:07,841 --> 00:43:11,370
(Including Mimi next to her)

1019
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:14,741
(She didn't do her mission on Eun Ji either.)

1020
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:18,181
(Eun Ji's lemons)

1021
00:43:19,411 --> 00:43:22,981
(They're still floating in the swimming pool.)

1022
00:43:24,491 --> 00:43:25,920
(Will the two of them clear the mission before 8am?)

1023
00:43:25,921 --> 00:43:27,120
(Make 1L of lemon juice.)

1024
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:28,997
(Draw a dot of at least 0.5cm on each member's face.)

1025
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:31,161
(Who will be the first one to take her mobile phone?)

1026
00:43:31,531 --> 00:43:33,030
(Current Time: 7:55am)

1027
00:43:33,031 --> 00:43:35,501
(5 minutes before the announcement)

1028
00:43:36,331 --> 00:43:38,501
I'll set my alarm before going back to sleep.

1029
00:43:41,171 --> 00:43:43,941
(Eun Ji gets up 1st.)

1030
00:43:45,211 --> 00:43:48,111
(She grabs her clothes and puts them on.)

1031
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:53,081
(She goes down to the 1st floor for a quick departure.)

1032
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:57,221
Where is everyone?

1033
00:43:57,821 --> 00:43:59,991
(The staff are quiet.)

1034
00:44:00,191 --> 00:44:01,221
They aren't up yet.

1035
00:44:01,661 --> 00:44:02,761
They aren't up?

1036
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:04,460
(Eun Ji)

1037
00:44:04,461 --> 00:44:06,260
(She moves to the 1st floor living room...)

1038
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:08,101
(where Yu Jin is sleeping.)

1039
00:44:09,031 --> 00:44:10,501
Is she still sleeping?

1040
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:17,971
(The youngest who's sleeping deeply due to the blood sugar spike)

1041
00:44:18,911 --> 00:44:21,881
(Mimi and Young Ji on the 2nd floor are still sound asleep.)

1042
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,751
(It's so late.)

1043
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:31,251
(1 minute remaining)

1044
00:44:31,991 --> 00:44:33,920
Where is the announcement?

1045
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,091
(It's 8 o'clock sharp.)

1046
00:44:35,361 --> 00:44:36,391
It's here.

1047
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:42,001
(Brother Yeong Seok: Come and see me.)

1048
00:44:42,861 --> 00:44:45,271
(Where on earth is he?)

1049
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:47,340
(From the front of the accommodation, )

1050
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:51,971
(if you turn about 90 degrees to the right, )

1051
00:44:52,271 --> 00:44:54,811
(you'll see the main entrance...)

1052
00:44:55,311 --> 00:44:57,751
(and the garage door straight ahead.)

1053
00:44:57,981 --> 00:45:00,321
(Yeong Seok is sitting right in front of it.)

1054
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:01,781
We got a message.

1055
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:05,551
Where is this?

1056
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:10,191
(Mimi's awake too.)

1057
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:13,631
(Her eyes aren't fully open yet.)

1058
00:45:14,531 --> 00:45:17,131
(Eun Ji is going for the exit on the right.)

1059
00:45:17,871 --> 00:45:20,441
(Mimi heads straight toward the pool.)

1060
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:26,511
(Yu Jin is now awake too.)

1061
00:45:26,981 --> 00:45:29,811
(She follows Mimi's lead.)

1062
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:33,427
(Wrong-way Eun Ji was the first one to come outside, but she's lost.)

1063
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:34,550
(Brother Yeong Seok)

1064
00:45:34,551 --> 00:45:37,312
(Meanwhile, Mimi and Yu Jin came out from the front of the building.)

1065
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:41,391
(Who will be the first to arrive?)

1066
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,531
(Sighing)

1067
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:47,761
(The 1st person will be arriving in 3 seconds.)

1068
00:45:50,431 --> 00:45:51,870
Welcome, brave warrior.

1069
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:53,701
(Eun Ji is in 1st place.)

1070
00:45:54,141 --> 00:45:56,070
- Welcome, brave warrior. - You are the first to arrive.

1071
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:57,111
Thank you.

1072
00:45:57,311 --> 00:45:58,910
Let us wait a moment.

1073
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,111
(Who will be in 2nd place?)

1074
00:46:00,411 --> 00:46:01,411
I'm not sure what it is.

1075
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:04,881
Warrior, you are second to arrive.

1076
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:06,451
And you are third.

1077
00:46:06,452 --> 00:46:08,157
(Mimi is in 2nd place, and Yu Jin is in 3rd place.)

1078
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:09,620
Which exit did you come outside from?

1079
00:46:09,621 --> 00:46:11,751
This one. I came out of the main entrance.

1080
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:15,491
- What? - You were sneaky about it.

1081
00:46:16,461 --> 00:46:19,761
I don't know if we should wait for Young Ji.

1082
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:22,701
(Even after Mimi left the room, )

1083
00:46:24,231 --> 00:46:27,771
(Artist Lee was sound asleep after staying up all night painting.)

1084
00:46:29,101 --> 00:46:33,371
(Eventually, her roommate, Mimi, leaves to wake her up.)

1085
00:46:35,181 --> 00:46:36,211
Young Ji.

1086
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:40,081
Young Ji, it's 8am. Wake up.

1087
00:46:41,021 --> 00:46:42,021
It's 8am.

1088
00:46:42,022 --> 00:46:44,521
(What? It's 8am?)

1089
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:48,891
(The Clock Spirit can't wake up without an alarm.)

1090
00:46:49,921 --> 00:46:50,931
She's here.

1091
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:53,190
(Finally, Young Ji is the last one to arrive.)

1092
00:46:53,191 --> 00:46:54,301
There's a mole on her face.

1093
00:46:55,261 --> 00:46:57,830
- All right, Young Ji. You're last. - There's a mole on her face.

1094
00:46:57,831 --> 00:46:59,831
- A mole... - You're the last one to arrive.

1095
00:47:00,071 --> 00:47:02,201
(Order of arrival)

1096
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:04,741
To start with, Eun Ji. You're first place. Step forward.

1097
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:05,841
Okay.

1098
00:47:05,842 --> 00:47:06,970
- Eun Ji. - Yes.

1099
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:09,380
Please reveal what your mission was.

1100
00:47:09,381 --> 00:47:12,351
My mission was...

1101
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:13,551
What's that?

1102
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:16,320
(Gosh, there's no way.)

1103
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:17,591
My mission was...

1104
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:19,491
(Rummaging through her bag)

1105
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:21,960
juicing 1L of lemon juice.

1106
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:23,707
Gosh, she really squeezed out all that lemon juice.

1107
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:25,030
What?

1108
00:47:25,031 --> 00:47:26,490
I have a question.

1109
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:28,831
There weren't that many lemons. How did you pull it off?

1110
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:30,901
So what happened was...

1111
00:47:32,271 --> 00:47:34,901
I won't let anyone succeed.

1112
00:47:35,241 --> 00:47:39,611
(Didn't Young Ji throw out all the lemons?)

1113
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:42,310
(Laughing)

1114
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:44,351
(Good job.)

1115
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,981
(Turns out, Lemon Eun Ji had a trick up her sleeve.)

1116
00:47:49,621 --> 00:47:53,320
(Her secret weapon was...)

1117
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:57,231
(a pouch of lemons she hid under the sun lounger.)

1118
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:02,201
(A few minutes later, she came back to the empty terrace...)

1119
00:48:03,201 --> 00:48:07,171
(and took every single lemon with her.)

1120
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:12,041
(She then hid the lemons right next to her bed.)

1121
00:48:12,511 --> 00:48:15,541
(The tricky part was finding a tool to juice with and a water bottle.)

1122
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:18,711
(She brought something from the 1st floor.)

1123
00:48:18,811 --> 00:48:21,281
(A blender!)

1124
00:48:21,781 --> 00:48:26,151
(Eun Ji hid the smuggled blender in the bathroom.)

1125
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:29,860
(She went downstairs again.)

1126
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:31,431
This bottle is 1L.

1127
00:48:32,161 --> 00:48:34,961
This is 1L. I can use this for the lemon juice, right?

1128
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:39,800
(It's the same kind as the one the staff had prepared.)

1129
00:48:39,801 --> 00:48:41,641
Where are you sleeping tonight? Here?

1130
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:43,001
I don't know yet.

1131
00:48:43,002 --> 00:48:44,511
Then I'm going to sleep here.

1132
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:46,041
Okay.

1133
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:48,057
(That's how she made sure to secure the bed next to the lemons.)

1134
00:48:48,081 --> 00:48:50,241
(Late at night, when everyone was asleep, )

1135
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:54,651
(she went into her lemon stash...)

1136
00:48:58,521 --> 00:49:02,491
(and used the blender to make 1L of lemon juice within 30 minutes.)

1137
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:04,390
I threw out all the lemons.

1138
00:49:04,391 --> 00:49:05,760
No, I had hidden all the lemons.

1139
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:07,401
There are still some left upstairs.

1140
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:12,000
My whole room smells like lemon. It's driving me insane.

1141
00:49:12,001 --> 00:49:14,071
(Eun Ji's breakfast is confirmed.)

1142
00:49:14,171 --> 00:49:16,140
- Now's the right time to... - We have to hear from Mimi.

1143
00:49:16,141 --> 00:49:17,710
Now's the right time to hear from Mimi.

1144
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:19,471
Right. Mimi, what happened?

1145
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:20,911
(Genuinely curious)

1146
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,641
My mission was...

1147
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:28,251
two or more people fully submerging up to their necks in the jacuzzi.

1148
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:29,351
Ta-da.

1149
00:49:29,421 --> 00:49:30,991
Mimi succeeded!

1150
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,591
Yes!

1151
00:49:32,691 --> 00:49:34,221
(Mimi's breakfast is confirmed.)

1152
00:49:34,321 --> 00:49:36,020
(Yu Jin and Young Ji are automatically assigned a penalty.)

1153
00:49:36,021 --> 00:49:37,631
What were your missions?

1154
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,631
What was Yu Jin's mission?

1155
00:49:41,331 --> 00:49:42,701
(Laughing)

1156
00:49:42,801 --> 00:49:44,170
(She has a crazy look on her face.)

1157
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:46,211
- She's making that mean face again. - What was it?

1158
00:49:46,931 --> 00:49:48,670
All right. Yu Jin.

1159
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:50,071
(She secretly takes something out.)

1160
00:49:50,811 --> 00:49:52,070
Show it to us.

1161
00:49:52,071 --> 00:49:53,770
(The true nature of her mission is gradually being revealed.)

1162
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:55,881
- It was eating... - Young Ji.

1163
00:49:56,281 --> 00:50:00,180
Cup tteokbokki alone without getting interrupted by anyone.

1164
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:01,821
(Clean)

1165
00:50:01,951 --> 00:50:04,350
- When did you eat this? - You did good.

1166
00:50:04,351 --> 00:50:05,497
(The two older E-caders are genuinely surprised.)

1167
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:07,521
I brought it as soon as we began.

1168
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:09,660
(Young Ji is truly disappointed.)

1169
00:50:09,661 --> 00:50:11,231
What time did you eat it?

1170
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:13,090
In the morning, at 5:43am.

1171
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:14,530
You ate it when you woke up?

1172
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:15,531
(She's a morning person only when it comes to the Morning Mission.)

1173
00:50:15,532 --> 00:50:16,630
Gosh.

1174
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:18,970
How did you wake up without an alarm?

1175
00:50:18,971 --> 00:50:21,200
It's built in me.

1176
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:23,441
- What is? - I go, "6am."

1177
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:25,740
- To wake up early in the morning. - What you did in Abu Dhabi?

1178
00:50:25,741 --> 00:50:28,881
Yes. I went "6am." And I really did wake up at 5:43am.

1179
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:30,671
I suddenly woke up like this.

1180
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:34,551
Yu Jin did succeed in her mission.

1181
00:50:34,651 --> 00:50:37,451
Let's hear about Young Ji's mission.

1182
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:40,421
(A sudden silence)

1183
00:50:40,591 --> 00:50:44,261
- I had to draw dots on faces. - Yes.

1184
00:50:44,361 --> 00:50:46,631
I had to draw them on everyone's faces.

1185
00:50:47,401 --> 00:50:50,161
So every time I do Morning Missions, my self-esteem takes a hit.

1186
00:50:53,701 --> 00:50:56,000
- She's sulking again. - And I keep getting betrayed.

1187
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:57,541
She's sulking again.

1188
00:50:57,941 --> 00:50:59,511
So did you manage to draw the dots?

1189
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:01,781
- Mimi has one, right? - I did this.

1190
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:03,110
- You drew it on her? - She did.

1191
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:05,010
- Goodness, you did. - I used a washable pen.

1192
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:06,881
Yu Jin, you have a beauty mark now.

1193
00:51:07,051 --> 00:51:09,280
I was sleeping right next to you. Why didn't you draw one on me?

1194
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:10,420
Right, why didn't you?

1195
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:12,091
I was going to wake up early and do it.

1196
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:15,721
(Her excuse is sleeping in.)

1197
00:51:16,091 --> 00:51:18,391
I don't even know how I would have pulled it off.

1198
00:51:18,961 --> 00:51:21,261
I thought about it all night.

1199
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:23,400
I thought about it long and hard.

1200
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:25,300
You could have come up with a plan...

1201
00:51:25,301 --> 00:51:26,530
instead of wasting your time throwing out the lemons.

1202
00:51:26,531 --> 00:51:28,801
She said "I don't know how I would have pulled it off."

1203
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:31,641
Anyway, Young Ji is the only one...

1204
00:51:31,741 --> 00:51:35,341
who failed to complete her mission.

1205
00:51:35,981 --> 00:51:38,511
An Yu Jin, mission failed.

1206
00:51:38,911 --> 00:51:43,351
Eun Ji and Mimi are the only ones who succeeded. Congratulations.

1207
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,491
(Their stomachs are empty, but their breakfast is confirmed.)

1208
00:51:49,061 --> 00:51:50,191
I'll go get the lemons.

1209
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:52,491
(Time to face the consequences of her action)

1210
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:56,900
(Trudging along)

1211
00:51:56,901 --> 00:52:00,771
(She starts picking up the lemons.)

1212
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:03,401
Why am I so bad at this?

1213
00:52:06,941 --> 00:52:10,311
(Young Ji is busily fishing out the lemons with her bare hands.)

1214
00:52:12,181 --> 00:52:14,141
If I just stay still, they will float over to me.

1215
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:15,581
And I'll pick them up when they do.

1216
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:18,951
(She's got the hang of it already.)

1217
00:52:19,951 --> 00:52:22,521
You see how they just float over to me?

1218
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:25,191
(They actually did float over to her.)

1219
00:52:25,591 --> 00:52:27,131
I'm smart, aren't I?

1220
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:32,201
(Feisty was picking up the lemons for a long time after that.)

1221
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:36,101
(The pool is now clean again.)

1222
00:52:36,401 --> 00:52:38,601
(Young Ji's running buddy, Yu Jin, joined her outside.)

1223
00:52:38,811 --> 00:52:40,141
The weather's nice.

1224
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:42,210
Shin Geon Jun will be leading you.

1225
00:52:42,211 --> 00:52:43,211
- Are you bringing your phone? - I put it here,

1226
00:52:43,212 --> 00:52:44,711
- in my back pocket. - Okay.

1227
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,550
I don't have a GoPro with me.

1228
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:48,081
I'll be carrying the GoPro for you.

1229
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:50,050
Are we not warming up?

1230
00:52:50,051 --> 00:52:51,051
Should we?

1231
00:52:51,052 --> 00:52:53,391
Yes, we should. Otherwise, I might die.

1232
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:55,861
- Stretch your ankles first. - Okay.

1233
00:52:57,021 --> 00:52:58,691
(Refreshed)

1234
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:00,490
Are all of the camera directors running with us?

1235
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:03,800
Gosh, no way. No? Chang Dae shook his head.

1236
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:05,501
I guess Chang Dae's not running.

1237
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:07,871
But you're a good runner.

1238
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:10,871
All of the camera directors here are good runners.

1239
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:12,540
They were in charge of filming Yu Jin during the race.

1240
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:13,541
That's right.

1241
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:16,211
Stretch your ankles and legs.

1242
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:17,710
(This is Young Ji's first day of going for a run, )

1243
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:18,780
(and she's pretending to spin a hula hoop.)

1244
00:53:18,781 --> 00:53:20,150
You're not stretching your ankles.

1245
00:53:20,151 --> 00:53:21,280
(They're warming up in their own ways.)

1246
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,921
- Are you done? - Yes, let's go.

1247
00:53:23,621 --> 00:53:25,050
(Today's running route)

1248
00:53:25,051 --> 00:53:28,891
(A 5km, 40-minute round trip from the house to the turnaround point)

1249
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:32,030
(They begin running!)

1250
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,931
(Brother Chang Dae: See you later.)

1251
00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:35,031
Gosh.

1252
00:53:35,201 --> 00:53:37,301
(One of them is already out of breath.)

1253
00:53:37,771 --> 00:53:39,431
Isn't this nice, Young Ji?

1254
00:53:40,071 --> 00:53:42,941
Running at a place like this is a good experience.

1255
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:45,131
Yes, I've actually been hoping this would happen.

1256
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:47,271
I did need to go on a run sooner or later.

1257
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:48,641
I've been eating so much.

1258
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:52,081
(It's the perfect time and weather for a run.)

1259
00:53:52,281 --> 00:53:53,711
My stomach hurts already.

1260
00:53:55,251 --> 00:53:56,251
You okay?

1261
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:58,820
(This brings back memories of those high school fitness tests.)

1262
00:53:58,821 --> 00:53:59,891
Gosh.

1263
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,721
We ran 100m.

1264
00:54:01,991 --> 00:54:03,321
That's more than I thought.

1265
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:05,161
Now we have to do that 50 times.

1266
00:54:06,431 --> 00:54:08,300
(Repeating 100m, 50 times)

1267
00:54:08,301 --> 00:54:10,500
(There's no run we can't finish if we do it 50 times.)

1268
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:11,770
You said it's downhill on the way there?

1269
00:54:11,771 --> 00:54:13,371
Which means it's uphill on our way back.

1270
00:54:13,901 --> 00:54:16,071
(That's the way things are in life.)

1271
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:18,771
(Meanwhile, Mimi and Eun Ji are making breakfast.)

1272
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:20,911
They have to run 5km.

1273
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:23,580
Is that... You jog regularly, right?

1274
00:54:23,581 --> 00:54:26,011
I usually walk. I don't run.

1275
00:54:27,011 --> 00:54:29,450
(It feels like they're running a marathon here.)

1276
00:54:29,451 --> 00:54:30,550
I'm so exhausted.

1277
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:31,920
(She's running on grit and guts.)

1278
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:33,321
(Groaning)

1279
00:54:34,161 --> 00:54:35,261
(Struggling)

1280
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:38,861
(Meanwhile, Yu Jin is still relaxed in front of her.)

1281
00:54:39,761 --> 00:54:41,577
(Young Ji takes a look at Yu Jin and speeds up again.)

1282
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:43,660
(She's a pacesetter for Young Ji.)

1283
00:54:43,661 --> 00:54:45,071
Slow down.

1284
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:47,771
Did you drink water before we started running?

1285
00:54:47,941 --> 00:54:49,041
I drank a lot of water.

1286
00:54:49,841 --> 00:54:51,887
(She's struggling because her stomach is full of water.)

1287
00:54:51,911 --> 00:54:53,910
(Seagulls squawking)

1288
00:54:53,911 --> 00:54:55,111
Stop squawking.

1289
00:54:55,941 --> 00:54:57,081
Stop it.

1290
00:54:58,781 --> 00:55:00,711
(You got this, Young Ji!)

1291
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:03,320
(They kept pushing themselves to continue running.)

1292
00:55:03,321 --> 00:55:04,521
I see the turnaround point!

1293
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:08,260
(Gosh)

1294
00:55:08,261 --> 00:55:09,421
This view is so pretty.

1295
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:12,037
(They hit the turnaround point and arrived at the scenic spot.)

1296
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:13,731
We have to run uphill later.

1297
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:15,730
(Forget the view.)

1298
00:55:15,731 --> 00:55:16,761
Come here.

1299
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,201
It's okay.

1300
00:55:19,871 --> 00:55:21,000
This view is amazing.

1301
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:22,841
- Yu Jin, let's take pictures. - Okay.

1302
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:24,241
This is pretty.

1303
00:55:24,711 --> 00:55:26,211
This is a private beach.

1304
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,040
From here to there.

1305
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:29,457
(A full, unobstructed view of the ocean)

1306
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:31,351
(They can't miss a photo opportunity.)

1307
00:55:31,681 --> 00:55:32,881
We're like hikers.

1308
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:35,721
All right. Here we go.

1309
00:55:40,551 --> 00:55:42,521
Look how far we've run.

1310
00:55:43,221 --> 00:55:45,191
From where? All the way over there?

1311
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:47,191
- Behind the mountain? - Yes.

1312
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:49,401
- Behind that mountain? - Yes.

1313
00:55:49,661 --> 00:55:50,661
Let's go.

1314
00:55:50,662 --> 00:55:52,230
- Yes. - Come on.

1315
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:54,601
- Let's get this over with. - All right.

1316
00:55:55,171 --> 00:55:57,811
(Meanwhile, Team Breakfast...)

1317
00:55:58,611 --> 00:56:00,441
It's such a peaceful morning.

1318
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:05,581
(Eun Ji eats yogurt, )

1319
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:10,050
(while Mimi eats cereal.)

1320
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:11,991
This is really good. The bread is so good.

1321
00:56:13,091 --> 00:56:15,021
(Yum)

1322
00:56:15,321 --> 00:56:17,881
I wonder what the others are up to? Probably running like crazy.

1323
00:56:18,891 --> 00:56:20,430
Did they go on their run?

1324
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:21,861
(Staff: Yes.)

1325
00:56:22,231 --> 00:56:24,371
- I have a question. - What is it?

1326
00:56:25,071 --> 00:56:27,071
- When we do Morning Missions, - Yes.

1327
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:30,241
- as soon as we begin, - Yes.

1328
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:32,741
- you hide yours and... - Yes.

1329
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:35,181
- destroy everyone else's. - Right.

1330
00:56:35,511 --> 00:56:36,681
How do you do it?

1331
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:38,551
(Laughing)

1332
00:56:38,751 --> 00:56:40,551
It's in my instinct.

1333
00:56:42,421 --> 00:56:44,521
- What? - It is.

1334
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:46,191
That's scary.

1335
00:56:47,761 --> 00:56:49,891
This feels like that documentary.

1336
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:52,231
The one with the top student and the...

1337
00:56:52,361 --> 00:56:53,830
(He can't finish the sentence.)

1338
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:55,100
- The nice student. - Yes, the nice student.

1339
00:56:55,101 --> 00:56:56,500
You just trailed off...

1340
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:58,401
before saying "nice student."

1341
00:56:58,631 --> 00:57:00,231
You're too nice.

1342
00:57:00,771 --> 00:57:01,800
(Feeling embarrassed)

1343
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:03,240
You're too naive and nice.

1344
00:57:03,241 --> 00:57:05,371
Young Ji, what's that? Wait, I picked this up.

1345
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,241
Why aren't you running?

1346
00:57:07,711 --> 00:57:10,081
(Their homeroom teacher appeared out of nowhere.)

1347
00:57:10,441 --> 00:57:11,680
(At his words, the two start running once again.)

1348
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:13,751
- Gosh. - It's the Riddle Master.

1349
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:16,721
Warriors!

1350
00:57:17,281 --> 00:57:18,421
Run faster!

1351
00:57:19,121 --> 00:57:20,150
Tough crowd.

1352
00:57:20,151 --> 00:57:21,191
(Tough crowd.)

1353
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:22,990
(Today's his off-day.)

1354
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:23,991
Producer Na.

1355
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:25,891
My stomach hurts so much.

1356
00:57:26,691 --> 00:57:28,661
(Being young means your stomach hurts.)

1357
00:57:29,901 --> 00:57:32,031
Running uphill is hard.

1358
00:57:33,001 --> 00:57:34,171
Lamaze breathing!

1359
00:57:34,741 --> 00:57:37,601
(Exhaling)

1360
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,271
Three, three, five breathing.

1361
00:57:39,471 --> 00:57:41,611
(Exhaling)

1362
00:57:42,641 --> 00:57:45,411
(They run with all they've got to the finish line.)

1363
00:57:45,811 --> 00:57:47,581
(Laughing)

1364
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:50,921
(As her pacesetter, Yu Ji waits for Young Ji.)

1365
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:52,321
Thanks, Yu Jin.

1366
00:57:52,851 --> 00:57:54,051
You're welcome.

1367
00:57:56,221 --> 00:57:59,960
(They slowly close the distance between them...)

1368
00:57:59,961 --> 00:58:00,961
(and run together in perfect rhythm.)

1369
00:58:00,961 --> 00:58:01,961
Only 200m to go!

1370
00:58:03,661 --> 00:58:05,431
Is that Brother Chang Dae?

1371
00:58:05,701 --> 00:58:06,731
Brother Chang Dae!

1372
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:10,100
Just because he's got seniority, he's over there...

1373
00:58:10,101 --> 00:58:11,270
(Annoyed)

1374
00:58:11,271 --> 00:58:12,271
(Relaxed)

1375
00:58:12,272 --> 00:58:14,040
Brother Chang Dae, you're good at running.

1376
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,840
(Brother Chang Dae's camera)

1377
00:58:15,841 --> 00:58:17,751
(Panting)

1378
00:58:18,351 --> 00:58:20,811
(They'll be arriving in 30 seconds.)

1379
00:58:21,981 --> 00:58:23,550
(Yu Jin runs back to Young Ji.)

1380
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:26,651
Go, Young Ji!

1381
00:58:27,491 --> 00:58:31,331
(Finally, they have arrived at the accommodation.)

1382
00:58:31,491 --> 00:58:32,831
For you warriors,

1383
00:58:33,361 --> 00:58:34,660
I'm thirsty.

1384
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:36,761
- we've prepared iced water. - Thank you.

1385
00:58:38,631 --> 00:58:40,430
(She drinks the elixir of life right away.)

1386
00:58:40,431 --> 00:58:42,871
(Gosh)

1387
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:44,840
Thank you. We've prepared iced water for you.

1388
00:58:44,841 --> 00:58:45,941
It's nice and cold.

1389
00:58:46,511 --> 00:58:49,281
(Young Ji quickly rehydrates as well.)

1390
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:52,151
(One more sip)

1391
00:58:52,381 --> 00:58:53,981
(Sipping water)

1392
00:58:54,351 --> 00:58:55,651
Our young bloods.

1393
00:58:56,051 --> 00:58:57,151
I feel refreshed.

1394
00:59:00,251 --> 00:59:01,521
This is really nice.

1395
00:59:02,621 --> 00:59:04,390
(Gosh)

1396
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:05,931
It doesn't leak at all.

1397
00:59:06,131 --> 00:59:08,801
(They finished the run feeling refreshed.)

1398
00:59:09,261 --> 00:59:11,770
(Two hours went by.)

1399
00:59:11,771 --> 00:59:13,831
(Current time: 11:50am)

1400
00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:15,970
(They washed up and got ready to leave the house.)

1401
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:17,771
Guess my theme for today.

1402
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:20,070
- A wimp. - A wimp?

1403
00:59:20,071 --> 00:59:21,411
(Annoyed)

1404
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:24,681
(There's only one wimp in the world)

1405
00:59:24,951 --> 00:59:27,821
(Young Ji immediately turns it into a song.)

1406
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:30,921
(After taking a two-hour break, )

1407
00:59:31,221 --> 00:59:34,121
(they're bursting with energy.)

1408
00:59:34,991 --> 00:59:37,591
(They switch gears to musical theater.)

1409
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:40,560
(It's like they're on Broadway.)

1410
00:59:40,561 --> 00:59:42,430
You're the only one

1411
00:59:42,431 --> 00:59:44,511
(The youngest put her mic on and is taking selfies.)

1412
00:59:45,271 --> 00:59:47,101
(Approaching her)

1413
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:51,040
Excessive... Excessive data usage...

1414
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:52,870
causes environmental pollution.

1415
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:54,610
Again? You two, seriously?

1416
00:59:54,611 --> 00:59:55,981
You get on her nerves.

1417
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:58,110
I saw you getting on her nerves.

1418
00:59:58,111 --> 00:59:59,151
That's not it.

1419
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:01,420
Young Ji always starts it.

1420
01:00:01,421 --> 01:00:02,480
I only respond to her...

1421
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:03,957
- because she seems bored. - I'm an environmentally-friendly...

1422
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:05,497
You guys fight because you keep getting on her nerves.

1423
01:00:05,521 --> 01:00:07,421
Yu Jin. You shouldn't glare at her, either.

1424
01:00:07,891 --> 01:00:10,020
Mom, you gave birth to me like this.

1425
01:00:10,021 --> 01:00:11,060
Your eyes shine too much.

1426
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:12,290
Don't glare at your older sister with them.

1427
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:14,030
Now make up. We're about to leave.

1428
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:15,430
(Hey!)

1429
01:00:15,431 --> 01:00:17,361
Ok Yu Jin! Ok Young Ji!

1430
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:18,800
- Their last name is Ok? - Our last name is Ok?

1431
01:00:18,801 --> 01:00:20,271
Your father is Ok Taec Yeon!

1432
01:00:20,971 --> 01:00:22,940
(An ever-expanding universe)

1433
01:00:22,941 --> 01:00:25,541
(Let's go to my place)

1434
01:00:25,711 --> 01:00:26,711
- Hey, Young Ji. - It's all right.

1435
01:00:26,711 --> 01:00:27,711
(Revving up)

1436
01:00:27,712 --> 01:00:29,680
(Time to head out.)

1437
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:31,040
Hey, Yu Jin. Isn't Producer Na...

1438
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:32,780
dressed like a world geography teacher?

1439
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:34,180
He actually...

1440
01:00:34,181 --> 01:00:36,150
- This is Albufeira. Let's go. - Okay.

1441
01:00:36,151 --> 01:00:38,121
- Teacher. - Yes?

1442
01:00:38,491 --> 01:00:39,751
Where are we going?

1443
01:00:40,021 --> 01:00:41,460
- Today, - Yes.

1444
01:00:41,461 --> 01:00:43,621
We're going somewhere Eun Ji would love.

1445
01:00:43,661 --> 01:00:45,690
It's a place stacked with wine.

1446
01:00:45,691 --> 01:00:48,031
- No, I don't want to. - Why not?

1447
01:00:48,101 --> 01:00:49,400
There's nothing for me to do there. It's not fun.

1448
01:00:49,401 --> 01:00:52,100
No one's buying that anymore since 2022.

1449
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:54,370
We all saw you drink six bottles in Gapyeong.

1450
01:00:54,371 --> 01:00:55,440
Everyone knows you're obsessed...

1451
01:00:55,441 --> 01:00:56,617
- It wasn't six bottles. - with soju.

1452
01:00:56,641 --> 01:00:58,940
There's nothing for me to do there.

1453
01:00:58,941 --> 01:01:01,117
- I guess I can look around. - Would you like to stay home, then?

1454
01:01:01,141 --> 01:01:03,041
No. Come on.

1455
01:01:03,141 --> 01:01:04,311
She said, "Come on."

1456
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:07,350
- This is going to be fun. - This is going to be fun.

1457
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:08,351
(Yu Jin is actually very excited.)

1458
01:01:08,352 --> 01:01:10,320
Where's the seat belt?

1459
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:13,290
(Where is this place that is stacked with wine?)

1460
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:16,591
We don't plan on getting drunk, but the point of visiting...

1461
01:01:16,891 --> 01:01:19,161
a winery is going on a vineyard tour.

1462
01:01:19,491 --> 01:01:22,161
We're going to taste the wines that are produced there.

1463
01:01:22,801 --> 01:01:23,860
That's insane.

1464
01:01:23,861 --> 01:01:25,971
(Portugal is not only famous for their Port wine, )

1465
01:01:26,171 --> 01:01:29,371
(but it was the world's number one per capita wine consumer in 2023.)

1466
01:01:29,641 --> 01:01:32,610
(That's why they're going on a winery tour.)

1467
01:01:32,611 --> 01:01:34,370
I wonder what Yu Jin, Mimi,

1468
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:36,131
and Young Ji were like in elementary school.

1469
01:01:36,211 --> 01:01:37,581
- In elementary school, - Yes.

1470
01:01:38,151 --> 01:01:40,911
I was a smart, insect-loving student.

1471
01:01:40,951 --> 01:01:43,020
(Back when she was a young Fabre)

1472
01:01:43,021 --> 01:01:44,081
I can picture that.

1473
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:46,850
Mimi, what were you like in elementary school?

1474
01:01:46,851 --> 01:01:48,261
I was the same back then.

1475
01:01:48,561 --> 01:01:50,120
I feel like Mimi...

1476
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:52,061
would have just had a younger face.

1477
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,961
In elementary school, I liked to draw.

1478
01:01:54,601 --> 01:01:56,330
- Right, you're good at drawing. - Yes, Mimi...

1479
01:01:56,331 --> 01:01:58,371
drew the design on our T-shirt.

1480
01:01:58,531 --> 01:02:01,000
I had drawn my own comic book.

1481
01:02:01,001 --> 01:02:02,001
(I see.)

1482
01:02:02,002 --> 01:02:03,600
So my classmates took turns reading it.

1483
01:02:03,601 --> 01:02:04,611
Goodness.

1484
01:02:05,011 --> 01:02:07,871
You might end up making webtoons like Kian84.

1485
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:10,110
I was a member of the jump rope club.

1486
01:02:10,111 --> 01:02:11,610
So during lunchtime at school,

1487
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:12,650
I did team jump rope...

1488
01:02:12,651 --> 01:02:13,651
- I know what you mean. - with those long skipping ropes.

1489
01:02:13,651 --> 01:02:14,651
Gosh.

1490
01:02:14,652 --> 01:02:19,321
(She's still good at jump rope.)

1491
01:02:19,591 --> 01:02:21,090
Back then, I liked jumping over the vaulting box.

1492
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:23,161
- Were you good? - Yes, I loved it.

1493
01:02:23,361 --> 01:02:24,790
Liking jumping over the vaulting box is funny.

1494
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:26,530
(They can't picture Eun Ji jumping over the vaulting box.)

1495
01:02:26,531 --> 01:02:29,360
- That's cute. - You know the machine with...

1496
01:02:29,361 --> 01:02:31,270
white chalk powder used to draw lines on the field at school?

1497
01:02:31,271 --> 01:02:32,707
- I know what you're talking about. - That's funny.

1498
01:02:32,731 --> 01:02:35,200
- That's so specific. - Not anyone could use those.

1499
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:36,870
- No, not anyone was allowed. - Right.

1500
01:02:36,871 --> 01:02:38,440
- Only students with authority. - Eun Ji...

1501
01:02:38,441 --> 01:02:39,840
liking that in elementary school...

1502
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:40,870
is so funny.

1503
01:02:40,871 --> 01:02:42,587
- Isn't it so funny? - And jumping over the vaulting box.

1504
01:02:42,611 --> 01:02:44,610
I think this is the winery.

1505
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:46,291
It looks like we've arrived at the winery.

1506
01:02:46,381 --> 01:02:47,510
Yes, this is it.

1507
01:02:47,511 --> 01:02:48,980
(Today, the E-caders are visiting...)

1508
01:02:48,981 --> 01:02:50,580
Are all of these grape vines?

1509
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:51,891
They are.

1510
01:02:52,091 --> 01:02:53,320
Mimi, look at that.

1511
01:02:53,321 --> 01:02:54,590
(There are endless rows of grapevines.)

1512
01:02:54,591 --> 01:02:55,691
It's beautiful.

1513
01:02:57,361 --> 01:03:00,261
(A charming, picture-perfect winery)

1514
01:03:00,691 --> 01:03:03,901
(It's a bit cozier compared to large-scale wineries, )

1515
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:08,671
(but it's still well-equipped with everything.)

1516
01:03:08,841 --> 01:03:11,610
At the moment, the grapevines are sleeping.

1517
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:13,040
They have to get up now.

1518
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:15,040
The grapes will be harvested in August. They're sleeping now.

1519
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,041
(They're not fully grown in yet, )

1520
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:20,611
(but this is how lush they get in August.)

1521
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:23,051
(Fresh grapes are gathered...)

1522
01:03:23,451 --> 01:03:25,521
(and aged in oak barrels over an extended period.)

1523
01:03:25,851 --> 01:03:29,591
(And that's how wine is made!)

1524
01:03:30,321 --> 01:03:32,591
Can we taste the wines?

1525
01:03:33,131 --> 01:03:35,261
Can we taste them?

1526
01:03:36,231 --> 01:03:38,130
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1527
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:39,801
Gosh, it's white wine.

1528
01:03:40,001 --> 01:03:41,801
You're supposed to do this, right?

1529
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:44,770
- You've seen it somewhere, right? - Right.

1530
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:45,771
I saw people do this too.

1531
01:03:45,772 --> 01:03:47,441
I'm so excited.

1532
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:49,580
(They immediately learn how to say "cheers" in Portuguese.)

1533
01:03:49,581 --> 01:03:50,710
One, two, three.

1534
01:03:50,711 --> 01:03:52,311
- Saude! - Saude!

1535
01:03:53,051 --> 01:03:54,750
(Sniffing)

1536
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:56,181
It smells amazing.

1537
01:03:56,651 --> 01:03:59,020
(Young Ji takes a sip.)

1538
01:03:59,021 --> 01:04:01,151
(Yu Jin takes a sip!)

1539
01:04:02,591 --> 01:04:04,391
Delicious. I like it.

1540
01:04:05,661 --> 01:04:08,031
(She's deeply moved by the flavor.)

1541
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:09,400
(Mimi, a non-drinker, finds Eun Ji quite fascinating.)

1542
01:04:09,401 --> 01:04:10,800
Does it suit your style?

1543
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:13,131
Check out the label on the bottle.

1544
01:04:13,731 --> 01:04:15,200
There's something unique about it.

1545
01:04:15,201 --> 01:04:16,321
There's a drawing of a palm.

1546
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:17,901
Here's a quiz for you.

1547
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:22,581
The winery family's trait is reflected on the label.

1548
01:04:22,641 --> 01:04:23,680
- What do you think it is? - Let me see.

1549
01:04:23,681 --> 01:04:24,681
- Eun Ji. - Eun Ji.

1550
01:04:24,682 --> 01:04:27,911
The palm lines of everyone in the family are said to bring wealth.

1551
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:30,581
- That was close. - Mimi.

1552
01:04:30,681 --> 01:04:32,221
They all have long life lines.

1553
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:33,990
She said "Long life lines."

1554
01:04:33,991 --> 01:04:35,321
It's not about palm lines.

1555
01:04:35,761 --> 01:04:36,921
- Young Ji. - Young Ji.

1556
01:04:37,021 --> 01:04:39,631
The fingerprints belong to the person who first made this wine.

1557
01:04:39,831 --> 01:04:41,331
(She was partially correct.)

1558
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:42,460
You're close.

1559
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,901
- But wrong. The characteristic... - Its characteristic is...

1560
01:04:45,031 --> 01:04:47,301
- Can you give us another clue? - Another one?

1561
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:51,411
They say that many people like this run in the family.

1562
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:53,541
Many people like this in the family?

1563
01:04:53,711 --> 01:04:55,611
Yu Jin! Longevity runs in the family.

1564
01:04:56,311 --> 01:04:58,711
Wrong. Try holding the bottle with your hand over the label.

1565
01:04:59,381 --> 01:05:02,380
(Over the hand shape printed on the label, )

1566
01:05:02,381 --> 01:05:04,821
(wrap your hand around the wine bottle.)

1567
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:06,620
Being left handed runs in the family.

1568
01:05:06,621 --> 01:05:10,021
(Being left handed runs in the family.)

1569
01:05:10,091 --> 01:05:11,161
You're smart.

1570
01:05:11,961 --> 01:05:14,631
- I got goosebumps. - You got it right.

1571
01:05:14,831 --> 01:05:17,261
- That's so special. - Turns out this family has been...

1572
01:05:17,401 --> 01:05:18,930
left-handed for generations.

1573
01:05:18,931 --> 01:05:21,500
- That's really special. - So they made the label like that.

1574
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:22,841
They must be smart.

1575
01:05:22,971 --> 01:05:24,341
- That's unique. - The red...

1576
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:26,811
(Today, right next to the winery building, )

1577
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:29,711
(on a bright green lawn, )

1578
01:05:30,781 --> 01:05:34,210
(we'll be playing games perfect for a picnic...)

1579
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:36,351
(with left-handed wine.)

1580
01:05:36,451 --> 01:05:37,650
- Today, - It goes well together.

1581
01:05:37,651 --> 01:05:38,950
The weather is really nice.

1582
01:05:38,951 --> 01:05:40,050
- It's so nice. - So, we came on a picnic.

1583
01:05:40,051 --> 01:05:42,290
- I love it. - Picnic.

1584
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:44,521
This one is picnic-themed.

1585
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:48,160
In college, our writer Woo Jung used to play this on school trips.

1586
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:49,200
- A bunch of retro games. - Retro games.

1587
01:05:49,201 --> 01:05:50,901
- That sounds like fun. - Amazing.

1588
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:52,830
- B.C. games. - Seriously.

1589
01:05:52,831 --> 01:05:53,971
Back in the B.C. era.

1590
01:05:55,101 --> 01:05:56,141
(Shock!)

1591
01:05:56,441 --> 01:05:58,670
(We prepared throwback games...)

1592
01:05:58,671 --> 01:06:01,241
(that ruled the '90s.)

1593
01:06:01,341 --> 01:06:03,341
- Pong dang. - Pong dang.

1594
01:06:03,481 --> 01:06:04,680
- Ho! - Ppang!

1595
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:06,111
- Jjin! - Ppang!

1596
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:08,451
(Also drinking games trending these days!)

1597
01:06:09,151 --> 01:06:10,680
(We have a variety of games lined up.)

1598
01:06:10,681 --> 01:06:12,491
- That's a big headache. - Is it me?

1599
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:16,391
We have to keep it fun. Roll, roll, roll book.

1600
01:06:17,361 --> 01:06:19,861
(The game combo is coming.)

1601
01:06:20,091 --> 01:06:22,100
- That's great. - B.C. games.

1602
01:06:22,101 --> 01:06:23,260
- Ancient games. - B.C. games.

1603
01:06:23,261 --> 01:06:25,200
First, let's check out today's dish.

1604
01:06:25,201 --> 01:06:27,630
Why don't you reveal the dish? Please open it.

1605
01:06:27,631 --> 01:06:30,001
(So, what's the dish for today's picnic game?)

1606
01:06:30,101 --> 01:06:31,910
- Ta-da! - Oh, my word!

1607
01:06:31,911 --> 01:06:34,570
- I want to eat gimbap. - I have to eat it.

1608
01:06:34,571 --> 01:06:38,981
(Bulgogi gimbap)

1609
01:06:39,181 --> 01:06:40,910
- I want to eat it so much. - I have to eat it.

1610
01:06:40,911 --> 01:06:42,251
- Goodness. - We have to eat it.

1611
01:06:42,551 --> 01:06:44,081
I really missed it.

1612
01:06:44,621 --> 01:06:46,620
- Can we also drink the wine? - Yes, you can.

1613
01:06:46,621 --> 01:06:47,951
There's wine behind you.

1614
01:06:48,491 --> 01:06:50,620
Oh, the left-handed wine.

1615
01:06:50,621 --> 01:06:53,090
Shall we pour some wine?

1616
01:06:53,091 --> 01:06:54,851
- Okay! - Since we've come all the way here.

1617
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:55,961
Sounds good.

1618
01:06:56,201 --> 01:06:57,560
Mimi, do you want me to pour you some water?

1619
01:06:57,561 --> 01:06:58,771
That would be great.

1620
01:06:59,031 --> 01:07:00,530
Can't we just drink the wine? Isn't it all-you-can-drink?

1621
01:07:00,531 --> 01:07:03,141
- No, not possible. - We can't?

1622
01:07:03,471 --> 01:07:04,770
It's a game college students play a lot these days.

1623
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:06,347
- Oh, okay. - College students these days?

1624
01:07:06,371 --> 01:07:08,911
Hoppang Jjinppang Big Bread.

1625
01:07:09,681 --> 01:07:10,681
- You don't know it? - What?

1626
01:07:10,682 --> 01:07:11,750
- We don't know. - Tell us.

1627
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:13,310
This is Hoppang Jjinppang Big Bread Game.

1628
01:07:13,311 --> 01:07:15,281
(Hoppang Jjinppang Big Bread Game)

1629
01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:16,521
Ho.

1630
01:07:16,551 --> 01:07:18,651
(When someone shouts "Ho,")

1631
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:20,797
- Eun Ji, you have to say "Ppang." - Ppang.

1632
01:07:20,821 --> 01:07:22,721
(the person pointed at has to shout "Ppang.")

1633
01:07:23,021 --> 01:07:24,021
Jjin!

1634
01:07:24,022 --> 01:07:25,761
(When someone shouts "Jjin,")

1635
01:07:26,061 --> 01:07:27,061
- Ppang! - Ppang

1636
01:07:27,062 --> 01:07:29,177
(the people on either side of the one pointed at shouts "Ppang!")

1637
01:07:29,201 --> 01:07:30,201
Big!

1638
01:07:30,202 --> 01:07:31,501
(When someone shouts "Big,")

1639
01:07:31,831 --> 01:07:32,831
- Ppang! - Ppang!

1640
01:07:33,231 --> 01:07:35,517
(everyone except the person pointed at has to shout "Ppang!")

1641
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:37,300
(Hoppang: Person who gets pointed at Jjinppang: Those on either side...)

1642
01:07:37,301 --> 01:07:39,741
(of the person pointed at, Big Bread: Everyone else)

1643
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:43,110
- Take it slow. - Slowly.

1644
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:45,481
- When someone gets it wrong... - One will get it wrong.

1645
01:07:45,881 --> 01:07:47,080
- When someone gets it wrong, - The rest...

1646
01:07:47,081 --> 01:07:48,550
- the rest... - Great.

1647
01:07:48,551 --> 01:07:49,650
- gets to eat. - Looks tasty.

1648
01:07:49,651 --> 01:07:51,620
- Whether it's wine or gimbap. - Okay!

1649
01:07:51,621 --> 01:07:52,920
- This sounds fun. - Yes.

1650
01:07:52,921 --> 01:07:53,921
(Full of expectations)

1651
01:07:53,922 --> 01:07:54,990
- Let's start slowly. - Please do an intro.

1652
01:07:54,991 --> 01:07:56,260
- I'll make the intro. - Please make one.

1653
01:07:56,261 --> 01:07:57,420
One, two, three, go.

1654
01:07:57,421 --> 01:07:59,861
- Hoppang jjinppang big bread. - Hoppang jjinppang big bread.

1655
01:07:59,931 --> 01:08:02,001
(Pros: It's easy to pick up and follow.)

1656
01:08:02,361 --> 01:08:04,301
(Cons: It's rather long.)

1657
01:08:04,361 --> 01:08:06,907
- Hoppang jjinppang big bread. Ho! - Hoppang jjinppang big bread. Ho!

1658
01:08:06,931 --> 01:08:07,970
- Hoppang! - No.

1659
01:08:07,971 --> 01:08:09,701
- That's wrong. - Not that.

1660
01:08:09,741 --> 01:08:10,741
Hoppang!

1661
01:08:10,742 --> 01:08:12,941
(When you're pointing you must only say "Ho.")

1662
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:14,041
Hoppang!

1663
01:08:14,042 --> 01:08:15,981
- You can only say "Ho." - That's wrong.

1664
01:08:16,011 --> 01:08:19,011
(The one who messed up has to stay still.)

1665
01:08:19,481 --> 01:08:22,020
(The others start enjoying the food.)

1666
01:08:22,021 --> 01:08:24,181
- Eun Ji. - It's the same.

1667
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:28,791
(So good!)

1668
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:32,431
(Three of them are filling their mouths with gimbap.)

1669
01:08:32,661 --> 01:08:33,691
This is good.

1670
01:08:34,131 --> 01:08:36,211
I haven't had gimbap for so long. It tastes so good.

1671
01:08:37,101 --> 01:08:38,400
- Young Ji. - It's good, isn't it?

1672
01:08:38,401 --> 01:08:40,901
You practiced so much, but why did you shout "Hoppang?"

1673
01:08:41,131 --> 01:08:42,440
- It was the intro. - Intro?

1674
01:08:42,441 --> 01:08:43,471
Intro?

1675
01:08:43,571 --> 01:08:45,740
- Does it just pop into your head? - Yes, it does.

1676
01:08:45,741 --> 01:08:48,170
Give me a word, and I can make up something right away!

1677
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:49,280
- Give you a word? - Yes.

1678
01:08:49,281 --> 01:08:50,841
Na Yeong Seok!

1679
01:08:50,881 --> 01:08:53,481
I'm Yeong Seok!

1680
01:08:54,751 --> 01:08:56,180
(Done in 0.1 seconds)

1681
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:58,691
- I can do it instantly. - Amazing!

1682
01:08:59,351 --> 01:09:01,091
- Can we start again? - Okay.

1683
01:09:01,151 --> 01:09:02,460
In 1, 2, 3.

1684
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:05,860
- Hoppang jjinppang big bread. - Hoppang jjinppang big bread.

1685
01:09:05,861 --> 01:09:06,941
- Ho, ho. ho! - Ho, ho, ho!

1686
01:09:07,061 --> 01:09:08,291
- Ho! - Ppang!

1687
01:09:08,831 --> 01:09:10,301
- Jjin! - Ppang!

1688
01:09:11,261 --> 01:09:12,671
- Big! - Ppang!

1689
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:13,831
- Got you! - Mimi.

1690
01:09:14,831 --> 01:09:15,840
(Flinching)

1691
01:09:15,841 --> 01:09:18,047
(Big: Everyone except the one pointed at must shout "Ppang.")

1692
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,910
(They start eating without hesitation.)

1693
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:21,740
This tastes better the more you chew.

1694
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:24,211
(Gimbap goes right into their mouths.)

1695
01:09:24,741 --> 01:09:27,081
(She was very hungry after running.)

1696
01:09:30,181 --> 01:09:31,551
(Good)

1697
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:33,220
- This is good. - Yes.

1698
01:09:33,221 --> 01:09:35,161
- Gimbap is so tasty. - I know.

1699
01:09:35,321 --> 01:09:36,621
- Are you ready now? - Yes.

1700
01:09:37,361 --> 01:09:38,801
Let's go for a long round this time!

1701
01:09:39,131 --> 01:09:41,091
(Very serious)

1702
01:09:41,191 --> 01:09:43,060
Eun Ji, you have to start.

1703
01:09:43,061 --> 01:09:44,130
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1704
01:09:44,131 --> 01:09:47,070
- Hoppang jjinppang big bread. - Hoppang jjinppang big bread.

1705
01:09:47,071 --> 01:09:48,151
- Ho, ho, ho. - Ho, ho, ho.

1706
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:50,341
- Jjin! - Ppang!

1707
01:09:51,641 --> 01:09:53,111
- Big! - Ppang!

1708
01:09:53,341 --> 01:09:54,341
(Intense)

1709
01:09:54,342 --> 01:09:55,541
Ho! Ppang!

1710
01:09:55,711 --> 01:09:57,041
- Jjin! - Ppang!

1711
01:09:57,181 --> 01:09:59,210
(She tries the self-pointing strategy.)

1712
01:09:59,211 --> 01:10:00,250
- Ppang. - They're good.

1713
01:10:00,251 --> 01:10:01,481
- Big. - Ppang!

1714
01:10:01,651 --> 01:10:02,981
- Ho! - Ppang!

1715
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:04,751
- Big. - Ppang!

1716
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:06,151
(Malfunctioning)

1717
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:07,291
Ppang!

1718
01:10:09,191 --> 01:10:12,331
(Ppang!)

1719
01:10:12,661 --> 01:10:14,791
(Laughing)

1720
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:17,961
(Humph)

1721
01:10:18,731 --> 01:10:20,430
(Mimi and Yu Jin are totally lost in the food.)

1722
01:10:20,431 --> 01:10:21,900
It would be fun if we do it a little faster.

1723
01:10:21,901 --> 01:10:24,070
I think this will be so much fun when we get the hang of it.

1724
01:10:24,071 --> 01:10:25,440
We can do it like ho, ppang, jjin, ppang!

1725
01:10:25,441 --> 01:10:27,570
- Yes, that would be fun. - Like ppang, ppang, ppang.

1726
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:28,610
- That's right. - Let's try that.

1727
01:10:28,611 --> 01:10:30,881
- Let's try that. - Let's do it. I'll focus real hard.

1728
01:10:31,381 --> 01:10:33,981
This game totally clashes with the whole winery vibe.

1729
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,980
Combining gimbap and wine itself is totally meant for Gen Zs.

1730
01:10:37,981 --> 01:10:39,890
- But surprisingly, it works! - I needed it to wash it down.

1731
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:40,891
Korean food and wine go well together.

1732
01:10:40,891 --> 01:10:41,891
They say Korean food and wine go well together.

1733
01:10:41,892 --> 01:10:43,121
- That's true. - Really?

1734
01:10:43,421 --> 01:10:45,191
- Let's start. You okay? - Start.

1735
01:10:45,691 --> 01:10:46,860
In 1, 2, 3.

1736
01:10:46,861 --> 01:10:50,060
- Hoppang jjinppang big bread. - Hoppang jjinppang big bread.

1737
01:10:50,061 --> 01:10:51,061
- Ho, ho, ho. - Ho, ho, ho.

1738
01:10:51,062 --> 01:10:53,077
- Who's going first? It's me. - Let's make it fast.

1739
01:10:53,101 --> 01:10:54,301
- Ho. - Ppang!

1740
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:55,701
- Jjin! - Ppang!

1741
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:57,041
(Flinching)

1742
01:10:57,601 --> 01:10:58,710
Big!

1743
01:10:58,711 --> 01:10:59,740
- Ppang! - Ppang!

1744
01:10:59,741 --> 01:11:00,741
(Laughing)

1745
01:11:00,742 --> 01:11:02,441
(It's me.)

1746
01:11:02,981 --> 01:11:04,480
You can't handle it.

1747
01:11:04,481 --> 01:11:05,551
(Eun Ji is crushed.)

1748
01:11:06,851 --> 01:11:09,021
(She quickly eats one.)

1749
01:11:10,451 --> 01:11:14,050
(Mimi takes a bite of gimbap.)

1750
01:11:14,051 --> 01:11:16,961
(Yu Jin takes a sip of wine.)

1751
01:11:17,891 --> 01:11:20,361
(There's no time to eat the snack.)

1752
01:11:20,561 --> 01:11:23,500
But I think you can do this.

1753
01:11:23,501 --> 01:11:25,900
- What is it? - You can do Roll Book, can't you?

1754
01:11:25,901 --> 01:11:28,030
- What? - Roll book, roll book.

1755
01:11:28,031 --> 01:11:29,447
- I've heard that a lot. - What is it?

1756
01:11:29,471 --> 01:11:31,910
While pointing at someone, you have to say someone else's name.

1757
01:11:31,911 --> 01:11:33,470
You point at Eun Ji and call out Young Ji.

1758
01:11:33,471 --> 01:11:34,671
- Yes. - Young Ji says, "Yes."

1759
01:11:34,941 --> 01:11:36,881
(Roll Book Game)

1760
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:38,441
Young Ji!

1761
01:11:38,881 --> 01:11:39,911
Young Ji!

1762
01:11:41,411 --> 01:11:43,881
(When you call out Young Ji and point at someone else, )

1763
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:45,251
Yes!

1764
01:11:45,451 --> 01:11:47,721
(Young Ji has to answer.)

1765
01:11:48,151 --> 01:11:49,620
The person who gets called goes next, right?

1766
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:50,961
Yes, the one who is called.

1767
01:11:53,361 --> 01:11:55,130
I think we should start with your own names first.

1768
01:11:55,131 --> 01:11:56,360
- Let's do it. - With your own names.

1769
01:11:56,361 --> 01:11:59,001
I want you to make our own Roll Book.

1770
01:11:59,031 --> 01:12:00,801
(She's ready to go.)

1771
01:12:01,771 --> 01:12:03,540
- Hey, Mimi. - Yes.

1772
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:04,740
- Eun Ji. - Yes.

1773
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:07,011
Yu Jin, roll, roll, roll, roll book.

1774
01:12:07,941 --> 01:12:09,441
(What is that?)

1775
01:12:09,511 --> 01:12:11,740
- When do we have time to do this? - Everyone should get up.

1776
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:13,410
- Everyone should get up? - When do we do this?

1777
01:12:13,411 --> 01:12:14,650
Eun Ji!

1778
01:12:14,651 --> 01:12:16,180
- It's Mimi, Eun Ji, Yu Jin, right? - With Mimi.

1779
01:12:16,181 --> 01:12:17,250
Until Young Ji.

1780
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:18,890
- Yeong Seok has to do it. - Which one?

1781
01:12:18,891 --> 01:12:20,331
You have to call out each one of us.

1782
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:21,891
In 1, 2, 3.

1783
01:12:22,391 --> 01:12:23,791
- Mimi. - Yes!

1784
01:12:23,921 --> 01:12:25,261
- Eun Ji! - Yes!

1785
01:12:25,361 --> 01:12:26,730
- Yu Jin. - Yes!

1786
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:27,890
- Young Ji. - Yes.

1787
01:12:27,891 --> 01:12:30,160
- Roll, roll, roll, roll book. - Roll, roll, roll, roll book.

1788
01:12:30,161 --> 01:12:31,301
- Young Ji. - Yes.

1789
01:12:31,601 --> 01:12:33,001
- Mimi. - Yes!

1790
01:12:33,201 --> 01:12:34,831
- Eun Ji. - Yes!

1791
01:12:35,401 --> 01:12:36,901
- Young Ji. - Yes!

1792
01:12:37,371 --> 01:12:38,571
Well...

1793
01:12:39,371 --> 01:12:40,571
Well...

1794
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:43,581
- Wrong! That's the wrong way. - Eun Ji.

1795
01:12:43,641 --> 01:12:44,680
- Wrong! That's the wrong way. - Wrong.

1796
01:12:44,681 --> 01:12:46,680
This is like Reverse Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1797
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:47,681
It's fun.

1798
01:12:48,251 --> 01:12:50,081
- You've drunk all the wine. - Excuse me.

1799
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:54,191
(She drinks up her wine.)

1800
01:12:54,451 --> 01:12:56,661
(She hasn't made a single mistake so far.)

1801
01:12:57,221 --> 01:12:58,981
(While everyone is relaxed and having fun, )

1802
01:12:59,361 --> 01:13:01,291
(one person is burning with anxiety.)

1803
01:13:01,631 --> 01:13:02,791
Let's do the roll call again.

1804
01:13:02,931 --> 01:13:04,230
- I'm calling out the names. - In 1, 2, 3.

1805
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:06,671
- Roll, roll, roll, roll book. - Roll, roll, roll, roll book.

1806
01:13:07,571 --> 01:13:08,971
- Eun Ji. - Yes!

1807
01:13:09,141 --> 01:13:10,471
- Mimi. - Yes!

1808
01:13:10,871 --> 01:13:12,811
- Eun Ji. - Yes!

1809
01:13:12,911 --> 01:13:13,911
Eun Ji.

1810
01:13:13,912 --> 01:13:14,971
(Loading)

1811
01:13:15,341 --> 01:13:16,411
(Chuckling)

1812
01:13:16,641 --> 01:13:18,141
- Young Ji. - Yes!

1813
01:13:18,611 --> 01:13:20,111
- Yu Jin. - Yes!

1814
01:13:20,281 --> 01:13:21,580
- Mimi. - Yes!

1815
01:13:21,581 --> 01:13:22,981
- Eun Ji. - Yes!

1816
01:13:23,051 --> 01:13:24,521
- Young Ji. - Yes!

1817
01:13:25,521 --> 01:13:26,521
Wrong!

1818
01:13:26,522 --> 01:13:28,250
(She pointed at Young Ji while calling Young Ji.)

1819
01:13:28,251 --> 01:13:29,561
(Zen mode)

1820
01:13:29,921 --> 01:13:31,120
(She eats gimbap right away.)

1821
01:13:31,121 --> 01:13:32,160
You did pretty well though.

1822
01:13:32,161 --> 01:13:34,791
(She also eats gimbap right away.)

1823
01:13:34,991 --> 01:13:37,400
We're not supposed to do it like this.

1824
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:39,731
You've had plenty of practice with your own name, right?

1825
01:13:40,031 --> 01:13:41,271
This is just the basics.

1826
01:13:41,331 --> 01:13:45,201
Now, you switch to the names of your favorite celebrities.

1827
01:13:45,311 --> 01:13:46,631
- Ok Taec Yeon? - Yes, Taec Yeon.

1828
01:13:46,941 --> 01:13:49,881
- You like Benedict Cumberbatch. - Hey, Benedict Cumberbatch.

1829
01:13:50,111 --> 01:13:51,810
(The name, Benedict Cumberbatch, is very long.)

1830
01:13:51,811 --> 01:13:52,950
It's so long.

1831
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:53,980
I want Ro-Da-Ju.

1832
01:13:53,981 --> 01:13:55,150
- Ro-Da-Ju. - Ro-Da-Ju.

1833
01:13:55,151 --> 01:13:56,620
It's Robert Downey Jr.

1834
01:13:56,621 --> 01:13:58,150
- Robert Downey Jr. - Robert Downey Jr.

1835
01:13:58,151 --> 01:13:59,521
Then I am...

1836
01:13:59,691 --> 01:14:00,990
I am Becum.

1837
01:14:00,991 --> 01:14:02,991
- Why? - Short for Benedict Cumberbatch.

1838
01:14:03,091 --> 01:14:05,330
- You mean... - Robert Downey Jr.

1839
01:14:05,331 --> 01:14:06,730
You do that. That's convenient for me.

1840
01:14:06,731 --> 01:14:07,860
- It's inconvenient for you. - Okay.

1841
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:09,330
That's right.

1842
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:12,230
- Mimi is smart. - She's smart.

1843
01:14:12,231 --> 01:14:13,600
She's a smart cookie.

1844
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:15,341
(Vocalization)

1845
01:14:17,641 --> 01:14:19,741
(Vocalization)

1846
01:14:19,941 --> 01:14:22,681
(Even Young Ji couldn't respond.)

1847
01:14:22,811 --> 01:14:23,981
She didn't even drink wine.

1848
01:14:24,641 --> 01:14:25,751
You drank, didn't you?

1849
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:28,151
(This Robert Downey Jr. is innocent.)

1850
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:29,480
Choose from around the world.

1851
01:14:29,481 --> 01:14:31,621
- Then, I'll go with Adele. - Mine is Taec Yeon.

1852
01:14:31,821 --> 01:14:33,490
- Adele! - Adele.

1853
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:35,620
- My son. - Adele.

1854
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:36,790
(Comedian version of Taec Yeon)

1855
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:37,791
Mr. Cha.

1856
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:39,590
Let's start. In 1, 2, 3.

1857
01:14:39,591 --> 01:14:42,031
- Roll, roll, roll, roll book. - Roll, roll, roll, roll book.

1858
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:44,360
- Adele. - Yes.

1859
01:14:44,361 --> 01:14:45,731
Robert Downey Jr.

1860
01:14:47,001 --> 01:14:48,801
- It's you. - Yes. Oh, is it me?

1861
01:14:50,101 --> 01:14:51,501
Robert Downey Jr.

1862
01:14:52,811 --> 01:14:54,571
- It's you. - Yes. Oh, is it me?

1863
01:14:56,911 --> 01:14:59,781
(Even the one who called the name...)

1864
01:15:00,211 --> 01:15:02,721
(and the Avenger's friend didn't realize.)

1865
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:05,220
(They start eating in a ridiculous way.)

1866
01:15:05,221 --> 01:15:07,190
- I knew that would happen. - It's me?

1867
01:15:07,191 --> 01:15:08,651
I just knew that would happen.

1868
01:15:08,761 --> 01:15:10,320
I thought she called you.

1869
01:15:10,321 --> 01:15:11,991
I'm Robert Downey Jr.?

1870
01:15:12,661 --> 01:15:15,261
(She was so confident back then.)

1871
01:15:15,801 --> 01:15:16,831
What was the name?

1872
01:15:17,161 --> 01:15:19,831
(Robert Downey Jr.)

1873
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:22,741
It feels like an old pub to drink and play games.

1874
01:15:24,971 --> 01:15:26,171
It's been such a while.

1875
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:28,540
Let's start. In 1, 2, 3, let's go.

1876
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:30,740
- Roll, roll, roll, roll book. - Roll, roll, roll, roll book.

1877
01:15:30,741 --> 01:15:32,050
(Robert Downey Jr. starts.)

1878
01:15:32,051 --> 01:15:33,680
- Taec Yeon. - Yes.

1879
01:15:33,681 --> 01:15:35,580
- Robert Downey Jr. - Yes.

1880
01:15:35,581 --> 01:15:38,750
- Benedict Cumberbatch. - Yes.

1881
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:39,920
(It's too much.)

1882
01:15:39,921 --> 01:15:41,790
- Robert Downey Jr. - Yes.

1883
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:43,361
- Benedict Cumberbatch. - Yes.

1884
01:15:43,461 --> 01:15:45,731
- Taec Yeon. - Wrong.

1885
01:15:45,831 --> 01:15:48,901
Taec Yeon. You called Taec Yeon, Taec Yeon.

1886
01:15:50,231 --> 01:15:53,331
(The younger ones fill their stomach with gimbap first.)

1887
01:15:53,571 --> 01:15:55,400
(Meanwhile, Eun Ji is...)

1888
01:15:55,401 --> 01:15:56,970
(gulping down wine.)

1889
01:15:56,971 --> 01:15:58,811
Eun Ji, stop drinking.

1890
01:15:59,811 --> 01:16:02,051
- Would you like a refill, ma'am? - That would be great.

1891
01:16:02,741 --> 01:16:05,041
(She brings plenty.)

1892
01:16:06,011 --> 01:16:09,651
(Pouring generously)

1893
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:11,021
They're on their second bottle.

1894
01:16:12,891 --> 01:16:14,921
I think we should stop the game.

1895
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:17,460
- Go. - Roll, roll, roll,

1896
01:16:17,461 --> 01:16:18,490
- Faster. - roll, roll,

1897
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,691
- Roll, roll, roll, roll book. - Faster!

1898
01:16:21,061 --> 01:16:22,501
- Taec Yeon. - Yes.

1899
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:25,431
Benedict Cumberbatch, you are...

1900
01:16:27,371 --> 01:16:28,600
(She carelessly reaches out her hand.)

1901
01:16:28,601 --> 01:16:30,901
(Then, pulls back immediately.)

1902
01:16:31,101 --> 01:16:33,841
(Actually, our eldest girl...)

1903
01:16:33,941 --> 01:16:36,781
(- Apple! - Apple!)

1904
01:16:36,881 --> 01:16:38,211
(Wrong!)

1905
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,910
(She's terrible with new games.)

1906
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:43,420
- Two hairtails. - Hairtail, hairtail.

1907
01:16:43,421 --> 01:16:44,950
- Two herrings. - Herring, herring.

1908
01:16:44,951 --> 01:16:46,550
- Three snappers. - Snapper, snapper, snapper.

1909
01:16:46,551 --> 01:16:48,190
- Three hairtails. - Hairtail, hairtail, hairtail.

1910
01:16:48,191 --> 01:16:50,091
- One mackerel. - Mackerel.

1911
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:54,030
(Now, she's had a couple of glasses of wine.)

1912
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:55,131
She did exactly the same.

1913
01:16:56,501 --> 01:16:57,630
(Noticing)

1914
01:16:57,631 --> 01:16:59,677
- It's so much fun! - Eun Ji, you're a little drunk.

1915
01:16:59,701 --> 01:17:02,941
(She smiles instead of answering.)

1916
01:17:03,101 --> 01:17:05,741
(In the following games...)

1917
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:06,970
(Holding up one hand)

1918
01:17:06,971 --> 01:17:08,041
(Then 2 hands, and 3)

1919
01:17:08,511 --> 01:17:10,280
- No, it's 3. - It's 3.

1920
01:17:10,281 --> 01:17:11,410
I'll do it again.

1921
01:17:11,411 --> 01:17:12,510
(Holding up one hand)

1922
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:13,650
(Holding up two hands)

1923
01:17:13,651 --> 01:17:14,680
(Must hold up three hands)

1924
01:17:14,681 --> 01:17:16,121
- It's three. - Let's skip this one.

1925
01:17:16,151 --> 01:17:17,280
Let's skip this game.

1926
01:17:17,281 --> 01:17:18,281
(For the first time ever, a game is stopped out of frustration.)

1927
01:17:18,282 --> 01:17:19,420
(Playing Animal Kingdom)

1928
01:17:19,421 --> 01:17:20,421
Go.

1929
01:17:20,422 --> 01:17:22,120
- Three mangoes. - Mango, mango, mango.

1930
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:23,921
- Two strawberries. - Strawberry, strawberry.

1931
01:17:23,961 --> 01:17:25,891
- One kiwi. - Kiwi.

1932
01:17:26,661 --> 01:17:28,460
(No matter what they do, she can't do it.)

1933
01:17:28,461 --> 01:17:30,731
- I don't think we should push it. - No.

1934
01:17:32,871 --> 01:17:34,330
These yellow flowers are so pretty too.

1935
01:17:34,331 --> 01:17:37,601
Yes. Portugal as a country really suits us.

1936
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:40,871
(After having a one-on-one with Producer Na, )

1937
01:17:41,071 --> 01:17:42,071
(Eun Ji jumps right into snapping photos.)

1938
01:17:42,072 --> 01:17:44,940
(Laughing)

1939
01:17:44,941 --> 01:17:46,481
Stop for a moment.

1940
01:17:46,881 --> 01:17:48,781
Here, Mimi. Look straight at me.

1941
01:17:48,981 --> 01:17:51,850
Three... Pull your tongue back in.

1942
01:17:51,851 --> 01:17:53,920
Okay.

1943
01:17:53,921 --> 01:17:56,021
Okay.

1944
01:17:56,621 --> 01:17:59,030
(They also take a group photo.)

1945
01:17:59,031 --> 01:18:00,031
I'm Cha Moo Hyeok.

1946
01:18:01,591 --> 01:18:02,801
I love you, Moo Hyeok.

1947
01:18:04,161 --> 01:18:05,161
Moo Hyeok.

1948
01:18:05,162 --> 01:18:07,531
I want to say Moo Hyeok's lines, but he has no lines.

1949
01:18:08,471 --> 01:18:09,800
It's so pretty.

1950
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:12,270
It is, isn't it? I love big trees like this.

1951
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:13,340
The tree is beautiful.

1952
01:18:13,341 --> 01:18:16,080
(They have a nice time at the winery.)

1953
01:18:16,081 --> 01:18:17,810
(They return to their accommodations.)

1954
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:20,011
- Thanks for today. - Hand boggie boggie

1955
01:18:20,151 --> 01:18:23,151
- Are you tired? - I'm not tired.

1956
01:18:23,251 --> 01:18:24,950
Oh, that's hot. Oh, it's prickly.

1957
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:26,051
Be careful.

1958
01:18:26,891 --> 01:18:28,050
Yu Jin, are you going to watch "I'm Sorry, I Love You?"

1959
01:18:28,051 --> 01:18:29,590
- Of course. - Let's watch it.

1960
01:18:29,591 --> 01:18:31,190
- Let's watch it. - We have to watch it.

1961
01:18:31,191 --> 01:18:33,061
- With a glass of wine. - I'd like that.

1962
01:18:33,361 --> 01:18:35,561
Binge watch "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

1963
01:18:37,331 --> 01:18:40,831
(Tired from the outing, they're recharging with the drama.)

1964
01:18:41,331 --> 01:18:43,071
Eun Ji!

1965
01:18:43,801 --> 01:18:46,211
(They're definitely recharging.)

1966
01:18:46,571 --> 01:18:50,311
(Meanwhile, since Mimi didn't drink any wine, )

1967
01:18:50,641 --> 01:18:51,641
Okay.

1968
01:18:51,642 --> 01:18:52,651
(she gets on a bicycle.)

1969
01:18:52,751 --> 01:18:55,621
(She decides to go to the cliff she didn't see in the morning.)

1970
01:18:56,651 --> 01:18:59,621
This is so refreshing.

1971
01:19:02,891 --> 01:19:04,760
Amazing. This is insane.

1972
01:19:04,761 --> 01:19:06,241
(She rides her bike along the beach.)

1973
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:09,031
Hello!

1974
01:19:13,731 --> 01:19:17,101
(She's really enjoying herself.)

1975
01:19:17,741 --> 01:19:20,610
This is insane!

1976
01:19:20,611 --> 01:19:21,710
(The sea is slowly getting closer.)

1977
01:19:21,711 --> 01:19:23,380
(It's the same seagull that cried even in the morning.)

1978
01:19:23,381 --> 01:19:26,350
My friend, the seagull.

1979
01:19:26,351 --> 01:19:27,751
(Main identity: Meme lover)

1980
01:19:27,851 --> 01:19:29,681
So this is the place!

1981
01:19:30,621 --> 01:19:32,621
(Before long, they arrive at the viewpoint.)

1982
01:19:32,721 --> 01:19:34,251
(She parks her bike.)

1983
01:19:38,891 --> 01:19:39,991
(Exclaiming)

1984
01:19:42,961 --> 01:19:44,300
This is amazing!

1985
01:19:44,301 --> 01:19:46,571
(The shimmering blue sea sways beneath golden cliffs.)

1986
01:19:46,671 --> 01:19:49,191
(This is the photo spot that Young Ji and Yu Jin also visited.)

1987
01:19:50,501 --> 01:19:53,071
(This beach is mine now.)

1988
01:19:53,641 --> 01:19:55,411
(Vocalization)

1989
01:20:00,581 --> 01:20:01,581
Done!

1990
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:03,461
Let's do this for 20 more years.

1991
01:20:04,381 --> 01:20:05,951
Bye!

1992
01:20:07,021 --> 01:20:08,890
This is sort of an image Eun Ji loves.

1993
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:09,997
(Earth Arcade, Mimi, Eun Ji, Yu Jin, Young Ji, 20 years)

1994
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:11,421
(Meanwhile...)

1995
01:20:11,621 --> 01:20:15,461
(Cha Moo Hyeok is a pervert.)

1996
01:20:16,101 --> 01:20:18,761
(Others are also watching the scene with writing in the sand.)

1997
01:20:19,671 --> 01:20:21,201
This is my favorite scene.

1998
01:20:21,371 --> 01:20:23,451
(All the scenes in the drama are Eun Ji's favorite.)

1999
01:20:24,141 --> 01:20:26,641
(Sobbing)

2000
01:20:27,611 --> 01:20:29,541
This is so sad.

2001
01:20:30,011 --> 01:20:32,451
("I'm Sorry, I Love You" fanatics are crying their eyes out.)

2002
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:34,811
Mr. Director!

2003
01:20:34,911 --> 01:20:35,920
(Panting)

2004
01:20:35,921 --> 01:20:37,121
I made it!

2005
01:20:37,551 --> 01:20:38,751
This is hard work.

2006
01:20:39,421 --> 01:20:40,651
But I feel great.

2007
01:20:41,651 --> 01:20:44,261
(Mimi is returning to the accommodations.)

2008
01:20:45,491 --> 01:20:46,661
(Sighing)

2009
01:20:48,531 --> 01:20:49,960
(She parks the bike.)

2010
01:20:49,961 --> 01:20:51,131
(Sighing)

2011
01:20:51,261 --> 01:20:52,401
Mission accomplished.

2012
01:20:54,631 --> 01:20:57,171
(Mimi heads for the 2nd floor.)

2013
01:20:57,501 --> 01:20:59,110
(Mimi enters.)

2014
01:20:59,111 --> 01:21:00,810
(Others are still watching the drama.)

2015
01:21:00,811 --> 01:21:02,310
It's the last episode.

2016
01:21:02,311 --> 01:21:04,041
(Last episode?)

2017
01:21:04,141 --> 01:21:06,611
(She sits, as if in a trance.)

2018
01:21:06,981 --> 01:21:08,911
(5 minutes later...)

2019
01:21:16,791 --> 01:21:18,721
(Sighing)

2020
01:21:24,661 --> 01:21:25,700
Oh, no.

2021
01:21:25,701 --> 01:21:28,331
(On pause)

2022
01:21:29,771 --> 01:21:31,941
No! Don't die, Moo Hyeok.

2023
01:21:32,511 --> 01:21:35,671
(She feels terrible.)

2024
01:21:36,741 --> 01:21:38,941
This drama is legendary.

2025
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:41,011
It's a legendary drama.

2026
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:46,321
(She's exhausted after crying so much.)

2027
01:21:46,491 --> 01:21:48,750
- Oh, my. - It's a legendary drama.

2028
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:51,231
(During break time we watched all of "I'm Sorry, I Love You.")

2029
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:54,291
- I'll miss this. - I know.

2030
01:21:54,861 --> 01:21:57,101
There's no wake-up mission tomorrow.

2031
01:21:57,401 --> 01:21:58,660
- Yes. - Instead of a wake-up mission,

2032
01:21:58,661 --> 01:22:01,370
I was thinking of trying something new!

2033
01:22:01,371 --> 01:22:02,400
- Okay. - What is it?

2034
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:03,801
Hosted by Eun Ji,

2035
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:06,371
we'll do "Lee Eun Ji's Love Square."

2036
01:22:08,141 --> 01:22:10,101
(To tell you something about our E-cade girls...)

2037
01:22:10,641 --> 01:22:12,880
(What do you think love is?)

2038
01:22:12,881 --> 01:22:16,221
(I think what IU said is true.)

2039
01:22:16,521 --> 01:22:18,257
(I think hoping the other person slept well is love.)

2040
01:22:18,281 --> 01:22:19,420
What a culture shock!

2041
01:22:19,421 --> 01:22:22,860
(They love to talk about love.)

2042
01:22:22,861 --> 01:22:25,831
(Shall we kiss first?)

2043
01:22:25,931 --> 01:22:28,161
(That's wrong.)

2044
01:22:28,891 --> 01:22:30,861
(You shouldn't kiss first.)

2045
01:22:31,031 --> 01:22:32,300
(Should we hold hands first?)

2046
01:22:32,301 --> 01:22:33,301
(Rubbing nose)

2047
01:22:33,401 --> 01:22:35,000
(Come on.)

2048
01:22:35,001 --> 01:22:36,001
(You should know better!)

2049
01:22:36,741 --> 01:22:38,801
(I'm 32 years old.)

2050
01:22:38,901 --> 01:22:41,910
(They also love to talk about dating.)

2051
01:22:41,911 --> 01:22:44,181
The staff will share their love problems.

2052
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:47,350
And you three will give them the solution.

2053
01:22:47,351 --> 01:22:48,450
As a solution panelist?

2054
01:22:48,451 --> 01:22:49,621
- Us? - Yes.

2055
01:22:49,721 --> 01:22:52,650
- Eun Ji will act as the MC. - Okay.

2056
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:53,867
- I like that. - And three of you...

2057
01:22:53,891 --> 01:22:57,521
I heard kids these days start dating without asking to go steady.

2058
01:22:57,621 --> 01:22:59,120
I honestly don't get that at all.

2059
01:22:59,121 --> 01:23:01,391
I think in that sense, I'm kind of a Confucian girl.

2060
01:23:01,831 --> 01:23:02,930
- I agree. - I think so.

2061
01:23:02,931 --> 01:23:05,460
- I'm a Confucian girl. - Yes, she's a bit like that.

2062
01:23:05,461 --> 01:23:07,147
I don't like it when a guy doesn't actually say he wants to date me.

2063
01:23:07,171 --> 01:23:10,141
Do you have a favorite love quote?

2064
01:23:11,101 --> 01:23:12,140
They're all the same!

2065
01:23:12,141 --> 01:23:14,071
("They're all the same." by Young Ji)

2066
01:23:14,971 --> 01:23:16,811
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2067
01:23:17,581 --> 01:23:19,351
I think this will be so much fun.

2068
01:23:20,011 --> 01:23:21,051
I'm looking forward to it.

2069
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:23,511
Should we set it up like we're sitting around chatting?

2070
01:23:24,021 --> 01:23:25,751
Doesn't it feel like a counseling center?

2071
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:29,121
(They're creating a cozy vibe just right for chatting.)

2072
01:23:29,361 --> 01:23:31,491
("Love Square" is ready to go.)

2073
01:23:32,121 --> 01:23:34,190
(Today's MC has come down first.)

2074
01:23:34,191 --> 01:23:35,791
I prepared the background music too.

2075
01:23:36,201 --> 01:23:37,530
- It's working. - It is?

2076
01:23:37,531 --> 01:23:39,061
Yes. I'm a bit nervous.

2077
01:23:40,071 --> 01:23:41,571
I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do it.

2078
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,501
- Are we set to go, Chang Dae? - Yes, we are.

2079
01:23:45,971 --> 01:23:49,581
(It's a quiet night with soft, drizzling rain.)

2080
01:23:50,441 --> 01:23:53,351
(The love counseling corner is now open.)

2081
01:23:54,781 --> 01:24:00,421
(It's time to listen to some love troubles.)

2082
01:24:01,991 --> 01:24:05,491
"Lee Eun Ji's Love Square!"

2083
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:09,471
(We're joined by a special audience who came to see "Love Square.")

2084
01:24:11,731 --> 01:24:15,130
There are many quotations about love.

2085
01:24:15,131 --> 01:24:18,341
There's one that is my favorite.

2086
01:24:19,341 --> 01:24:21,341
There are three things you can't hide.

2087
01:24:22,111 --> 01:24:26,051
That's sneezing, poverty, and love.

2088
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:29,481
Let's all give love a try!

2089
01:24:31,181 --> 01:24:33,321
(Panelists are on standby.)

2090
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:36,421
(MC Lee Eun Ji)

2091
01:24:36,691 --> 01:24:40,691
Hi! This is the first episode of "Lee Eun Ji's Love Square."

2092
01:24:40,861 --> 01:24:43,061
In other words, it's time for us to chat.

2093
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:44,961
It's raining outside right now.

2094
01:24:46,101 --> 01:24:48,371
(It's a peaceful night, perfect for talking about love.)

2095
01:24:48,671 --> 01:24:50,471
Let me introduce...

2096
01:24:50,701 --> 01:24:54,211
the "Love Square" panelists that will join me tonight.

2097
01:24:54,441 --> 01:24:57,041
From what I know, this panelist has been single her entire life.

2098
01:24:57,781 --> 01:24:59,911
She doesn't know too much about love.

2099
01:24:59,981 --> 01:25:02,581
But ironically, she's the loveliest!

2100
01:25:03,221 --> 01:25:04,781
Kim Mimi, please come out!

2101
01:25:07,021 --> 01:25:09,721
(The first panelist makes a lovely entrance.)

2102
01:25:11,391 --> 01:25:13,731
(She's never been in a relationship herself, )

2103
01:25:14,691 --> 01:25:16,230
(but she has joined many dating shows as a panelist...)

2104
01:25:16,231 --> 01:25:18,261
(more than any other panelist tonight.)

2105
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:20,970
(Her experience as a panelist "Heart Signal 4,")

2106
01:25:20,971 --> 01:25:22,841
("After Signal," and "Heart Pairing")

2107
01:25:23,301 --> 01:25:24,981
- I've had zero relationships. - Goodness.

2108
01:25:26,441 --> 01:25:27,470
- Welcome. - Hello.

2109
01:25:27,471 --> 01:25:28,870
- How are you? - If you've had...

2110
01:25:28,871 --> 01:25:32,210
zero relationships, how are you qualified for this?

2111
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:34,211
We're all the same. What could be so different?

2112
01:25:35,011 --> 01:25:37,280
We're all new to life, we do the best we can.

2113
01:25:37,281 --> 01:25:38,620
Ms. Mimi, I have a question.

2114
01:25:38,621 --> 01:25:41,850
Do people usually come up to you for advice?

2115
01:25:41,851 --> 01:25:43,290
No, no one.

2116
01:25:43,291 --> 01:25:44,391
(No one)

2117
01:25:44,691 --> 01:25:45,890
Nobody asks me.

2118
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:47,130
- Nobody asks you? - No.

2119
01:25:47,131 --> 01:25:48,161
Okay, thank you.

2120
01:25:48,361 --> 01:25:50,300
Let's move on to the next panel.

2121
01:25:50,301 --> 01:25:53,000
She's the youngest, at 23 this year.

2122
01:25:53,001 --> 01:25:56,271
She's bound to bring some Gen Z insight about love.

2123
01:25:56,971 --> 01:26:00,470
She nicknamed herself as a "Confucian girl,"

2124
01:26:00,471 --> 01:26:02,041
someone traditional and conservative.

2125
01:26:02,511 --> 01:26:04,310
She's very conservative for her age.

2126
01:26:04,311 --> 01:26:05,311
- That's right. - Yes.

2127
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,711
Why don't we meet her now?

2128
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:08,851
Please come out, An Yu Jin!

2129
01:26:09,621 --> 01:26:11,781
(She is the youngest panelist, )

2130
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:14,551
(but she puts propriety and duty above all else.)

2131
01:26:15,091 --> 01:26:16,921
- U go girl! - U go girl

2132
01:26:17,161 --> 01:26:18,321
- She's back - She's back

2133
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:21,661
(Her walk is elegant and dignified, )

2134
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:26,231
(as if she were wearing hanbok.)

2135
01:26:26,301 --> 01:26:27,830
- Girl girl - Girl girl!

2136
01:26:27,831 --> 01:26:29,231
- Hey you go girl - Hey you go girl

2137
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:30,741
- That that that - That that that

2138
01:26:30,771 --> 01:26:34,571
(The Confucian girl is greeting us with a bow.)

2139
01:26:37,211 --> 01:26:38,541
She's Confucianism in human form.

2140
01:26:38,811 --> 01:26:40,550
Hello, welcome.

2141
01:26:40,551 --> 01:26:41,850
- Hello. - Yes.

2142
01:26:41,851 --> 01:26:44,181
Why do you call yourself "Confucian girl?"

2143
01:26:45,121 --> 01:26:47,790
Yes, that's because I realized I was rather conservative.

2144
01:26:47,791 --> 01:26:48,791
Why is that?

2145
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:50,891
I used to think that I was open-minded...

2146
01:26:51,721 --> 01:26:53,430
and more carefree than most people.

2147
01:26:53,431 --> 01:26:55,890
But then Eun Ji mentioned that kids these days...

2148
01:26:55,891 --> 01:26:58,361
just decide to date without making things official.

2149
01:26:58,431 --> 01:27:01,200
- That's true. - She told me that before.

2150
01:27:01,201 --> 01:27:02,301
- I did. - That moment,

2151
01:27:03,101 --> 01:27:04,621
I thought, "That doesn't sound right."

2152
01:27:05,301 --> 01:27:06,841
The Confucian girl inside me...

2153
01:27:08,711 --> 01:27:10,011
was awakened like that.

2154
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:11,581
That's why...

2155
01:27:12,111 --> 01:27:13,751
- You call yourself that? - That's right.

2156
01:27:13,951 --> 01:27:16,521
Do people come up to you for advice?

2157
01:27:17,221 --> 01:27:19,020
I am the leader of our group,

2158
01:27:19,021 --> 01:27:22,151
so the other members confide in me with their concerns.

2159
01:27:22,691 --> 01:27:25,461
And in those matters, I'm a thinker, not a feeler.

2160
01:27:25,561 --> 01:27:27,860
(Her MBTI is definitely a T.)

2161
01:27:27,861 --> 01:27:29,861
- You're a thinker, all right. - I am a thinker.

2162
01:27:30,001 --> 01:27:31,860
So I always try to find solutions.

2163
01:27:31,861 --> 01:27:34,731
I value solutions more than sympathizing with them.

2164
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:38,171
- I'll try to do that tonight too. - A big thinker.

2165
01:27:38,271 --> 01:27:39,300
What a coincidence!

2166
01:27:39,301 --> 01:27:41,071
Our next panelist is a big feeler...

2167
01:27:42,571 --> 01:27:44,110
who's waiting for us.

2168
01:27:44,111 --> 01:27:47,650
She asked for very specific entrance music.

2169
01:27:47,651 --> 01:27:49,451
- Could we play her song, please? - Let's go!

2170
01:27:50,951 --> 01:27:52,751
(She makes people laugh with just her song.)

2171
01:27:53,521 --> 01:27:55,621
She specifically asked for a wrestling song.

2172
01:27:55,891 --> 01:27:56,921
Here she is.

2173
01:27:58,221 --> 01:28:01,161
(Showing off her back)

2174
01:28:02,431 --> 01:28:04,531
(She's restraining her front.)

2175
01:28:04,701 --> 01:28:06,231
(The crowd loves her.)

2176
01:28:06,401 --> 01:28:07,431
Yes!

2177
01:28:10,741 --> 01:28:13,141
(The feisty gorilla dominates the room from the start.)

2178
01:28:13,571 --> 01:28:15,140
(Gorillas pounding their chests are not an act of aggression...)

2179
01:28:15,141 --> 01:28:17,387
(but social play for communication, display, mating, and so on.)

2180
01:28:17,411 --> 01:28:19,580
(This feisty gorilla is a good one.)

2181
01:28:19,581 --> 01:28:21,261
- Oh, look! - She's fighting with someone!

2182
01:28:21,611 --> 01:28:23,851
(She doesn't spare herself when it comes to performing.)

2183
01:28:24,181 --> 01:28:25,880
- Akh! - Akh!

2184
01:28:25,881 --> 01:28:27,021
Akh!

2185
01:28:27,351 --> 01:28:29,721
We don't have a nickname for you, actually.

2186
01:28:29,921 --> 01:28:31,460
I'm a professional truth bomber.

2187
01:28:31,461 --> 01:28:32,861
- The pro truth bomber? - Gosh.

2188
01:28:33,091 --> 01:28:34,960
But we all know you're a big feeler.

2189
01:28:34,961 --> 01:28:36,501
How will you manage that?

2190
01:28:36,761 --> 01:28:39,631
I'll go back and forth between logic and emotion.

2191
01:28:40,271 --> 01:28:42,840
I strive to achieve the perfect truth bomb.

2192
01:28:42,841 --> 01:28:44,870
But who are you supposed to be right now?

2193
01:28:44,871 --> 01:28:46,370
Right now, I'm Ma Dong Seok.

2194
01:28:46,371 --> 01:28:47,641
(I'm Ma Dong Seok.)

2195
01:28:47,711 --> 01:28:48,711
You're Lee Dong Seok.

2196
01:28:48,712 --> 01:28:49,741
That's right.

2197
01:28:56,351 --> 01:28:58,580
(MC Eun Ji)

2198
01:28:58,581 --> 01:29:00,650
(Zero relationship girl)

2199
01:29:00,651 --> 01:29:02,620
(Lee Dong Seok)

2200
01:29:02,621 --> 01:29:04,391
(Confucian girl)

2201
01:29:04,991 --> 01:29:07,491
("Love Square")

2202
01:29:08,661 --> 01:29:11,801
(What is dating for E-caders?)

2203
01:29:11,931 --> 01:29:14,370
What do you think a relationship should be like?

2204
01:29:14,371 --> 01:29:15,900
- What is a relationship? - I'll go first.

2205
01:29:15,901 --> 01:29:16,941
Yes, Lee Dong Seok?

2206
01:29:17,071 --> 01:29:19,170
- I personally think... - Yes.

2207
01:29:19,171 --> 01:29:20,440
That it's about team play.

2208
01:29:20,441 --> 01:29:21,641
- My gosh! - Team play?

2209
01:29:22,011 --> 01:29:23,210
(Wow!)

2210
01:29:23,211 --> 01:29:24,240
- Cool! - Team play!

2211
01:29:24,241 --> 01:29:26,311
Relationships, even for married couples...

2212
01:29:26,551 --> 01:29:28,251
would be like a group project.

2213
01:29:28,851 --> 01:29:31,181
You divide the parts equally,

2214
01:29:31,381 --> 01:29:34,021
and when the other is in trouble, you help out.

2215
01:29:34,821 --> 01:29:37,360
You go on with life, feeling love for humanity.

2216
01:29:37,361 --> 01:29:41,330
Someone who really knows love would say that.

2217
01:29:41,331 --> 01:29:42,461
I do know love.

2218
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:46,830
- You're so cute! - You know relationships...

2219
01:29:46,831 --> 01:29:48,871
and love very well.

2220
01:29:49,001 --> 01:29:50,670
I was surprised by your wisdom.

2221
01:29:50,671 --> 01:29:52,340
- I'm very wise. - I didn't expect that from you,

2222
01:29:52,341 --> 01:29:53,810
- since you're so young. - Thank you.

2223
01:29:53,811 --> 01:29:55,870
- I'm 24. - What do you think, Confucian girl?

2224
01:29:55,871 --> 01:29:57,580
I think love is about...

2225
01:29:57,581 --> 01:29:58,940
- Relationships. - samgangoryun...

2226
01:29:58,941 --> 01:30:00,010
and bunguyusin.

2227
01:30:00,011 --> 01:30:01,410
(Samgangoryun, bunguyusin)

2228
01:30:01,411 --> 01:30:02,411
Bunguyusin.

2229
01:30:02,412 --> 01:30:04,412
- What does that mean? - Samgangoryun, bunguyusin!

2230
01:30:04,481 --> 01:30:05,580
"What does that mean?"

2231
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:06,890
Bunguyusin is the duty of trust between friends.

2232
01:30:06,891 --> 01:30:09,221
It's one of the duties in samgangoryun.

2233
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:11,390
Trust is the most important thing...

2234
01:30:11,391 --> 01:30:12,820
- in any relationship. - Right.

2235
01:30:12,821 --> 01:30:14,760
- Of course. - I think it would matter more...

2236
01:30:14,761 --> 01:30:15,930
- in romantic relationships. - You're right.

2237
01:30:15,931 --> 01:30:17,200
But when she was talking about the idiom,

2238
01:30:17,201 --> 01:30:18,860
and you said "What does that mean?"

2239
01:30:18,861 --> 01:30:21,330
I really don't know.

2240
01:30:21,331 --> 01:30:22,600
It's okay, you know North America now.

2241
01:30:22,601 --> 01:30:23,840
- Right, North America. - Yes.

2242
01:30:23,841 --> 01:30:25,870
What do you think, Mimi?

2243
01:30:25,871 --> 01:30:26,910
I think...

2244
01:30:26,911 --> 01:30:29,111
relationships are a home run.

2245
01:30:29,711 --> 01:30:30,841
- A home run? - What?

2246
01:30:31,441 --> 01:30:32,540
A home run.

2247
01:30:32,541 --> 01:30:35,021
(The zero relationship girl and her word choice shocked them.)

2248
01:30:35,181 --> 01:30:36,650
- A home run? - That's right.

2249
01:30:36,651 --> 01:30:37,651
Why is that?

2250
01:30:37,652 --> 01:30:40,052
I think a good relationship would lead straight to marriage.

2251
01:30:40,191 --> 01:30:41,350
(Impressed)

2252
01:30:41,351 --> 01:30:42,821
You've really had zero experience.

2253
01:30:44,191 --> 01:30:45,920
So you date one person...

2254
01:30:45,921 --> 01:30:47,160
- and get married to them? - That's the home run?

2255
01:30:47,161 --> 01:30:48,430
- Just one person in your life? - Yes, just one...

2256
01:30:48,431 --> 01:30:50,200
- for the rest of your life. - You're saying love isn't...

2257
01:30:50,201 --> 01:30:51,630
going from one person to the other.

2258
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:53,731
Yes, if we're talking about true love.

2259
01:30:54,431 --> 01:30:56,840
- That's very romantic. - You're a romantic, Mimi.

2260
01:30:56,841 --> 01:30:58,500
- It's so romantic. - No wonder you fell in love...

2261
01:30:58,501 --> 01:30:59,640
- with Lisbon. - Right.

2262
01:30:59,641 --> 01:31:00,641
That was very romantic.

2263
01:31:00,642 --> 01:31:02,370
Should we go into the first story?

2264
01:31:02,371 --> 01:31:03,740
Can I ask you something before that?

2265
01:31:03,741 --> 01:31:04,880
Of course, Lee Dong Seok.

2266
01:31:04,881 --> 01:31:06,951
- What is love to you, MC Eun Ji? - Yes?

2267
01:31:09,751 --> 01:31:12,071
I understand you're the most experienced out of all of us.

2268
01:31:13,151 --> 01:31:14,820
- As a 34-year-old, - You're 34.

2269
01:31:14,821 --> 01:31:16,790
And as the eldest here...

2270
01:31:16,791 --> 01:31:19,091
Relationships are inefficient.

2271
01:31:19,321 --> 01:31:20,561
- Here it is. - Gosh.

2272
01:31:20,931 --> 01:31:22,490
- It's inefficient. - Yes.

2273
01:31:22,491 --> 01:31:23,600
It's very inefficient.

2274
01:31:23,601 --> 01:31:26,231
Even when they're three hours away,

2275
01:31:26,371 --> 01:31:28,200
you're willing to spend that time...

2276
01:31:28,201 --> 01:31:30,340
just to drive all the way there.

2277
01:31:30,341 --> 01:31:31,941
- But it's worth it. - It's worth it.

2278
01:31:32,201 --> 01:31:33,341
That was incredible!

2279
01:31:34,011 --> 01:31:35,917
- Give it up for the MC! - She's the MC for a reason.

2280
01:31:35,941 --> 01:31:38,140
- M.C the Max! - She's on another level.

2281
01:31:38,141 --> 01:31:39,851
Wait, who are you sending those hearts to?

2282
01:31:40,751 --> 01:31:41,951
There are a few.

2283
01:31:45,421 --> 01:31:47,702
(Here are today's stories in "Lee Eun Ji's Love Square.")

2284
01:31:48,221 --> 01:31:49,790
(Traveling from Abu Dhabi...)

2285
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:52,160
(to Lisbon...)

2286
01:31:52,161 --> 01:31:54,431
(and again to Albufeira, )

2287
01:31:54,931 --> 01:31:56,600
(we took two planes...)

2288
01:31:56,601 --> 01:31:59,001
(and moved from two different time zones.)

2289
01:31:59,361 --> 01:32:02,101
(These stories are from those behind the cameras, )

2290
01:32:02,701 --> 01:32:06,741
(the staff members who don't have time to talk to their loved ones.)

2291
01:32:07,011 --> 01:32:10,110
We've been traveling for 12 days.

2292
01:32:10,111 --> 01:32:11,557
- That's how long it's been. - It's incredible.

2293
01:32:11,581 --> 01:32:14,411
And our staff members who started dating in Seoul...

2294
01:32:14,711 --> 01:32:16,180
seem to have some concerns.

2295
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:18,920
- It's long distance, then. - It's a very long distance.

2296
01:32:18,921 --> 01:32:21,590
- They have quite a lot of concerns. - Relationship problems?

2297
01:32:21,591 --> 01:32:23,721
Yes, and we'll go into that tonight.

2298
01:32:24,061 --> 01:32:25,990
- Let's start with the first story. - I'm excited.

2299
01:32:25,991 --> 01:32:27,261
- I'm curious. - Let's focus.

2300
01:32:27,661 --> 01:32:28,830
This is really bad.

2301
01:32:28,831 --> 01:32:30,260
- This is... - It's one of our staff members.

2302
01:32:30,261 --> 01:32:31,500
- I'm so curious. - What happened?

2303
01:32:31,501 --> 01:32:32,501
This is a hard one.

2304
01:32:32,502 --> 01:32:33,942
- I'll read it out. - How bad is it?

2305
01:32:34,601 --> 01:32:36,841
This is from "Empty Left Hand."

2306
01:32:38,071 --> 01:32:39,101
"Empty Left Hand?"

2307
01:32:39,181 --> 01:32:40,520
Let's start with the first story.

2308
01:32:40,521 --> 01:32:42,351
- I'm excited and curious. - Let's focus.

2309
01:32:42,821 --> 01:32:43,960
This is really bad.

2310
01:32:43,961 --> 01:32:45,320
- This is... - It's one of our staff members.

2311
01:32:45,321 --> 01:32:46,490
- I'm so curious. - What happened?

2312
01:32:46,491 --> 01:32:47,530
This is a hard one.

2313
01:32:47,531 --> 01:32:48,971
- I'll read it out. - How bad is it?

2314
01:32:49,691 --> 01:32:51,931
This is from "Empty Left Hand."

2315
01:32:53,231 --> 01:32:54,231
"Empty Left Hand?"

2316
01:32:54,232 --> 01:32:57,971
Hello, I've been with my boyfriend for a year now.

2317
01:32:58,401 --> 01:33:01,271
Before the shoot, my boyfriend got me an anniversary gift...

2318
01:33:01,441 --> 01:33:03,011
and gave me a couple ring.

2319
01:33:03,481 --> 01:33:04,880
He said, "When you're tired from the shoot,"

2320
01:33:04,881 --> 01:33:07,351
"look at the ring and think of me!"

2321
01:33:08,011 --> 01:33:11,381
And so I traveled from Abu Dhabi to Portugal only to realize...

2322
01:33:11,651 --> 01:33:14,091
- No way. - No, please.

2323
01:33:14,921 --> 01:33:17,060
That the ring was missing from my left hand!

2324
01:33:17,061 --> 01:33:18,421
Get out of here!

2325
01:33:19,021 --> 01:33:20,660
I tend to lose a lot of my things,

2326
01:33:20,661 --> 01:33:23,401
so he specifically asked me to take good care of the ring.

2327
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:24,700
But now that I lost it,

2328
01:33:24,701 --> 01:33:26,931
I feel so bad, even during filming.

2329
01:33:27,331 --> 01:33:29,800
How should I tell him the news...

2330
01:33:29,801 --> 01:33:34,411
without getting my boyfriend too upset?

2331
01:33:34,871 --> 01:33:36,370
That's the story from Empty Left Hand.

2332
01:33:36,371 --> 01:33:37,380
What should we do with this?

2333
01:33:37,381 --> 01:33:38,381
(Sighing)

2334
01:33:38,611 --> 01:33:42,310
Empty Left Hand has already made up her mind.

2335
01:33:42,311 --> 01:33:44,120
- She's going to tell him. - Yes, she's going to come clean.

2336
01:33:44,121 --> 01:33:45,450
- But how? - Now...

2337
01:33:45,451 --> 01:33:47,790
the issue is finding a way to tell him without...

2338
01:33:47,791 --> 01:33:50,161
hurting his feelings too much.

2339
01:33:50,361 --> 01:33:52,521
- I'll put myself in their shoes. - Yes.

2340
01:33:52,791 --> 01:33:55,560
- It's so busy and hectic here. - Yes.

2341
01:33:55,561 --> 01:33:58,761
- And the time difference is big. - Right.

2342
01:33:58,831 --> 01:34:02,031
So if I just got a text saying, "I lost the ring,"

2343
01:34:02,201 --> 01:34:04,201
I would be really angry.

2344
01:34:04,441 --> 01:34:06,840
Telling him in person and apologizing...

2345
01:34:06,841 --> 01:34:08,871
- is much more genuine. - And with some flowers.

2346
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:11,680
- So they should meet first. - Yes.

2347
01:34:11,681 --> 01:34:13,481
- They should meet. - Okay.

2348
01:34:13,711 --> 01:34:15,380
And saying it was too busy,

2349
01:34:15,381 --> 01:34:17,481
and I had too much to do is wrong.

2350
01:34:17,951 --> 01:34:19,191
It should be an honest apology.

2351
01:34:19,751 --> 01:34:20,820
She should be honest.

2352
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:21,950
"I'm sorry, I lost the ring."

2353
01:34:21,951 --> 01:34:24,791
Our members are a bit cool.

2354
01:34:24,821 --> 01:34:26,260
But saying sorry...

2355
01:34:26,261 --> 01:34:27,990
won't bring the ring back.

2356
01:34:27,991 --> 01:34:29,360
- Of course not! - No, it won't.

2357
01:34:29,361 --> 01:34:30,361
It could be anywhere!

2358
01:34:30,362 --> 01:34:32,601
So unless it was really expensive,

2359
01:34:32,631 --> 01:34:34,311
- she should get new ones... - A new ring.

2360
01:34:34,701 --> 01:34:37,200
- to replace the lost rings. - I see.

2361
01:34:37,201 --> 01:34:38,517
(Face-to-face apology, new couple rings)

2362
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:40,171
For me, I prefer bowing.

2363
01:34:40,611 --> 01:34:41,640
- What? - Bowing.

2364
01:34:41,641 --> 01:34:43,241
If you lose your ring,

2365
01:34:43,441 --> 01:34:45,311
I just want you to get on your knees.

2366
01:34:45,411 --> 01:34:47,550
- You want action. - A performance.

2367
01:34:47,551 --> 01:34:50,621
I think actions speak louder than material things.

2368
01:34:51,321 --> 01:34:53,721
- Just start bawling right away! - Right.

2369
01:34:53,751 --> 01:34:55,651
- Put on a big show! - Okay.

2370
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:59,120
So you want her to go overboard with her apology?

2371
01:34:59,121 --> 01:35:00,431
- I see. - That's nice.

2372
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:03,290
- I don't agree. - Performance is key.

2373
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:04,500
What do you think, Mimi?

2374
01:35:04,501 --> 01:35:05,601
- I think... - Yes.

2375
01:35:06,001 --> 01:35:07,831
- I would call him right away... - Yes.

2376
01:35:08,101 --> 01:35:09,330
And tell him I lost the ring.

2377
01:35:09,331 --> 01:35:10,970
- On the spot? - If it were me.

2378
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:12,600
- Right away? - I think...

2379
01:35:12,601 --> 01:35:15,510
- you're basically lying to him... - That makes sense.

2380
01:35:15,511 --> 01:35:17,080
- during all that time. - Right.

2381
01:35:17,081 --> 01:35:19,040
- You pretend the ring is there. - Right, you're pretending.

2382
01:35:19,041 --> 01:35:20,487
So as soon as I find out, I'd call and say,

2383
01:35:20,511 --> 01:35:22,050
"I lost the ring, and I'm so sorry."

2384
01:35:22,051 --> 01:35:24,150
"I have no excuse."

2385
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:26,020
- "Can we talk about this?" - That sounds like Mimi.

2386
01:35:26,021 --> 01:35:28,050
- That's what I would do. - So you'd let him know...

2387
01:35:28,051 --> 01:35:30,261
- before actually meeting. - Yes.

2388
01:35:30,621 --> 01:35:33,830
Getting that call would really make him mad,

2389
01:35:33,831 --> 01:35:36,590
but if he sees how sorry she is when they meet,

2390
01:35:36,591 --> 01:35:38,160
- and since he already knew... - He might forgive her.

2391
01:35:38,161 --> 01:35:40,007
- it might be better. - I kind of agree with Mimi.

2392
01:35:40,031 --> 01:35:41,770
If she told him only after meeting,

2393
01:35:41,771 --> 01:35:43,411
- his first words might be this. - I see.

2394
01:35:43,501 --> 01:35:44,840
"And you kept this from me this whole time?"

2395
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:46,100
- Right. - Exactly!

2396
01:35:46,101 --> 01:35:49,171
"You knew you lost it, and you tried to hide that from me?"

2397
01:35:49,241 --> 01:35:50,781
He might take it like this.

2398
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:52,910
That's a good opinion.

2399
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:54,057
(Telling them in advance to prevent further anger)

2400
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:57,281
Is Empty Left Hand a woman or a man?

2401
01:35:57,451 --> 01:35:58,750
It's a female assistant director.

2402
01:35:58,751 --> 01:36:00,551
- She was a woman? - Really?

2403
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:02,820
Could we get her boyfriend's MBTI?

2404
01:36:02,821 --> 01:36:04,290
Why are we so...

2405
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:05,690
I'm so invested right now!

2406
01:36:05,691 --> 01:36:07,790
- I am too. - I want to help out!

2407
01:36:07,791 --> 01:36:08,960
He's an INFP.

2408
01:36:08,961 --> 01:36:10,761
- Oh, no! - He's an INFP?

2409
01:36:11,801 --> 01:36:13,000
- INFPs... - You're INFP, right?

2410
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:14,670
Will remember this until they die!

2411
01:36:14,671 --> 01:36:15,730
- Really? - Yes!

2412
01:36:15,731 --> 01:36:17,600
- You're an INFP? - I am!

2413
01:36:17,601 --> 01:36:18,641
(An INFP in the flesh)

2414
01:36:18,701 --> 01:36:21,971
He might say that it's okay, but...

2415
01:36:22,071 --> 01:36:23,831
- he might still feel... - Do you know this?

2416
01:36:24,941 --> 01:36:26,811
It's the "I'm fine" meme.

2417
01:36:29,281 --> 01:36:31,781
- You say it's okay, but you're sad. - Exactly.

2418
01:36:32,151 --> 01:36:33,450
INFPs will...

2419
01:36:33,451 --> 01:36:35,190
Well, I can't speak for...

2420
01:36:35,191 --> 01:36:36,820
- every INFP out there. - Of course not.

2421
01:36:36,821 --> 01:36:38,491
- But for me, - Yes.

2422
01:36:38,661 --> 01:36:41,930
I will have a very lonely and empty battle with myself.

2423
01:36:41,931 --> 01:36:44,130
And especially if I get the news via text,

2424
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,630
all of my anger will boil because of all the time difference,

2425
01:36:46,631 --> 01:36:47,951
until I turn into an evil spirit.

2426
01:36:48,231 --> 01:36:49,671
- I'm serious. - Wait.

2427
01:36:49,931 --> 01:36:53,171
As an INFP, what do you think is the best way to apologize?

2428
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:55,270
- This is what I think. - What is it?

2429
01:36:55,271 --> 01:36:57,711
Performance is important for INFPs.

2430
01:36:58,211 --> 01:36:59,311
- Okay. - I'm serious.

2431
01:36:59,611 --> 01:37:01,151
Please trust me!

2432
01:37:01,411 --> 01:37:02,510
Have faith in me.

2433
01:37:02,511 --> 01:37:03,780
Okay, Young Ji.

2434
01:37:03,781 --> 01:37:05,820
You're the girlfriend, and I'm the boyfriend.

2435
01:37:05,821 --> 01:37:07,691
Hi, babe! You're here.

2436
01:37:08,091 --> 01:37:09,121
What's wrong?

2437
01:37:09,921 --> 01:37:11,320
(She just starts crying right away.)

2438
01:37:11,321 --> 01:37:12,961
Babe, what's wrong? Did something happen?

2439
01:37:13,221 --> 01:37:15,891
(She stares at her empty hand and starts wailing.)

2440
01:37:16,491 --> 01:37:19,030
- Babe... - Please don't talk to me right now.

2441
01:37:19,031 --> 01:37:20,471
What? Babe...

2442
01:37:20,671 --> 01:37:22,230
What's wrong? Talk to me.

2443
01:37:22,231 --> 01:37:24,371
Did something happen in Portugal? What happened?

2444
01:37:24,771 --> 01:37:27,141
- I really... - What is it? Say something!

2445
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:28,811
Were you hurt? Are you sick?

2446
01:37:29,241 --> 01:37:30,281
What's wrong?

2447
01:37:30,611 --> 01:37:31,911
Why? Talk to me.

2448
01:37:31,981 --> 01:37:33,810
No, stop! Don't!

2449
01:37:33,811 --> 01:37:35,810
Babe, stop it! What's wrong?

2450
01:37:35,811 --> 01:37:38,151
Don't hit yourself. What is it?

2451
01:37:38,881 --> 01:37:40,821
(Well, she succeeded in making us laugh.)

2452
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:42,551
- That's not bad. - Goodness.

2453
01:37:42,651 --> 01:37:43,920
- That was good. - It wasn't bad.

2454
01:37:43,921 --> 01:37:46,930
- I'm telling you, it'll work. - Hey, you really...

2455
01:37:46,931 --> 01:37:49,061
- It'll work. - I'm so angry right now.

2456
01:37:49,231 --> 01:37:51,530
- I'll be so angry. - You'll be angry?

2457
01:37:51,531 --> 01:37:53,330
- Yes! - Then what do you want, Yu Jin?

2458
01:37:53,331 --> 01:37:54,401
Could you show us?

2459
01:37:54,831 --> 01:37:56,971
She'll be arriving soon.

2460
01:37:57,871 --> 01:37:58,901
- Babe! - Hey.

2461
01:37:59,441 --> 01:38:01,610
- How was the shoot? - It was good.

2462
01:38:01,611 --> 01:38:02,970
I missed you. How did it go?

2463
01:38:02,971 --> 01:38:04,380
- Well, you know... - Yes?

2464
01:38:04,381 --> 01:38:06,541
Wait, babe!

2465
01:38:07,611 --> 01:38:10,211
What happened to your ring?

2466
01:38:11,021 --> 01:38:13,421
I actually have something to tell you about that.

2467
01:38:13,891 --> 01:38:15,091
Should we talk over dinner?

2468
01:38:15,951 --> 01:38:17,760
- She's a pro! - Gosh!

2469
01:38:17,761 --> 01:38:19,861
She calmed him down.

2470
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:22,631
I mean, doing this the moment you meet...

2471
01:38:23,131 --> 01:38:25,260
(Sobbing)

2472
01:38:25,261 --> 01:38:27,601
No hello, nothing?

2473
01:38:27,831 --> 01:38:30,370
You haven't met in weeks, and the first thing you say is...

2474
01:38:30,371 --> 01:38:32,270
(Gasping)

2475
01:38:32,271 --> 01:38:33,471
(Exclaiming)

2476
01:38:33,871 --> 01:38:35,340
What is he supposed to do with that?

2477
01:38:35,341 --> 01:38:37,881
- Isn't it endearing? - I don't think I want to see that.

2478
01:38:38,341 --> 01:38:39,911
- I'll just get angry. - Mimi.

2479
01:38:40,041 --> 01:38:41,411
Mimi, what about you?

2480
01:38:41,681 --> 01:38:43,280
- Babe. - Yes?

2481
01:38:43,281 --> 01:38:44,580
Look at you,

2482
01:38:44,581 --> 01:38:46,250
- holding onto all this gold. - All this gold.

2483
01:38:46,251 --> 01:38:47,491
Wait, babe.

2484
01:38:47,851 --> 01:38:49,020
Our ring that you always wear...

2485
01:38:49,021 --> 01:38:50,590
Mimi has everything but the ring.

2486
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:51,820
- it's gone. - I'll be so angry.

2487
01:38:51,821 --> 01:38:53,561
What happened to our ring?

2488
01:38:53,891 --> 01:38:55,261
- Our ring? - Yes.

2489
01:38:56,191 --> 01:38:57,931
- Well... - Yes?

2490
01:38:58,501 --> 01:38:59,530
I'm so sorry.

2491
01:38:59,531 --> 01:39:01,731
- It's cute. It's working! - Gosh.

2492
01:39:01,801 --> 01:39:03,570
During the shoot,

2493
01:39:03,571 --> 01:39:05,200
I got so busy...

2494
01:39:05,201 --> 01:39:06,941
My gosh, this is so touching.

2495
01:39:07,011 --> 01:39:09,170
I didn't even know I lost it.

2496
01:39:09,171 --> 01:39:11,340
- And? - But let's get a new pair!

2497
01:39:11,341 --> 01:39:13,180
- Goodness! - Look at her face.

2498
01:39:13,181 --> 01:39:14,811
This is the key.

2499
01:39:14,911 --> 01:39:17,980
You can tell the apology is genuine from her eyes.

2500
01:39:17,981 --> 01:39:19,981
- She's so cute. - Yes, this is cute.

2501
01:39:20,081 --> 01:39:21,520
- Babe. - Maybe it's her reaction.

2502
01:39:21,521 --> 01:39:22,621
Should I start dating?

2503
01:39:23,961 --> 01:39:25,721
(Soon to be in a relationship)

2504
01:39:25,921 --> 01:39:27,361
I really think you should.

2505
01:39:27,391 --> 01:39:28,960
I think it's time for you to start.

2506
01:39:28,961 --> 01:39:30,730
- I think so too. - It's time.

2507
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:32,060
- The time has come. - You're ready.

2508
01:39:32,061 --> 01:39:34,430
We'll share your opinions with Empty Left Hand.

2509
01:39:34,431 --> 01:39:35,870
- Thank you. - You're going to share?

2510
01:39:35,871 --> 01:39:37,200
(Empty Left Hand, Tell him before and apologize in person, )

2511
01:39:37,201 --> 01:39:38,647
(Apologize in person with new rings, Start bawling the moment they meet)

2512
01:39:38,671 --> 01:39:40,370
She sent us a message!

2513
01:39:40,371 --> 01:39:41,617
- What is it? - What did she say?

2514
01:39:41,641 --> 01:39:42,971
This is amazing!

2515
01:39:43,441 --> 01:39:46,211
She starts by laughing.

2516
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,381
And she said, "I think it's right."

2517
01:39:49,351 --> 01:39:51,281
(Which of the three solutions did she pick?)

2518
01:39:51,951 --> 01:39:53,151
"Performance matters."

2519
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:57,720
- What? - Let's go!

2520
01:39:57,721 --> 01:40:00,091
(The INFP knows what the other INFP wants.)

2521
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:03,030
"And portraying all of those emotions..."

2522
01:40:03,031 --> 01:40:05,761
- "clearly is very important." - That's right.

2523
01:40:05,931 --> 01:40:07,670
She didn't think about calling him.

2524
01:40:07,671 --> 01:40:09,070
- They're both busy. - Right.

2525
01:40:09,071 --> 01:40:10,441
- He's really busy too. - Okay.

2526
01:40:10,541 --> 01:40:11,600
Wait, hold on.

2527
01:40:11,601 --> 01:40:14,241
Would she agree even after seeing your performance?

2528
01:40:14,941 --> 01:40:17,081
A fellow INFP may like it.

2529
01:40:17,481 --> 01:40:19,040
- Thank you. My bottle! - Gosh.

2530
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:20,980
- Gosh. - Nice!

2531
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:23,051
It's rose wine, the symbol of love.

2532
01:40:23,581 --> 01:40:26,050
(Lee Dong Seok gets a bottle of wine.)

2533
01:40:26,051 --> 01:40:27,051
Thank you.

2534
01:40:27,052 --> 01:40:30,320
- You were all so insightful, - Yes?

2535
01:40:30,321 --> 01:40:32,490
- We're objective. - objective, right.

2536
01:40:32,491 --> 01:40:34,561
And we heard many different opinions from you.

2537
01:40:34,691 --> 01:40:35,830
Should we move on to the next story?

2538
01:40:35,831 --> 01:40:36,891
- Sure. - Okay.

2539
01:40:36,931 --> 01:40:39,101
(The second story)

2540
01:40:39,961 --> 01:40:41,131
(Sighing)

2541
01:40:41,171 --> 01:40:43,001
What do we do with this one, guys?

2542
01:40:43,231 --> 01:40:44,770
Can I play a song that I like?

2543
01:40:44,771 --> 01:40:45,971
- Of course. - I'm excited.

2544
01:40:47,371 --> 01:40:48,511
Hello.

2545
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:51,911
This story is about a long-distance couple of nine years.

2546
01:40:53,751 --> 01:40:55,450
We did date for a long time,

2547
01:40:55,451 --> 01:40:58,720
but more than half of that was long distance.

2548
01:40:58,721 --> 01:41:01,250
- We're still doing long distance. - That's so harsh.

2549
01:41:01,251 --> 01:41:03,650
But other than that, our relationship is going well,

2550
01:41:03,651 --> 01:41:06,121
since we only fight once every three years or so.

2551
01:41:06,261 --> 01:41:08,030
And while I was in the middle of filming,

2552
01:41:08,031 --> 01:41:10,501
and things were getting hectic, I received a text.

2553
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:13,060
Babe, could I...

2554
01:41:13,061 --> 01:41:14,630
go on a trip with my friends next week?

2555
01:41:14,631 --> 01:41:16,670
We're thinking of going to the Grand Canyon.

2556
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:18,700
It's with two guys and two girls.

2557
01:41:18,701 --> 01:41:19,871
What? No way.

2558
01:41:21,071 --> 01:41:22,370
- Of course not. - She's reading right now.

2559
01:41:22,371 --> 01:41:24,441
I'm sorry, I'll keep it to myself.

2560
01:41:24,781 --> 01:41:26,310
I was just so busy right now,

2561
01:41:26,311 --> 01:41:28,210
and I felt bad that I wasn't able to check in as much.

2562
01:41:28,211 --> 01:41:30,250
So I told him that he should go.

2563
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:31,951
Actually, both of us...

2564
01:41:32,021 --> 01:41:33,380
have gone on trips from time to time...

2565
01:41:33,381 --> 01:41:35,791
with friends of the opposite sex, so it was fine.

2566
01:41:35,921 --> 01:41:38,660
But this was the first time the people matched up perfectly,

2567
01:41:38,661 --> 01:41:40,290
so I did feel a bit odd.

2568
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:42,031
Why would you let him go?

2569
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:44,700
The trip is for two nights and three days.

2570
01:41:44,701 --> 01:41:47,430
- That's so long. - His friend, Young Seok,

2571
01:41:47,431 --> 01:41:49,070
is someone I know pretty well.

2572
01:41:49,071 --> 01:41:50,270
He's really reliable,

2573
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:52,400
and my boyfriend also never...

2574
01:41:52,401 --> 01:41:53,917
gave me any reason to be suspicious of him before.

2575
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:55,510
I don't know...

2576
01:41:55,511 --> 01:41:57,111
who the two other girls are.

2577
01:41:57,581 --> 01:42:00,950
My boyfriend knew them for about six months,

2578
01:42:00,951 --> 01:42:04,151
and they're aware of the fact that he's in a relationship.

2579
01:42:04,251 --> 01:42:05,920
But when I told others around me,

2580
01:42:05,921 --> 01:42:08,551
everyone told me to stop him from going.

2581
01:42:08,621 --> 01:42:10,661
Am I acting too cool right now?

2582
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,961
Was it strange of me to tell him to go on that trip?

2583
01:42:13,621 --> 01:42:14,731
Yes, it is.

2584
01:42:15,431 --> 01:42:17,061
(She's so serious.)

2585
01:42:17,261 --> 01:42:20,360
I'm sorry, but I think her boyfriend asking her if he could go...

2586
01:42:20,361 --> 01:42:21,641
is a problem in the first place.

2587
01:42:22,401 --> 01:42:24,840
Why go on a trip with other girls when you have a girlfriend?

2588
01:42:24,841 --> 01:42:27,810
He shouldn't have asked her. He should have just told...

2589
01:42:27,811 --> 01:42:30,070
his friend he's not going, not ask his girlfriend about it.

2590
01:42:30,071 --> 01:42:31,941
- From the start? - Yes.

2591
01:42:33,211 --> 01:42:36,480
If he doesn't understand that the person he loves could be...

2592
01:42:36,481 --> 01:42:37,881
worried about that issue...

2593
01:42:38,481 --> 01:42:39,520
- Gosh! - She's right.

2594
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:40,591
(Everyone relates.)

2595
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:43,790
Then I think the boyfriend might not have thought of her feelings...

2596
01:42:43,791 --> 01:42:45,311
- well enough. - Mimi, that was great.

2597
01:42:45,621 --> 01:42:48,461
She's also wondering if she's acting too cool.

2598
01:42:48,561 --> 01:42:50,600
I think she agreed because...

2599
01:42:50,601 --> 01:42:53,531
she was just swept up in the moment.

2600
01:42:53,731 --> 01:42:56,300
Since they always did that before,

2601
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:57,800
- she felt like she should agree. - Right.

2602
01:42:57,801 --> 01:42:59,140
I understand why she did it.

2603
01:42:59,141 --> 01:43:02,270
But I do believe that the reason she's feeling that way...

2604
01:43:02,271 --> 01:43:03,741
is not her, but her boyfriend.

2605
01:43:04,411 --> 01:43:05,980
She feels odd,

2606
01:43:05,981 --> 01:43:08,851
because the fact that he brought it up...

2607
01:43:09,151 --> 01:43:10,351
is kind of suspicious.

2608
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:12,480
(Mimi thinks that it's the boyfriend's fault...)

2609
01:43:12,481 --> 01:43:14,027
(for not handling the issue on his end from the start.)

2610
01:43:14,051 --> 01:43:15,321
What do you think, Yu Jin?

2611
01:43:15,991 --> 01:43:17,221
- I think... - Yes.

2612
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:20,220
That there are many different types of people in this world,

2613
01:43:20,221 --> 01:43:21,861
- and I'll try to relate to them. - Okay.

2614
01:43:22,061 --> 01:43:23,531
Some people might be cool with...

2615
01:43:23,831 --> 01:43:25,830
going on trips with friends of the opposite sex,

2616
01:43:25,831 --> 01:43:27,470
- even when they're seeing someone. - Yes, that's true.

2617
01:43:27,471 --> 01:43:29,431
- I'm not one of those people. - Yes.

2618
01:43:29,571 --> 01:43:31,140
- But it is possible. - Right.

2619
01:43:31,141 --> 01:43:34,411
Speaking from the boyfriend's point,

2620
01:43:34,471 --> 01:43:36,040
they've been together for nine years.

2621
01:43:36,041 --> 01:43:38,610
And he had many cases where she was cool with him going on trips.

2622
01:43:38,611 --> 01:43:40,850
- That's right. - He has all that data.

2623
01:43:40,851 --> 01:43:43,851
Because of that, he might've asked her...

2624
01:43:44,151 --> 01:43:46,281
with the thought,

2625
01:43:46,381 --> 01:43:49,250
"I won't go if she doesn't like it."

2626
01:43:49,251 --> 01:43:51,467
Perhaps it wasn't something like, "I have to go on this trip."

2627
01:43:51,491 --> 01:43:55,191
As for me, I don't think that this woman is strange.

2628
01:43:55,931 --> 01:43:59,100
Since they've dated for nine years, they must've talked a lot...

2629
01:43:59,101 --> 01:44:01,731
and built deep connections.

2630
01:44:01,831 --> 01:44:04,201
She should've shared these worries honestly...

2631
01:44:04,601 --> 01:44:07,370
when her boyfriend asked the question...

2632
01:44:07,371 --> 01:44:11,441
or when she first had this thought.

2633
01:44:11,941 --> 01:44:13,511
Here is what this woman thinks.

2634
01:44:13,841 --> 01:44:15,681
She is unsure about the situation,

2635
01:44:15,781 --> 01:44:17,551
but she already told him to go.

2636
01:44:17,651 --> 01:44:19,920
- People are going, "Are you crazy?" - Gosh.

2637
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:20,951
"Why did you allow it?"

2638
01:44:21,551 --> 01:44:23,591
(Lee Dong Seok couldn't stop her sigh.)

2639
01:44:24,161 --> 01:44:26,561
She wants to know,

2640
01:44:27,431 --> 01:44:30,900
"Am I so strange for allowing him to go on this trip?"

2641
01:44:30,901 --> 01:44:32,961
- That's why she's asking. - Here's what I think.

2642
01:44:33,761 --> 01:44:35,170
Young Ji should say something.

2643
01:44:35,171 --> 01:44:36,570
(Tormented)

2644
01:44:36,571 --> 01:44:38,571
Yu Jin, keep going.

2645
01:44:38,671 --> 01:44:41,740
Even if she does say yes, she should communicate her worries.

2646
01:44:41,741 --> 01:44:44,110
"The numbers of men and women didn't match earlier."

2647
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:46,540
She should say this honestly.

2648
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:48,880
- I think it'll be for the best. - Yes, Yu Jin has a point.

2649
01:44:48,881 --> 01:44:51,150
Without having these worries,

2650
01:44:51,151 --> 01:44:53,080
- she should communicate more. - This is...

2651
01:44:53,081 --> 01:44:54,267
She should be completely open.

2652
01:44:54,291 --> 01:44:56,690
This isn't a problem we can solve.

2653
01:44:56,691 --> 01:44:59,261
It's a problem only the two of them can solve.

2654
01:44:59,761 --> 01:45:01,360
That's something a total thinker would say.

2655
01:45:01,361 --> 01:45:04,731
This is a time when we share worries.

2656
01:45:04,831 --> 01:45:07,161
I think you'll marry well.

2657
01:45:09,431 --> 01:45:11,000
Seriously. I think you'll marry well.

2658
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:14,310
Her fault lies in the fact that she wasn't honest...

2659
01:45:14,311 --> 01:45:17,011
- in the beginning. - She was unsure.

2660
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:20,680
- Gosh, she's good. - Saying yes was okay.

2661
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:23,881
But since she allowed him to go on this trip already,

2662
01:45:24,221 --> 01:45:27,120
I don't think she should complain about it...

2663
01:45:27,121 --> 01:45:29,190
if she plans to continue dating him.

2664
01:45:29,191 --> 01:45:30,191
Right.

2665
01:45:30,192 --> 01:45:33,060
Thus, she should have a serious conversation later.

2666
01:45:33,061 --> 01:45:35,167
- You want them to talk again. - Yes. With seriousness.

2667
01:45:35,191 --> 01:45:36,260
- That sounds good. - No playing around.

2668
01:45:36,261 --> 01:45:37,800
- Lee Dong Seok. - Lee Dong Seok, go.

2669
01:45:37,801 --> 01:45:39,601
- What do you think? - Let's go, Anger.

2670
01:45:39,901 --> 01:45:42,370
There is the most important fact.

2671
01:45:42,371 --> 01:45:43,371
What is it?

2672
01:45:43,372 --> 01:45:45,670
She doesn't know the two women who will go on a trip...

2673
01:45:45,671 --> 01:45:46,941
with her boyfriend.

2674
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:50,640
There are people who are okay with mixed-gender trips.

2675
01:45:50,641 --> 01:45:53,241
She did say that she had allowed such trips before.

2676
01:45:53,341 --> 01:45:55,581
During their nine years of relationship,

2677
01:45:55,681 --> 01:45:58,551
they must've built rapport.

2678
01:45:58,821 --> 01:46:01,090
Despite that, she feels unsure...

2679
01:46:01,091 --> 01:46:02,571
because she doesn't know those women.

2680
01:46:03,191 --> 01:46:05,490
I think that's the part that makes the least amount of sense.

2681
01:46:05,491 --> 01:46:07,831
- She doesn't know them. - Her boyfriend...

2682
01:46:07,931 --> 01:46:11,631
should've introduced them to her first.

2683
01:46:11,831 --> 01:46:13,231
They should've had a meal together.

2684
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:16,271
He should've let her check and see...

2685
01:46:16,371 --> 01:46:18,500
- that they were safe. - However,

2686
01:46:18,501 --> 01:46:21,370
her boyfriend has been living abroad for many years.

2687
01:46:21,371 --> 01:46:23,471
Then he shouldn't go on this trip.

2688
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:26,580
Lee Dong Seok, how would you react in this situation?

2689
01:46:26,581 --> 01:46:28,851
Honey, I want to go on a trip.

2690
01:46:29,211 --> 01:46:30,650
It's a 2-on-2 situation.

2691
01:46:30,651 --> 01:46:32,751
May I go on a trip as a member of 2 men and 2 women?

2692
01:46:32,851 --> 01:46:34,291
Are you going to a blind dating pub?

2693
01:46:35,021 --> 01:46:36,590
No, I'm not. I'm going to the Grand Canyon.

2694
01:46:36,591 --> 01:46:40,620
Visiting that place is an item on my bucket list.

2695
01:46:40,621 --> 01:46:42,791
Then why would you go there with those women?

2696
01:46:42,961 --> 01:46:44,500
I see that it doesn't work.

2697
01:46:44,501 --> 01:46:45,860
It makes no sense.

2698
01:46:45,861 --> 01:46:47,730
- It makes no sense. - Not in the slightest.

2699
01:46:47,731 --> 01:46:50,131
It makes no sense...

2700
01:46:50,231 --> 01:46:52,800
that the woman is blaming herself for acting too cool.

2701
01:46:52,801 --> 01:46:54,840
- That's right. - She should've questioned it...

2702
01:46:54,841 --> 01:46:56,070
from the very start.

2703
01:46:56,071 --> 01:46:57,911
When the man asked her...

2704
01:46:58,011 --> 01:47:00,240
if he may go on this trip,

2705
01:47:00,241 --> 01:47:01,980
his explanation was too rough...

2706
01:47:01,981 --> 01:47:04,420
since he had the previous experience of going on such trips.

2707
01:47:04,421 --> 01:47:06,980
The question was wrong, not the woman who sent the story.

2708
01:47:06,981 --> 01:47:10,860
The man at fault for making her think that she is strange.

2709
01:47:10,861 --> 01:47:11,961
She isn't at fault.

2710
01:47:13,421 --> 01:47:14,790
(Young Ji thinks it's a problem...)

2711
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:16,267
(to go on a trip with women the girlfriend doesn't know.)

2712
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:18,330
Which opinion was...

2713
01:47:18,331 --> 01:47:19,561
- The best? - The best?

2714
01:47:19,661 --> 01:47:22,930
All of us agree that this woman isn't the strange one here.

2715
01:47:22,931 --> 01:47:24,140
We completely understand.

2716
01:47:24,141 --> 01:47:25,370
(The boyfriend should've refused to go on the trip.)

2717
01:47:25,371 --> 01:47:26,570
(They need to have an honest conversation.)

2718
01:47:26,571 --> 01:47:29,051
(The problem is that the girlfriend doesn't know these women.)

2719
01:47:29,171 --> 01:47:30,211
What is it?

2720
01:47:30,771 --> 01:47:33,041
(Oh, my)

2721
01:47:33,241 --> 01:47:34,610
(What is it?)

2722
01:47:34,611 --> 01:47:36,881
- What? - It's an unexpected result.

2723
01:47:38,481 --> 01:47:40,180
I think I know this person's style.

2724
01:47:40,181 --> 01:47:41,191
She is cool.

2725
01:47:41,391 --> 01:47:44,521
In an old-fashioned term, her motto is YOLO.

2726
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:48,761
I think she is like, "Don't worry about tomorrow!"

2727
01:47:48,861 --> 01:47:50,961
Among the three, there is a solution...

2728
01:47:51,061 --> 01:47:52,260
she finds...

2729
01:47:52,261 --> 01:47:54,771
the most likable and relatable.

2730
01:47:55,171 --> 01:47:57,371
Her choice is...

2731
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:00,041
Kim Mimi's solution.

2732
01:48:00,501 --> 01:48:02,371
- What was it? - What was mine?

2733
01:48:02,771 --> 01:48:03,970
There is an answer to that.

2734
01:48:03,971 --> 01:48:05,481
There is an additional answer.

2735
01:48:06,041 --> 01:48:07,980
"Listening to everyone,"

2736
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:09,951
"Mimi's solution appeals to me the most."

2737
01:48:10,981 --> 01:48:12,950
"He should've told his friend that he wasn't going."

2738
01:48:12,951 --> 01:48:15,191
- "It makes sense." - He should've told his friend that.

2739
01:48:15,251 --> 01:48:16,651
"I'm angry right now."

2740
01:48:18,121 --> 01:48:20,760
Listening to the members made her angry.

2741
01:48:20,761 --> 01:48:23,291
- She must be a fierce type. - Yes.

2742
01:48:23,431 --> 01:48:25,331
That's right. Such things make you angry.

2743
01:48:25,831 --> 01:48:28,401
I didn't think that I'd win. Thank you.

2744
01:48:29,731 --> 01:48:31,170
- Here you go. - Thank you.

2745
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:32,401
I see.

2746
01:48:33,601 --> 01:48:35,741
I like the variety of opinions.

2747
01:48:36,071 --> 01:48:38,110
- Shall we move on? - It's the last story.

2748
01:48:38,111 --> 01:48:40,711
- Okay. - Oh, no. Why is it the last one?

2749
01:48:41,151 --> 01:48:42,151
- It's fun. - The title.

2750
01:48:43,051 --> 01:48:45,651
(The third story)

2751
01:48:46,051 --> 01:48:49,151
The title is, "Which present will be nice?"

2752
01:48:50,251 --> 01:48:53,020
"Hello, I'm the man who only thinks about love."

2753
01:48:53,021 --> 01:48:54,360
"I'm Hak-dong's Choi Soo Jong."

2754
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:55,391
Hak-dong's Choi Soo Jong!

2755
01:48:57,031 --> 01:48:59,200
"I have the one and only wife..."

2756
01:48:59,201 --> 01:49:00,730
"and the one and only daughter."

2757
01:49:00,731 --> 01:49:02,101
It's Producer Geon Jun.

2758
01:49:02,871 --> 01:49:04,601
(Correct)

2759
01:49:04,701 --> 01:49:07,740
"I left the two of them in Korea due to the business trip abroad,"

2760
01:49:07,741 --> 01:49:09,641
"so my heart is very heavy."

2761
01:49:10,411 --> 01:49:12,610
"My wife is working and taking care of our daughter,"

2762
01:49:12,611 --> 01:49:13,881
"so I feel even worse."

2763
01:49:13,981 --> 01:49:15,787
"In the week I go back from the business trip.."

2764
01:49:15,811 --> 01:49:17,650
"are my daughter's entrance ceremony for the daycare center..."

2765
01:49:17,651 --> 01:49:19,481
"as well as her first birthday party."

2766
01:49:19,581 --> 01:49:21,591
"So there must be many things to take care of."

2767
01:49:21,921 --> 01:49:24,460
"Thus, I want to give a surprise present..."

2768
01:49:24,461 --> 01:49:26,460
"for my wife on the day I go back..."

2769
01:49:26,461 --> 01:49:27,760
"and console her."

2770
01:49:27,761 --> 01:49:30,430
- How sweet. - "But I have no idea..."

2771
01:49:30,431 --> 01:49:31,501
"what to get her."

2772
01:49:31,601 --> 01:49:34,370
"For your information, my wife was born in 1993."

2773
01:49:34,371 --> 01:49:36,271
"Her MBTI type is ENFJ."

2774
01:49:36,371 --> 01:49:39,140
"She's interested in fashion and her favorite color is red."

2775
01:49:39,141 --> 01:49:40,771
- He should buy a bag. - Nice.

2776
01:49:40,871 --> 01:49:43,610
"I want to make her happy with a wise choice in the present."

2777
01:49:43,611 --> 01:49:45,110
"Please pick a present, experts."

2778
01:49:45,111 --> 01:49:46,511
A Van Cleef and Arpels necklace.

2779
01:49:47,811 --> 01:49:50,551
- I'm sure of it. A red one. - A Van Cleef and Arpels necklace.

2780
01:49:51,121 --> 01:49:53,481
She was born in 1993. She is ENFJ. She'd like the necklace.

2781
01:49:53,821 --> 01:49:55,890
How realistic. We got the brand name.

2782
01:49:55,891 --> 01:49:56,921
A bracelet or a necklace.

2783
01:49:57,821 --> 01:49:59,920
- Have you decided? - I've decided.

2784
01:49:59,921 --> 01:50:00,960
- Have you decided? - Yes.

2785
01:50:00,961 --> 01:50:02,330
- Okay. - Where should he buy it?

2786
01:50:02,331 --> 01:50:05,030
- At a Van Cleef and Arpels store. - In Lisbon or Abu Dhabi?

2787
01:50:05,031 --> 01:50:06,471
It'll be better to buy it in Lisbon.

2788
01:50:06,931 --> 01:50:08,971
He should accompany it with wine from Lisbon.

2789
01:50:09,371 --> 01:50:11,541
Give her the lefthander wine and the necklace.

2790
01:50:11,641 --> 01:50:12,641
The lefthander wine.

2791
01:50:12,642 --> 01:50:13,717
- Totally. - That sounds great.

2792
01:50:13,741 --> 01:50:16,410
So he should buy it here, not in Korea.

2793
01:50:16,411 --> 01:50:17,411
She'll like it better.

2794
01:50:17,511 --> 01:50:19,410
A Van Cleef and Arpels necklace and wine.

2795
01:50:19,411 --> 01:50:20,910
(Young Ji's solution: A necklace and wine from Lisbon)

2796
01:50:20,911 --> 01:50:24,750
Since he's here, shall we get a list of the presents...

2797
01:50:24,751 --> 01:50:26,451
he has given her?

2798
01:50:26,551 --> 01:50:28,290
(Connecting to the person who sent the story)

2799
01:50:28,291 --> 01:50:29,291
(Laughing)

2800
01:50:29,291 --> 01:50:30,291
(Anonymity not guaranteed.)

2801
01:50:30,292 --> 01:50:33,720
- What were the presents? - I haven't given her many presents.

2802
01:50:33,721 --> 01:50:34,860
I see.

2803
01:50:34,861 --> 01:50:36,531
Then a handwritten letter is nice.

2804
01:50:36,691 --> 01:50:39,461
If I spend the money and get her a present,

2805
01:50:40,331 --> 01:50:41,370
she goes, "Why did you buy this?"

2806
01:50:41,371 --> 01:50:43,071
- She doesn't like my taste. - I see.

2807
01:50:43,171 --> 01:50:45,201
- The emcee knows... - Yes.

2808
01:50:45,301 --> 01:50:47,600
The person who sent the story and his wife.

2809
01:50:47,601 --> 01:50:49,470
- You guys are close. - That's right. I know them well.

2810
01:50:49,471 --> 01:50:51,881
What kind of a present do you think she'll like?

2811
01:50:52,211 --> 01:50:53,411
- A present for her? - Yes.

2812
01:50:53,941 --> 01:50:55,011
(Sighing)

2813
01:50:55,351 --> 01:50:58,151
To be honest, I think she'll like cash.

2814
01:50:58,921 --> 01:51:00,980
- Cash is the best. - It's the best.

2815
01:51:00,981 --> 01:51:03,251
I have a similar answer.

2816
01:51:04,121 --> 01:51:06,461
It's hard to receive a present...

2817
01:51:06,661 --> 01:51:09,190
that suits your taste perfectly.

2818
01:51:09,191 --> 01:51:10,191
That's right.

2819
01:51:10,231 --> 01:51:12,530
When you prepare a surprise present...

2820
01:51:12,531 --> 01:51:14,401
from abroad,

2821
01:51:14,601 --> 01:51:16,530
it's hard for the recipient to like it by 100 percent.

2822
01:51:16,531 --> 01:51:17,817
- It isn't easy. - The probability is low.

2823
01:51:17,841 --> 01:51:20,770
- However, cash isn't romantic. - No.

2824
01:51:20,771 --> 01:51:23,941
Thus, I think they should go to the department store together.

2825
01:51:24,641 --> 01:51:25,641
That's a good idea.

2826
01:51:26,081 --> 01:51:29,011
"Honey, didn't you buy anything..."

2827
01:51:29,211 --> 01:51:30,311
"in Portugal?"

2828
01:51:30,411 --> 01:51:32,180
- Seriously. - You bought something, right?

2829
01:51:32,181 --> 01:51:33,181
Didn't you buy anything?

2830
01:51:33,182 --> 01:51:34,991
I've been busy with the shoot.

2831
01:51:35,391 --> 01:51:37,860
- I... - Producer Geon Jun, get out.

2832
01:51:37,861 --> 01:51:40,621
For goodness' sake. There is no hope for him.

2833
01:51:41,291 --> 01:51:43,060
He can't give an excuse of, "I was too busy."

2834
01:51:43,061 --> 01:51:44,960
She is in the same field.

2835
01:51:44,961 --> 01:51:46,400
That's right. It makes no sense.

2836
01:51:46,401 --> 01:51:48,100
- She'll know everything... - That's right.

2837
01:51:48,101 --> 01:51:49,401
About his day.

2838
01:51:50,201 --> 01:51:51,901
- What now? - Yu Jin.

2839
01:51:52,171 --> 01:51:53,171
I think...

2840
01:51:53,571 --> 01:51:57,611
he should buy a postcard in Portugal...

2841
01:51:57,711 --> 01:52:00,311
- and write a heartfelt message. - Yes. That's the best.

2842
01:52:00,411 --> 01:52:02,451
Then he should take her out to buy her a present.

2843
01:52:03,081 --> 01:52:05,321
Get the present wrapped...

2844
01:52:05,421 --> 01:52:07,021
with the letter.

2845
01:52:07,281 --> 01:52:09,650
- When she opens it at home, - That's a good idea.

2846
01:52:09,651 --> 01:52:10,820
- she'll find the letter. - Yes.

2847
01:52:10,821 --> 01:52:12,860
"When did you write this?" There will be a present too.

2848
01:52:12,861 --> 01:52:14,861
- "I bought it in Portugal." - It'll be very nice.

2849
01:52:14,991 --> 01:52:16,660
I realized this during the conversation.

2850
01:52:16,661 --> 01:52:20,701
We're just talking about our dream present.

2851
01:52:20,801 --> 01:52:24,201
It should be related to the country he visited.

2852
01:52:24,301 --> 01:52:27,871
I don't think it should be an expensive bag or jewelry.

2853
01:52:28,311 --> 01:52:30,210
- I prefer a postcard. - A postcard.

2854
01:52:30,211 --> 01:52:32,081
- Yes. It'll be very nice. - Then...

2855
01:52:32,181 --> 01:52:33,280
Yu Jin thinks he should get a postcard...

2856
01:52:33,281 --> 01:52:34,340
and deliver his sincerity.

2857
01:52:34,341 --> 01:52:35,350
(Yu Jin's solution: Buy a present together at a department store...)

2858
01:52:35,351 --> 01:52:36,410
(and give a message that's written on a postcard from Portugal.)

2859
01:52:36,411 --> 01:52:39,121
Let's talk about our dream presents. How about you, Mimi?

2860
01:52:39,221 --> 01:52:40,580
Put yourself in her shoes.

2861
01:52:40,581 --> 01:52:44,661
Your husband goes, "Honey, I'm back."

2862
01:52:44,761 --> 01:52:46,061
It's 1 of the 2.

2863
01:52:46,491 --> 01:52:49,291
Cash or diamond.

2864
01:52:50,161 --> 01:52:51,200
The queen of earthly desires.

2865
01:52:51,201 --> 01:52:53,561
- Mimi, what's up with you? - The queen of earthly desires.

2866
01:52:53,661 --> 01:52:56,030
(Mimi's solution: Cash or diamond)

2867
01:52:56,031 --> 01:52:57,200
(Cash or diamond)

2868
01:52:57,201 --> 01:52:58,340
(A present from a department store and a postcard from Portugal)

2869
01:52:58,341 --> 01:52:59,470
(A necklace and Portuguese wine)

2870
01:52:59,471 --> 01:53:00,571
Producer Shin Geon Jun.

2871
01:53:01,371 --> 01:53:02,971
Please pick one.

2872
01:53:03,971 --> 01:53:05,341
As soon as I heard one solution...

2873
01:53:05,681 --> 01:53:07,481
- You felt a hunch. - I felt a hunch.

2874
01:53:08,251 --> 01:53:09,351
Is it Van Cleef and Arpels?

2875
01:53:10,681 --> 01:53:15,021
(Among the three solutions, which one does he like the best?)

2876
01:53:15,791 --> 01:53:17,990
It's Yu Jin's solution.

2877
01:53:17,991 --> 01:53:19,360
(He chooses Yu Jin's solution.)

2878
01:53:19,361 --> 01:53:21,461
I liked the idea involving a postcard...

2879
01:53:21,561 --> 01:53:23,601
- and the department store. - The department store.

2880
01:53:23,931 --> 01:53:25,660
- It's a good idea. - I can show her that I thought...

2881
01:53:25,661 --> 01:53:26,760
- about her during my trip... - She is smart.

2882
01:53:26,761 --> 01:53:28,170
While giving her the present...

2883
01:53:28,171 --> 01:53:29,900
- she wants. - That's right.

2884
01:53:29,901 --> 01:53:32,401
It's really nice since it's a mix of dream and reality.

2885
01:53:32,601 --> 01:53:33,700
- That's right. - It has both.

2886
01:53:33,701 --> 01:53:34,840
She killed 2 birds with 1 stone.

2887
01:53:34,841 --> 01:53:36,170
- Two birds. - Two birds.

2888
01:53:36,171 --> 01:53:37,940
- Two birds. - Two birds.

2889
01:53:37,941 --> 01:53:39,381
- Yes. - Two birds.

2890
01:53:39,841 --> 01:53:40,881
Nice.

2891
01:53:41,081 --> 01:53:43,050
Producer Geon Jun, if you can, please do...

2892
01:53:43,051 --> 01:53:44,450
the postcard, department store, a break from the childcare,

2893
01:53:44,451 --> 01:53:46,281
a Van Cleef and Arpels necklace, and wine.

2894
01:53:46,951 --> 01:53:48,720
- Do all of them. - She is having a hard time.

2895
01:53:48,721 --> 01:53:50,451
- Childcare is exhausting. - I agree.

2896
01:53:51,321 --> 01:53:52,360
Congratulations.

2897
01:53:52,361 --> 01:53:54,091
(Yu Jin wins a bottle of wine.)

2898
01:53:54,661 --> 01:53:56,961
(All three members get a bottle each.)

(Camera detox)

2903
01:54:06,218 --> 01:54:07,687
(What are you doing?)

2904
01:54:07,688 --> 01:54:10,487
(I work hard because there are cameras.)

2905
01:54:10,488 --> 01:54:11,827
(What if we do something fun when there are no cameras?)

2906
01:54:11,828 --> 01:54:12,997
(We'll take care of it.)

01:54:30,108 --> 01:54:31,718
It's not a tteokbokki party.

2916
01:54:31,918 --> 01:54:33,418
What's a Jade Emperor party?

2917

(The agents are back after completing the mission.)

2918
01:54:35,988 --> 01:54:37,757
- Cheers. - Cheers.

2919

2920
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,787

Out!

Why?

2948
01:55:49,588 --> 01:55:51,027
Because she is locked up.

2949
01:55:51,028 --> 01:55:52,058
I want to do that.

2950
01:55:52,458 --> 01:55:54,828
- People aren't letting her go. - Why?

2951
01:55:56,428 --> 01:55:58,598

Please let me do that.

Please.
