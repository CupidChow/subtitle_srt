1
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:11,836
(Earth Arcade 3)

2
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:13,236
(Previously)

3
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:15,235
(Figuring out Torong's scheme)

4
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:17,045
(One rabbit...)

5
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:18,375
(stole a corporate card.)

6
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:21,416
(The agents came to Abu Dhabi to catch Torong.)

7
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:22,815
(Hello.)

8
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:23,816
(Are you Agent F?)

9
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:26,346
(They had a secret rendezvous with Cheol Yong...)

10
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:27,755
(and went on an undercover operation.)

11
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:29,715
(Someone to our left recognized us!)

12
00:00:29,716 --> 00:00:31,385
(Payment notification for plane tickets)

13
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:33,385
(There are tickets for 2 people. 2 people got on that flight.)

14
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:34,855
(He ran away with Cheol Yong.)

15
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:35,895
Was he a spy?

16
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:38,066
(The traitor, Cheol Yong, showed his true colors.)

17
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:41,365
(The quick-witted Torong ran away to Lisbon.)

18
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:42,665
(I took your prized possessions.)

19
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,265
(Yu Jin's bag, Mimi's slippers, laptop, Yang Hee Eun's glasses case)

20
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:46,266
(We need to pretend to be backpackers.)

21
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:48,676
(They followed Torong to Lisbon.)

22
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:50,646
(But they didn't hear any news.)

23
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:52,306
(The agents grew bored.)

24
00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:53,575
It's suspicious.

25
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:55,445
(Picking on the production crew)

26
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:57,146
(Why did you guys sit there?)

27
00:00:57,286 --> 00:01:00,255
(Don't suddenly quit your job at eggiscoming.)

28
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:01,256
(Don't do that.)

29
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:03,255
(You can't leave after seeing us at our worst.)

30
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:04,785
(Is this the advance party?)

31
00:01:04,786 --> 00:01:05,786
(They gave a comedy skit early in the morning.)

32
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:07,125
(Running away)

33
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:08,596
Why did they bring their bags?

34
00:01:08,956 --> 00:01:10,266
(My goodness)

35
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:12,025
(After breakfast)

36
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:14,665
- We're meeting up at 10am. - What time is it now?

37
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,035
It's 8:47am.

38
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:17,906
Why don't you know when you have your phone now?

39
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:19,765
I got used to leaving it behind.

40
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:21,075
What was the point of giving her phone back?

41
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:22,605
She doesn't carry it around.

42
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:23,705
- She doesn't need it. - See you later.

43
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:24,806
See you later.

44
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:28,476
(The lodging becomes much quieter.)

45
00:01:28,976 --> 00:01:30,545
(People who are left behind.)

46
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:32,516
(About people who are left behind)

47
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:34,655
(For a short while, )

48
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:36,516
(please watch the show from the crew's perspective.)

49
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:39,186
(Let us tell you about the E-cade members.)

50
00:01:39,886 --> 00:01:43,296
(They never travel quietly.)

51
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:45,095
(Come on.)

52
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:46,096
(Clap.)

53
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,466
(Clapping)

54
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,806
(People at the front, clap as well.)

55
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:52,906
(There are people behind the E-cade members.)

56
00:01:53,106 --> 00:01:54,206
(Screaming)

57
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:55,906
The plates are so big.

58
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:58,446
(We always need to steel our hearts due to the sudden feistiness.)

59
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:00,006
(Hey!)

60
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:01,846
(They torment the production crew regularly.)

61
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:05,345
(It's their hobby to start the purgatory of feistiness.)

62
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:07,285
Director Chang Dae, when do you have...

63
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:08,816
- a mental breakdown? - Be honest.

64
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:10,556
- In the car. - In the car?

65
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:13,756
It's now.

66
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:15,126
- Why? - Why?

67
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:17,926
It's hard when there isn't a theme.

68
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,496
It's like, "Should I film this or not?"

69
00:02:20,636 --> 00:02:21,836
(Meanwhile, )

70
00:02:22,236 --> 00:02:24,335
(the E-cade members are resting as usual.)

71
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:26,866
(Let's get our energy level up.)

72
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:28,436
(Nearby, )

73
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:31,876
(the production crew hurriedly sets something up.)

74
00:02:32,206 --> 00:02:33,345
They're setting up the cameras.

75
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:34,346
(They spot the production crew being busy.)
- Let's go. - Let's go.

76
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:38,785
(They go to the filming location in a cheerful state.)

77
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:41,415
The directors are too tired.

78
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,285
The directors need the Exhaustion Spirit.

79
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:44,725
- The Exhaustion Spirit. - We'll give them...

80
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:46,426
the Energy Drink Spirit.

81
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:49,526
(Making meaningless noises)

82
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:51,565
There you go.

83
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:53,325
- There you go. - Let's pray for them.

84
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:54,695
I love that I have my voice back.

85
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:56,065
- So good. - I have my voice back.

86
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,705
You have your voice back since you went to bed early.

87
00:02:57,706 --> 00:02:59,965
It would've been nice had I gotten it back sooner.

88
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:01,705
- I know. - My voice was sealed for a while.

89
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:03,306
- Young Ji, did you dry your hair? - I'm drying it now.

90
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:05,975
- Do you want the low airflow? - My goodness.

91
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:07,516
- Yes, please. - I'll turn it on.

92
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:10,816
(Yu Jin is here as well.)

93
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:12,885
("Dry Hair with Young Ji," reinterpreted by Lee Young Ji)

94
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:14,086
What are you doing?

95
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:15,456
Welcome.

96
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:16,756
This is...

97
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,786
Lee Young Ji's Natural Fan Time.

98
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,796
Here comes the low airflow.

99
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:25,126
(She starts off light.)

100
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:26,796
- Low airflow! - This is insane.

101
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:28,636
- Low airflow! - Low airflow!

102
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:30,196
- Medium airflow! - Medium airflow!

103
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:32,035
(Medium airflow that feels like high airflow)

104
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:33,536
Now comes the last one.

105
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:35,405
Let's enter the high airflow.

106
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:37,246
One, two, three. Let's go!

107
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:38,875
(Incredibly high airflow)

108
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,476
(The junior comedienne makes it funny.)

109
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:43,845
Let's make it fiery.

110
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:45,385
(It evolves into a fiery performance.)

111
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:46,386
(Screaming)

112
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:47,416
I hate it.

113
00:03:47,516 --> 00:03:48,715
(Absorbed)

114
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:49,756
(It's time to stop.)

115
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:51,655
- What is it? - So?

116
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:53,686
- So? - The console table will break.

117
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:55,355
Today,

118
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:58,195
we originally didn't have much plan other than resting for the morning.

119
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,365
- Okay. - A market will open later.

120
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,065
We love markets.

121
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,836
- We were going to buy souvenirs. - I love that plan.

122
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:06,635
(Near the National Pantheon, a historical site of Lisbon)

123
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:08,476
(National Pantheon, Market)

124
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:10,846
(Mercado de Santa Clara)

125
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,575
(It's full of antique items.)

126
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:17,346
If we leave you to be until then, you'll torment the staff members.

127
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:19,715
- So in a hurry... - What a reason.

128
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:20,856
- Seriously. - Right now,

129
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:22,615
quite a few people...

130
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:24,026
- want to quit. - Is that so?

131
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:26,725
"I want to quit if it's going to be like this."

132
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:29,025
- They're weak. - Yesterday, we suddenly ran...

133
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:30,696
- at that place with bicycles. - Yes.

134
00:04:30,796 --> 00:04:32,826
My camera director went, "I'm glad I'm in charge of Eun Ji."

135
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:35,636
(He spoke his mind.)

136
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:38,706
If we leave you to be, you'll torment the staff members.

137
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,975
- So we went through the storage. - The storage?

138
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,335
Did you get this from the storage?

139
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:43,575
- Yes. - How strange.

140
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:44,845
- We went through the storage. - What kind of storage...

141
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:47,716
We found something among the items we had brought...

142
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:49,475
just in case.

143
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:50,716
- What could it be? - Let's find out.

144
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:51,985
Yu Jin.

145
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:53,115
- Yu Jin? - Open the drawer.

146
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:54,716
- The drawer? Is there a drawer? - Is there a drawer?

147
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:56,116
There's a drawer.

148
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:58,556
(What will they find inside the drawer?)

149
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:00,126
What's this?
(A mysterious board)

150
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:04,325
I know what it is.

151
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:06,066
Yeong Mi!

152
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:07,296
Yeong Mi!

153
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,495
(The interim game they'll play)

154
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:10,606
It's curling.

155
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,065
It's the 4-on-4 curling.

156
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:14,005
- How will we play this? - It's mini curling.

157
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:17,105
Why do you think there are eight stones?

158
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:18,406
- Why is that? - A 4-on-4 match?

159
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:21,646
Today, you'll play against...

160
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,885
people who are the most exhausted because of you.

161
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:25,886
- They're the four youngest ones. - Okay.

162
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,616
- The 4 youngest ones. - The 4 youngest ones.

163
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:30,356
You'll play curling against the four youngest staff members.

164
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:33,086
- If you win, - Okay.

165
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:34,996
You'll receive...

166
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:37,296
- tasty coffee and egg tarts. - Egg tarts.

167
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:40,796
(The egg tart shop the agents visited on the first day)

168
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:42,596
(Impressed)

169
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:46,066
(The agents really enjoyed the egg tarts.)

170
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,205
(I could eat 12!)

171
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:49,436
(So we went back and got some more!)

172
00:05:50,436 --> 00:05:52,306
(Egg tarts and coffee)

173
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:54,275
- What if we fail to win? - Let's say that you fail to win.

174
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:56,015
I told you that we were going to the market later, right?

175
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:57,016
- Yes. - Yes.

176
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:58,846
If you fail to win by any chance,

177
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:01,916
you'll do something during the trip to the market.

178
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:03,816
Mouth Detox.

179
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:06,226
What? Hold on a second.

180
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:09,125
(If the agents fail to win, they'll undergo the Mouth Detox.)

181
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:10,826
(It means silence.)

182
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:12,565
(A customized mission for the E-cade members...)

183
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:13,825
(that hasn't been tried before)

184
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:14,865
- You don't want us to talk? - Hold on a second.

185
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:16,565
- That's too personal. - Hold on a second.

186
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:18,665
- You just want to silence us. - That's too personal.

187
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,775
- You just want to travel quietly. - Please be quiet.

188
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:22,606
- Please be quiet. - I mean...

189
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,375
What kind of a show does this?

190
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,675
If we succeed in it, we get egg tarts.

191
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,006
If we fail, we need to be quiet.

192
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,676
That's ridiculous.

193
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,245
Young Ji got her voice back today, right?

194
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:32,645
As soon as she began talking, Director Sun Woo...

195
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:35,015
took off and put on his headphones repeatedly.

196
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,315
(It's just another day for him.)

197
00:06:36,316 --> 00:06:37,386
He did it repeatedly.

198
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:39,455
It's worse because she got her voice back.

199
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:40,456
- Yes. - She got her voice back.

200
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:42,656
- I got my voice back. - It's different.

201
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:45,125
- Still, telling us to be quiet... - Seriously.

202
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:47,566
How could you ask the cast members to be quiet on a variety show?

203
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:50,136
We aren't asking you to do that for a long time.

204
00:06:50,436 --> 00:06:52,306
- Okay. - Just try to win. Yu Jin? Why...

205
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,136
- You're glaring. - I'm speaking with my eyes.

206
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:56,306
Look to the front.

207
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:57,875
Who are the youngest directors?

208
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:58,975
- The youngest ones, - Thus...

209
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:00,645
- please enter. - Please stand next to them.

210
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:02,546
- Please stand next to them. - They're the ones we saw yesterday.

211
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:05,145
- Hello. - Hello.

212
00:07:05,146 --> 00:07:06,585
- The youngest ones, please enter. - Thus...

213
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:07,685
- Please stand next to them. - We saw them yesterday.

214
00:07:07,686 --> 00:07:09,415
- Please stand next to them. - They're the ones we saw yesterday.

215
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,056
Please move to the red corner.

216
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:14,096
All right. They're the four youngest members.

217
00:07:15,126 --> 00:07:17,565
(The 4 youngest members)

218
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:20,225
We had fun looking at the pigeons yesterday.

219
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:22,266
How are they the youngest ones?

220
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:25,535
Are they the bosses among the younger members?

221
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:26,665
They're the ones...

222
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,505
who look away when we ask questions in the morning.

223
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:30,236
- Yes. - When we ask questions...

224
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:32,845
The girl with the hippie perm on the left,

225
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:34,716
- please say hello. - Ma Ru. Writer Ma Ru.

226
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:38,015
(Writer Ma Ru will introduce herself first.)

227
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:39,986
- Why is she Writer Ma Ru? - She resembles Ma Ru.

228
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:42,515
(She resembles Ma Ru.)

229
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:43,516
Hello.

230
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:45,055
I'm the youngest writer of Earth Arcade,

231
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:46,425
- Lee Ju Eun. - Hey.

232
00:07:46,426 --> 00:07:47,426
Ma Ru.

233
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:50,196
Can you tell us when you joined the company?

234
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:52,166
- I joined in 2021. - Okay.

235
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:53,525
It's quite recent.

236
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:54,665
(She has been a crew member since Season 1.)

237
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,735
What was the hardest about this shoot?

238
00:07:57,736 --> 00:07:59,636
- Be honest. Be totally honest. - Be honest.

239
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:01,636
- Pigeons? - Pigeons.

240
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:02,976
Pigeons?

241
00:08:02,977 --> 00:08:04,005
(Let us explain which pigeons she's talking about.)

242
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:05,676
It was the most fun we had.

243
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:07,846
(Yesterday, when they went on their separate ways for photos, )

244
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:10,275
(this incident occurred.)

245
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:11,315
(Writer Ma Ru)

246
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,116
(She diligently shooed away the pigeons.)

247
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:15,755
After I came back, the work in the afternoon was hard.

248
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:16,756
Right.

249
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:18,325
- You became traumatized. - It's understandable.

250
00:08:18,326 --> 00:08:20,325
I'm the youngest writer of Earth Arcade,

251
00:08:20,326 --> 00:08:22,795
Choi Ye Ji. I'm Ju Eun's junior by one year.

252
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:23,825
Okay.

253
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:26,595
By the way, her face has the vibe of a dance club.

254
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:28,936
- That's right. - I think she was in a dance club.

255
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:30,035
K-pop.

256
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:31,065
(A former dance club member and a K-pop fan)

257
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,135
(Refer to the field day episode of Channel Fullmoon.)

258
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,005
- Yu Jin. - She should compete against Yu Jin.

259
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,736
(Yu Jin knows about her reputation.)

260
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:39,805
(A face-off with "After Like")

261
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:42,376
(The perfect mirror mode)

262
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,546
(Her coworkers look away.)

263
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:48,655
- That's incredible. - Her hips were unrivaled.

264
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:50,986
- That's incredible. - That's incredible.

265
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,126
- Gosh, what's wrong with her? - That's incredible.

266
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:54,955
I told you not to do that.

267
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:56,056
(The next member)

268
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:58,026
How about Producer YooA?

269
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,795
(Is the next one Producer YooA?)

270
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:01,295
- Producer YooA. - Producer YooA.

271
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:02,635
Hello, please introduce yourself.

272
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:05,535
I'm the youngest producer of Earth Arcade, Myeong Ji Min.

273
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:06,865
- Producer Ji Min. - Producer Ji Min.

274
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:08,105
She suppresses her laughter well.

275
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:10,476
She really looks like YooA of OH MY GIRL.

276
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:11,845
(Hiding her own face)

277
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:13,405
- You're beautiful. - How old are you?

278
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:14,916
- I'm 31. - Okay.

279
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:16,045
She's my age.

280
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:17,175
- She's Mimi's age. - We're the same age.

281
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:18,285
She's YooA's age too.

282
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:19,346
Hello.

283
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:20,615
Hello.

284
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:22,816
I'm the youngest producer of Earth Arcade, Ahn Young Eun.

285
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:24,226
The youngest...

286
00:09:24,726 --> 00:09:27,556
Young Eun, what was hard about this shoot?

287
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:30,966
It's my first time working nonstop...

288
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:36,166
(Producer Young Eun's throat closed up.)

289
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:38,005
- Her throat closed up. - Her throat closed up.

290
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:39,066
Just now,

291
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:40,605
she teared up when she said,

292
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:41,936
"It's my first time working nonstop..."

293
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:44,146
(Tearing up)

294
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:46,106
Which shows have you worked on?

295
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:48,176
- "Jinny's Kitchen." - "Jinny's Kitchen."

296
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:50,075
- "Youn's Unexpected Journey." - Which one?

297
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:52,116
- "Youn's Unexpected Journey." - "Youn's Unexpected Journey."

298
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:53,716
We're definitely different, right?

299
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:56,315
- My ears hurt. - Your ears hurt.

300
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:57,685
(Laughing)

301
00:09:57,686 --> 00:09:58,986
She didn't even say much.

302
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:01,656
Let's win. Let's win and eat.

303
00:10:01,856 --> 00:10:03,296
Do you have a team slogan?

304
00:10:03,526 --> 00:10:04,596
We prepared it.

305
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:06,526
(Passionate)

306
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:07,736
Show us.

307
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:09,995
(Laughing)

308
00:10:09,996 --> 00:10:11,365
(They become embarrassed.)

309
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:12,366
You can do it.

310
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:13,765
One, two, three.

311
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:16,076
- We want a promotion! - We want a promotion!

312
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,276
(The youngest members want a promotion.)

313
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,916
- That's cute. - "We want a promotion!"

314
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:23,975
"We want a promotion!"

315
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:25,115
"We want to speak?"

316
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:26,215
- Shall we begin? - Okay.

317
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:27,285
Three, two, one.

318
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:29,516
- We want to speak! - We want to speak!

319
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,526
(Benchmarking against the youngest staff members)

320
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:33,586
(They want to avoid the mouth detox.)

321
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:35,655
You've watched a curling match on TV, right?

322
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:36,825
- Yeong Mi. - Yeong Mi.

323
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:38,266
(4-on-4 Mini Curling)

324
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:40,936
The closer your stones get...

325
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:42,795
to the center circle,

326
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:44,265
- the better it is. - Okay.

327
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:45,466
(Example number 1)

328
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:47,935
(If your stone doesn't go past this line, )

329
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,975
(it's out!)

330
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:51,276
(Example number 2)

331
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:53,375
(If your stone goes past this line, )

332
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,615
(it survives on the board even though the score is 0 points!)

333
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:56,846
(Example number 3)

334
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:00,685
(If your stone lands on the target, )

335
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:02,556
(you win a point!)

336
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:05,626
(The closer it is to the center, the better it is.)

337
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:08,826
(1 point, so it's 1 to 0.)

338
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:12,326
(1 point and 1 point, so it's 2 to 0.)

339
00:11:12,826 --> 00:11:15,196
(The rules might appear complicated, but you'll learn them in no time.)

340
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:16,496
- You'll play to five points. - Okay.

341
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:18,236
- Go, Yu Jin. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

342
00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:19,666
- Get it. - You can do it.

343
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:21,105
Pull up your confidence.

344
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:23,375
Your confidence will go down if you lose.

345
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:24,476
It's a K-pop match.

346
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:26,276
- It's K-pop versus K-pop. - It's a K-pop match.

347
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:28,416
- Play or lose... - What's up with her pose?

348
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:29,845
(Edgy)

349
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,146
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

350
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:34,116
- Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

351
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:38,056
(She gets her confidence back.)

352
00:11:38,426 --> 00:11:40,285
- Go 1st. - Go 1st.

353
00:11:40,286 --> 00:11:41,295
(Team Youngest will start.)

354
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:43,496
(Blue for Team Youngest, orange for Team E-caders)

355
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:45,196
- Ju Eun. - Ma Ru, sniff.

356
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:48,296
- Ju Eun, good luck. Let's go. - Ju Eun!

357
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:50,906
(Ma Ru, sniff, Ma Ru, prick up, Ma Ru, bite)

358
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:53,806
Ma Ru, sniff, Ma Ru, prick up, Ma Ru, bite

359
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:56,106
(Out)

360
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:58,306
(It's hard to control your strength.)

361
00:11:58,476 --> 00:12:00,376
- It's okay. - It's okay.

362
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:02,376
(Spitting)

363
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:03,415
Do it with seriousness. You can do well.

364
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,885
- You can do it. - Let's go.

365
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:06,246
- You can do it. Stay calm. - Let's...

366
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:08,256
Slide it over.

367
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:13,586
(It smoothly lands in the center.)

368
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:15,356
It was perfect.

369
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:17,296
(Well done.)

370
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:18,726
For goodness' sake.

371
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:21,236
Don't flick the stone. Push it like this.

372
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:23,196
- I have a tip. - What is it?

373
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:25,166
Aim far...

374
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:26,406
and keep your hand relaxed.

375
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,275
(Like this)

376
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:30,175
- Okay. - It was beginner's luck.

377
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:32,306
Thanks to the digital detox...

378
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:34,976
I'm sorry, but why did you say, "It was beginner's luck?"

379
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:37,746
You're showing favoritism for this team.

380
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:39,716
(If Team E-caders lose, they'll get the Mouth Detox.)

381
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:41,885
You should go, "Lee Young Ji!"

382
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,486
- Lee Young Ji! - Lee Young Ji!

383
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:46,085
(She only got the cheers after she asked for them.)

384
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:47,485
- Thank you. - Thank you very much.

385
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:48,896
- Next player. - Who is it?

386
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:50,355
- All right. - OH MY GIRL.

387
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:51,426
She has pretty dimples.

388
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,766
You'll go out.

389
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:54,835
Go out.

390
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:56,066
Nice shot!

391
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:57,836
Nice shot!

392
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:02,135
Let's go!

393
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:03,705
What? How is she so good at this?

394
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:05,376
- You can do it. - What was that?

395
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:06,746
Fire fox.

396
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:08,476
- Fox Club. - Fox Club.

397
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:10,116
- Fox Club. - Keep your hand relaxed.

398
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:11,886
Nice.

399
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:13,886
(Out)

400
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:17,086
(Mouth Detox begins to approach them.)

401
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:20,326
I don't think it's a bad idea to travel quietly.

402
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,296
(A pained smile)

403
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:23,926
Hello.

404
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:25,896
- Hello. - Hello.

405
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:27,936
I think she'll do badly.

406
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:33,366
- It's a stable shot. - Not bad.

407
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:35,106
It'll go in next time. Not bad.

408
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:36,976
(Kim Mi Hyun is the next player.)

409
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:39,175
- The stones are blocking the path. - Just...

410
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:40,805
- Keep it easy. - Take one out.

411
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:41,876
Mimi.

412
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:42,916
Let's go.

413
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:48,415
(It curves and lands on the target.)

414
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,355
(Team E-caders gains a big advantage.)

415
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:51,356
You did so well.

416
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:52,786
(She discovered her talent.)

417
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,756
You did so well.

418
00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:57,196
- We're doing better. - We're doing better.

419
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,065
(A celebration ceremony)

420
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:02,966
(Singing indecipherable words)

421
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:05,636
(Writer Dance Club enters.)

422
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:08,706
(A customized distraction tactic for a former dance club member)

423
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,006
Don't move to the rhythm!

424
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:13,006
Don't move to the rhythm!

425
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:14,716
No! Don't do that!

426
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:16,546
Don't do that.

427
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,045
Don't move to the rhythm!

428
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,546
(She can't hide her dancing DNA.)

429
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:20,816
(She gets her senses back and focuses!)

430
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:22,555
- Focus. - It was the perfect song.

431
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:23,556
Don't get distracted.

432
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:26,986
- Hey! - There you go.

433
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:30,756
- Hey! - There you go.

434
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,665
(She easily pushed off Team E-caders' stone.)

435
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,795
How is she so good at it?

436
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,496
- What's this? - How is she so good at it?

437
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:38,535
- How is she so good at it? - What's this? I mean...

438
00:14:38,536 --> 00:14:39,536
What?

439
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,206
(Shouting)

440
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:43,406
(They've been cheering for Team Youngest.)

441
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:45,005
- What? - Come on!

442
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:47,106
- It's their first time. - Please don't get too excited.

443
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,546
Please root for us as well.

444
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:50,216
- I'm sorry. - I'm so sensitive right now.

445
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:52,386
I'm so sensitive right now.

446
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,356
(The most sensitive one in the area)

447
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:57,726
(While the older girls show their feisty side, )

448
00:14:58,456 --> 00:15:00,526
(the last player enters quietly.)

449
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:03,195
(Concentrating without a motion)

450
00:15:03,196 --> 00:15:05,165
My goodness.

451
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,126
Yu Jin, you can do it. You're our Ma Ru.

452
00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:09,166
- You're our puppy. - Yu Jin is determined.

453
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:15,076
Nice. Not bad.

454
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:18,105
(What happens now?)

455
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:19,605
It's over. Round One is over.

456
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:21,005
- What? - Round One is over.

457
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:22,045
Let's calculate the score.

458
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,075
(The score for Round 1 will be announced.)

459
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:25,815
The blue stone that's the closest to the center...

460
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:28,116
gets one point.

461
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:29,585
Then come the orange ones.

462
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:31,956
But the orange ones don't count. So it's 1 to 0.

463
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:34,656
- It's 1 to 0. - Okay.

464
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:37,725
- Congratulations. - I want to point something out.

465
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:38,996
Your celebration is lacking.

466
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:40,996
You need to do more to celebrate it.

467
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,896
- Three, two, one. Let's go. - Shall we show them?

468
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:44,165
(Can you keep up?)

469
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,836
(Singing indecipherable words)

470
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:49,876
(They seize control with an intense performance.)

471
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:52,976
We're used to such antics.

472
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:55,046
(Don't look down on our experience on Earth Arcade.)

473
00:15:57,986 --> 00:15:59,645
You're so serious.

474
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:01,786
Why are you so serious?

475
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:02,986
I need to speak.

476
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:04,415
(An earnest plea)

477
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,025
- "I need to speak." - Hey.

478
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:07,055
(Let me speak.)

479
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:08,355
She's so cute.

480
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:09,396
Shall we begin?

481
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:10,825
- Shall we go first? - Shall we begin?

482
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:12,325
- Eun Ji, go 1st. - Okay. I'll go 1st.

483
00:16:12,326 --> 00:16:13,565
It's no joke.

484
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:14,666
Eun Ji, do well.

485
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:16,165
- Think of us. - Okay.

486
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,865
- Think of our cute acts. - Okay.

487
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:19,005
- Let's do this. - Let's speak.

488
00:16:19,006 --> 00:16:21,235
- Let's speak in the car. - We...

489
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:22,406
We need to chat.

490
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:24,306
(Out)

491
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,776
- Nice shot. - It's okay.

492
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:28,715
It's okay.

493
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:30,445
- It's okay. - I'm sorry.

494
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:31,646
(Sorry)

495
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,886
(The first player, Producer Young Eun)

496
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:38,426
(Attacking with her gums)

497
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:40,625
My lonely days

498
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:42,626
- It's a goodbye now - It's a goodbye now

499
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:44,495
- Goodbye. - It's a wordplay on her name.

500
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:45,866
Goodbye, Ahn Young Eun.

501
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,396
Goodbye

502
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:48,836
Goodbye, Ahn Young Eun.

503
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:50,796
(Goodbye, stone.)

504
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,935
- Their attack worked. - It's pressuring.

505
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:54,735
It gets more pressuring each time.

506
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:56,176
- Number two. - Shall I go next?

507
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:58,606
- Our girl with the Midas touch. - I want to be crazy

508
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,546
(The girl with the Midas touch enters.)

509
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:02,976
The Midas touch. That's good.

510
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:10,316
It's okay.

511
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:11,926
(Good)

512
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:13,786
(The board is still clean.)

513
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:16,456
- It's okay. - You can't predict the result.

514
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:20,396
Ma Ru, sniff, Ma Ru, prick up, Ma Ru, bite

515
00:17:20,426 --> 00:17:22,266
Come on! No!

516
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:24,665
Let's do this.

517
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,735
Good.

518
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:27,266
- Prize! - Prize!

519
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:29,536
(They'll get a gift card if they win.)

520
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:31,205
Yu Jin, good luck.

521
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:32,806
- Good luck. - Let's push it off.

522
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:35,346
(A blue stone is in the way.)

523
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:36,876
Let's push it off.

524
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:42,786
(She pushed it to the center.)

525
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:45,885
It's okay.

526
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:48,396
Your stone is at the front. It's okay.

527
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:50,825
- Prize! - Thank you!

528
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:51,925
Thank you!

529
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,366
(They're one step closer to the gift card.)

530
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:54,895
- It's okay. - I imagined people cheering...

531
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:56,536
when Yu Jin's stone pushed the blue stone, right?

532
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:57,766
(Shouting)

533
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,065
(He was about to cheer.)

534
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:00,606
(Then he acted like he didn't cheer.)

535
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,935
- You imagined it. - Did I imagine it?

536
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:03,105
Yes, you imagined it.

537
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:05,506
(A detection dog for partial ruling)

538
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:07,145
- I was so sad that I cried. - It's like a reaction video.

539
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:08,945
I know. If you commentate like this,

540
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:10,916
- people will complain. - We bawled.

541
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,546
You bawled?

542
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:14,885
Put it in the center.

543
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,756
She parted her hair differently.

544
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:19,386
(Team E-caders, Team Youngest)

545
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,596
(She concentrates and sets off to push the stone.)

546
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:23,456
It'll push my stone to the center.

547
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:25,225
- We got this. - Hit the orange stone.

548
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:26,265
- The orange stone. - Hit the orange stone.

549
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:27,795
- The orange one. - Put it right next to our stone.

550
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:30,096
- The orange stone. - Just put it there.

551
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:33,005
(They surround her and attack her eardrums.)

552
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:34,776
- Hit the orange stone. - Make it hard for them.

553
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:38,345
- Not bad. - Good.

554
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:40,076
- We have Young Ji. - Am I the last player?

555
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:42,575
- Young Ji, you're last. - Push it off.

556
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:43,676
Young Ji, let's show them.

557
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:46,016
I like seeing that side of her.

558
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:50,656
Young Ji!

559
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:53,626
(She pushes off the blue stone.)

560
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:56,355
You did so well.

561
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:57,796
How did you do that?

562
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,696
Let's go.

563
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:01,895
- Let's, let's, let's go. - Let's go. Hey.

564
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:02,965
Prepare a celebration performance.

565
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:03,966
- Okay. - You're so good.

566
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:06,335
- She'll mess things up. - Okay.

567
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:07,336
You can do it.

568
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:08,636
- Mimi, sing a song by OH MY GIRL. - Okay.

569
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:10,706
(I got it.)

570
00:19:10,806 --> 00:19:12,305
(Ding diring diridingdingding)

571
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:13,876
(Oh, nan nan nan nana nan)

572
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:15,515
(Noise-cancelling)

573
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:17,216
(Cancelling the noise-cancelling function)

574
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:18,886
Let's go.

575
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,516
(Out)

576
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:23,186
- All right. - Our stone is closer.

577
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:25,055
Give us the score.

578
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:26,686
- We get one point. - One point.

579
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:28,096
(1 point)

580
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:29,256
(Round 2, Team E-caders: 1, Team Youngest: 1)

581
00:19:29,257 --> 00:19:31,326
Who's the next player? Let's get it.

582
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:33,196
(it's a close match of 1 to 1.)

583
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,396
- Ma Ru, sniff, Ma Ru, bite - Ma Ru, sniff, Ma Ru, bite

584
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:36,936
Let's go.

585
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:40,836
- Okay. - Out.

586
00:19:41,036 --> 00:19:42,576
(Attacking with her gums)

587
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:44,376
(Attacked)

588
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:47,045
- Beautiful producer, Ahn Young Eun! - Ahn Young Eun!

589
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:48,845
- Hello. - Beautiful producer!

590
00:19:48,846 --> 00:19:49,846
Ahn Young Eun!

591
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:53,716
- What are you doing? - Good.

592
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:55,485
(Even Producer Ji Min who did well earlier)

593
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,416
- That's rushed. - Let's see your skills.

594
00:19:57,956 --> 00:19:59,125
(She ends up assisting Team E-caders.)

595
00:19:59,126 --> 00:20:01,925
- It's even better. - It's even better.

596
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:03,056
It's even better.

597
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:07,566
(Round 3, Team E-caders: 3, Team Youngest: 1)

598
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:09,336
Mimi, just relax.

599
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:10,596
Mimi.

600
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:15,475
- How is she so good at it? - You did so well.

601
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:16,836
Let's go.

602
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,876
- Well done, Yu Jin. - It's okay.

603
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:22,346
(Now comes the last shot.)

604
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:26,615
- It's on the line. - We won.

605
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:27,685
- Good. - It's 4 to 1.

606
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,555
- We're doing well. - Well done.

607
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:31,626
- We're doing very well. - We're doing well.

608
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,385
- This is hard. - Let's do this for real.

609
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:34,826
You should try going first.

610
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:36,196
We'll go first.

611
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:38,695
- Eun Ji, good luck. - Good luck. You can do it.

612
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,565
- I want to do well. - Eun Ji, show us.

613
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:42,766
- Korea's representative comedienne. - I really want to do this.

614
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,936
All right.

615
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:47,006
- Nice. - My goodness.

616
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:48,306
It landed.

617
00:20:48,476 --> 00:20:49,875
(Nice)

618
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:51,745
It landed.

619
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:53,976
- It landed. - Good.

620
00:20:56,476 --> 00:20:57,915
(Attacking with the whites of her eyes)

621
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:58,946
Push it off.

622
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:02,715
- It's okay. - Good.

623
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:04,315
- Not bad. - Not bad.

624
00:21:04,316 --> 00:21:05,385
Not bad.

625
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:06,525
- It's in the way. - Mimi.

626
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:08,055
(The ace player, Mimi goes next.)

627
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:09,295
- Mimi, good luck. - She's an ace player.

628
00:21:09,296 --> 00:21:11,026
- It'll be bad if she hits it. - It's a dessert. It's an egg tart.

629
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,026
Mimi, push it.

630
00:21:14,126 --> 00:21:15,136
Good job.

631
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:16,596
Mimi, push it.

632
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:18,806
Good job.

633
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:20,506
What's up with her?

634
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:22,475
(It goes into the target with Eun Ji's stone.)

635
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:23,536
It's okay.

636
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:24,976
The pride of Team E-caders.

637
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:27,205
(The celebrating machine)

638
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:28,775
- Hello. - Do you like it?

639
00:21:28,776 --> 00:21:30,445
- We'll get a point no matter what. - To the lonely days

640
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:32,085
(The singing attack is back.)

641
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:33,086
(Goodbye)

642
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:35,286
- Hello. - A song attack for Ahn Young Eun.

643
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:37,415
(Sighing)

644
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,956
(Her sigh shows her nervousness.)

645
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:40,525
- She breathed out. - I'm nervous.

646
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:41,626
We can do it.

647
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:43,526
She breathed so loudly.

648
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:45,995
- No! - Okay.

649
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:46,996
Come on.

650
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:48,635
(Screaming)

651
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:50,065
(Oops)

652
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:51,966
What was that?

653
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:53,306
- Why were you happy? - What?

654
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:54,736
Why were you happy?

655
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,606
Okay.

656
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:58,105
You never know.

657
00:21:58,106 --> 00:21:59,146
Let's go, Yu Jin.

658
00:21:59,546 --> 00:22:01,146
- You can do it. - Nice.

659
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:02,945
- Hey. Nice. - Nice.

660
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,416
- Well done. - Your stone is closer.

661
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:06,115
(Since it's Round 5, everyone has got the hang of it.)

662
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,346
Your stone is closer.

663
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:09,786
(With a worried expression, Producer Ji Min enters.)

664
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:12,255
Come on!

665
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:13,525
- Come on! - Come on!

666
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:15,325
- Aim for that one. - Come on!

667
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:16,595
- Which one? That one? - Come on!

668
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,266
- No. Go for the orange stone. - Come on!

669
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:20,195
- Then it'll be in the center. - They look like a curling team.

670
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:21,895
- I know. - Their outfits too.

671
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:23,396
- But they're losing. - They should get uniforms.

672
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:25,806
- They should get uniforms. - Too strong.

673
00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:29,606
Not yet.

674
00:22:31,276 --> 00:22:32,276
(An advanced skill)

675
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:34,305
It was nice. She did well.

676
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:36,415
- It was a cool skill. - She did so well.

677
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,385
- She hit the middle one. - What's the strategy?

678
00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:40,315
Just avoid that one and...

679
00:22:40,316 --> 00:22:41,316
- You can do it. - Do you trust me?

680
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:42,415
- Do what you want to do. - Do you trust me?

681
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,416
Do what you want to do.

682
00:22:44,516 --> 00:22:46,456
- I'll go. - Okay.

683
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:49,395
- Okay. - For goodness' sake.

684
00:22:49,396 --> 00:22:51,195
- No, it's okay. - They're the same.

685
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:52,826
- They're the same. - They're the same.

686
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,625
- It's neck and neck. - Push it slightly.

687
00:22:54,626 --> 00:22:56,565
If Writer Ju Eun puts her stone closer to the center,

688
00:22:56,566 --> 00:22:58,135
- Team Youngest will win. - Push it like this.

689
00:22:58,136 --> 00:22:59,905
- We're totally... - Push it.

690
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:01,035
It might fall off.

691
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:02,036
Push it gently.

692
00:23:02,037 --> 00:23:03,635
- Don't push too hard. - Seriously.

693
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:06,205
I mean, I didn't know that the four of you could speak...

694
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:07,406
so well.

695
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:09,876
- They just ignored us. - I didn't know that.

696
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:11,985
Put it in the center. You can do it.

697
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:13,545
- Relax. - You can't do it.

698
00:23:13,546 --> 00:23:14,645
- Out. - Relax.

699
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:16,255
- Nice. - My goodness!

700
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:18,016
- Out. - Relax.

701
00:23:18,426 --> 00:23:21,026
(The textbook example of curling)

702
00:23:21,726 --> 00:23:23,526
(Nice)

703
00:23:24,026 --> 00:23:26,826
(It's as if they've won the Winter Games.)

704
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:27,926
(Dejected)

705
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:30,495
- It's worth 1 point. - Is it 4 to 2?

706
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:31,496
- Yes. - One more point to go.

707
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:33,836
- Come on. - Come on.

708
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,536
Producer Hyun Yong, don't laugh. The netherworld will begin soon.

709
00:23:38,806 --> 00:23:39,946
I'm on your side.

710
00:23:40,276 --> 00:23:42,116
You reacted as if you had won the world soccer competition.

711
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:45,115
- We want to speak. - We want to speak.

712
00:23:45,116 --> 00:23:46,185
Three, two, go.

713
00:23:46,186 --> 00:23:47,786
- We want to speak! - We want to speak!

714
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:48,916
A promotion. Okay.

715
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,085
- You don't need to do it. - One, two, three, four.

716
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:51,825
- We want a promotion! - We want a promotion!

717
00:23:51,826 --> 00:23:52,855
All right.

718
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:54,026
(Embarrassed)

719
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:56,626
- Protect the player. - The order is important.

720
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,466
- She's good. - Go out. You go out.

721
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:01,226
Can you keep up?

722
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:04,835
- What's up? - Oh, no.

723
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:06,535
- Oh, no. - Good.

724
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:07,935
- You can do it, Eun Ji. - Thanks to you...

725
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,176
Korea's comedienne who won an award at the Baeksang Arts Awards.

726
00:24:09,676 --> 00:24:10,676
You can do it.

727
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:12,575
- You can do it. - She got lucky earlier.

728
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,576
The mom of Earth Arcade.

729
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,976
I'm sorry, but I heard you say, "She got lucky earlier."

730
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:19,085
(Feigning ignorance)

731
00:24:19,086 --> 00:24:21,216
Close your ears. Eun Ji, you can do it.

732
00:24:25,126 --> 00:24:26,556
(Out)

733
00:24:26,656 --> 00:24:27,785
- No. - Yes!

734
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:28,925
- Okay. - Okay.

735
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,796
You said, "Yes," so loudly.

736
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:33,126
(Producer Young Eun enters.)

737
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:36,366
After a 1-hour break, we'll torment you 4 times.

738
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:39,036
After a 1-hour break, we'll torment you for 4 hours.

739
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,705
- Let's enjoy silence for an hour. - Do it as you did earlier.

740
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:41,975
- Relax. - Be quiet.

741
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:44,536
- Okay. - Okay.

742
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:47,305
- Goodbye - She's in a hurry.

743
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:49,075
- She's in a hurry. - It's too strong.

744
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:50,245
- She was in a hurry. - That's what I'm saying.

745
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:51,515
- That's what I'm saying. - That's what I'm saying.

746
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:52,616
(She failed to control her strength.)

747
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:55,286
- It was because of them. - We're sorry.

748
00:24:55,616 --> 00:24:57,086
- Out. - The slide was too hasty.

749
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:59,655
You need to learn a bit more. It was too hasty.

750
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:01,186
(Encore)

751
00:25:01,426 --> 00:25:03,796
- It was too strong. - You can do it. You're the best.

752
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:05,326
Okay. Nice.

753
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:06,466
(Her stone is in the middle of the path.)

754
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:07,725
- It's in the middle. - Well done.

755
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:09,095
- Kim Mi Hyun. - You blocked the path.

756
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:10,695
- You blocked the path perfectly. - You blocked the path.

757
00:25:10,696 --> 00:25:12,006
(It's an advantageous location.)

758
00:25:12,436 --> 00:25:15,376
(Writer Ma Ru comes next.)

759
00:25:15,536 --> 00:25:17,606
- Do you want to level up? - Yes.

760
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:19,976
Out.

761
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:21,046
(It went out strongly.)

762
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:22,515
- She lost her cool. - It was too strong.

763
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:24,076
She lost her cool.

764
00:25:24,176 --> 00:25:26,315
- I think it was too strong. - She totally lost her cool.

765
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,845
I think her strength was excessive.

766
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:30,286
- Yes. - I agree.

767
00:25:30,856 --> 00:25:31,856
(It's Yu Jin's turn.)

768
00:25:31,857 --> 00:25:33,885
- Yu Jin, good luck. - Good luck.

769
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:35,055
- Out. - Korea's representative idol.

770
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:36,656
- Okay. - Nice.

771
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:37,855
- Out. - Korea's representative idol.

772
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:39,625
- Okay. - Nice.

773
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:41,525
- It's okay. - Nice.

774
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:42,735
For now, we're at an advantage.

775
00:25:42,736 --> 00:25:43,996
(Team E-caders is at an advantage.)

776
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:45,535
(Each team has one turn left.)

777
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:46,566
One turn remains.

778
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:50,836
(Team Youngest's last player)

779
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:53,975
- Banana, banana. - Banana, banana.

780
00:25:53,976 --> 00:25:55,515
Okay. She feels rushed.

781
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:56,675
- She feels rushed. - She feels rushed.

782
00:25:56,676 --> 00:25:58,116
- It'll go out. - Let's go out.

783
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,585
(She throws the stone!)

784
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:02,116
- It'll go out. - Let's go out.

785
00:26:05,556 --> 00:26:07,586
(Team E-caders' stone goes out.)

786
00:26:08,556 --> 00:26:10,425
(This is curling.)

787
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:13,825
- Okay. - What was that?

788
00:26:13,826 --> 00:26:15,336
(Dejected)

789
00:26:15,636 --> 00:26:17,196
We're in the same group.

790
00:26:18,336 --> 00:26:19,336
YooA.

791
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:22,135
- Young Ji, let's focus. - You can do it.

792
00:26:22,136 --> 00:26:23,875
- You're doing well. - Becuase of the pigeons...

793
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:25,846
- Don't go past the line. - Don't go past the line.

794
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:27,675
(Anxious)

795
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:28,846
(Making strange noises)

796
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:30,845
She's rushed.

797
00:26:30,846 --> 00:26:33,346
(The stone leaves Young Ji's hand.)

798
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:36,115
(What will be the result?)

799
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:37,215
- Don't go past the line. - Don't go past the line.

800
00:26:37,216 --> 00:26:38,386
She's rushed.

801
00:26:39,276 --> 00:26:40,775
- Young Ji, let's focus. - You can do it.

802
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:42,675
- You're doing well. - Becuase of the pigeons...

803
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:44,376
- Don't go past the line. - Don't go past the line.

804
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:46,345
(Anxious)

805
00:26:46,346 --> 00:26:47,516
(Making strange noises)

806
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:49,515
She's rushed.

807
00:26:49,516 --> 00:26:51,986
(The stone leaves Young Ji's hand.)

808
00:26:52,756 --> 00:26:54,885
(What will be the result?)

809
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:55,895
- Don't go past the line. - Don't go past the line.

810
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:57,056
She's rushed.

811
00:26:58,056 --> 00:26:59,795
We're set. It's on the red circle.

812
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:00,796
- The red circle. - The red circle.

813
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:02,196
(Oh, no.)

814
00:27:02,396 --> 00:27:03,735
- The red circle. - Young Ji.

815
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:05,135
- Young Ji. - We won.

816
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:06,235
- Young Ji. - Well done.

817
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:07,405
- All right. - Prepare a celebration performance.

818
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:10,675
- Prepare a celebration performance. - Prepare a celebration performance.

819
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:11,706
- What is it? - Let's celebrate it.

820
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:13,805
(Team E-caders' stone is closer to the center.)

821
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,145
(1 point)

822
00:27:15,146 --> 00:27:16,376
- Let's celebrate. - Three, two...

823
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:18,246
- One, two, three. - Three, two, one. Let's go.

824
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:21,086
(Team E-caders won!)

825
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:24,116
(Goodbye, gift cards.)

826
00:27:24,386 --> 00:27:26,326
Please look at each other.

827
00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:28,055
- Bow. - Bow.

828
00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:29,295
(That was a good game.)

829
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:31,525
- See you again next time. - You were the best.

830
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:32,526
Anyway...
(Whispering)

831
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,966
She says they still deserve some gift cards.

832
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:39,305
- She ordered me to ask. - Good job.

833
00:27:39,306 --> 00:27:42,506
Even if they lost, please give them some gift cards.

834
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:46,006
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

835
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:47,675
- Is this cinnamon? - I think so.

836
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:48,975
- Is this... - I think so, too.

837
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:50,246
It's still a little warm.

838
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:51,985
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

839
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:53,915
- I appreciate it. - Thank you very much.

840
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,015
(It tastes just as good as before.)

841
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:56,086
Look at this.

842
00:27:56,356 --> 00:28:01,556
(Egg tarts and warm coffee make the perfect combo.)

843
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:03,695
- We have a talent for curling. - Yes.

844
00:28:03,696 --> 00:28:05,155
(Mimi prefers egg tarts over coffee.)

845
00:28:05,156 --> 00:28:06,166
It's so delicious.

846
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:08,936
(Pouring a lot of powdered sugar)

847
00:28:09,796 --> 00:28:11,035
The sunlight feels quite strong.

848
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:12,436
- It keeps coming every night. - You're right.

849
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:13,865
It causes a commotion every night.

850
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:15,165
(They keep getting into it.)

851
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,206
I can't sleep at night.

852
00:28:16,676 --> 00:28:17,875
I can't eat more than one.

853
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:18,905
How many did you eat?

854
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,006
- I ate 4. - You ate 4?

855
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:21,406
- When? - Really?

856
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:23,546
Just now.

857
00:28:23,547 --> 00:28:24,746
(It hit the spot for the dessert monster again today.)

858
00:28:25,046 --> 00:28:26,316
It's so nice and warm.

859
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:28,755
The weather is perfect right now. What time is it?

860
00:28:28,756 --> 00:28:30,516
- It's 11:05am. - It's perfect right now.

861
00:28:30,786 --> 00:28:32,156
I can't wait to go to the market.

862
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:34,386
When we go to the market

863
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:36,096
Everyone.

864
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:37,995
- We keep talking. - Yes?

865
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:40,496
- We keep talking. We can talk. - Yes.

866
00:28:40,826 --> 00:28:42,995
Let me tell you where we're going now.

867
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:45,636
In Korea, there is the five-day market.

868
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:47,266
Also in Lisbon, Portugal...

869
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:49,106
Was it Tuesday and Saturday?

870
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,835
- That's perfect. - It's open on Tuesday and Saturday.

871
00:28:50,836 --> 00:28:52,775
- Tuesday, Saturday market? - There's a market.

872
00:28:52,776 --> 00:28:54,676
We won't get to see it other than today.

873
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,216
I'll definitely buy a fridge magnet.

874
00:28:57,616 --> 00:28:59,645
Like fridge magnets that Eun Ji mentioned.

875
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:01,446
- Like it's magnetic - Or bottle openers.

876
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:03,086
- Hairpins. - Hairpins.

877
00:29:03,456 --> 00:29:06,385
Port wine, pens, and notebooks.

878
00:29:06,386 --> 00:29:08,056
- Sardine soap. - Yes, sardine soap.

879
00:29:08,756 --> 00:29:11,126
(Thieves' Market)

880
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:14,125
(The most famous flea market in Portugal...)

881
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,866
(at Campo de Santa Clara)

882
00:29:16,396 --> 00:29:18,065
(As most of the items sold are second-hand, )

883
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:20,966
(it was called a market where thieves sold items.)

884
00:29:21,736 --> 00:29:25,136
(In fact, it's a flea market that has nothing to do with thieves.)

885
00:29:26,246 --> 00:29:29,045
(We go to a general store that's inside the market.)

886
00:29:29,046 --> 00:29:30,876
(And...)

887
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,016
Gosh.

888
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:33,916
(What? Wait, girls.)

889
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:35,955
(It's over there.)

890
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:38,056
- That's it. - Hey!

891
00:29:39,556 --> 00:29:42,125
(What on earth happened at the Thieves' Market?)

892
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:44,396
(It's coming up soon.)

893
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:46,325
I want to drink sangria on the terrace.

894
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,496
I want to buy a vintage camera.

895
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:52,206
(As they keep driving with a lot of anticipation)

896
00:29:52,806 --> 00:29:53,905
- Look at the view. - It's lovely.

897
00:29:53,906 --> 00:29:55,336
It looks so romantic.

898
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:57,905
We rented it for a certain amount of time.

899
00:29:57,906 --> 00:29:58,906
- Okay. - Okay.

900
00:29:58,907 --> 00:30:00,075
(They decide to head to the souvenir shop first.)

901
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:01,906
- It's another souvenir shop. - Amazing.

902
00:30:02,246 --> 00:30:03,775
- There are so many things I want. - Producer Na, we have no money.

903
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,485
I want that Portuguese hat.

904
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:06,846
- This is it. - It's pretty.

905
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,015
It looks cute.

906
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,855
- I really want that hat. - Isn't it adorable?

907
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:10,986
My goodness.

908
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:14,386
(A secret shop that has everything)

909
00:30:14,986 --> 00:30:17,426
(The item zone is deep inside the shop.)

910
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,396
(From fridge magnets that Eun Ji wanted)

911
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:21,296
(Various postcards)

912
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:23,866
(All sorts of towels)

913
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,506
(On the other side, which is the clothing zone)

914
00:30:27,206 --> 00:30:29,906
(Full of clothing articles with Lisbon written on them)

915
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:33,506
(Small and cute craftwork)

916
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:35,646
(And even port wine)

917
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:38,376
(There are also mini bottles of port wine.)

918
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:40,045
(The list of items at the general store)

919
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,546
(Towels, teacups, kitchen utensils, socks, teaspoon sets...)

920
00:30:41,786 --> 00:30:43,355
- Hello. - Hello.

921
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:44,485
(They enter the store.)

922
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:46,085
- Young Ji, there are many pigeons. - Are these towels?

923
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:47,525
- Where? - These are all pigeons.

924
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:49,555
- I need to buy one of these. - We do.

925
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,695
- These are swallows. - I need to get one.

926
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:52,595
- Swallows. - The swallow is their symbol.

927
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:53,926
- Is that right? - I'm sorry.

928
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:55,896
These tumblers look so pretty.

929
00:30:56,236 --> 00:30:58,806
(There are tumblers that she couldn't buy last time.)

930
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:00,505
What do you think of this Lisbon fedora?

931
00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:01,566
It looks so good on you.

932
00:31:02,476 --> 00:31:03,576
I want this one.

933
00:31:03,806 --> 00:31:04,835
- That's pretty. - It looks good on you.

934
00:31:04,836 --> 00:31:05,906
- Let me see, Yu Jin. - Do I look okay?

935
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:08,446
Both of you look good. They look great on you.

936
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:10,045
Mimi, "I love Lisbon."

937
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:11,145
- Where is it? - Lisbon.

938
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:12,585
- I need to buy that. - It's a hooded sweatshirt.

939
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:14,185
- There it is. - It's perfect for the weather.

940
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:15,316
(Endless greed)

941
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,315
There are so many pretty items here.

942
00:31:17,316 --> 00:31:18,986
When did you have a chance to remember that?

943
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:21,725
- Eun Ji, we need to buy one. - Definitely.

944
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:23,026
- I need to buy one of these. - The swallow...

945
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,125
(Brother Yeong Seok settles somewhere.)

946
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:27,325
There are so many things to buy,

947
00:31:27,326 --> 00:31:28,865
- but we don't have... - We have no money.

948
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:30,635
- Why are you here? - Are you okay?

949
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:31,636
- Why are you here? - What's wrong with you?

950
00:31:31,637 --> 00:31:33,365
- Gosh. - What are you doing?

951
00:31:33,366 --> 00:31:35,166
- Suddenly... - Welcome.

952
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:36,405
- What's going on? - "Welcome."

953
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:38,035
- Are you the owner? - Welcome.

954
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:39,406
- Hello. - Hello.

955
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:40,645
(He welcomes them like he's been waiting for them.)

956
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:42,446
- He must be the store owner. - Thank you.

957
00:31:42,546 --> 00:31:44,275
Did you find something that you like?

958
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:46,185
- I found so many. - I found a lot of things.

959
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:48,485
I see. If there's something you like,

960
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:50,015
each of you can bring one here.

961
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,915
- Only one? - This is NANA...

962
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:53,325
- Goodness. - Souvenir Shop.

963
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:55,156
Goodness.

964
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:58,355
(NANA Souvenir Shop)

965
00:31:58,356 --> 00:32:00,626
(Its business hours last only 15 minutes.)

966
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,666
(The magical shop is open.)

967
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,465
What do we have to buy?

968
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,836
(Pick a souvenir that you'd like.)

969
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:09,236
Which one looks better?

970
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:10,576
This one?

971
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:12,546
(However, )

972
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:16,615
(you must answer the question correctly to get it.)

973
00:32:16,616 --> 00:32:18,575
(Capital City Quiz, Answer in a Row, Word Chain, Reverse Perfect Pitch)

974
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:20,386
(If you get it wrong...)

975
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:22,655
(Go back in line.)

976
00:32:22,656 --> 00:32:24,386
(The person behind you gets her turn.)

977
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:28,485
If you'd like to buy the hat...

978
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:29,695
(The first customer wants to buy the Lisbon hat.)

979
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,725
Pick one of these.

980
00:32:31,726 --> 00:32:33,425
- What's wrong with you? - This place looks so cute.

981
00:32:33,426 --> 00:32:35,325
- Young Ji, we don't have much time. - I'm sorry.

982
00:32:35,326 --> 00:32:36,435
- You have ten minutes. - Ten minutes.

983
00:32:36,436 --> 00:32:37,465
Which one is it?

984
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:39,466
(What will be the question for the first customer?)

985
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:41,535
- "Reverse Perfect Pitch?" Gosh. - You're good at it.

986
00:32:41,536 --> 00:32:43,176
- You're good at it. - Reverse Perfect Pitch.

987
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:44,935
All right, are you ready?

988
00:32:44,936 --> 00:32:46,105
Once I give you the keyword, start right away.

989
00:32:46,106 --> 00:32:47,306
- Okay. - Get ready.

990
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:49,675
It's "Royal new royal."

991
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,815
- This is insane. - Start.

992
00:32:50,816 --> 00:32:59,425
(Royal new royal)

993
00:32:59,426 --> 00:33:00,426
(Ral)

994
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:01,555
- Wrong. At the end, - At the end...

995
00:33:01,556 --> 00:33:02,995
you said, "Royal new roral."

996
00:33:02,996 --> 00:33:04,025
- Wrong. - You said "ral."

997
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:05,765
- Please go back. - "I love Lisbon."

998
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:06,825
"I love Lisbon."

999
00:33:06,826 --> 00:33:08,596
Which one will you pick?

1000
00:33:09,536 --> 00:33:11,665
- "Royal new roral?" - "New roral."

1001
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:12,735
Complete the Proverb.

1002
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:14,166
- Complete the Proverb. - She can do it.

1003
00:33:14,236 --> 00:33:15,676
- I must have it. - I know.

1004
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,335
- Yours is cute. - Isn't it pretty?

1005
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:18,405
- It's pretty. - Isn't it?

1006
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:19,875
She's a brainiac. She can guess most of them.

1007
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:21,006
- Let's go. - All right.

1008
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:22,576
(Glaring)

1009
00:33:23,146 --> 00:33:24,416
"After being slapped in Jongno..."

1010
00:33:25,346 --> 00:33:26,845
- "Curse in Myeongdong." - Wrong.

1011
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:28,855
(After being slapped in Jongno, curse in Myeongdong?)

1012
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:30,516
- "Curse in Myeongdong." - Wrong.

1013
00:33:30,556 --> 00:33:32,725
(The eldest finds it funny that she said Myeongdong out of nowhere.)

1014
00:33:32,726 --> 00:33:34,885
Why would you get slapped in Jongno?

1015
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:37,096
(The second eldest can't understand the question.)

1016
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:38,756
That was good.

1017
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:40,965
She did a good job. You're amazing.

1018
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:42,365
Jongno and Myeongdong are close to each other.

1019
00:33:42,366 --> 00:33:44,135
- Is it possible to try again? - It's possible.

1020
00:33:44,136 --> 00:33:45,496
- You just need to stand in line. - Stand in line.

1021
00:33:45,836 --> 00:33:47,235
- Young Ji, it's hard. - It's hard.

1022
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:48,765
- "After being slapped in Jongno?" - You vent by the Han River.

1023
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:50,175
- It was related to venting. - Yes.

1024
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:51,635
- Cursing is wrong. - Why would you curse in Myeongdong?

1025
00:33:51,636 --> 00:33:52,645
(She went to the wrong place.)

1026
00:33:52,646 --> 00:33:53,805
- Myeongdong is innocent. - To vent...

1027
00:33:53,806 --> 00:33:54,905
- Lisbon. - We only have ten minutes.

1028
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:56,115
- Would you like that? - Yes.

1029
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:57,475
- This one. - Would you like to buy that?

1030
00:33:57,476 --> 00:33:58,476
- Please. - Go ahead and pick.

1031
00:33:58,477 --> 00:34:00,285
- A hooded sweatshirt. Let's go. - A hooded sweatshirt.

1032
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:01,646
(The question for her hooded sweatshirt at stake)

1033
00:34:02,186 --> 00:34:03,315
Complete the Proverb.

1034
00:34:03,316 --> 00:34:04,585
It's Complete the Proverb again.

1035
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:05,626
All right.

1036
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:07,386
"Afraid of maggots..."

1037
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:09,256
"I can't make a tiger."

1038
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:11,125
- Wrong. - Why would you make a tiger?

1039
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:12,425
The answer is "I can't make sauces."

1040
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:13,526
It's a tiger.

1041
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:14,925
Darn it.

1042
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:16,665
Her answer was ridiculous.

1043
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:18,595
(The next customer takes her place right away.)

1044
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:19,965
- Isn't this tumbler cute? - What's this?

1045
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:21,335
- It's a tumbler. - Goodness.

1046
00:34:21,336 --> 00:34:22,336
- It looks nice. - Isn't it cute?

1047
00:34:22,337 --> 00:34:23,875
- Hurry up. Let's go. - Hurry up.

1048
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:24,876
You don't need to be responsive.

1049
00:34:24,877 --> 00:34:26,846
- Producer Na, we have ten minutes. - Please pick one.

1050
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,805
You know what? I'm not in a hurry.

1051
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:30,546
- We're in a hurry. - Here you go.

1052
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:31,945
It's a multiplication table again.

1053
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,245
- My goodness. - You can do it.

1054
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:35,086
- A multiplication table? - A multiplication table is easy.

1055
00:34:35,346 --> 00:34:36,785
- But... - What's wrong?

1056
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:38,586
I always get a multiplication table wrong.

1057
00:34:38,956 --> 00:34:42,185
A multiplication table... I will give you a random question.

1058
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:43,225
Okay.

1059
00:34:43,226 --> 00:34:44,525
- What's 9 times 5? - It's 45.

1060
00:34:44,526 --> 00:34:46,495
- Correct. - Yes.

1061
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:47,795
- Can I have this? - Yes.

1062
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:48,936
- Correct. - You did well.

1063
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:50,036
(Feeling betrayed by Mimi who got smarter)
- What was that about? - You're good.

1064
00:34:51,037 --> 00:34:52,735
- Get something else and line up. - Bring something else.

1065
00:34:52,736 --> 00:34:54,166
Something else?

1066
00:34:54,836 --> 00:34:57,036
(Mimi goes straight to...)

1067
00:34:57,476 --> 00:34:59,476
Doesn't it look the closest to pigeons in Korea?

1068
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,306
Does this one look similar to pigeons?

1069
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:02,645
- Since I sold one item, - The fedora looks good.

1070
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:04,545
- shall I close the shop for today? - No.

1071
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:05,885
- Answer in a Row. - Answer in a Row.

1072
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,716
Answer in a Row? Let's get started.

1073
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:10,116
- Let's try this one. - The hat looks good on her.

1074
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:11,985
- She looks like Epaksa. - All right.

1075
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:12,986
(Giggling)

1076
00:35:13,386 --> 00:35:15,085
Five words that start with "R."

1077
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:16,496
- One, two, three. - Ri Young Ji.

1078
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:18,026
Ri Eun Ji.

1079
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:19,796
- Keep going. - Wrong.

1080
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:23,265
My family name is Lee.

1081
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:25,935
- Please go way back in line. - My family name is Lee.

1082
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:27,436
(Words that start with "R": Rhythm, remote, ribbon, recorder...)

1083
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:29,235
(Meanwhile, the next player picked her question.)

1084
00:35:29,236 --> 00:35:30,236
Capital city...

1085
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:31,735
Capital City Quiz?

1086
00:35:31,736 --> 00:35:33,206
Our brain...

1087
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:35,275
- What is she going to do? - Our brainiac.

1088
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:36,445
- Let's get started. - What's wrong?

1089
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:37,446
(Changing suddenly)

1090
00:35:37,447 --> 00:35:38,745
- Good luck. - North and Central America...

1091
00:35:38,746 --> 00:35:40,046
Come to your senses.

1092
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:43,015
What's the capital city of Finland? One, two, three.

1093
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,715
- Helsinki. - Correct.

1094
00:35:44,716 --> 00:35:45,726
(Helsinki)

1095
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:48,486
(An Yu Genius overcame her worst subject.)

1096
00:35:49,226 --> 00:35:51,825
(Celebrating)

1097
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:53,465
- Producer Na. - Hurry up.

1098
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:54,725
The difficulty level is...

1099
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:55,865
You asked her, "What's 9 times 5?"

1100
00:35:55,866 --> 00:35:57,496
Stop talking. We must hurry.

1101
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:01,705
(She keeps her hooded sweatshirt and goes shopping again.)

1102
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:02,806
What shall I buy?

1103
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:05,476
These are espresso cups, right?

1104
00:36:07,446 --> 00:36:10,575
(She picks an Azulejo teacup as her second item.)

1105
00:36:10,576 --> 00:36:11,845
- All right. - Girls, here I go.

1106
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:12,885
- Let's go. - This will be mine.

1107
00:36:12,886 --> 00:36:13,945
- The eldest sister. - You can do it.

1108
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:14,946
- Here I go. - That's really pretty.

1109
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:17,056
It will depend on the result of the next player.

1110
00:36:18,016 --> 00:36:19,485
Did I make it? Can I keep it?

1111
00:36:19,486 --> 00:36:20,625
- No, the next player... - It depends...

1112
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:21,626
- On her? - It depends on her.

1113
00:36:21,627 --> 00:36:23,856
Mimi is the next player.

1114
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,056
Go ahead and pick.

1115
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,995
- But Mimi... - Please pick one.

1116
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:28,196
Mimi can do it.

1117
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:30,095
- It depends on you. - Right.

1118
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:32,066
- How will things turn out? - "Faker?"

1119
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:33,705
- Faker Game. - What's this?

1120
00:36:33,706 --> 00:36:34,965
Let me explain.

1121
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:36,905
(We'll explain what Faker Game is.)

1122
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:39,575
(Catching the falling ruler)

1123
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:41,746
(A reflex test)

1124
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,145
(A celestial record)

1125
00:36:43,146 --> 00:36:44,545
(It became the talk of the town because he caught it so fast.)

1126
00:36:44,546 --> 00:36:46,286
(This is where we got the idea from.)

1127
00:36:46,986 --> 00:36:49,116
(The ruler will be dropped all of a sudden.)

1128
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:51,286
(They must catch it to succeed.)

1129
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:54,455
As I said, get ready to catch it.

1130
00:36:54,456 --> 00:36:55,755
You're ready to catch it, right?

1131
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:56,825
All right.

1132
00:36:56,826 --> 00:36:58,496
Get ready to catch it.

1133
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,065
No, don't grab it.

1134
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:02,025
- Get ready to catch it. - Here you go.

1135
00:37:02,026 --> 00:37:03,365
- I see. - It might fall,

1136
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:04,765
- so get ready to catch it. - She'll definitely make it.

1137
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,306
Catch it in the count of three.

1138
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,606
- For example... - Go back in line.

1139
00:37:09,676 --> 00:37:11,036
Catch it in the count of three.

1140
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:12,945
(What are you doing?)

1141
00:37:12,946 --> 00:37:13,946
Wait.

1142
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:15,245
Your explanation wasn't clear.

1143
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:16,816
I told you to get ready to catch it.

1144
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:18,745
- Get ready to catch... - I told you to get ready.

1145
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:20,116
- How could he start immediately? - You're a con artist.

1146
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,715
He's a total con artist.

1147
00:37:21,716 --> 00:37:22,785
- He's the worst. - I told you...

1148
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:23,815
to get ready to catch it.

1149
00:37:23,816 --> 00:37:25,516
I'd like to leave a review on this shop.

1150
00:37:26,486 --> 00:37:27,555
I'll write a review.

1151
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:29,426
- The service is terrible. - Please get behind the line.

1152
00:37:30,296 --> 00:37:31,325
Get behind the line.

1153
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:32,326
(The next customer picks the question in a hurry.)

1154
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:34,096
(Faker Game)

1155
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:35,935
(The same game is picked.)

1156
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:38,065
- Gosh, it's this hat. - What is your item?

1157
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:39,405
- This is her item. - Put it here.

1158
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:41,665
I repeat. Get ready to catch it.

1159
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,035
You're ready to catch it, right?

1160
00:37:43,036 --> 00:37:45,436
Young Ji, starting now, look at me straight in the eye...

1161
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:48,046
- Goodness. - We need to write a review.

1162
00:37:48,076 --> 00:37:49,175
(Flinching)

1163
00:37:49,176 --> 00:37:51,716
(She flinched, but the ruler fell helplessly.)

1164
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:53,045
Get back in line.

1165
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:55,245
Go all the way back.

1166
00:37:55,246 --> 00:37:58,156
- We need to write a review on this. - This is completely ridiculous.

1167
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:01,085
- He deserves zero stars. - He's getting more unreasonable.

1168
00:38:01,086 --> 00:38:02,855
- What's wrong with him? - Instead of improving yourself,

1169
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:04,595
- you're getting more unreasonable. - Exactly.

1170
00:38:04,596 --> 00:38:07,026
- Faker is amazing at this game. - Hurry up.

1171
00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:08,696
What's your item?

1172
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:11,466
(She wants to win the hat for Young Ji.)

1173
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:12,935
- Gosh, it's Answer in a Row. - Okay, she can do it.

1174
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:14,136
Answer in a Row.

1175
00:38:14,506 --> 00:38:16,535
Five words that end with "jeon." One, two, three.

1176
00:38:16,536 --> 00:38:18,075
Green onion jeon, kimchi jeon, seafood jeon,

1177
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:19,646
chive jeon, potato jeon.

1178
00:38:19,746 --> 00:38:20,976
Oh, my.

1179
00:38:21,006 --> 00:38:22,746
"Potato jeon?"

1180
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:23,846
Correct.

1181
00:38:23,847 --> 00:38:24,875
(She gets her revenge victory as quickly as a rapper.)

1182
00:38:24,876 --> 00:38:27,486
That's me. This is what I'm capable of.

1183
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:28,916
- Young Ji. - Thank you.

1184
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:30,116
I'll win this for you.

1185
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:33,756
(Today's best player who has won 2 times already)

1186
00:38:33,886 --> 00:38:36,155
- What is it? It's so pretty. - It's a teacup.

1187
00:38:36,156 --> 00:38:38,955
My sister told me that she wanted one.

1188
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:40,995
- Your sister? - Hurry up, Yu Jin. We have no time.

1189
00:38:40,996 --> 00:38:42,765
- Let's go. - It's for my sister.

1190
00:38:42,766 --> 00:38:44,396
- I haven't bought her a gift yet. - Let's go.

1191
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:45,735
It's Capital City Quiz.

1192
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:47,636
(She got Capital City Quiz again.)

1193
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:49,505
- You can do it, Deity of Capital. - I got it last time.

1194
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:52,435
- You'll definitely get it wrong. - Let's go.

1195
00:38:52,436 --> 00:38:53,445
The capital city of Mexico.

1196
00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:54,446
One, two, three.

1197
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:55,575
- Brazil? - Wrong.

1198
00:38:55,576 --> 00:38:56,645
I thought that too.

1199
00:38:56,646 --> 00:38:57,676
(She's bad with Central America.)

1200
00:38:57,716 --> 00:38:58,716
Wrong.

1201
00:38:58,717 --> 00:39:00,346
What's the capital city of Mexico?

1202
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:01,715
- What is it? - Helsinki? No.

1203
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:02,855
"Helsinki?"

1204
00:39:02,856 --> 00:39:04,086
(It's not even in the same continent.)

1205
00:39:04,716 --> 00:39:06,925
Please give me...

1206
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:07,926
one more chance.

1207
00:39:07,927 --> 00:39:09,225
I went on a concert tour in Mexico.

1208
00:39:09,226 --> 00:39:10,756
No, you don't get any more chance.

1209
00:39:10,856 --> 00:39:12,025
It's Mexico City.

1210
00:39:12,026 --> 00:39:13,065
That's right.

1211
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:14,225
Good job. Get back in line.

1212
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,266
- Mexico City. - Producer Na.

1213
00:39:15,426 --> 00:39:16,565
I'm glad that you remembered.

1214
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:18,136
(The aftermath of a significant shock)

1215
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,266
Mexico City.

1216
00:39:20,366 --> 00:39:21,866
I need to win this, please.

1217
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:23,875
Why did you bring a swallow?

1218
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:25,005
I must win this for Mimi.

1219
00:39:25,006 --> 00:39:26,705
Isn't this a pigeon?

1220
00:39:26,706 --> 00:39:27,905
It's a pigeon.

1221
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:29,645
- Mimi. - It's a set.

1222
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:31,316
Okay, you can do it. It's ice cream.

1223
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:32,515
- It's easy. - You have three minutes.

1224
00:39:32,516 --> 00:39:33,645
We have three minutes left.

1225
00:39:33,646 --> 00:39:34,885
This is an initial quiz on ice cream.

1226
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:37,316
Look at the initial letters...

1227
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:39,286
and guess the name of the ice cream.

1228
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:41,256
I'll count three seconds slowly.

1229
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,555
- Three, two, one. - Tank Boy.

1230
00:39:43,556 --> 00:39:44,655
(Tank Boy)

1231
00:39:44,656 --> 00:39:45,656
Correct.

1232
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,895
(She answers correctly without any hesitation.)

1233
00:39:47,896 --> 00:39:50,166
- That's amazing. - She did a great job.

1234
00:39:50,636 --> 00:39:51,666
Turn around.

1235
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:55,666
(Honey, we should celebrate it properly.)

1236
00:39:55,906 --> 00:39:57,275
I really hope that it's a different game.

1237
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:58,705
It'd be great if it's Capital City Game again.

1238
00:39:58,706 --> 00:40:00,906
- Answer in a Row. - Let's start Answer in a Row.

1239
00:40:01,076 --> 00:40:02,105
You can do it.

1240
00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:05,175
Name 5 flowers with more than 4 syllables.

1241
00:40:05,176 --> 00:40:06,185
- Four syllables? - One, two, three.

1242
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:07,385
- Sunflower. - Sunflower.

1243
00:40:07,386 --> 00:40:08,685
- Pasqueflower. - Wrong.

1244
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:10,286
- Pasqueflower. - "Pasqueflower?"

1245
00:40:10,556 --> 00:40:12,116
(He's pressured to say that it counts.)

1246
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:13,825
I'm sorry. Pasqueflower exists.

1247
00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:15,556
- Cosmos. - Bridal wreath spirea.

1248
00:40:15,656 --> 00:40:17,056
Bridal wreath spirea.

1249
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:18,226
Wrong.

1250
00:40:18,356 --> 00:40:20,826
(She named a tree as if she was possessed.)

1251
00:40:21,326 --> 00:40:23,665
- Eun Ji! - "Bridal wreath spirea?"

1252
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,266
(Laughing)

1253
00:40:25,836 --> 00:40:27,465
(She failed by repeating the eldest sister.)

1254
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,906
What's wrong with you?

1255
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:31,905
(There isn't much time left.)

1256
00:40:31,906 --> 00:40:33,745
Wrong, goodbye.

1257
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:34,876
Let me help you.

1258
00:40:35,706 --> 00:40:37,675
Shouldn't I close after this customer?

1259
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:39,245
- Come on. - Give me one more chance.

1260
00:40:39,246 --> 00:40:40,285
- The last one. - Each of you gets one last chance.

1261
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:41,785
- Okay. - It's the last chance.

1262
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:42,915
I'm sorry,

1263
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:45,215
but I'll accept the customers who have lined up.

1264
00:40:45,216 --> 00:40:46,986
- It's our lunchtime now. - Come on, Producer Na.

1265
00:40:47,186 --> 00:40:48,425
(Screaming)

1266
00:40:48,426 --> 00:40:49,895
- He must eat a lot of lunch. - I have to eat something good.

1267
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:51,456
- Princess Na. - Let's leave a review on our blog.

1268
00:40:51,896 --> 00:40:53,125
Princess Na, I'll play this.

1269
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:54,266
- This one? - Okay.

1270
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:55,926
You keep coming back with this.

1271
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:57,995
- You can read it from here. - This is for Yu Jin.

1272
00:40:57,996 --> 00:40:59,165
"Your fate is the same as the next player."

1273
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,665
- Your fate is the same... - That's me.

1274
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,605
Young Ji and Mimi share the same fate.

1275
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:03,775
- Gosh. - You can do it.

1276
00:41:03,776 --> 00:41:05,035
- She'll go right away. - Okay.

1277
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,046
Good luck, Young Ji.

1278
00:41:06,806 --> 00:41:08,345
It's Reverse Perfect Pitch.

1279
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:10,675
- Why don't you two... - Do we all have to do it?

1280
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,875
Take turns?

1281
00:41:11,876 --> 00:41:13,046
- What does that mean? - We can do it.

1282
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,545
- We'll take turns. - Okay.

1283
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:15,546
(They must take turns and win.)

1284
00:41:15,646 --> 00:41:17,155
If you make it within 30 seconds,

1285
00:41:17,156 --> 00:41:18,285
- you'll win. - Okay.

1286
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:19,385
- Please count 30 seconds. - It's 30 seconds.

1287
00:41:19,386 --> 00:41:20,426
- Okay. - Thirty seconds.

1288
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:22,656
Let's start. Here's the keyword.

1289
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:24,926
- We're ready. - "Gamdasal Gamdadui."

1290
00:41:25,056 --> 00:41:27,725
- Get ready, set, go. - Gamdasal...

1291
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:29,396
(Gamdasal Gamdadui)

1292
00:41:29,466 --> 00:41:31,096
(Gamdasal Gamdadui)

1293
00:41:31,266 --> 00:41:35,965
(Gamdasal Gamdadui)

1294
00:41:35,966 --> 00:41:37,675
- Gamdasal Gamdadui. - You got it.

1295
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:39,446
(Gamdasal Gamdadui)

1296
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:41,776
- Gamdasal Gamdadui. - Put your hand down.

1297
00:41:41,976 --> 00:41:43,845
(Gamdasal Gamdadui)

1298
00:41:43,846 --> 00:41:45,475
- Keep your face still. - Gamdasal Gamdadui.

1299
00:41:45,476 --> 00:41:47,715
- That's right. - Gamdasal Gamdadui.

1300
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:49,915
- Right. - Gamdasal Dadui.

1301
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:51,515
- No. - Wrong.

1302
00:41:51,516 --> 00:41:53,086
- At the end... - She didn't say "gam."

1303
00:41:53,226 --> 00:41:54,925
- She didn't say "gam." - She didn't say "gam."

1304
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:56,095
It's wrong.

1305
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,355
You skipped one syllable.

1306
00:41:57,356 --> 00:41:58,456
Please stand back in line.

1307
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:00,266
What? Is that over?

1308
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,696
Thirty seconds are up.

1309
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:03,835
I'm good at this.

1310
00:42:03,836 --> 00:42:05,835
You picked Reverse Perfect Pitch.

1311
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:07,106
I'm good at this.

1312
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:08,906
I'm good at this, sir.

1313
00:42:09,336 --> 00:42:12,406
(What are they doing?)

1314
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:14,746
(They're studying the rest.)

1315
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:16,846
(Smirking)

1316
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,215
Yu Jin, please start. This is Reverse Perfect Pitch.

1317
00:42:19,216 --> 00:42:20,816
- Are you ready? - It's the highest difficulty level.

1318
00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:25,015
- "Ringdighidingdighidingdingding." - This is insane.

1319
00:42:25,016 --> 00:42:26,525
- "Ringdighidingdighidingdingding." - It's very hard.

1320
00:42:26,526 --> 00:42:27,555
One, two, three.

1321
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:29,996
(Ringdighidingdighidingdingding)

1322
00:42:30,056 --> 00:42:32,725
(Ringdighidingdingdingdingding)

1323
00:42:32,726 --> 00:42:33,726
Wrong.

1324
00:42:34,796 --> 00:42:36,196
(Dingdingdingdingding)

1325
00:42:36,366 --> 00:42:38,736
(It's okay, dingdingdingdingding.)

1326
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,906
(It's okay. You still have 20 seconds left.)

1327
00:42:42,106 --> 00:42:54,615
(Ringdighidingdighidingdingding)

1328
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:56,716
- She's good. - Ringdighidingdighidingdingding.

1329
00:42:56,756 --> 00:42:58,515
(Ringdighidingdighidingdingding)

1330
00:42:58,516 --> 00:42:59,925
(Ringdighidingdingghi)

1331
00:42:59,926 --> 00:43:00,926
Wrong.

1332
00:43:01,086 --> 00:43:02,585
- You were almost done. - That was close.

1333
00:43:02,586 --> 00:43:04,126
(That was so close.)

1334
00:43:04,426 --> 00:43:06,096
(She feels bummed out for her.)

1335
00:43:06,266 --> 00:43:07,525
- She's really good at it. - It's the last one.

1336
00:43:07,526 --> 00:43:08,665
- She did an amazing job. - It's the last one.

1337
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:10,396
- It's the last one. - She's very good.

1338
00:43:10,436 --> 00:43:12,336
(Ringdighidingdighidingdingding)

1339
00:43:13,106 --> 00:43:15,405
(Ringdighidingdighidingdingding)

1340
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:17,106
(Ringdighidingghidi)

1341
00:43:18,176 --> 00:43:20,646
(Puppy An Dingdingding feels very regretful.)

1342
00:43:20,746 --> 00:43:21,975
- It's the last one. - It's the last one.

1343
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:23,416
Girls, it's my last chance.

1344
00:43:23,846 --> 00:43:25,415
- Complete the Phrase. - Everyday Category.

1345
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:26,545
- Let's go, Lee Eun Ji. - You can do it.

1346
00:43:26,546 --> 00:43:27,645
- You can do it. - All right.

1347
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:28,686
No pressure.

1348
00:43:29,216 --> 00:43:30,686
(When we're nervous, we do the fire dance.)

1349
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:34,326
- Oa... - Sis.

1350
00:43:35,486 --> 00:43:36,596
Correct.

1351
00:43:38,626 --> 00:43:41,866
(Celebrating together)

1352
00:43:41,926 --> 00:43:44,236
Sir, the owner of the store.

1353
00:43:44,536 --> 00:43:46,206
Within 15 seconds.

1354
00:43:46,566 --> 00:43:48,165
- In 15 seconds? - Ringdighidingdighidingdingding.

1355
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:49,265
- In 15 seconds? - In 15 seconds.

1356
00:43:49,266 --> 00:43:50,835
- Not even 30 seconds? - Yes, 15 seconds.

1357
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,035
- This is your last try. - Yes.

1358
00:43:52,036 --> 00:43:53,245
- You can do it. - It's your last try.

1359
00:43:53,246 --> 00:43:54,275
- In 15 seconds. - Ringdighi...

1360
00:43:54,276 --> 00:43:56,176
- Please count 15 seconds. - Okay.

1361
00:43:56,316 --> 00:43:57,476
I'm going to focus.

1362
00:43:57,746 --> 00:43:58,746
Get ready.

1363
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:01,646
Start.

1364
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:07,155
(Ringdighidingdighidingdingding)

1365
00:44:07,156 --> 00:44:09,186
- Ringdighiding... - Wrong.

1366
00:44:09,756 --> 00:44:11,156
(Covering her mouth)

1367
00:44:11,556 --> 00:44:12,655
(Her reattempt fails.)

1368
00:44:12,656 --> 00:44:13,866
That's a shame.

1369
00:44:13,926 --> 00:44:16,025
- It was too hard. - The game is over.

1370
00:44:16,026 --> 00:44:17,365
- Well done. - Ringdighi...

1371
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:18,895
(Pacing around with a feeling of regret)

1372
00:44:18,896 --> 00:44:20,066
(Just dance.)

1373
00:44:20,506 --> 00:44:22,876
(I don't care. I'll just dance.)

1374
00:44:23,606 --> 00:44:25,136
Ringdighdingdi... That's it.

1375
00:44:25,236 --> 00:44:26,645
(With singing and dancing, it's easy to understand.)

1376
00:44:26,646 --> 00:44:27,976
That's right.

1377
00:44:28,046 --> 00:44:29,845
I'm sorry, but it's my lunchtime.

1378
00:44:29,846 --> 00:44:31,145
Can you please leave?

1379
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:32,716
He must have rhinitis.

1380
00:44:32,986 --> 00:44:34,085
It's his lunchtime.

1381
00:44:34,086 --> 00:44:35,086
(Eun Ji: Hooded sweatshirt, Mimi: Tumbler, Young Ji's hat, )

1382
00:44:35,087 --> 00:44:36,115
(Young Ji: handcrafted swallow, Yu Jin: A hooded sweatshirt)

1383
00:44:36,116 --> 00:44:37,155
Goodbye.

1384
00:44:37,156 --> 00:44:40,126
(NANA Souvenir Shop is closed.)

1385
00:44:40,826 --> 00:44:42,456
- It's cute. - I want to get one.

1386
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:46,526
(Full of regret)

1387
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,895
This shop has new souvenir items.

1388
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,365
Why don't you look around the Thieves' Market outside?

1389
00:44:52,366 --> 00:44:54,105
- The Thieves' Market? - Isn't it a flea market?

1390
00:44:54,106 --> 00:44:55,906
- I mean, flea market. - "Thieves' Market?"

1391
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:57,835
Actually, it was called the Thieves' Market.

1392
00:44:57,836 --> 00:45:00,505
- That's the original name? - Originally, it was where...

1393
00:45:00,506 --> 00:45:02,105
thieves sold items that they had stolen.

1394
00:45:02,106 --> 00:45:03,876
- A long time ago. - I see.

1395
00:45:04,476 --> 00:45:06,346
Now, it's just a flea market.

1396
00:45:07,316 --> 00:45:08,915
(Formerly known as the Thieves' Market, )

1397
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,516
(it's now a flea market.)

1398
00:45:10,756 --> 00:45:12,856
(Mercado de Santa Clara)

1399
00:45:13,486 --> 00:45:15,526
(From old vintage items)

1400
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:19,526
(A market that sells various artworks)

1401
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:23,096
(What kind of objects do they sell at the market?)

1402
00:45:23,296 --> 00:45:24,435
It's a hat.

1403
00:45:24,436 --> 00:45:25,935
(They decide to take a look around.)

1404
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:27,565
- There's Ronaldo. - There's another one.

1405
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:29,265
- The cat looks cute. - It's like Namdaemun Market.

1406
00:45:29,266 --> 00:45:30,675
It's very cute.

1407
00:45:30,676 --> 00:45:32,005
There are postcards for Yu Jin.

1408
00:45:32,006 --> 00:45:33,845
- I like postcards. - Right, Yu Jin.

1409
00:45:33,846 --> 00:45:36,645
- I need to buy postcards. - Did someone draw these?

1410
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:38,646
- He draws them himself. - They're adorable.

1411
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:40,085
He draws them.

1412
00:45:40,086 --> 00:45:41,086
(Stylish handmade postcards)

1413
00:45:41,087 --> 00:45:42,215
- Vintage. - Sunglasses.

1414
00:45:42,216 --> 00:45:44,056
These are so vintage.

1415
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:45,685
- Young Ji would like them. - It's the type for Young Ji.

1416
00:45:45,686 --> 00:45:46,855
You might hurt your eyes. These are reading glasses.

1417
00:45:46,856 --> 00:45:47,886
Are they okay?

1418
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:49,625
Doesn't she look good? What do you think of Young Ji?

1419
00:45:49,626 --> 00:45:51,896
- How do I look? - You'd love them.

1420
00:45:53,096 --> 00:45:54,126
How do I look with these?

1421
00:45:54,726 --> 00:45:55,866
Thank you.

1422
00:45:55,966 --> 00:45:57,565
There's a hat that you'd like.

1423
00:45:57,566 --> 00:45:59,395
- Yes. - You like unusual hats like that.

1424
00:45:59,396 --> 00:46:00,505
- Yu Jin. - Are these military uniforms?

1425
00:46:00,506 --> 00:46:02,035
How did you figure out what I like?

1426
00:46:02,036 --> 00:46:03,335
- There's a Korean military uniform. - Right.

1427
00:46:03,336 --> 00:46:05,135
- Let me show you Korean outfits. - "Hong Soon Woo."

1428
00:46:05,136 --> 00:46:06,676
It belonged to Soon Woo.

1429
00:46:06,846 --> 00:46:09,816
(Nice to meet you.)

1430
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:17,686
(The Thieves' Market has all sorts of things.)

1431
00:46:18,116 --> 00:46:19,485
There are so many pretty things.

1432
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,055
- I want to buy them all. - I want them.

1433
00:46:21,056 --> 00:46:22,726
- There's so much I want to buy. - It's hot.

1434
00:46:23,126 --> 00:46:25,126
- I need a pair of shoes. - It's very sunny.

1435
00:46:25,926 --> 00:46:27,625
We should've come here with our allowance.

1436
00:46:27,626 --> 00:46:28,995
- You're right. - Hello.

1437
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:30,165
The weather is beautiful too.

1438
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:31,435
- Goodness. - There's more inside.

1439
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:32,966
Girls, wait a minute.

1440
00:46:33,136 --> 00:46:34,335
It's Torong.

1441
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:35,765
"I'm away. Send me a message if you're interested."

1442
00:46:35,766 --> 00:46:36,775
Is it Torong?

1443
00:46:36,776 --> 00:46:37,835
It's Torong.

1444
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,335
"I'm away. Send me a message if you're interested."

1445
00:46:39,336 --> 00:46:40,346
Is it Torong?

1446
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:43,546
(A stall where Torong's shirt is hanging)

1447
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,876
"I'm away. Send me a message if you're interested."

1448
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:49,246
(In the middle of the Thieves' Market)

1449
00:46:49,316 --> 00:46:52,256
(the E-caders' items are on sale.)

1450
00:46:52,316 --> 00:46:56,855
(The items were lost in Abu Dhabi.)

1451
00:46:56,856 --> 00:47:01,495
(The one who stole: Cheol Yong)

1452
00:47:01,496 --> 00:47:04,396
(The one who ordered him: Torong)

1453
00:47:04,536 --> 00:47:07,266
(Found in Lisbon that's 8,100km away from Abu Dhabi)

1454
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:08,565
Look at that.

1455
00:47:08,566 --> 00:47:10,236
He left my shoe too.

1456
00:47:10,406 --> 00:47:11,535
These are mine.

1457
00:47:11,536 --> 00:47:13,405
Look, these belong to us.

1458
00:47:13,406 --> 00:47:15,276
(5 minutes ago)

1459
00:47:16,006 --> 00:47:19,346
(Torong appeared at the Thieves' Market.)

1460
00:47:20,446 --> 00:47:25,086
(He set up the stall with the stuff he stole.)

1461
00:47:27,756 --> 00:47:33,126
(Then he went away for a while.)

1462
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,465
(Torong is nearby!)

1463
00:47:35,466 --> 00:47:38,266
(Their main job, catching Torong, starts.)

1464
00:47:38,336 --> 00:47:40,466
- "I'm away. DM me if interested." - Darn him.

1465
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:42,365
- Hotel? Three minutes away. - Yes.

1466
00:47:42,366 --> 00:47:44,475
- In the bag. - Imagine if this got sold.

1467
00:47:44,476 --> 00:47:45,476
Guys, we...

1468
00:47:45,477 --> 00:47:46,906
(Young Ji gets back her glasses case.)

1469
00:47:47,946 --> 00:47:49,715
I finally found my bag.

1470
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:51,045
(Yu Jin gets back her bag.)

1471
00:47:51,046 --> 00:47:52,675
What's the point of having one shoe?

1472
00:47:52,676 --> 00:47:53,815
It's Torong, right?

1473
00:47:53,816 --> 00:47:55,745
(Mimi gets back her slipper.)

1474
00:47:55,746 --> 00:47:57,786
(And...)

1475
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:00,426
(placed beside their lost stuff...)

1476
00:48:00,826 --> 00:48:03,156
(is a note saying he is away.)

1477
00:48:03,696 --> 00:48:06,496
(It has someone's social media ID.)

1478
00:48:06,996 --> 00:48:08,365
- I, M, - I finally found my bag.

1479
00:48:08,366 --> 00:48:09,765
- F, E, - What's the use of having one shoe?

1480
00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:11,835
- Isn't this Cheol Yong? - D, R, A... It's Cheol Yong.

1481
00:48:11,836 --> 00:48:12,836
Fe-dragon, Cheol Yong.

1482
00:48:13,136 --> 00:48:14,506
- Cheol Yong... - Message him.

1483
00:48:14,866 --> 00:48:15,966
(I'm away. Send me a message. I'm at a hotel 3 minutes away.)

1484
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,806
(After leaving Cheol Yong's contact, )

1485
00:48:22,446 --> 00:48:25,576
(Torong left somewhere.)

1486
00:48:25,676 --> 00:48:27,046
(And...)

1487
00:48:28,846 --> 00:48:34,356
(Cheol Yong who followed him all the way to Lisbon)

1488
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:36,696
(What on earth are they scheming?)

1489
00:48:37,696 --> 00:48:39,796
(Additional information)

1490
00:48:40,226 --> 00:48:41,495
"A hotel three minutes away?"

1491
00:48:41,496 --> 00:48:42,796
Which hotel is three minutes away from here?

1492
00:48:44,096 --> 00:48:45,536
I just need to find the hotel.

1493
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:47,136
Which hotel?

1494
00:48:47,137 --> 00:48:48,165
(They look up nearby hotels.)

1495
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,166
Which hotel?

1496
00:48:49,606 --> 00:48:50,606

1498
00:48:54,406 --> 00:48:56,976
(There are a lot of them.)

1499
00:48:57,116 --> 00:48:58,576
There's a five-star hotel.

1500
00:48:59,046 --> 00:49:00,616
But it's 11 minutes away on foot.

1501
00:49:01,086 --> 00:49:02,286
There's one 350m away.

1502
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:03,615
This is 240m away.

1503
00:49:03,616 --> 00:49:04,816
(Option 3, a 3-star hotel)

1504
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:06,056
It's 170m away.

1505
00:49:06,886 --> 00:49:09,056
- It's 170m... - But there are a lot of hotels.

1506
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:16,696
(Their current location)

1507
00:49:16,836 --> 00:49:19,696
(Where are those two at?)

1508
00:49:19,766 --> 00:49:21,305
He's within three minutes.

1509
00:49:21,306 --> 00:49:23,936
Why did he bring these? I guess...

1510
00:49:24,036 --> 00:49:26,036
he just brought them here.

1511
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:29,106
- Things he brought from the hotel? - It's five minutes on foot.

1512

1513
00:49:33,616 --> 00:49:35,285

00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:37,086
(Towels)

1515
00:49:37,656 --> 00:49:39,155
- Is this a hotel towel? - What are these?

1516
00:49:39,156 --> 00:49:40,156
What is this?

1517
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:42,455
I think this is the logo.

1518
00:49:42,456 --> 00:49:44,225
- This must be the hotel's logo. - He took this from the hotel?

1519
00:49:44,226 --> 00:49:45,226
Yes.

1520
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:50,436
Mimi, check if there's a hotel with these logos.

1521
00:49:50,966 --> 00:49:52,135
Is this a QR code? No.

1522
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:53,735
I'm going to search the image.

1523
00:49:53,736 --> 00:49:55,535
She's amazing. Can you do that?

1524
00:49:55,536 --> 00:49:57,275
She's looking it up on the Internet.

1525
00:49:57,276 --> 00:49:58,276
Goodness.

No.

00:50:11,856 --> 00:50:13,955
(She finds a picture of a robe.)

1531
00:50:13,956 --> 00:50:15,626
Is this it? What do you think?

1532
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:20,666

1545
00:50:44,757 --> 00:50:47,786
(It's just 20m away!)

1546
00:50:47,886 --> 00:50:50,826
(If they turn their heads from the market...)

1547
00:50:53,496 --> 00:50:56,496
We can just go down that way and go straight.

1548
00:50:56,696 --> 00:50:58,166
- Okay, let's go. - Let's go.

1549
00:50:58,266 --> 00:50:59,535
Where is it? Give it to me, Mimi.

1550
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:00,936
- Take the stuff. - Take them.

1551
00:51:02,406 --> 00:51:04,075
It's to the left.

1552
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:06,135
He has no morals.

1553
00:51:06,136 --> 00:51:08,045
- He even stole from the hotel. - This way.

1554
00:51:08,046 --> 00:51:10,016
He stole the hotel stuff.

1555
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,276
This way.

1556
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:15,215
(They walk through the crowd.)

1557
00:51:15,216 --> 00:51:16,216
There.

1558
00:51:16,486 --> 00:51:18,756
We shouldn't... Will they spot us?

1559
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:20,885
(They head to the hotel Yu Jin found.)

1560
00:51:20,886 --> 00:51:22,055
Torong, you jerk.

1561
00:51:22,056 --> 00:51:23,955
(Destination, Casa dell'Arte Club House)

1562
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,026
It's this building.

1563
00:51:26,926 --> 00:51:27,926
It's this logo.

1564
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:34,106
(It's the hotel logo she looked up just now.)

1565
00:51:35,406 --> 00:51:37,906
(A fancy-looking building)

1566
00:51:38,406 --> 00:51:39,406
It's this logo.

1567
00:51:39,776 --> 00:51:41,005
- This is the right place. - Yes.

1568
00:51:41,006 --> 00:51:42,775
- This is the right place. - This is it, Yu Jin.

1569
00:51:42,776 --> 00:51:44,246

(The 1st floor is empty.)

1572
00:51:54,026 --> 00:51:55,026
Torong?

1573
00:51:55,027 --> 00:51:57,295
(The 1st floor is empty.)

1574
00:51:57,296 --> 00:51:59,755
Let's split up and search each door.

1575
00:51:59,756 --> 00:52:00,796
I'll head to the second floor.

1576
00:52:03,196 --> 00:52:09,566
(Eun Ji heads to the 2nd floor on her own.)

1577
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:15,105
(Yu Jin searches the 1st floor.)

1578
00:52:15,106 --> 00:52:16,206
He's not here.

1579
00:52:18,776 --> 00:52:22,916
(Mimi searches the storage.)

1580
00:52:24,116 --> 00:52:25,685
- He's not there, is he? - No. Let's check the 2nd floor.

1581
00:52:25,686 --> 00:52:26,726
- The 2nd floor? - I think he's on the 2nd floor.

1582
00:52:27,126 --> 00:52:28,155
Is it locked?

1583
00:52:28,156 --> 00:52:29,156
(Young Ji is unlocking the door.)
What is this?

1584
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:39,365
(She comes across a balcony on her way to the 2nd floor.)

1585
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:43,576
(It's locked.)

1586
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:50,746
(She heads to the 2nd floor again.)

1587
00:52:54,386 --> 00:52:57,585
(Girls!)

1588
00:52:57,586 --> 00:53:00,786
Girls!

1589
00:53:02,026 --> 00:53:03,856
(Cheol Yong is here.)

1590
00:53:04,026 --> 00:53:06,225
Girls!

1591
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:07,995
- Torong. It's on the second floor. - Girls.

1592
00:53:07,996 --> 00:53:08,996
- It's the second floor. - What are you?

1593
00:53:08,997 --> 00:53:10,396
(Flustered)

1594
00:53:10,736 --> 00:53:12,135
- Girls. What are you? - It's the second floor.

1595
00:53:12,136 --> 00:53:13,366
What are you?

1596
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:15,266
- Who are you? - Cheol Yong.

1597
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:16,975
(Meanwhile, those on the 1st floor can only hear the sound.)

1598
00:53:16,976 --> 00:53:17,976
The other side?

1599
00:53:18,736 --> 00:53:20,875
(Intimidated)

1600
00:53:20,876 --> 00:53:23,245
Eun Ji. where are you?

1601
00:53:23,246 --> 00:53:24,576
Here, on the second floor.

1602
00:53:25,216 --> 00:53:27,116
Hey!

1603
00:53:27,486 --> 00:53:29,645
- My goodness. - What is this?

1604
00:53:29,646 --> 00:53:30,655
(Only Cheol Yong is here, and Torong is gone.)

1605
00:53:30,656 --> 00:53:31,656
(Where is this place?)

1606
00:53:31,657 --> 00:53:33,086
- Come here. - Wait.

1607
00:53:35,686 --> 00:53:39,056
(This place is...)

1608
00:53:39,656 --> 00:53:40,665
(We'll become the kings of desserts.)

1609
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:43,296
(Torong and Cheol Yong's hideout)

1610
00:53:43,396 --> 00:53:45,536
(1 minute ago)

1611
00:53:46,436 --> 00:53:48,506
(Cheol Yong was chilling out alone.)

1612
00:53:49,236 --> 00:53:51,306
(Relaxed)

1613
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:55,905
(He was monitoring a laptop screen.)

1614
00:53:55,906 --> 00:53:57,076
(Girls!)

1615
00:53:57,476 --> 00:53:59,276
- Girls. - Torong. It's the second floor.

1616
00:53:59,376 --> 00:54:01,716
(He is captured by Eun Ji.)

1617
00:54:02,046 --> 00:54:03,886
- Who are you? - Wait.

1618
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:06,255
Move. Take his phone away.

1619
00:54:06,256 --> 00:54:07,925
Take his phone, I mean his laptop.

1620
00:54:07,926 --> 00:54:08,985
Take it.

1621
00:54:08,986 --> 00:54:10,255
- Stay still. - Where are you?

1622
00:54:10,256 --> 00:54:12,795
- Here, on the second floor. - Stay still.

1623
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:13,996
(She confiscates the laptop first.)

1624
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,696
What is this, guys?

1625
00:54:17,866 --> 00:54:19,435
- Come here, you. - Hold on.

1626
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:20,436
(On Cheol Yong's laptop screen...)

1627
00:54:20,536 --> 00:54:23,505
(is a person in a yellow hoodie...)

1628
00:54:23,506 --> 00:54:27,346
(waiting for someone somewhere.)

1629
00:54:27,446 --> 00:54:28,446
(Location A)

1630
00:54:28,447 --> 00:54:29,475
"Location A."

1631
00:54:29,476 --> 00:54:32,416
("Location A" written on a piece of paper)

1632
00:54:33,276 --> 00:54:34,315
There's someone.

1633
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:37,416
(What on earth is happening?)

1634
00:54:37,856 --> 00:54:40,886
(Everyone is very confused.)

1635
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,186
There, on the wall.

1636
00:54:42,586 --> 00:54:43,595
Mimi, hold him down.

1637
00:54:43,596 --> 00:54:44,626
"We'll become the kings of desserts."

1638
00:54:44,756 --> 00:54:45,796
"The showdown day."

1639
00:54:45,896 --> 00:54:47,926
- "Year 2025..." - Don't move, Cheol Yong.

1640
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:50,935
(Filling up one side of the wall...)

1641
00:54:50,936 --> 00:54:52,296
(The showdown day)

1642
00:54:52,396 --> 00:54:53,465
(Location A, get the egg tart recipe from a guy wearing a yellow hoodie)

1643
00:54:53,466 --> 00:54:54,565
(Many pieces of papers are stuck all over the wall.)

1644
00:54:54,566 --> 00:54:55,906
(Location B, get information on how to stow away)

1645
00:54:56,366 --> 00:54:58,436
(Stowaway)

1646
00:54:58,476 --> 00:55:01,805
(They read the notes one by one.)

1647
00:55:01,806 --> 00:55:03,816
"We'll go... Information on how to stow away..." Wait.

1648
00:55:04,216 --> 00:55:06,545
- Who is this? - Goodness.

1649
00:55:06,546 --> 00:55:08,886
- Riddle Master. - It's Brother Yeong Seok.

1650
00:55:10,986 --> 00:55:15,126
(Riddle Master, Producer Na)

1651
00:55:15,256 --> 00:55:17,625
Isn't this a WiFi password of some sort?

1652
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:19,655
(They start back from the top.)

1653
00:55:19,656 --> 00:55:21,596
(The showdown day)

1654
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:24,496
(Today's date)

1655
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:26,866
(Location A, get the egg tart recipe from a guy wearing a yellow hoodie)

1656
00:55:27,066 --> 00:55:28,905
(Location A)

1657
00:55:28,906 --> 00:55:30,105
This says "Location A."

1658
00:55:30,106 --> 00:55:32,236
("Location A" that was on the laptop)

1659
00:55:32,276 --> 00:55:33,276
"Egg tart."

1660
00:55:33,277 --> 00:55:35,106
- They already met. - They did.

1661
00:55:35,576 --> 00:55:38,916
(Location A where Torong will get the recipe from an unknown person)

1662
00:55:40,116 --> 00:55:43,986
(Torong was on his way to Location A.)

1663
00:55:44,656 --> 00:55:47,656
(Cheol Yong was monitoring Location A live.)

1664
00:55:49,656 --> 00:55:51,225
Location B. Shouldn't we go here?

1665
00:55:51,226 --> 00:55:53,426
- "Stow away." - He'll stow away after that.

1666
00:55:54,696 --> 00:55:58,836
(Torong set up a pretty detailed plan.)

1667
00:55:59,366 --> 00:56:01,665
Is his ultimate goal...

1668
00:56:01,666 --> 00:56:03,505
- to open a shop in The Hyundai, - The Hyundai.

1669
00:56:03,506 --> 00:56:04,506
The department store?

1670
00:56:04,876 --> 00:56:08,446
(After successfully stowing away from Lisbon, )

1671
00:56:09,206 --> 00:56:12,145
(Torong wishes to open his shop in a department store.)

1672
00:56:12,146 --> 00:56:13,685
This won't be a hint, right?

1673
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:14,785
(They look for other clues.)

1674
00:56:14,786 --> 00:56:16,085
What's "get information on how to stow away?"

1675
00:56:16,086 --> 00:56:17,415
He just took the egg tart recipe.

1676
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,416
Is there more?

1677
00:56:19,056 --> 00:56:21,185
- This. - Cheol Yong looks worn out.

1678
00:56:21,186 --> 00:56:22,286
Why don't we let him out of the frame?

1679
00:56:22,456 --> 00:56:23,695
(Laughing)

1680
00:56:23,696 --> 00:56:25,196
Don't move, Cheol Yong.

1681
00:56:25,496 --> 00:56:27,425
- Was there any other clue? - Cheol Yong.

1682
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,426
No.

1683
00:56:28,496 --> 00:56:30,336
Where is this Location A?

1684
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:34,006
(The meeting place for the egg tart recipe)

1685
00:56:34,706 --> 00:56:37,606
(Where is Location A?)

1686
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:40,035
What's "get information on how to stow away?"

1687
00:56:40,036 --> 00:56:41,045
(She checks the CCTV footage on the laptop again.)

1688
00:56:41,046 --> 00:56:43,346
- Is there more? - Stow away... This is Location A.

1689
00:56:44,976 --> 00:56:48,616
(Torong is nowhere to be seen.)

1690
00:56:49,016 --> 00:56:51,416
(Waving)

1691
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,586
- Hold on. - Come here.

1692
00:56:54,326 --> 00:56:55,326
It's Torong.

1693
00:56:57,256 --> 00:56:58,855
- It's Torong. - You spy.

1694
00:56:58,856 --> 00:57:00,526
That's the meeting location.

1695
00:57:00,826 --> 00:57:01,826
What's this?
(Torong finally shows up.)

1696
00:57:03,896 --> 00:57:04,996
The egg tart...

1697
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:08,235
(An egg tart box)

1698
00:57:08,236 --> 00:57:10,065
He's giving the egg tart to Torong.

1699
00:57:10,066 --> 00:57:11,305
(He takes out a piece of paper.)

1700
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:12,336
No, it's a note.

1701
00:57:13,336 --> 00:57:14,805
- They are... - He passed Torong a note.

1702
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,206
Making a secret deal.

1703
00:57:16,346 --> 00:57:18,346
- That's the recipe. - Who is that guy?

1704
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:20,046
It must be the dessert recipe.

1705
00:57:20,946 --> 00:57:22,145
- What's this? - Check his outfit.

1706
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:23,216
It's there!

1707
00:57:23,486 --> 00:57:24,815
It's there!

1708
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,685
(Where is Mimi pointing at?)

1709
00:57:26,686 --> 00:57:29,885
(The hotel)

1710
00:57:29,886 --> 00:57:32,225
(Here)

1711
00:57:32,226 --> 00:57:34,025
- That is Location A. - The bridge.

1712
00:57:34,026 --> 00:57:35,495
- That's where Mimi is pointing. - It's over there.

1713
00:57:35,496 --> 00:57:37,035
- It's there. - It's the same as in the video.

1714
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,036
- There he is. - The yellow hoodie.

1715
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,465
- There's a woman. - Over there.

1716
00:57:39,466 --> 00:57:40,805
(There's a woman.)

1717
00:57:40,806 --> 00:57:42,105
- There's Torong too. - There's a woman.

1718
00:57:42,106 --> 00:57:43,806
- He's still there. - The yellow hoodie.

1719
00:57:44,036 --> 00:57:45,136
- There he is. - The yellow hoodie.

1720
00:57:45,606 --> 00:57:49,476
(Point of Chang Dae's view in the midst of the chaos)

1721
00:57:49,606 --> 00:57:50,615
He's not there.

1722
00:57:50,616 --> 00:57:52,345
- The yellow hoodie. - Where?

1723
00:57:52,346 --> 00:57:54,685
The yellow hoodie in the video is over there.

1724
00:57:54,686 --> 00:57:55,885
- Where? - He is still there.

1725
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:57,015
- Where is that place? - Torong is there too.

1726
00:57:57,016 --> 00:57:58,356
- Torong is there too. - Torong is there too.

1727
00:57:58,686 --> 00:58:00,156
Doesn't it look like a cathedral?

1728
00:58:00,956 --> 00:58:02,185
They're still doing something.

1729
00:58:02,186 --> 00:58:03,486
(She looks it up on the map immediately.)

1730
00:58:03,726 --> 00:58:04,855
How do we get there?

1731
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:05,925
- We... - Why don't we go down...

1732
00:58:05,926 --> 00:58:06,955
- and ask? - Young Ji.

1733
00:58:06,956 --> 00:58:08,096
- Yes? - "National Pantheon."

1734
00:58:08,266 --> 00:58:09,365
- What? - "National Pantheon."

1735
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:10,366
Yes.

1736
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:12,666
(National Pantheon)

1737
00:58:18,206 --> 00:58:22,206
(Location A, National Pantheon)

1738
00:58:22,746 --> 00:58:25,476
(Torong meets the yellow hoodie...)

1739
00:58:25,976 --> 00:58:28,715
(and gets the egg tart recipe.)

1740
00:58:28,716 --> 00:58:29,885
- It's 120m away. - Let's get going.

1741
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:31,885
- Let's go. - Let's ask the people out there.

1742
00:58:31,886 --> 00:58:33,015
(Thanks to her quick search, they get going right away.)

1743
00:58:33,016 --> 00:58:34,756
- It's four minutes on foot. - You better watch out.

1744
00:58:34,956 --> 00:58:36,426
Who are you anyway?

1745
00:58:37,026 --> 00:58:38,155
Cheol Yong, mind your actions.

1746
00:58:38,156 --> 00:58:39,156
(Scared)

1747
00:58:39,157 --> 00:58:41,395
Isn't it better to go to Location B straight away?

1748
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:42,396
- We... - We don't know where that is.

1749
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:43,525
Since Torong is over there,

1750
00:58:43,526 --> 00:58:45,466
it's likely that place will have a clue to Location B.

1751
00:58:45,766 --> 00:58:46,935
You're right. The clue to Location B...

1752
00:58:46,936 --> 00:58:48,866
should be there.

1753
00:58:50,006 --> 00:58:51,006
Pantheon?

1754
00:58:51,376 --> 00:58:52,975
- What's the name again? - Information for stowaway.

1755
00:58:52,976 --> 00:58:54,206
National Pantheon.

1756
00:58:54,606 --> 00:58:56,905
(The members leave in haste!)

1757
00:58:56,906 --> 00:58:57,975
What should we do?

1758
00:58:57,976 --> 00:58:59,446
(The members leave in haste!)

1759
00:59:00,116 --> 00:59:03,046
(Meanwhile, Torong finishes his deal with the guy.)

1760
00:59:07,926 --> 00:59:10,185
Here it is. Mimi, look there.

1761
00:59:10,186 --> 00:59:11,996
- You're right, that's the place. - Turn right.

1762
00:59:13,656 --> 00:59:17,536
(Torong saunters down to the 1st floor.)

1763
00:59:18,236 --> 00:59:20,536
(The members arrive near the National Pantheon.)

1764
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:22,666
That must be the entrance.

1765
00:59:23,976 --> 00:59:26,005
- Where? - Pantheon.

1766
00:59:26,006 --> 00:59:27,406
- There he is. - There.

1767
00:59:28,006 --> 00:59:29,276
- There he is. - There.

1768
00:59:29,906 --> 00:59:31,275
- Get him. - Hey!

1769
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,815
(The members, Torong)

1770
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:34,915
- Get him. - Hey!

1771
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:35,946
Hey!

1772
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:40,015
(Torong is right in front of them!)

1773
00:59:40,016 --> 00:59:41,025
(Mimi: Get him!)

1774
00:59:41,026 --> 00:59:42,385
(Hey!)

1775
00:59:42,386 --> 00:59:45,296
(He gets on something.)

1776
00:59:45,826 --> 00:59:47,595
(Do I look like An Yu Jin to you?)

1777
00:59:47,596 --> 00:59:49,066
- He got on something. - Get him!

1778
00:59:49,396 --> 00:59:50,596
Did he get on a tuk-tuk?

1779
00:59:51,536 --> 00:59:54,066
(He disappears on a tuk-tuk.)

1780
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:59,436
(He avoided them by a hair!)

1781
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:05,176
(Gosh, when did they come here?)

1782
01:00:06,216 --> 01:00:07,285
Did he get on a tuk-tuk?

1783
01:00:07,286 --> 01:00:09,386
(Trembling in annoyance)

1784
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:10,816
Goodness.

1785
01:00:11,616 --> 01:00:13,515
This is our tuk-tuk.

1786
01:00:13,516 --> 01:00:14,725
- What? - It has cameras set up.

1787
01:00:14,726 --> 01:00:16,526
- This is our tuk-tuk. - What do you mean by ours?

1788
01:00:17,126 --> 01:00:20,395
(Mimi suddenly figures things out in her own way.)

1789
01:00:20,396 --> 01:00:21,725
- This is our tuk-tuk. - What do you mean by ours?

1790
01:00:21,726 --> 01:00:23,396
It has cameras set up. That means it's ours.

1791
01:00:24,136 --> 01:00:26,695
(An incredible way of putting things together)

1792
01:00:26,696 --> 01:00:28,266
- Where? - Get on quickly.

1793
01:00:28,936 --> 01:00:31,135
Excuse me. Can we...

1794
01:00:31,136 --> 01:00:32,205
- Yes. - Wait.

1795
01:00:32,206 --> 01:00:34,005
Isn't there a way to get on it?

1796
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:35,406
We don't know where it's headed.

1797
01:00:37,106 --> 01:00:40,346
(Where is Torong going...)

1798
01:00:40,446 --> 01:00:43,585
(after getting his hands on the recipe?)

1799
01:00:43,586 --> 01:00:45,385
(Location A, get the egg tart recipe from a guy wearing a yellow hoodie)

1800
01:00:45,386 --> 01:00:47,185
(Location B, get information on how to stow away...)

1801
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:49,686
(from Riddle Master)

1802
01:00:50,826 --> 01:00:55,226
(The Riddle Master has information on how to stow away.)

1803
01:00:56,026 --> 01:00:59,695
(Where is he?)

1804
01:00:59,696 --> 01:01:03,006
(Departure, Thieves' Market, Arrival, Location B)

1805
01:01:03,306 --> 01:01:04,535
- Girls. - Let's see.

1806
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:06,575
Torong posted something on his social media.

1807
01:01:06,576 --> 01:01:07,576
- Yes. - What does it say?

1808
01:01:07,646 --> 01:01:09,406
This is where the Riddle Master is.

1809
01:01:10,646 --> 01:01:13,375
(Does anyone know the answer? Please help me leave.)

1810
01:01:13,376 --> 01:01:16,946
(The Riddle Master's whereabouts)

1811
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:18,915
"Cameraman, Actor Choi Woo Shik,"

1812
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:20,485
"Kim Kardashian, CODE KUNST,"

1813
01:01:20,486 --> 01:01:21,755
- "Amor Fati." - I think...

1814
01:01:21,756 --> 01:01:23,626
we need to rearrange the words.

1815
01:01:23,656 --> 01:01:25,325
(A combination of 5-letter words)

1816
01:01:25,326 --> 01:01:27,265
(Camaeraman, Actyu Choi Woo Shik, Kim Kardassian, GODE KUNST, )

1817
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,196
(Amoro Fati)

1818
01:01:29,466 --> 01:01:30,865
"Camaeraman, Actyu Choi Woo Shik,"

1819
01:01:30,866 --> 01:01:32,866
- "Kim Kardassian." - "Kim Kardassian."

1820
01:01:32,996 --> 01:01:34,136
- "Ssian." - "Ssian."

1821
01:01:35,106 --> 01:01:37,336
Read it vertically. "Cachoikimgoa." Nothing?

1822
01:01:37,506 --> 01:01:38,535
"Dokyuanteuti."

1823
01:01:38,536 --> 01:01:40,906
What if we read the misspelled ones?

1824
01:01:41,446 --> 01:01:43,275
(There is a spelling error to each phrase.)

1825
01:01:43,276 --> 01:01:45,215
(Camaeraman, Actyu Choi Woo Shik, Kim Kardassian, GODE KUNST, )

1826
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:47,145
(Amoro Fati)

1827
01:01:47,146 --> 01:01:48,846
- "Mae." - "Maeyussi..."

1828
01:01:49,116 --> 01:01:50,886
- "Maeyu..." - "Goro."

1829
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:53,056
- "Maeyussi..." - "Maeyussigoro?"

1830
01:01:53,186 --> 01:01:54,655
- "Maeyussigoro." - I'll look it up.

1831
01:01:54,656 --> 01:01:55,656
- Okay. - Nice.

1832
01:01:55,986 --> 01:01:59,056
- "Maeyussigoro." - "Maeyussi..."

1833
01:01:59,256 --> 01:02:00,826
- "Maeyussigoro." - "Maeyussigoro."

1834
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:03,195
- "Maeyussigoro?" - "Maeyussigoro."

1835
01:02:03,196 --> 01:02:04,465
(She looks up "Maeyussigoro.")

1836
01:02:04,466 --> 01:02:05,666
- Any results? - No.

1837
01:02:05,896 --> 01:02:08,066
Lisbon Maeyussigoro.

1838
01:02:08,436 --> 01:02:10,105
- If you do that... - Goro.

1839
01:02:10,106 --> 01:02:11,505
I can't find anything.

1840
01:02:11,506 --> 01:02:12,636
(Nothing)

1841
01:02:13,036 --> 01:02:15,605
Should we try it with the correct spelling?

1842
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:16,606
"Mae..."

1843
01:02:17,246 --> 01:02:19,315
(If you correct the wrong spellings)

1844
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:24,916
(Me, woo, si, ko, reu)

1845
01:02:25,256 --> 01:02:28,025
- "Mewoosikoreu." - I only found a dessert cafe.

1846
01:02:28,026 --> 01:02:29,286
(Mewoosikoreu...)

1847
01:02:29,756 --> 01:02:31,526
- Nothing. - She found nothing.

1848
01:02:32,156 --> 01:02:34,625
So it's a clue to Location B. But what is it?

1849
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,765
(Me, woo, si, ko, reu)

1850
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:39,136
- It's not Saint George's Castle. - It's Commerce Square.

1851
01:02:39,736 --> 01:02:41,406
- Where? - It's Commerce Square.

1852
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:43,005
- You're right. - Commerce Square.

1853
01:02:43,006 --> 01:02:44,035
- You're right. - You're right.

1854
01:02:44,036 --> 01:02:45,106
- That's it. - You're right.

1855
01:02:45,476 --> 01:02:47,475
If you combine the misspelled letters,

1856
01:02:47,476 --> 01:02:49,176
- you get Commerce Square. - You get Commerce Square.

1857
01:02:49,246 --> 01:02:51,145
(Mae, yu, ssi, go, ro)

1858
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:57,555
(Ko, me, reu, si, woo)

1859
01:02:57,556 --> 01:03:04,126
("Koereusiwoo," Korean pronunciation of Commerce Square)

1860
01:03:04,356 --> 01:03:05,795
Isn't this the square we went yesterday?

1861
01:03:05,796 --> 01:03:07,295
- The Commerce Square? - Oh, that place?

1862
01:03:07,296 --> 01:03:09,026
- We saw the sunset there. - Right.

1863
01:03:09,566 --> 01:03:11,396
- You're right. - It's that place.

1864
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,336
(Afternoon of the day before)

1865
01:03:13,936 --> 01:03:16,766
(The place where they saw Lisbon's amazing sunset...)

1866
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:22,206
(and their roleplay reached its peak)

1867
01:03:22,676 --> 01:03:25,916
(This is Commerce Square.)

1868
01:03:26,516 --> 01:03:29,886
(Location B, Commerce Square)

1869
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:37,226
(The Riddle Master is here!)

1870
01:03:37,556 --> 01:03:39,195
Let's go to Commerce Square.

1871
01:03:39,196 --> 01:03:40,825
- It's Commerce Square. - Commerce Square.

1872
01:03:40,826 --> 01:03:41,865
Commerce Square.

1873
01:03:41,866 --> 01:03:44,166
(Departure, Thieves' Market, Arrival, Commerce Square)

1874
01:03:44,836 --> 01:03:46,366
How did you manage to find Commerce Square?

1875
01:03:46,696 --> 01:03:48,136
- You're incredible. - An Yu Jin.

1876
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,165
She's so smart.

1877
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:51,506
- She's a genius. - She sure is smart.

1878
01:03:52,176 --> 01:03:53,235
- She's so smart. - She's truly a genius.

1879
01:03:53,236 --> 01:03:54,346
Thank you.

1880
01:03:54,446 --> 01:03:55,775
Yu Jin is an expert...

1881
01:03:55,776 --> 01:03:57,106
- at looking up the information. - I agree.

1882
01:03:57,976 --> 01:04:00,515
She can work with such limited hints.

1883
01:04:00,516 --> 01:04:01,916
(Her eyes have become even shinier.)

1884
01:04:02,246 --> 01:04:03,916
I'm so excited. I can feel my adrenaline rush.

1885
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:05,886
- It's nice. - My body is producing dopamine.

1886
01:04:08,126 --> 01:04:10,126
- Why did he go to Commerce Square? - Follow the rabbit.

1887
01:04:10,586 --> 01:04:13,095
He plans to get the information to stow away...

1888
01:04:13,096 --> 01:04:14,425
- from the Riddle Master. - You said he would.

1889
01:04:14,426 --> 01:04:16,766
Must we catch the Riddle Master as well?

1890
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:19,296
The Riddle Master looked very familiar.

1891
01:04:19,836 --> 01:04:21,536
He looks pretty old.

1892
01:04:22,106 --> 01:04:23,665
(A last-minute notice)

1893
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:26,005
Where Torong put the corporate card...

1894
01:04:26,006 --> 01:04:27,506
- On his neck. - On his neck.

1895
01:04:27,706 --> 01:04:28,806
Is it on his neck?

1896
01:04:29,506 --> 01:04:33,516
(He modified the carrot rocket to become a necklace.)

1897
01:04:33,676 --> 01:04:35,246
We must grab him by his collar.

1898
01:04:35,546 --> 01:04:37,386
- Chop him in the neck. - Chop him.

1899
01:04:37,486 --> 01:04:38,886
Like karate.

1900
01:04:40,386 --> 01:04:42,485
(1 message)

1901
01:04:42,486 --> 01:04:44,255
I got a message from Armstorong.

1902
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:45,256
- What does he say? - What does it say?

1903
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:47,256
"Thanks for the glasses." How dare you?

1904
01:04:47,396 --> 01:04:48,895
- "Thanks for the glasses." - Come on.

1905
01:04:48,896 --> 01:04:50,165
Look. "Thanks for the glasses."

1906
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:51,895
- Young Ji, did he take one? - What's wrong with him?

1907
01:04:51,896 --> 01:04:52,896
How many do you have?

1908
01:04:52,897 --> 01:04:54,106
- Hold on. - One might be missing.

1909
01:04:54,236 --> 01:04:57,135
(Torong wearing it means...)

1910
01:04:57,136 --> 01:04:58,935
(Hold on.)

1911
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,275
- Darn it. - One section was empty.

1912
01:05:00,276 --> 01:05:01,346
Oh, no!

1913
01:05:01,906 --> 01:05:03,105
- He took one. - The glasses.

1914
01:05:03,106 --> 01:05:04,545
Yu Jin, my glasses.

1915
01:05:04,546 --> 01:05:06,345
I'll get back your glasses first thing.

1916
01:05:06,346 --> 01:05:07,515
- Yu Jin, get back my glasses first. - We must get it back.

1917
01:05:07,516 --> 01:05:08,915
We can get back the corporate card next time.

1918
01:05:08,916 --> 01:05:10,515
(Torong uploaded a post just now.)

1919
01:05:10,516 --> 01:05:11,885
(You suck at rock-paper-scissors...)

1920
01:05:11,886 --> 01:05:13,855
(and have become slower in running. I was shocked.)

1921
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:15,585
(You suck at rock-paper-scissors and have become slower in running.)

1922
01:05:15,586 --> 01:05:17,326
- Hold on, Mimi. - What is it?

1923
01:05:17,726 --> 01:05:19,825
"You suck at rock-paper-scissors and have become slower in running?"

1924
01:05:19,826 --> 01:05:21,026
Is this directed at me?

1925
01:05:21,596 --> 01:05:22,695
I kind of think so.

1926
01:05:22,696 --> 01:05:23,696
(Looking murderous)

1927
01:05:23,697 --> 01:05:25,865
Yu Jin is offended.

1928
01:05:25,866 --> 01:05:27,296
Offended?

1929
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:28,666
This is wrong.

1930
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,035
- Yu Jin. - I'm not a slow runner.

1931
01:05:30,036 --> 01:05:31,476
Tell Torong to get into the water.

1932
01:05:31,836 --> 01:05:33,706
Do you want to get into the water?

1933
01:05:34,506 --> 01:05:37,376
Are you scared? Are you offended?

1934
01:05:37,876 --> 01:05:38,945
- Torong... - I don't think...

1935
01:05:38,946 --> 01:05:40,446
- she can go back to her idol self. - Really?

1936
01:05:41,846 --> 01:05:43,386
Should I not say "scared" and just stick to "offended?"

1937
01:05:45,516 --> 01:05:47,056
Are you offended?

1938
01:05:48,426 --> 01:05:50,386
- It's cute and nice. - Cute...

1939
01:05:51,296 --> 01:05:54,596
(Meanwhile, Commerce Square)

1940
01:05:57,296 --> 01:05:59,936
(Torong shows up.)

1941
01:06:01,806 --> 01:06:05,306
(To get the information to stow away, )

1942
01:06:06,036 --> 01:06:09,806
(he is looking for the Riddle Master.)

1943
01:06:10,076 --> 01:06:12,215
- We're here. - Yes, we are.

1944
01:06:12,216 --> 01:06:13,315
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1945
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:15,415
- I have your back. - Be careful.

1946
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:16,486
Let's run.

1947
01:06:16,886 --> 01:06:21,086
(They rush to the square.)

1948
01:06:21,926 --> 01:06:24,296
Look for a rabbit head.

1949
01:06:25,026 --> 01:06:27,196
The Riddle Master must be in the square.

1950
01:06:28,466 --> 01:06:29,966
Where is Torong?

1951
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:32,765
The Riddle Master.

1952
01:06:32,766 --> 01:06:34,066
(Where is the Riddle Master?)

1953
01:06:34,806 --> 01:06:36,236
Where is Torong?

1954
01:06:38,006 --> 01:06:39,136
The Riddle Master.

1955
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:42,606
Gosh, Eun Ji.

1956
01:06:43,106 --> 01:06:44,546
You're running pretty fast today.

1957
01:06:45,616 --> 01:06:49,546
(Eun Ji is the slowest runner among the members.)

1958
01:06:50,346 --> 01:06:53,355
(Eun Ji and Yu Jin search together.)

1959
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:54,625
- Where is Torong? - Mi Hyun.

1960
01:06:54,626 --> 01:06:56,056
- Yes? - Shall we search there?

1961
01:06:56,486 --> 01:06:57,486
Shall we go there?

1962
01:06:57,487 --> 01:06:58,626
(Mimi and Young Ji search together.)

1963
01:06:59,496 --> 01:07:00,556
- Torong. - What?

1964
01:07:00,926 --> 01:07:03,095
- Where is he? - I found the Riddle Master!

1965
01:07:03,096 --> 01:07:04,366
The Riddle Master!

1966
01:07:04,836 --> 01:07:06,496
- I found him! - The Riddle Master!

1967
01:07:07,296 --> 01:07:08,736
The Riddle Master!

1968
01:07:08,906 --> 01:07:09,906
What?

1969
01:07:09,907 --> 01:07:11,405
(Laughing)

1970
01:07:11,406 --> 01:07:12,406
This...

1971
01:07:13,036 --> 01:07:14,036
Goodness.

1972
01:07:14,037 --> 01:07:15,545
Welcome, warriors.

1973
01:07:15,546 --> 01:07:16,745
- Look at him. - Hurry up.

1974
01:07:16,746 --> 01:07:18,176
He looks terrible.

1975
01:07:20,476 --> 01:07:24,956
(Riddle Master tells you everything if you solve his riddle.)

1976
01:07:25,486 --> 01:07:30,326
(These are improvised props found in Abu Dhabi.)

1977
01:07:31,056 --> 01:07:33,956
- A rabbit came just before. - Right.

1978
01:07:34,726 --> 01:07:36,995
Are you looking to solve a riddle?

1979
01:07:36,996 --> 01:07:38,366
- Yes! - That's right!

1980
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:41,236
(1 minute ago)

1981
01:07:42,936 --> 01:07:44,306
(Correct!)

1982
01:07:44,736 --> 01:07:48,006
(Torong finds out the stowaway route.)

1983
01:07:48,976 --> 01:07:51,476
(He is very excited!)

1984
01:07:55,746 --> 01:08:00,856
(Torong sets off to stow away.)

1985
01:08:01,726 --> 01:08:04,055
Are you looking to solve a riddle?

1986
01:08:04,056 --> 01:08:05,296
- Yes! - That's right!

1987
01:08:06,556 --> 01:08:07,796
What is that?

1988
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,795
- Then... - Yes?

1989
01:08:09,796 --> 01:08:11,736
- What's that? - If you get it right in a minute...

1990
01:08:13,136 --> 01:08:14,565
What am I doing?

1991
01:08:14,566 --> 01:08:16,705
Don't lose the vibe.

1992
01:08:16,706 --> 01:08:18,675
Are you sure you'll get the correct answer?

1993
01:08:18,676 --> 01:08:20,176
- We're sure. - We are.

1994
01:08:20,236 --> 01:08:21,605
This is hard work.

1995
01:08:21,606 --> 01:08:22,606
The question.

1996
01:08:23,006 --> 01:08:24,816
- The first question! - He spit on me.

1997
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:28,286
(Sorry!)

1998
01:08:28,946 --> 01:08:31,155
You have to guess the name...

1999
01:08:31,156 --> 01:08:32,586
- of a sport. - Okay.

2000
01:08:32,856 --> 01:08:37,285
What’s the name of this sport where you push and spin the bed?

2001
01:08:37,286 --> 01:08:38,725
- Bed? - Push the bed?

2002
01:08:38,726 --> 01:08:40,595
- You have one minute. - Push the bed?

2003
01:08:40,596 --> 01:08:42,125
- You have a minute. - Is this a trick question?

2004
01:08:42,126 --> 01:08:44,166
- It's a trick question. - Yes, it is.

2005
01:08:44,296 --> 01:08:46,666
- The one where you throw things. - Shot-putting!

2006
01:08:46,796 --> 01:08:48,806
- Shot-putting is incorrect. - You push and spin.

2007
01:08:48,906 --> 01:08:50,975
- Why would you push a bed? - Push and spin?

2008
01:08:50,976 --> 01:08:53,006
You push the bed...

2009
01:08:53,176 --> 01:08:55,705
- and then spin. - The bed?

2010
01:08:55,706 --> 01:08:57,205
Give us the name of such a sport.

2011
01:08:57,206 --> 01:08:59,376
It's not soccer and it's not basketball.

2012
01:08:59,546 --> 01:09:02,115
- You have 20 seconds. - You push the bed...

2013
01:09:02,116 --> 01:09:03,145
Push the bed and spin.

2014
01:09:03,146 --> 01:09:05,386
Ah! Mimi! Volleyball.

2015
01:09:05,586 --> 01:09:08,086
Volleyball is wrong!

2016
01:09:08,226 --> 01:09:09,786
- Push bed spin? - Ten seconds.

2017
01:09:09,926 --> 01:09:10,956
It's wrong.

2018
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:12,826
- What is it? - Something to do with bed.

2019
01:09:12,956 --> 01:09:14,295
You push.

2020
01:09:14,296 --> 01:09:16,666
- Then spin. - You push then spin?

2021
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,935
- You push then spin? - In 5, 4,

2022
01:09:18,936 --> 01:09:20,035
- Bed spinning. - three,

2023
01:09:20,036 --> 01:09:21,436
- Bed spinning? - two,

2024
01:09:21,506 --> 01:09:22,866
- Be villain. - one. Wrong!

2025
01:09:23,236 --> 01:09:24,606
- Bed. - The answer is...

2026
01:09:24,736 --> 01:09:26,606
badminton.

2027
01:09:26,836 --> 01:09:28,375
- Badminton! - What is this?

2028
01:09:28,376 --> 01:09:30,575
- In one minute. - What is that?

2029
01:09:30,576 --> 01:09:31,876
- Really! - Gosh.

2030
01:09:32,016 --> 01:09:33,545
You can try again in one minute.

2031
01:09:33,546 --> 01:09:35,646
Producer Na, you really live life to the fullest.

2032
01:09:35,886 --> 01:09:37,516
- I'm not a producer. - I mean...

2033
01:09:37,916 --> 01:09:39,015
He really gives everything.

2034
01:09:39,016 --> 01:09:40,455
- I'm tearing up. - I'm not a producer.

2035
01:09:40,456 --> 01:09:41,655
This is quite moving.

2036
01:09:41,656 --> 01:09:44,126
I have a question. How long have you been here?

2037
01:09:45,026 --> 01:09:46,525
- About 12 minutes? - Really?

2038
01:09:46,526 --> 01:09:47,895
Personally, I'm very moved.

2039
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:49,396
(1 minute later)

2040
01:09:49,526 --> 01:09:51,395
Can I give you the next question?

2041
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,595
- Yes! - Please!

2042
01:09:52,596 --> 01:09:53,896
If you get this question right,

2043
01:09:54,296 --> 01:09:56,935
I'll tell you where the rabbit went.

2044
01:09:56,936 --> 01:09:58,035
(My cringe level is maxing out.)

2045
01:09:58,036 --> 01:10:00,136
He learned acting from "Reply 1994."

2046
01:10:01,176 --> 01:10:02,806
- Now for the second quiz. - Okay.

2047
01:10:03,706 --> 01:10:07,246
When Winnie the Pooh gets hit by a car...

2048
01:10:07,646 --> 01:10:09,116
what do you call it?

2049
01:10:09,186 --> 01:10:10,916
(You have one minute.)

2050
01:10:11,016 --> 01:10:13,116
Pooh got hit by a car. Pooh-crash!

2051
01:10:13,186 --> 01:10:14,655
Car...

2052
01:10:14,656 --> 01:10:16,226
Car.. Pooh accident.

2053
01:10:16,356 --> 01:10:17,926
- Car accident. Pooh-car. - Car accident.

2054
01:10:18,456 --> 01:10:19,896
- Pooh accident. - Pooh.

2055
01:10:20,356 --> 01:10:22,866
- Cappuccino! - Car-Pohh.

2056
01:10:23,626 --> 01:10:24,735
Correct!

2057
01:10:24,736 --> 01:10:26,296
(Cappuccino)

2058
01:10:27,066 --> 01:10:29,105
(They got it right in 18 seconds.)

2059
01:10:29,106 --> 01:10:30,405
- We did it! - Correct answer!

2060
01:10:30,406 --> 01:10:32,275
Cappuccino!

2061
01:10:32,276 --> 01:10:33,435
- Now what? - The information...

2062
01:10:33,436 --> 01:10:36,446
Now, I have to give you the information I gave Torong.

2063
01:10:36,776 --> 01:10:39,316
- It’s a QR code. - This is the hint.

2064
01:10:39,476 --> 01:10:41,185
(This is the QR code with stowaway info.)

2065
01:10:41,186 --> 01:10:42,615
Hurry up and scan it, will you?

2066
01:10:42,616 --> 01:10:44,045
(If you point the camera at it, the link pops up.)

2067
01:10:44,046 --> 01:10:45,286
I'm so embarrassed now.

2068
01:10:45,716 --> 01:10:47,316
- It's linking to something. - It's Naver.

2069
01:10:48,626 --> 01:10:50,086
(Naver.com)

2070
01:10:52,696 --> 01:10:54,356
- What is it? - It's a bus ticket.

2071
01:10:54,466 --> 01:10:56,365
- It's a bus ticket. - It leaves at 1:55pm.

2072
01:10:56,366 --> 01:10:57,725
- What time is it now? - It's 1:14pm.

2073
01:10:57,726 --> 01:10:59,066
We have about 40 minutes left.

2074
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:01,136
(The bus leaves in 40 minutes.)

2075
01:11:01,666 --> 01:11:05,035
(A map link shows up when you scroll down.)

2076
01:11:05,036 --> 01:11:07,776
(Belem Tower)

2077
01:11:08,146 --> 01:11:10,046
- It's Belem Tower! - Check the route.

2078
01:11:11,876 --> 01:11:15,246
(Belem Tower)

2079
01:11:16,246 --> 01:11:21,986
(They search the route from Commerce Square to Belem Tower.)

2080
01:11:22,986 --> 01:11:24,455
- Let's take the tuk-tuk. - Okay.

2081
01:11:24,456 --> 01:11:25,495
Thanks for everything.

2082
01:11:25,496 --> 01:11:26,625
Warriors!

2083
01:11:26,626 --> 01:11:27,926
- Yes! - Thank you!

2084
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:29,896
- Be healthy! - What are those?

2085
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:33,535
It's meaningful to meet like this. Let's take a picture together.

2086
01:11:33,536 --> 01:11:34,965
Please don't do this.

2087
01:11:34,966 --> 01:11:36,836
- One, two, three. - I rather not take one.

2088
01:11:37,206 --> 01:11:39,276
(Day 1 of wishing Brother Yeong Seok would shave)

2089
01:11:39,376 --> 01:11:41,375
I think the Riddle Master is cute.

2090
01:11:41,376 --> 01:11:43,206
- I know. - "Warriors."

2091
01:11:43,246 --> 01:11:44,945
I wish he'd dress like that when he was with us.

2092
01:11:44,946 --> 01:11:46,675
- Me too. - He looks nice.

2093
01:11:46,676 --> 01:11:47,946
- Oh, dear. - What?

2094
01:11:48,046 --> 01:11:49,086
Honey?

2095
01:11:49,616 --> 01:11:52,715
(One last look)

2096
01:11:52,716 --> 01:11:54,286
(Location B, get information on how to stow away from Riddle Master)

2097
01:11:54,986 --> 01:11:55,986
(Stowaway)

2098
01:11:55,987 --> 01:11:59,026
(Torong's final goal!)

2099
01:12:03,166 --> 01:12:07,536
(Now, Torong only has to stow away.)

2100
01:12:07,936 --> 01:12:11,406
(3 days ago)

2101
01:12:11,906 --> 01:12:15,546
(He acquired the golden coffee recipe.)

2102
01:12:16,306 --> 01:12:20,416
(Then he headed to Lisbon, Portugal.)

2103
01:12:21,016 --> 01:12:24,986
(He acquired the egg tart recipe.)

2104
01:12:25,016 --> 01:12:26,656
(Egg tart recipe. Golden coffee recipe)

2105
01:12:27,116 --> 01:12:32,726
(Now the only thing left is to stow away.)

2106
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:36,726
(At the place where the Age of Discovery began, )

2107
01:12:37,096 --> 01:12:40,736
(will he pull off the stowaway?)

2108
01:12:41,936 --> 01:12:44,876
- To the Belem Tower, please. - Can we go to the Belem Tower?

2109
01:12:46,276 --> 01:12:52,516
(They're chasing Torong to Belem Tower!)

2110
01:12:52,646 --> 01:12:56,446
(Traveling from Commerce Square to Belem Tower)

2111
01:12:56,946 --> 01:12:58,215
It's this one.

2112
01:12:58,216 --> 01:12:59,716
(They take another look at the hint.)

2113
01:13:00,216 --> 01:13:02,526
- It's 1:55pm. - Okay.

2114
01:13:03,056 --> 01:13:04,896
We have to look for the yellow bus.

2115
01:13:04,996 --> 01:13:06,026
Yellow bus.

2116
01:13:06,526 --> 01:13:08,566
Lisbon yellow bus.

2117
01:13:08,966 --> 01:13:10,595
There's a yellow bus tour too.

2118
01:13:10,596 --> 01:13:11,966
The yellow bus?

2119
01:13:12,296 --> 01:13:13,895
I think being a stowaway is suspicious.

2120
01:13:13,896 --> 01:13:15,565
- That he's stowing away. - Really?

2121
01:13:15,566 --> 01:13:17,035
(Stowing away means sneaking out of the country by ship or plane.)

2122
01:13:17,036 --> 01:13:20,106
(By ship or plane)

2123
01:13:20,376 --> 01:13:22,806
(But, a bus ticket?)

2124
01:13:23,076 --> 01:13:24,545
- How can we stow away by a bus? - Stowing away on a bus?

2125
01:13:24,546 --> 01:13:25,716
That won't be easy.

2126
01:13:25,876 --> 01:13:27,715
- Yellow bus. - Then it won't be a city tour.

2127
01:13:27,716 --> 01:13:30,546
He could be taking the tour bus to the stowaway place.

2128
01:13:31,456 --> 01:13:33,655
- Torong just put up a post. - What does it say?

2129
01:13:33,656 --> 01:13:34,885
Egg tart acquired. That's my dive!

2130
01:13:34,886 --> 01:13:36,826
You guys just dive into the pool.

2131
01:13:37,256 --> 01:13:38,825
(They're impressed by the punchline.)

2132
01:13:38,826 --> 01:13:40,355
He has his way with words.

2133
01:13:40,356 --> 01:13:41,596
- Nice one. - Unbelievable.

2134
01:13:41,766 --> 01:13:44,226
(Meanwhile, at Belem Tower)

2135
01:13:48,336 --> 01:13:49,966
(Torong has already arrived.)

2136
01:13:50,136 --> 01:13:51,476
(Come here.)

2137
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:54,575
(Cheol Yong made a narrow escape from the hotel.)

2138
01:13:54,576 --> 01:13:55,746
(Slap!)

2139
01:13:56,506 --> 01:13:58,716
(We were found out because of you!)

2140
01:14:00,216 --> 01:14:03,916
(They plan to stow away together.)

2141
01:14:05,886 --> 01:14:07,556
(Whispering)

2142
01:14:10,886 --> 01:14:12,496
(Whispering again)

2143
01:14:13,726 --> 01:14:15,196
(Nodding)

2144
01:14:15,926 --> 01:14:19,736
(They're a duo going beyond "Dumb and Dumber.")

2145
01:14:19,996 --> 01:14:21,235
It's 48 minutes past.

2146
01:14:21,236 --> 01:14:22,705
- Be careful going around. - It's at 55 minutes.

2147
01:14:22,706 --> 01:14:24,265
This is a close call.

2148
01:14:24,266 --> 01:14:25,736
(They have 7 minutes left until bus departure time.)

2149
01:14:25,806 --> 01:14:28,106
I think we'll arrive at 50 minutes past.

2150
01:14:28,176 --> 01:14:30,106
We have to catch him in less than five minutes.

2151
01:14:30,276 --> 01:14:31,946
He posted a new one.

2152
01:14:32,076 --> 01:14:33,445
Goodbye?

2153
01:14:33,446 --> 01:14:34,615
- He said goodbye. - Where is he now?

2154
01:14:34,616 --> 01:14:36,785
- No, it's not 55 past yet. - Where is he?

2155
01:14:36,786 --> 01:14:38,585
He posted this 21 seconds ago saying goodbye.

2156
01:14:38,586 --> 01:14:40,056
Is that the Belem Tower?

2157
01:14:40,356 --> 01:14:41,686
I think so.

2158
01:14:42,326 --> 01:14:43,486
It's the Belem Tower.

2159
01:14:44,286 --> 01:14:47,796
(The dumb duo is still looking for the bus.)

2160
01:14:48,696 --> 01:14:52,266
(Torong wants to communicate again.)

2161
01:14:54,736 --> 01:14:55,736
Get it?

2162
01:14:56,736 --> 01:15:00,306
(So frustrated, Torong spoke in Earth language by mistake.)

2163
01:15:07,346 --> 01:15:11,586
(Torong is giving orders about something.)

2164
01:15:12,186 --> 01:15:14,516
(Cheol Yong gets the lookout duty.)

2165
01:15:16,786 --> 01:15:19,856
(Torong starts looking for the yellow bus again.)

2166
01:15:20,256 --> 01:15:22,526
- We're nearly there. - We've arrived.

2167
01:15:23,826 --> 01:15:25,936
Is that Torong's head by any chance?

2168
01:15:26,536 --> 01:15:27,565
It's 50 minutes past.

2169
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:29,305
- We have to go to the tower. - It's the yellow bus.

2170
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:31,406
We have to catch him in five minutes.

2171
01:15:31,606 --> 01:15:32,606
Get off now.

2172
01:15:33,136 --> 01:15:34,535
(Can they catch Torong in less than 5 minutes?)

2173
01:15:34,536 --> 01:15:36,776
- Where to? The tower? - Run!

2174
01:15:37,306 --> 01:15:38,376
Run to the tower!

2175
01:15:40,746 --> 01:15:44,186
(They just run at full speed toward the tower.)

2176
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:49,726
(Torong feels their presence.)

2177
01:15:50,656 --> 01:15:53,355
(The E-caders are closing in!)

2178
01:15:53,356 --> 01:15:54,865
(E-caders, Torong)

2179
01:15:54,866 --> 01:15:56,025
Come one, run.

2180
01:15:56,026 --> 01:15:57,796
(E-caders, Torong)

2181
01:15:59,036 --> 01:16:01,705
(They're just running with their eyes on the tower.)

2182
01:16:01,706 --> 01:16:02,706
Go to the tower.

2183
01:16:05,306 --> 01:16:06,776
(Quickly turning away)

2184
01:16:10,046 --> 01:16:12,946
(While E-caders are looking at one direction, )

2185
01:16:13,316 --> 01:16:15,986
(Torong turns and bolts in another!)

2186
01:16:16,046 --> 01:16:19,716
(E-caders, Torong)

2187
01:16:20,086 --> 01:16:21,726
Did you see the rabbit?

2188
01:16:22,056 --> 01:16:23,786
(E-caders still haven't noticed.)

2189
01:16:23,986 --> 01:16:26,926
(Running at full speed!)

2190
01:16:30,596 --> 01:16:31,935
Did you see the rabbit?

2191
01:16:31,936 --> 01:16:32,996
(E-caders have no idea about this.)

2192
01:16:33,036 --> 01:16:34,065
The yellow bus.

2193
01:16:34,066 --> 01:16:37,036
(They arrive at Belem Tower.)

2194
01:16:37,436 --> 01:16:39,636
(There's nothing.)

2195
01:16:39,976 --> 01:16:41,446
I don't have a clue.

2196
01:16:44,476 --> 01:16:45,776
Did you see the rabbit?

2197
01:16:48,786 --> 01:16:50,846
(Meanwhile, Cheol Yong, who was on lookout duty, )

2198
01:16:52,186 --> 01:16:55,556
(bravely sets out to rescue Torong.)

2199
01:16:55,626 --> 01:16:57,826
(Torong)

2200
01:16:58,556 --> 01:17:01,666
(But he completely misses Torong.)

2201
01:17:02,126 --> 01:17:04,795
(Where is he headed?)

2202
01:17:04,796 --> 01:17:08,266
(He's headed toward E-caders.)

2203
01:17:09,566 --> 01:17:12,436
(No!)

2204
01:17:12,736 --> 01:17:14,336
(E-caders had been lost and confused.)

2205
01:17:14,436 --> 01:17:15,446
Over there!

2206
01:17:16,076 --> 01:17:17,245
- Where? - Over there!

2207
01:17:17,246 --> 01:17:18,616
(They hit the jackpot!)

2208
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:20,146
- That's Cheol Yong! - Over there!

2209
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:21,945
(Just get him!)

2210
01:17:21,946 --> 01:17:23,185
He's over there.

2211
01:17:23,186 --> 01:17:24,345
- Get him! - He's over there.

2212
01:17:24,346 --> 01:17:25,385
(Running again)

2213
01:17:25,386 --> 01:17:26,856
- Over there! - That's Cheol Yong.

2214
01:17:27,386 --> 01:17:28,386
Torong's over there.

2215
01:17:28,726 --> 01:17:30,826
- He's over there! - Get him!

2216
01:17:32,596 --> 01:17:33,596
Get him!

2217
01:17:38,096 --> 01:17:40,736
(Torong's speed picks up.)

2218
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:46,176
(Will the Torong hunters catch him again?)

2219
01:17:47,306 --> 01:17:49,906
(Meanwhile, Park Wan Kyu is clearly out of steam.)

2220
01:17:50,446 --> 01:17:52,116
He must have exercised hard.

2221
01:17:54,476 --> 01:17:55,686
I'll get Cheol Yong.

2222
01:17:56,346 --> 01:17:57,686
(Eun Ji goes after the easy target!)

2223
01:17:58,616 --> 01:18:02,456
(Cheol Yong’s back says it all. He's giving his best.)

2224
01:18:02,856 --> 01:18:06,256
(This is the slowest race in the variety show history.)

2225
01:18:07,926 --> 01:18:10,796
(Panting)

2226
01:18:12,166 --> 01:18:13,195
Cheol Yong.

2227
01:18:13,196 --> 01:18:14,766
(These two are gasping for air.)

2228
01:18:20,676 --> 01:18:21,676
Hey!

2229
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:25,445
(Panting)

2230
01:18:25,446 --> 01:18:29,946
Cheol Yong. Why did you run?

2231
01:18:31,286 --> 01:18:33,916
(It roughly means he's sorry.)

2232
01:18:34,986 --> 01:18:36,726
Cheol Yong, let's go.

2233
01:18:37,326 --> 01:18:38,456
Let's walk.

2234
01:18:40,096 --> 01:18:43,166
This place feels like that cemetery in Melbourne, Australia.

2235
01:18:43,466 --> 01:18:44,496
Jun Young.

2236
01:18:46,336 --> 01:18:49,405
(Meanwhile, what's up with Torong?)

2237
01:18:49,406 --> 01:18:52,776
(He's demonstrating 2 years of Jamsu Bridge running experience.)

2238
01:18:54,876 --> 01:18:56,345
(Panting)

2239
01:18:56,346 --> 01:18:57,676
What's wrong with him?

2240
01:18:58,376 --> 01:18:59,915
(This Torong hunter is totally drained.)

2241
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:00,916
Wait a second.

2242
01:19:02,116 --> 01:19:03,516
Can't you hold this for me?

2243
01:19:03,916 --> 01:19:04,916
Please?

2244
01:19:04,917 --> 01:19:06,556
(For the first time in any race, she hands over the camera.)

2245
01:19:07,456 --> 01:19:10,656
(Boxing Mimi is running nonstop.)

2246
01:19:18,266 --> 01:19:20,766
(Torong is still way off in the distance.)

2247
01:19:22,606 --> 01:19:25,106
(The yellow bus finally appears.)

2248
01:19:25,336 --> 01:19:26,836
It's the yellow bus!

2249
01:19:27,606 --> 01:19:28,606
So that's it.

2250
01:19:30,546 --> 01:19:33,716
(Final sprint)

2251
01:19:34,846 --> 01:19:38,816
(She has to catch him before the bus takes off!)

2252
01:19:40,286 --> 01:19:44,056
(But Torong hops on in a flash!)

2253
01:19:46,226 --> 01:19:48,266
(Depart!)

2254
01:19:51,026 --> 01:19:54,036
(The hunter appears!)

2255
01:19:54,636 --> 01:19:56,866
- You got him! - Where's the card?

2256
01:19:57,106 --> 01:19:58,406
Cheol Yong must have it.

2257
01:19:58,806 --> 01:20:00,035
(Fumbling)

2258
01:20:00,036 --> 01:20:01,106
Where's the card?

2259
01:20:01,846 --> 01:20:02,846
Doesn't he have it?

2260
01:20:02,847 --> 01:20:03,945
(He put the corporate card in his pocket for the magic trick.)

2261
01:20:03,946 --> 01:20:04,946
Let me see.

2262
01:20:05,316 --> 01:20:06,445
(Torong always struggles with endings.)

2263
01:20:06,446 --> 01:20:07,446
We found it.

2264
01:20:09,186 --> 01:20:14,186
Wait. The bus is supposed to leave at 1:55pm.

2265
01:20:14,516 --> 01:20:17,986
You succeeded in catching him at 1:53pm!

2266
01:20:18,356 --> 01:20:19,356
(Clapping)

2267
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:20,396
Eun Ji.

2268
01:20:21,156 --> 01:20:23,026
She went after Cheol Yong.

2269
01:20:23,826 --> 01:20:25,295
Did they catch Torong?

2270
01:20:25,296 --> 01:20:26,495
They did?

2271
01:20:26,496 --> 01:20:27,896
The bus is leaving at 1:55pm.

2272
01:20:28,666 --> 01:20:30,305
(They hold hands tightly.)

2273
01:20:30,306 --> 01:20:31,636
Cheol Yong, why are you taking the bus?

2274
01:20:32,336 --> 01:20:33,336
You don't know?

2275
01:20:34,876 --> 01:20:35,876
Hold tight.

2276
01:20:35,877 --> 01:20:37,145
Eun Ji is bringing Cheol Yong.

2277
01:20:37,146 --> 01:20:38,206
(Refreshing charm)

2278
01:20:39,146 --> 01:20:40,475
(They arrive safely.)

2279
01:20:40,476 --> 01:20:41,516
Cheol Yong!

2280
01:20:42,886 --> 01:20:44,216
Eun Ji, we caught Torong.

2281
01:20:47,486 --> 01:20:49,386
(Bump)

2282
01:20:51,486 --> 01:20:54,125
(Cheol Yong is pitiful until the end.)

2283
01:20:54,126 --> 01:20:56,095
- Get on. - We caught him.

2284
01:20:56,096 --> 01:20:59,436
(Everyone manages to get on the yellow bus.)

2285
01:21:00,436 --> 01:21:01,436
Oh, dear.

2286
01:21:01,437 --> 01:21:04,106
(They all ran like track stars.)

2287
01:21:04,136 --> 01:21:05,235
This is so hard.

2288
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:06,836
Why has he become so fast?

2289
01:21:07,776 --> 01:21:10,106
Torong is so fast.

2290
01:21:10,676 --> 01:21:13,515
Good work everyone. Now, you'll see how...

2291
01:21:13,516 --> 01:21:14,745
- Torong... - Take a good look.

2292
01:21:14,746 --> 01:21:16,786
Planned to stow away on this bus.

2293
01:21:17,216 --> 01:21:19,386
- This is crazy. - I bet it's going into the sea.

2294
01:21:22,726 --> 01:21:23,955
I bet it's going into the sea.

2295
01:21:23,956 --> 01:21:27,326
(The yellow bus charges straight toward the sea.)

2296
01:21:31,766 --> 01:21:33,596
(Dopamine overload!)

2297
01:21:37,436 --> 01:21:39,506
- Amazing! - Girls!

2298
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:42,646
(This is not a roller coaster.)

2299
01:21:43,246 --> 01:21:45,816
(This is not a water ride.)

2300
01:21:47,016 --> 01:21:48,516
- Insane! - Wow!

2301
01:21:48,816 --> 01:21:52,216
(The bus splashes straight into the Atlantic!)

2302
01:21:53,456 --> 01:21:55,225
- I love it! - Insane!

2303
01:21:55,226 --> 01:21:57,886
(Torong’s plan was surprisingly spectacular.)

2304
01:21:58,286 --> 01:21:59,625
(Still feeling the moment)

2305
01:21:59,626 --> 01:22:01,866
- This is so cool! - It's like I'm in a spy movie.

2306
01:22:01,966 --> 01:22:03,195
I love it.

2307
01:22:03,196 --> 01:22:04,826
I thought I was on a water ride.

2308
01:22:05,866 --> 01:22:07,965
- What is this? - It's an amphibious bus.

2309
01:22:07,966 --> 01:22:09,465
It's called the HIPPOtrip bus.

2310
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:11,505
I never thought I’d ride an amphibious bus in my life.

2311
01:22:11,506 --> 01:22:13,235
They put the bus and boat together.

2312
01:22:13,236 --> 01:22:14,276
(Going through both land and river, it offers unique tour experience.)

2313
01:22:14,606 --> 01:22:17,676
We caught Torong!

2314
01:22:19,146 --> 01:22:21,016
- This is so nice. - We caught him!

2315
01:22:21,446 --> 01:22:23,486
We won 1,300 dollars!

2316
01:22:24,646 --> 01:22:26,015
Don't you love this?

2317
01:22:26,016 --> 01:22:28,315
- I love it. - It's so nice.

2318
01:22:28,316 --> 01:22:29,655
(Torong was ready to cross the Tagus River.)

2319
01:22:29,656 --> 01:22:31,625
- I'm so grateful. - I love this.

2320
01:22:31,626 --> 01:22:33,955
- Right. - I'm grateful we can enjoy this.

2321
01:22:33,956 --> 01:22:36,726
(He wanted to escape to somewhere beyond the Atlantic!)

2322
01:22:37,326 --> 01:22:39,796
Cheol Yong, why did you do it?

2323
01:22:40,696 --> 01:22:42,336
Why did you betray us?

2324
01:22:43,036 --> 01:22:44,465
(What is he doing?)

2325
01:22:44,466 --> 01:22:45,976
(Wiggling)

2326
01:22:46,076 --> 01:22:47,505
Cheol Yong, why did you do it? Say sorry.

2327
01:22:47,506 --> 01:22:49,576
- Apologize. - Say sorry.

2328
01:22:50,046 --> 01:22:51,876
- I'm sorry. - Thank you for apologizing.

2329
01:22:52,616 --> 01:22:55,615
Yu Jin searched everything.

2330
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:59,215
- Right. - She became faster at finding...

2331
01:22:59,216 --> 01:23:00,356
- related information. - Yes.

2332
01:23:01,216 --> 01:23:02,726
She's just bad at rock-paper-scissors

2333
01:23:03,556 --> 01:23:04,556
She's the best.

2334
01:23:04,557 --> 01:23:07,526
Torong! Rock-paper-scissors.

2335
01:23:08,596 --> 01:23:10,996
Yu Jin's skill has come back now.

2336
01:23:25,816 --> 01:23:28,685
Torong and Cheol Yong have gone back to space.

2337
01:23:28,686 --> 01:23:30,245
Congratulations on catching them.

2338
01:23:30,246 --> 01:23:32,555
Congratulations. Thank you, Yu Jin.

2339
01:23:32,556 --> 01:23:34,315
Good work, Mimi.

2340
01:23:34,316 --> 01:23:35,955
- You too, Eun Ji. - You as well, Young JI.

2341
01:23:35,956 --> 01:23:38,255
- Good work, everyone. - Producer Na.

2342
01:23:38,256 --> 01:23:40,456
Are we getting 1,300 dollars each?

2343
01:23:41,356 --> 01:23:43,065
But how did it become 1,300 dollars?

2344
01:23:43,066 --> 01:23:44,426
- Incentive. - There's interest.

2345
01:23:44,526 --> 01:23:47,196
Don't you remember our contract terms?

2346
01:23:47,766 --> 01:23:49,305
- Ten percent each. - At the Thai dessert place.

2347
01:23:49,306 --> 01:23:50,705
We agreed to raise it by 10 percent each.

2348
01:23:50,706 --> 01:23:52,306
That's right. It was in Thailand.

2349
01:23:52,836 --> 01:23:54,776
You have a great memory when it comes to things like this.

2350
01:23:56,076 --> 01:23:58,546
We'll make it 1,300 dollars each, adjusted for inflation.

2351
01:23:58,646 --> 01:24:00,876
- Nice! - We'll pay you that.

2352
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:02,416
Nice!

2353
01:24:02,546 --> 01:24:04,885
I'm hungry. I want to eat cup ramyeon.

2354
01:24:04,886 --> 01:24:07,455
I really want to eat cup tteokbokki.

2355
01:24:07,456 --> 01:24:09,286
I'm craving for crazy cold soju.

2356
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,856
What is she saying?

2357
01:24:11,126 --> 01:24:12,826
I want Korean food.

2358
01:24:12,926 --> 01:24:15,295
- I want Korean food. - It's about time we have it.

2359
01:24:15,296 --> 01:24:16,765
I want soju.

2360
01:24:16,766 --> 01:24:18,735
- I'm hungry. - We're hungry.

2361
01:24:18,736 --> 01:24:19,996
- I want raw fish. - Is there budae jjigae?

2362
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:23,866
(Miles away from Korea and in a foreign land, )

2363
01:24:24,566 --> 01:24:27,406
(it's been 6 days since they had Korean food.)

2364
01:24:27,476 --> 01:24:28,706
Are we going to a Korean restaurant?

2365
01:24:29,246 --> 01:24:31,976
- I'm hungry. - I'm hungry.

2366
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:33,946
I've only been waiting for this day.

2367
01:24:34,276 --> 01:24:36,186
This is the day for Korean food.

2368
01:24:36,486 --> 01:24:39,755
- I'm hungry. - I crave Korean food.

2369
01:24:39,756 --> 01:24:40,756
(Shouting for Korean food, they set off for the restaurant)

2370
01:24:41,616 --> 01:24:44,085
Are we there yet?

2371
01:24:44,086 --> 01:24:46,256
- We have to go for 20 more minutes. - We're still a long way away.

2372
01:24:46,926 --> 01:24:49,495
It's the rush hour.

2373
01:24:49,496 --> 01:24:50,496
(Unluckily, they're stuck in rush hour.)

2374
01:24:51,026 --> 01:24:53,896
(The roads are packed with cars.)

2375
01:24:54,436 --> 01:24:57,266
(This is a 20-minute route, but an hour has passed already.)

2376
01:24:57,636 --> 01:25:00,606
When we get there, can we just get one food?

2377
01:25:01,036 --> 01:25:03,005
Can't you give us just one dish?

2378
01:25:03,006 --> 01:25:04,075
(They’ve reached the point of asking for free food.)

2379
01:25:04,076 --> 01:25:06,475
Ask Yeong Seok directly to give us a dish.

2380
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:07,576
I wonder what he'll say.

2381
01:25:07,846 --> 01:25:09,316
- I think he'll say yes. - Me too.

2382
01:25:09,416 --> 01:25:11,486
- I don't think so. - He could flat out refuse.

2383
01:25:12,616 --> 01:25:14,815
- A hip Korean restaurant? - What is that?

2384
01:25:14,816 --> 01:25:16,386
(They light up instantly.)

2385
01:25:17,026 --> 01:25:19,326
(Tonight, the dinner spot looks even more welcoming.)

2386
01:25:19,426 --> 01:25:20,595
(Japchae, bulgogi, gimbap, galbijjim, chicken gomtang)

2387
01:25:20,596 --> 01:25:25,866
(Just the names on the wall make their hearts flutter.)

2388
01:25:26,566 --> 01:25:28,365
(It’s been a whole 6 days since they left Korea.)

2389
01:25:28,366 --> 01:25:30,836
(It's about time they crave Korean food.)

2390
01:25:32,436 --> 01:25:38,106
(There's a steaming bowl of soup.)

2391
01:25:39,546 --> 01:25:43,986
(This place filled with Korean food seems more welcoming in Lisbon.)

2392
01:25:44,446 --> 01:25:46,656
(They arrive at their first Korean restaurant.)

2393
01:25:46,956 --> 01:25:50,326
- So much traffic. - We've arrived.

2394
01:25:52,226 --> 01:25:53,355
(Just thinking about Korean food gets them dancing.)

2395
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:54,396
Be careful.

2396
01:25:55,296 --> 01:25:56,296
It looks good.

2397
01:25:58,166 --> 01:26:00,535
(They finally enter the restaurant.)

2398
01:26:00,536 --> 01:26:02,336
Look at the words behind you. They're so pretty.

2399
01:26:02,436 --> 01:26:04,405
There's chicken gomtang.

2400
01:26:04,406 --> 01:26:06,305
- I want to eat jjajangmyeon. - Me too.

2401
01:26:06,306 --> 01:26:08,306
Yu Jin, they have chicken gomtang. There's galbijjim.

2402
01:26:09,576 --> 01:26:11,475
- Amazing. - Jjajangmyeon!

2403
01:26:11,476 --> 01:26:13,076
(She charges straight for galbijjim.)

2404
01:26:13,276 --> 01:26:15,015
- I want to take this. - Rice cake soup with dumplings.

2405
01:26:15,016 --> 01:26:17,346
- Nice. - I want to hang this in my house.

2406
01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:18,956
Galbijjim.

2407
01:26:19,686 --> 01:26:21,255
Come quickly, Yeong Seok.

2408
01:26:21,256 --> 01:26:23,625
- Why aren't we eating? - Yeong Seok.

2409
01:26:23,626 --> 01:26:26,556
There's something very important I have to tell you.

2410
01:26:27,126 --> 01:26:29,295
Because of the traffic jam,

2411
01:26:29,296 --> 01:26:30,965
we are so very hungry.

2412
01:26:30,966 --> 01:26:32,736
It took us an hour for a 20-minute trip.

2413
01:26:32,996 --> 01:26:36,266
So how about just giving us the first dish?

2414
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:37,965
- No! - Why not?

2415
01:26:37,966 --> 01:26:39,305
I'm not Yeong Seok of the past.

2416
01:26:39,306 --> 01:26:41,475
- What is this? - He's turned so cold.

2417
01:26:41,476 --> 01:26:43,076
Are you a hybrid transformer?

2418
01:26:43,176 --> 01:26:45,105
- I’m on the verge of losing my job. - Why?

2419
01:26:45,106 --> 01:26:47,676
I'm not needed if I can't even say "wrong!"

2420
01:26:47,746 --> 01:26:49,585
- Woo Jung said that? - She told me...

2421
01:26:49,586 --> 01:26:51,385
to be really firm today.

2422
01:26:51,386 --> 01:26:52,415
- Woo Jung. - Oh, no.

2423
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,386
No! Yu Jin, no! Wait!

2424
01:26:55,756 --> 01:26:58,326
- I feel dizzy. - No!

2425
01:26:58,756 --> 01:26:59,796
I'm hungry.

2426
01:27:00,426 --> 01:27:02,125
Since you caught Torong today,

2427
01:27:02,126 --> 01:27:03,526
it’s time for a long-awaited Korean food party!

2428
01:27:03,626 --> 01:27:05,196
That's the good news.

2429
01:27:05,966 --> 01:27:07,496
- I'm so happy. - And...

2430
01:27:07,596 --> 01:27:10,266
the bad news is you don't get to eat everything.

2431
01:27:10,366 --> 01:27:11,436
- What? - What do you mean?

2432
01:27:12,236 --> 01:27:14,776
There will be a simple game every time a new dish comes out.

2433
01:27:15,176 --> 01:27:17,046
If you succeed, you'll get to eat it.

2434
01:27:17,146 --> 01:27:18,346
You won't if you fail.

2435
01:27:18,446 --> 01:27:20,545
I came here today with strong determination.

2436
01:27:20,546 --> 01:27:22,586
Why do you need to be determined all the time?

2437
01:27:22,786 --> 01:27:25,316
You were like "Warriors of Earth!" earlier.

2438
01:27:25,616 --> 01:27:26,816
Is that why you're like this now?

2439
01:27:27,086 --> 01:27:28,886
I feel so sorry for you.

2440
01:27:29,126 --> 01:27:30,156
I know, right?

2441
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:31,385
You're worried you might get demoted.

2442
01:27:31,386 --> 01:27:32,996
Isn't that why you're trying so hard?

2443
01:27:33,096 --> 01:27:35,526
- Don't be, I'm fine. - You're in Princess Na mode now.

2444
01:27:35,666 --> 01:27:37,495
Before I announce the game...

2445
01:27:37,496 --> 01:27:39,365
you're going to play for Korean food,

2446
01:27:39,366 --> 01:27:41,366
- why don't you see the first dish? - I'd like that.

2447
01:27:41,536 --> 01:27:43,106
- We're... - Please bring the first dish.

2448
01:27:43,366 --> 01:27:44,366
- Show us! - It's gimbap!
- It's gimbap! - Nice!

2449
01:27:45,367 --> 01:27:47,505
- I love gimbap! - I was craving this so much.

2450
01:27:47,506 --> 01:27:49,076
- Goodness. - I love gimbap so much.

2451
01:27:49,546 --> 01:27:50,805
- It doesn't have a lot of rice. - Are those mushrooms?

2452
01:27:50,806 --> 01:27:52,515
- I love this type of gimbap. - It looks so good!

2453
01:27:52,516 --> 01:27:54,815
I prefer gimbap without too much rice in it.

2454
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:55,885
It looks delicious.

2455
01:27:55,886 --> 01:27:57,415
I haven't smelled sesame oil in so long.

2456
01:27:57,416 --> 01:27:58,516
This looks amazing.

2457
01:27:58,616 --> 01:27:59,755
- It has a lot of vegetables, too. - Gosh!

2458
01:27:59,756 --> 01:28:00,856
I really want to have it.

2459
01:28:01,986 --> 01:28:04,056
(Did you think we're in Korea?)

2460
01:28:04,756 --> 01:28:07,396
(No, this gimbap was made in Lisbon with local ingredients.)

2461
01:28:08,156 --> 01:28:10,765
(Gimbap)

2462
01:28:10,766 --> 01:28:12,635
- It looks so good. - It's the type you make at home.

2463
01:28:12,636 --> 01:28:14,135
- I like that. - I know, right?

2464
01:28:14,136 --> 01:28:15,365
The kind where you put everything...

2465
01:28:15,366 --> 01:28:16,905
- you can find in the fridge. - Right, raid-the-fridge gimbap.

2466
01:28:16,906 --> 01:28:17,935
This type of gimbap feels more...

2467
01:28:17,936 --> 01:28:20,106
- Korean. - Right, I agree.

2468
01:28:20,436 --> 01:28:22,105
- Should we get started? - Yes!

2469
01:28:22,106 --> 01:28:23,445
- Great. - I'd love to have this right now.

2470
01:28:23,446 --> 01:28:24,746
- Is it a new game? - It's very simple.

2471
01:28:25,276 --> 01:28:26,616
Completing four syllables...

2472
01:28:27,016 --> 01:28:28,075
- of everyday words. - Complete the Word?

2473
01:28:28,076 --> 01:28:29,186
Okay, that's easy.

2474
01:28:29,286 --> 01:28:31,146
(Complete the Word, Everyday Category)

2475
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:32,685
- Cock? - Roach.

2476
01:28:32,686 --> 01:28:33,716
Correct.

2477
01:28:33,886 --> 01:28:35,085
- Porcu? - Pine.

2478
01:28:35,086 --> 01:28:36,156
Correct!

2479
01:28:36,986 --> 01:28:38,786
- Star? - King!

2480
01:28:38,896 --> 01:28:40,426
Wrong!

2481
01:28:40,856 --> 01:28:43,125
(They have to go all the way around to get the dish.)

2482
01:28:43,126 --> 01:28:44,126
- Gosh, I'm so nervous. - Are you going first?
Easy!

2483
01:28:45,127 --> 01:28:47,435
- But I'm very cold-hearted today. - No.

2484
01:28:47,436 --> 01:28:49,105
So I'm going to call you out very quickly.

2485
01:28:49,106 --> 01:28:50,106
I'll say "wrong" right away.

2486
01:28:50,107 --> 01:28:51,735
- For example, - Why is he being so harsh?

2487
01:28:51,736 --> 01:28:52,736
North, south?
- East... - Wrong!

2488
01:28:53,737 --> 01:28:55,106
- What? - Goodness!

2489
01:28:55,306 --> 01:28:56,646
- No way! - His voice!

2490
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:57,906
- His voice is different! - I mean...

2491
01:28:58,046 --> 01:28:59,475
- you should let her speak! - I didn't even finish!

2492
01:28:59,476 --> 01:29:01,475
- This is how we're going to do it. - Gosh.

2493
01:29:01,476 --> 01:29:02,885
(He's not just chilly, he's ice cold.)

2494
01:29:02,886 --> 01:29:04,186
- What? - He's like a robot!

2495
01:29:07,256 --> 01:29:08,555
- Should we start with Eun Ji? - Yes!

2496
01:29:08,556 --> 01:29:09,756
You're good at this game, Eun Ji.

2497
01:29:10,456 --> 01:29:11,626
- Yes, she's good. - Okay.

2498
01:29:12,256 --> 01:29:14,226
- He'll say two syllables first. - Let's begin.

2499
01:29:16,526 --> 01:29:17,996
- Lucky? - Guy.

2500
01:29:18,126 --> 01:29:19,135
Wrong!

2501
01:29:19,136 --> 01:29:20,436
- Wait, why? - You know, "lucky guy!"

2502
01:29:20,636 --> 01:29:21,835
- Lucky? - Guy.

2503
01:29:21,836 --> 01:29:23,405
(Wrong!)

2504
01:29:23,406 --> 01:29:24,636
- You know, "lucky guy!" - What's "lucky guy?"

2505
01:29:25,297 --> 01:29:27,227
- He'll say two syllables first. - Let's begin.

2506
01:29:29,567 --> 01:29:31,097
- Lucky? - Guy.

2507
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:32,196
Wrong!

2508
01:29:32,197 --> 01:29:33,606
- Wait, why? - You know, "lucky guy!"

2509
01:29:33,607 --> 01:29:34,837
- Lucky? - Guy.

2510
01:29:34,907 --> 01:29:36,336
Wrong! What?

2511
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:37,376
- You know, "lucky guy!" - What's "lucky guy?"

2512
01:29:37,377 --> 01:29:39,036
- Why is that wrong? - You know, "lucky guy!"

2513
01:29:39,037 --> 01:29:40,046
- She was right! - It's Ro Hong Chul's catchphrase.

2514
01:29:40,047 --> 01:29:41,507
- Why am I wrong? - Lucky guy!

2515
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:44,316
(What's wrong with "lucky guy?")

2516
01:29:44,317 --> 01:29:45,416
- What's wrong with that? - Lucky guy!

2517
01:29:45,417 --> 01:29:47,986
(Strong resistance)

2518
01:29:47,987 --> 01:29:49,016
Lucky guy!

2519
01:29:49,017 --> 01:29:50,457
Don't you know this catchphrase?

2520
01:29:50,987 --> 01:29:53,186
- Is it popular? - I think this is correct.

2521
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:54,456
- Come on, she's right! - Give us the point!

2522
01:29:54,457 --> 01:29:55,756
(He got it "wrong" on the very first question.)

2523
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:56,826
- Producer Na. - Hey, come on!

2524
01:29:56,827 --> 01:29:59,497
You're going too far!

2525
01:29:59,867 --> 01:30:01,366
This is too excessive.

2526
01:30:01,367 --> 01:30:03,066
Remember Ro Hong Chul?

2527
01:30:03,067 --> 01:30:05,136
"I'm a lucky guy!" He used to do this all the time.

2528
01:30:05,137 --> 01:30:06,406
- She's right! - Why is "lucky guy" wrong?

2529
01:30:06,407 --> 01:30:08,037
We were actually going for lucky...

2530
01:30:08,707 --> 01:30:11,136
- Lucky Vicky! - Exactly.

2531
01:30:11,137 --> 01:30:12,906
- I'm so lucky! - That's not the only answer.

2532
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:15,647
- Okay, you're not wrong. - I like "lucky guy."

2533
01:30:16,447 --> 01:30:17,517
Let's continue.

2534
01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:20,616
- Stir-fry? - Pork!

2535
01:30:20,617 --> 01:30:21,617
Correct!

2536
01:30:21,618 --> 01:30:23,217
- OO? - Samsam.

2537
01:30:23,457 --> 01:30:24,516
- Wrong! - Wait.

2538
01:30:24,517 --> 01:30:25,927
- Why not? - Samsamohoh.

2539
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,227
- She said "ohohsamsam." - Oh, no.

2540
01:30:27,557 --> 01:30:28,786
She's right! "Ohohsamsam" is right.

2541
01:30:28,787 --> 01:30:30,026
- It's "ohohsamsam." - Ohohsamsam.

2542
01:30:30,027 --> 01:30:32,426
I thought I was saying "samsamohoh."

2543
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,427
"Ohohsamsam?"

2544
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:36,137
Let's say I used inversion.

2545
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:37,466
- Yes, inversion! - Not "samsamohoh,"

2546
01:30:37,467 --> 01:30:38,467
- but "ohohsamsam." - That makes sense.

2547
01:30:38,468 --> 01:30:39,737
You can switch things around.

2548
01:30:40,737 --> 01:30:42,106
- Wait a minute. - This is too harsh!

2549
01:30:42,107 --> 01:30:43,206
No, could you please...

2550
01:30:43,207 --> 01:30:45,477
I mean, they're basically the same words.

2551
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:46,747
No, could you please...

2552
01:30:47,277 --> 01:30:48,977
(She just handed the gimbap back to Mimi.)

2553
01:30:49,547 --> 01:30:50,577
What?

2554
01:30:50,877 --> 01:30:51,976
Why did you give it to her?

2555
01:30:51,977 --> 01:30:53,717
- Why did you hand it to her? - Get it back!

2556
01:30:53,917 --> 01:30:56,017
I'm not giving it back!

2557
01:30:56,657 --> 01:30:58,487
(Gimbap is out.)

2558
01:30:59,357 --> 01:31:00,357
I'm so sorry.

2559
01:31:00,527 --> 01:31:02,127
This is a phrase from the lyrics...

2560
01:31:02,727 --> 01:31:05,726
of one of your members' hit songs.

2561
01:31:05,727 --> 01:31:07,096
- Even our OOTD - That's what we were looking for.

2562
01:31:07,097 --> 01:31:08,767
- Is just so like us - Oh, that phrase.

2563
01:31:08,827 --> 01:31:10,136
Right, OOTD.

2564
01:31:10,137 --> 01:31:11,597
- Could you sing us that part? - It reminds you of samsamohoh.

2565
01:31:11,837 --> 01:31:15,006
(Even our OOTD is just so like us)

2566
01:31:15,007 --> 01:31:17,977
(When it comes to my favorite things)

2567
01:31:18,937 --> 01:31:21,176
See? She sang it right away.

2568
01:31:21,177 --> 01:31:23,077
Do you even know what OOTD means, Producer Na?

2569
01:31:23,217 --> 01:31:25,147
- I know OOTD. - What does it mean?

2570
01:31:25,447 --> 01:31:26,546
(Snorting)

2571
01:31:26,547 --> 01:31:28,046
- What if I get it right? - Yes?

2572
01:31:28,047 --> 01:31:29,857
- What will you do? - I'll go on a digital detox.

2573
01:31:30,517 --> 01:31:32,726
- Gosh! - Young Ji, you can't be serious!

2574
01:31:32,727 --> 01:31:33,957
Young Ji, you can't!

2575
01:31:34,187 --> 01:31:35,527
- Please, calm down. - Don't do it.

2576
01:31:36,297 --> 01:31:38,957
- Gosh! - Don't do it. Please don't.

2577
01:31:39,267 --> 01:31:40,596
- Young Ji, you can't be serious! - Young Ji, you can't!

2578
01:31:40,597 --> 01:31:41,797
- Please, calm down. - Don't do it.

2579
01:31:42,067 --> 01:31:44,536
Don't do it, for our sake.

2580
01:31:44,537 --> 01:31:46,267
(And for our sake, too.)

2581
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:47,867
I'll do better. I'll focus.

2582
01:31:48,037 --> 01:31:49,406
- We got this. - I'm sorry.

2583
01:31:49,407 --> 01:31:50,537
You're good.

2584
01:31:51,407 --> 01:31:52,776
- Goodness! - Is it beef jeon?

2585
01:31:52,777 --> 01:31:54,446
- It's kimchi and green onion jeon. - It's jeon.

2586
01:31:54,447 --> 01:31:55,607
I absolutely need to have this.

2587
01:31:55,807 --> 01:31:57,717
This round is assorted jeon.

2588
01:31:58,547 --> 01:32:01,187
(Made with Lisbon's green onions, kimchi, and pancake mix)

2589
01:32:01,787 --> 01:32:04,387
(And crispy texture after being cooked with Lisbon's oil)

2590
01:32:04,687 --> 01:32:07,356
(Assorted jeon)

2591
01:32:07,357 --> 01:32:09,186
I was really craving jeon.

2592
01:32:09,187 --> 01:32:11,497
I love this oily, greasy smell.

2593
01:32:11,757 --> 01:32:13,196
- Let's start. - All right.

2594
01:32:13,197 --> 01:32:14,367
- Who will start? - It smells amazing.

2595
01:32:14,527 --> 01:32:15,597
Eun Ji will start.

2596
01:32:16,267 --> 01:32:17,297
Let's begin.

2597
01:32:19,607 --> 01:32:20,866
- I'm? - SOLO.

2598
01:32:20,867 --> 01:32:21,867
Correct.

2599
01:32:22,707 --> 01:32:24,537
- Bacte? - Gamri.

2600
01:32:24,877 --> 01:32:25,977
- Wrong! - What is "gamri?"

2601
01:32:26,177 --> 01:32:27,606
(Pokerface)

2602
01:32:27,607 --> 01:32:28,746
What is "gamri?"

2603
01:32:28,747 --> 01:32:30,016
Bactegamri?

2604
01:32:30,017 --> 01:32:31,346
- It's an idiom. - What's the answer?

2605
01:32:31,347 --> 01:32:33,017
- What is bactegamri? - Bactegamri?

2606
01:32:33,617 --> 01:32:34,747
- Bactegamri? - Is it a thing?

2607
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:37,487
I'll explain what bactegamri is.

2608
01:32:37,987 --> 01:32:39,117
It means to eradicate.

2609
01:32:39,927 --> 01:32:41,227
Eradicate, and?

2610
01:32:42,127 --> 01:32:43,397
For those who were born.

2611
01:32:43,797 --> 01:32:44,896
(Suddenly reciting poetry)

2612
01:32:44,897 --> 01:32:46,266
You must endure!

2613
01:32:46,267 --> 01:32:47,596
- You must endure? - What does "ri" stand for?

2614
01:32:47,597 --> 01:32:50,166
- Come over here. - Come over here!

2615
01:32:50,167 --> 01:32:51,636
What was the answer?

2616
01:32:51,637 --> 01:32:52,706
- Gamri is just... - Is it bacteria?

2617
01:32:52,707 --> 01:32:53,807
Of course it's bacteria.

2618
01:32:54,637 --> 01:32:56,136
- I see. - I only thought of the athlete...

2619
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:57,406
- Park Tae Hwan. - It was bacteria.

2620
01:32:57,407 --> 01:32:59,107
We don't talk about bacteria in our everyday lives.

2621
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:01,847
(You won't talk about this assorted jeon, either.)

2622
01:33:02,007 --> 01:33:04,316
It really smelled amazing.

2623
01:33:04,317 --> 01:33:06,316
Guys, there will be more.

2624
01:33:06,317 --> 01:33:07,387
There will be, right?

2625
01:33:07,517 --> 01:33:09,217
- It's coming. - Here's the next dish.

2626
01:33:09,887 --> 01:33:11,116
- It's rice cake and dumpling soup! - We have to win.

2627
01:33:11,117 --> 01:33:12,487
- I need to have it! - Rice cake and dumpling soup.

2628
01:33:12,887 --> 01:33:14,826
I love my mom's rice cake and dumpling soup.

2629
01:33:14,827 --> 01:33:16,057
(Rice cake and dumpling soup)

2630
01:33:16,327 --> 01:33:17,996
- It smells amazing! - This is my comfort food.

2631
01:33:17,997 --> 01:33:19,127
- It's my comfort food. - I'm so hungry.

2632
01:33:19,667 --> 01:33:21,767
(Hiding in the tasty white broth, )

2633
01:33:22,737 --> 01:33:25,597
(rice cakes and dumplings welcome you at the same time.)

2634
01:33:26,137 --> 01:33:28,606
(Rice cake and dumpling soup)

2635
01:33:28,607 --> 01:33:29,876
Yu Jin, it smells amazing.

2636
01:33:29,877 --> 01:33:31,607
I love my mom's rice cake and dumpling soup.

2637
01:33:31,907 --> 01:33:34,206
Excuse me, Yu Jin. Is there something wrong?

2638
01:33:34,207 --> 01:33:36,877
I don't have the strength to argue anymore.

2639
01:33:37,347 --> 01:33:38,877
(Low battery)

2640
01:33:39,147 --> 01:33:41,717
I feel like my energy is draining away.

2641
01:33:42,047 --> 01:33:43,286
We'll fill it up again with dumplings.

2642
01:33:43,287 --> 01:33:44,416
- Yes, dumplings. - I'm so hungry.

2643
01:33:44,417 --> 01:33:45,816
Just say whatever you can think of that makes sense!

2644
01:33:45,817 --> 01:33:47,057
- No, but then... - Let's begin.

2645
01:33:47,087 --> 01:33:48,826
- Eun Ji, are you going first? - Yes.

2646
01:33:48,827 --> 01:33:50,826
- Good. - Okay.

2647
01:33:50,827 --> 01:33:53,097
(Round 3, rice cake and dumpling soup)

2648
01:33:54,967 --> 01:33:56,437
- "Youngji?" - I love you.

2649
01:33:56,997 --> 01:33:58,566
- Wrong! - Why not? I love her.

2650
01:33:58,567 --> 01:33:59,567
I approve of this.

2651
01:33:59,568 --> 01:34:00,606
(Kwak Cheol Yong approves of this.)

2652
01:34:00,607 --> 01:34:02,237
- I approve! It's correct! - Couples love each other!

2653
01:34:02,607 --> 01:34:03,936
- What's the answer? - What's after "youngji?"

2654
01:34:03,937 --> 01:34:05,607
It's youngji mushrooms which means lingzhi mushrooms.

2655
01:34:06,447 --> 01:34:08,506
She said she loves Young Ji.

2656
01:34:08,507 --> 01:34:09,546
Lingzhi mushrooms are...

2657
01:34:09,547 --> 01:34:11,216
Producer Na, you don't love Young Ji?

2658
01:34:11,217 --> 01:34:12,246
I do.

2659
01:34:12,247 --> 01:34:14,286
It's because we talked about this in the car.

2660
01:34:14,287 --> 01:34:15,816
- That's right! - In the car,

2661
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:17,986
we talked about how much we loved each other.

2662
01:34:17,987 --> 01:34:19,927
- I was still in that space. - What's...

2663
01:34:20,057 --> 01:34:22,526
What's after "youngji?"

2664
01:34:22,527 --> 01:34:23,697
What do you think it is?

2665
01:34:24,197 --> 01:34:25,396
Young Ji auntie.

2666
01:34:25,397 --> 01:34:27,627
(Rice cake and dumpling soup is out.)

2667
01:34:27,997 --> 01:34:29,966
- It's japchae. - Yes, japchae!

2668
01:34:29,967 --> 01:34:31,136
Japchae, nice!

2669
01:34:31,137 --> 01:34:32,137
Japchae is nice.

2670
01:34:32,138 --> 01:34:33,737
(The fourth dish is japchae.)

2671
01:34:34,167 --> 01:34:35,967
(Chewy noodles mixed with meat and vegetables)

2672
01:34:36,707 --> 01:34:39,107
(It's the perfect balance of sweet and savory with textures.)

2673
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:42,107
(Japchae)

2674
01:34:42,747 --> 01:34:43,877
Should I go first?

2675
01:34:44,117 --> 01:34:45,546
- Do you want to go first? - Go for it, Mimi.

2676
01:34:45,547 --> 01:34:46,746
- Right, we never made it over here. - Mimi is stepping up!

2677
01:34:46,747 --> 01:34:47,946
I'm smart these days.

2678
01:34:47,947 --> 01:34:48,986
- Yes, you are. - I see.

2679
01:34:48,987 --> 01:34:50,156
- I've been doing great. - You're so confident.

2680
01:34:50,157 --> 01:34:52,357
- That's great, Mimi. - She's the Lisbon brainy girl.

2681
01:34:53,227 --> 01:34:54,927
(Mimi got smarter after arriving in Lisbon.)

2682
01:34:55,227 --> 01:34:56,656
- Mimi's never answered... - Good luck!

2683
01:34:56,657 --> 01:34:58,357
- Right? - Yes, neither have I.

2684
01:34:58,627 --> 01:34:59,866
(Round 4, japchae)

2685
01:34:59,867 --> 01:35:01,226
Good luck. Kim Mi Hyun is the best.

2686
01:35:01,227 --> 01:35:03,237
- I think I can get it. - Let's begin.

2687
01:35:04,037 --> 01:35:05,436
- ChatG? - PT!

2688
01:35:05,437 --> 01:35:06,507
Correct!

2689
01:35:08,007 --> 01:35:09,236
- Wine in? - Truth out.

2690
01:35:09,237 --> 01:35:10,276
Correct!

2691
01:35:10,277 --> 01:35:11,637
- Conserve, share? - Exchange, reuse.

2692
01:35:11,837 --> 01:35:12,877
Correct!

2693
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:14,807
- Electronic? - Device.

2694
01:35:15,147 --> 01:35:16,147
- Wow! - Correct!

2695
01:35:16,777 --> 01:35:18,447
(They passed the halfway point for the first time.)

2696
01:35:18,747 --> 01:35:20,217
- Paja? - Mas!

2697
01:35:21,047 --> 01:35:22,517
- That's correct! - She's right!

2698
01:35:22,787 --> 01:35:24,717
She's right! Yes!

2699
01:35:25,187 --> 01:35:27,486
- Sobo? - Sobogoro...

2700
01:35:27,487 --> 01:35:29,357
- Wrong! - Seriously...

2701
01:35:29,957 --> 01:35:31,497
Sobogoro...

2702
01:35:32,357 --> 01:35:34,067
(The words just rolled out of her mouth.)

2703
01:35:34,527 --> 01:35:36,567
- Sobogo? Oh, Sobo... - Sobogo?

2704
01:35:37,237 --> 01:35:38,697
- What's the answer? - I'm so sorry.

2705
01:35:38,997 --> 01:35:40,507
What's the answer?

2706
01:35:40,637 --> 01:35:42,206
- Soboro bun. - What?

2707
01:35:42,207 --> 01:35:43,277
I'm so sorry.

2708
01:35:43,677 --> 01:35:45,476
- You remembered soboro. - Right!

2709
01:35:45,477 --> 01:35:46,947
- "Soboro..." - You did well.

2710
01:35:47,247 --> 01:35:48,776
- Take it away! - We did pretty well this time.

2711
01:35:48,777 --> 01:35:50,016
We really did.

2712
01:35:50,017 --> 01:35:51,176
- Sobo... - You were really close.

2713
01:35:51,177 --> 01:35:52,747
I know. I'm really sorry.

2714
01:35:52,847 --> 01:35:55,246
(Japchae is out.)

2715
01:35:55,247 --> 01:35:56,316
Mimi, you did well.

2716
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:57,616
- I really did, right? - You're the best, Mimi.

2717
01:35:57,617 --> 01:35:58,916
- ChatGPT! - ChatGPT.

2718
01:35:58,917 --> 01:36:00,026
- You pronounced it right, too. - You know...

2719
01:36:00,027 --> 01:36:01,426
- Chat... - I thought of something else.

2720
01:36:01,427 --> 01:36:02,657
(High hopes for the brainy girl today)

2721
01:36:02,957 --> 01:36:04,757
- I'm so hungry. - It's okay.

2722
01:36:05,527 --> 01:36:07,367
I'll get you the next dish.

2723
01:36:07,567 --> 01:36:09,566
- Here comes the next dish. - I need to have it.

2724
01:36:09,567 --> 01:36:11,536
- Is it kimchi stew? - Is it soft tofu stew?

2725
01:36:11,537 --> 01:36:12,566
- Kimchi stew? - Soft tofu stew?

2726
01:36:12,567 --> 01:36:13,637
- It's soft tofu stew. - Yes!

2727
01:36:14,007 --> 01:36:15,207
- Wait, it's not. - It's kimchi stew.

2728
01:36:16,037 --> 01:36:19,577
(With the kimchi they made here in Lisbon, )

2729
01:36:20,347 --> 01:36:22,577
(it has the spicy taste of Korea.)

2730
01:36:23,417 --> 01:36:26,117
(Kimchi stew)

2731
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:27,787
It smells amazing!

2732
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:32,957
- I'm so hungry. - It smells great!

2733
01:36:33,057 --> 01:36:34,226
I think that's enough.

2734
01:36:34,227 --> 01:36:36,157
- It's authentic. - Were you trying to go inside?

2735
01:36:36,697 --> 01:36:38,127
I want to bathe in this stew.

2736
01:36:38,727 --> 01:36:40,726
- Me too. - That's amazing.

2737
01:36:40,727 --> 01:36:42,166
Should we dive?

2738
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:43,497
- Dive! - Dive?

2739
01:36:43,667 --> 01:36:45,297
(You got it.)

2740
01:36:45,797 --> 01:36:46,966
- Dive! - Is this "Hold your breath,"

2741
01:36:46,967 --> 01:36:48,166
"Kimchi stew dive?"

2742
01:36:48,167 --> 01:36:49,777
I really can do it, you know.

2743
01:36:49,977 --> 01:36:51,976
Producer Na, it's still hot. Let's do it now.

2744
01:36:51,977 --> 01:36:54,107
Should someone take a bite first?

2745
01:36:54,707 --> 01:36:56,877
- Yes, please! - Can we try the tofu too?

2746
01:36:57,177 --> 01:36:59,016
Then let's play...

2747
01:36:59,017 --> 01:37:01,247
The Timing Game.

2748
01:37:01,387 --> 01:37:02,416
You shouldn't...

2749
01:37:02,417 --> 01:37:03,586
- say it so loudly. - We can hear you.

2750
01:37:03,587 --> 01:37:04,786
- Woo Jung. - The Timing Game?

2751
01:37:04,787 --> 01:37:05,956
We heard you loud and clear.

2752
01:37:05,957 --> 01:37:07,256
You guys should come up with a signal.

2753
01:37:07,257 --> 01:37:09,086
You play the Timing Game, but the rule is...

2754
01:37:09,087 --> 01:37:10,396
everyone has a bite except for those who lose.

2755
01:37:10,397 --> 01:37:11,397
- Only one person can't eat? - No, there could be more.

2756
01:37:11,398 --> 01:37:12,926
- Someone should start them off. - Okay.

2757
01:37:12,927 --> 01:37:14,496
Tell us when to start.

2758
01:37:14,497 --> 01:37:15,767
- Begin. Two! - One!

2759
01:37:16,367 --> 01:37:17,637
- What? - What are you doing?

2760
01:37:17,697 --> 01:37:18,937
- Begin. Two! - One!

2761
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:20,836
(That was untimely.)

2762
01:37:20,837 --> 01:37:22,207
- Why are you joining them? - What?

2763
01:37:22,367 --> 01:37:24,407
You're not one of the members, Yeong Seok!

2764
01:37:24,677 --> 01:37:26,677
(One of the real members is loving this.)

2765
01:37:26,847 --> 01:37:27,877
Producer Na!

2766
01:37:29,477 --> 01:37:31,447
What on earth are you doing?

2767
01:37:31,547 --> 01:37:32,986
- I was just... - What were you doing?

2768
01:37:32,987 --> 01:37:34,887
Do you want to play with us?

2769
01:37:36,187 --> 01:37:38,156
I think he wants to play with us.

2770
01:37:38,157 --> 01:37:39,626
- I was confused. - He feels left out.

2771
01:37:39,627 --> 01:37:41,957
(He got the rules confused with another game.)

2772
01:37:42,127 --> 01:37:44,327
Are you all ready?

2773
01:37:44,497 --> 01:37:45,497
Begin!

2774
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:47,067
- One! - One!

2775
01:37:47,427 --> 01:37:48,896
- You guys failed. - Nice.

2776
01:37:48,897 --> 01:37:49,897
(Eun Ji and Yu Jin are out.)

2777
01:37:49,898 --> 01:37:51,437
- We can eat, Young Ji. - Nice.

2778
01:37:51,637 --> 01:37:53,107
- Thank you for the food! - Thank you.

2779
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:54,467
I'm so jealous.

2780
01:37:55,307 --> 01:37:57,207
(A big spoonful)

2781
01:38:04,677 --> 01:38:05,917
It looks so good.

2782
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:09,117
(A standing ovation)

2783
01:38:09,417 --> 01:38:11,087
(Savoring)

2784
01:38:11,717 --> 01:38:14,027
(It's been a while since they had spicy stew.)

2785
01:38:14,257 --> 01:38:15,487
Thank you!

2786
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,227
You're the best!

2787
01:38:17,897 --> 01:38:19,056
It's like you made it in Korea.

2788
01:38:19,057 --> 01:38:20,367
(Thank you.)

2789
01:38:20,767 --> 01:38:23,396
- It looks so good! - It's amazing.

2790
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:25,736
It smells like sour kimchi. Is it?

2791
01:38:25,737 --> 01:38:27,707
It is sour kimchi. It's perfect.

2792
01:38:27,907 --> 01:38:29,237
- It's delicious. - It's so good.

2793
01:38:29,537 --> 01:38:31,177
(Licking off the spoon)

2794
01:38:31,677 --> 01:38:33,807
I literally want to lick the bowl clean. It's so good.

2795
01:38:34,447 --> 01:38:35,506
Should we start here?

2796
01:38:35,507 --> 01:38:36,516
- Yes, let's start with Mimi. - Okay.

2797
01:38:36,517 --> 01:38:37,716
- That sounds good. - We're starting here?

2798
01:38:37,717 --> 01:38:38,776
- Yes. - Okay.

2799
01:38:38,777 --> 01:38:39,916
- Good luck. - Mimi's doing great.

2800
01:38:39,917 --> 01:38:41,347
- She's good. - Mimi's even starting it off.

2801
01:38:41,947 --> 01:38:43,287
We'll begin. Are you all ready?

2802
01:38:43,617 --> 01:38:44,687
Let's go.

2803
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:47,357
- Bullet? - Shower.

2804
01:38:48,127 --> 01:38:49,727
- What? - She's right!

2805
01:38:49,957 --> 01:38:51,697
(Freezing)

2806
01:38:51,797 --> 01:38:54,227
She's right! Getting showered with bullets!

2807
01:38:54,597 --> 01:38:56,667
(Trying to convey the meaning with body language)

2808
01:38:56,797 --> 01:38:58,796
- Bang! - That totally makes sense!

2809
01:38:58,797 --> 01:39:00,306
It's on brand with the spy thing.

2810
01:39:00,307 --> 01:39:01,637
- Whoosh! - It can happen in games.

2811
01:39:02,007 --> 01:39:03,877
- Like in "Sudden Attack." - Right.

2812
01:39:04,107 --> 01:39:06,007
- Okay, I'll say it's correct. - Thank you.

2813
01:39:08,177 --> 01:39:09,916
- Star? - Fish.

2814
01:39:09,917 --> 01:39:10,977
Correct.

2815
01:39:12,147 --> 01:39:13,416
- Fau? - Cet.

2816
01:39:13,417 --> 01:39:14,417
Correct.

2817
01:39:14,418 --> 01:39:15,816
- Weather? - Forecast.

2818
01:39:15,817 --> 01:39:16,887
- Gosh! - Correct!

2819
01:39:17,417 --> 01:39:19,287
(They passed the halfway point again.)

2820
01:39:19,657 --> 01:39:21,086
- Snack? - Cart.

2821
01:39:21,087 --> 01:39:22,157
Correct!

2822
01:39:22,327 --> 01:39:24,526
- Maca? - When you go to Macao...

2823
01:39:24,527 --> 01:39:25,527
- Wrong! - No!

2824
01:39:25,657 --> 01:39:27,567
- What's the answer? - Macao? Really?

2825
01:39:27,827 --> 01:39:29,767
- When you go to Macao? - Young Ji, come on.

2826
01:39:29,837 --> 01:39:30,996
- What's the answer? - Macaroni!

2827
01:39:30,997 --> 01:39:32,466
- "Macarena" or macaroni. - Right!

2828
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:33,736
"Macarena!"

2829
01:39:33,737 --> 01:39:35,607
(Lost for words)

2830
01:39:35,707 --> 01:39:37,107
I'm really sorry, guys.

2831
01:39:38,377 --> 01:39:39,677
- It's okay. - That was close.

2832
01:39:39,707 --> 01:39:41,146
You had a bite, Young Ji.

2833
01:39:41,147 --> 01:39:42,277
- So it's okay. - I'm really sorry.

2834
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:44,276
You didn't try hard because you already had a bite.

2835
01:39:44,277 --> 01:39:46,787
- We blew it because of that bite. - No, that's not it.

2836
01:39:47,447 --> 01:39:49,346
Young Ji, but I am seriously hungry.

2837
01:39:49,347 --> 01:39:50,817
Guys, I'm so sorry.

2838
01:39:51,117 --> 01:39:53,256
Yu Jin is about to explode, guys.

2839
01:39:53,257 --> 01:39:54,526
I'm so hungry right now.

2840
01:39:54,527 --> 01:39:56,657
Bring out the food! Bring the next dish!

2841
01:39:56,927 --> 01:39:58,196
I desperately need food.

2842
01:39:58,197 --> 01:39:59,357
- Is it bibimbap? - Goodness.

2843
01:39:59,997 --> 01:40:01,566
- It's bibimbap. This is amazing. - Wow!

2844
01:40:01,567 --> 01:40:03,266
- Yu Jin, I'll get you this dish. - It's in a stone pot!

2845
01:40:03,267 --> 01:40:06,436
- Thank you. Let's pop that yolk. - Yu Jin, I'll help you eat this.

2846
01:40:06,437 --> 01:40:08,336
- It's stone pot bibimbap. - It's really hot.

2847
01:40:08,337 --> 01:40:09,337
- Get us this dish, Young Ji. - It's bibimbap.

2848
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:13,007
(The aroma of sesame oil spreads as the rice gets cooked.)

2849
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:15,477
(Topped with an egg for rich flavor)

2850
01:40:16,007 --> 01:40:18,617
(Stone pot bibimbap)

2851
01:40:18,717 --> 01:40:20,386
- We'll start with Mimi. - I'll do better this time.

2852
01:40:20,387 --> 01:40:21,646
- I'm so sorry. - Young Ji.

2853
01:40:21,647 --> 01:40:23,586
Don't be nervous. You don't do well under pressure.

2854
01:40:23,587 --> 01:40:24,616
I like that mindset.

2855
01:40:24,617 --> 01:40:26,056
- I don't need to have it. - Let's begin.

2856
01:40:26,057 --> 01:40:27,457
- Really? - I'll eat when I get back to Korea.

2857
01:40:28,827 --> 01:40:29,997
There's no pressure.

2858
01:40:30,997 --> 01:40:33,226
- Thanks, I guess. - Let's start with Mimi.

2859
01:40:33,227 --> 01:40:34,267
(Round 6, stone pot bibimbap)

2860
01:40:35,867 --> 01:40:37,966
- Mani? - Ac...

2861
01:40:37,967 --> 01:40:38,967
Wrong!

2862
01:40:39,937 --> 01:40:41,737
(The brainy girl suddenly disappeared.)

2863
01:40:42,007 --> 01:40:43,777
I only thought of maniac, too.

2864
01:40:44,537 --> 01:40:46,607
(Why did I say that?)

2865
01:40:46,777 --> 01:40:49,147
This must be a real maniac. She even screamed at the end.

2866
01:40:49,977 --> 01:40:51,416
(She can't help but glare.)

2867
01:40:51,417 --> 01:40:54,287
(Controlling her expression)

2868
01:40:54,587 --> 01:40:55,646
What's the answer?

2869
01:40:55,647 --> 01:40:57,216
- Maniac! - Maybe manic fans?

2870
01:40:57,217 --> 01:40:58,686
- Manicure! - Manicure.

2871
01:40:58,687 --> 01:41:01,027
- Right, manicure. - Manic fans.

2872
01:41:01,287 --> 01:41:02,927
There are so many "mani" s.

2873
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:05,056
Yu Jin is switching from...

2874
01:41:05,057 --> 01:41:07,166
being angry to being a professional idol.

2875
01:41:07,167 --> 01:41:08,226
And she's back to being angry.

2876
01:41:08,227 --> 01:41:10,066
- She's Jekyll and Hyde right now. - Jekyll and Hyde.

2877
01:41:10,067 --> 01:41:11,067
Just look at her!

2878
01:41:11,068 --> 01:41:12,466
No, I'm so sorry!

2879
01:41:12,467 --> 01:41:13,537
Let's bring the food out.

2880
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:15,737
(Stone pot bibimbap is out.)

2881
01:41:16,407 --> 01:41:18,406
- Could you bring the next food? - It's fine.

2882
01:41:18,407 --> 01:41:19,736
- It's totally fine. - That looks good.

2883
01:41:19,737 --> 01:41:20,906
- It's really fine. - Gosh.

2884
01:41:20,907 --> 01:41:21,947
(Here comes the next dish.)

2885
01:41:22,277 --> 01:41:24,247
Is this stir-fried chicken?

2886
01:41:24,717 --> 01:41:26,416
- Maybe it's tteokbokki. - It looks like kimpitang.

2887
01:41:26,417 --> 01:41:28,186
- What is this? - We should have a bite.

2888
01:41:28,187 --> 01:41:29,886
It's spicy stir-fried chicken and cheese.

2889
01:41:29,887 --> 01:41:32,057
- There is no way this is bad! - Could we have it, please?

2890
01:41:32,987 --> 01:41:35,687
(A thick layer of cheese)

2891
01:41:36,627 --> 01:41:39,657
(Along with spicy and sweet chicken)

2892
01:41:40,027 --> 01:41:42,667
(Spicy stir-fried chicken and cheese)

2893
01:41:43,067 --> 01:41:44,896
- Just one bite! - Could we try it?

2894
01:41:44,897 --> 01:41:46,937
(Just looking at it energized her.)

2895
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:48,437
Should we play the Timing Game again?

2896
01:41:48,707 --> 01:41:49,806
- Wait. - Okay.

2897
01:41:49,807 --> 01:41:51,076
- Guys, let's sit. - Let's start the Timing Game.

2898
01:41:51,077 --> 01:41:52,677
Begin!

2899
01:41:52,777 --> 01:41:53,777
One.

2900
01:41:54,047 --> 01:41:55,676
You have to stand up, too. We need to be sure.

2901
01:41:55,677 --> 01:41:56,677
- One! - Oh!

2902
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:58,677
But didn't you just... Two!

2903
01:41:59,317 --> 01:42:00,317
Three.

2904
01:42:02,647 --> 01:42:03,657
Three.

2905
01:42:04,587 --> 01:42:07,557
(Smiling)

2906
01:42:07,757 --> 01:42:10,497
Everyone except Yu Jin can take a bite.

2907
01:42:10,957 --> 01:42:12,996
- Thank you for the food! - Thank you!

2908
01:42:12,997 --> 01:42:14,566
- Thank you! - Gosh!

2909
01:42:14,567 --> 01:42:15,967
(Yu Jin didn't get to try a bite again.)

2910
01:42:16,397 --> 01:42:19,197
(Yu Jin was the one to find where Cheol Yong was hiding today.)

2911
01:42:19,367 --> 01:42:20,667
(Commerce Square)

2912
01:42:21,167 --> 01:42:24,077
(She also found out where the Riddle Master was.)

2913
01:42:24,177 --> 01:42:26,307
(Cappuccino)

2914
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:28,547
(She answered correctly on quizzes.)

2915
01:42:28,907 --> 01:42:30,747
(That's him, right?)

2916
01:42:31,317 --> 01:42:35,347
(She also ran first to catch Torong, )

2917
01:42:35,647 --> 01:42:38,187
(and succeeded in catching him.)

2918
01:42:38,657 --> 01:42:41,227
(So she's really hungry right now from working hard all day.)

2919
01:42:42,087 --> 01:42:44,197
(But the chicken isn't hers to try.)

2920
01:42:44,757 --> 01:42:47,227
(She stares bitterly at the members...)

2921
01:42:47,297 --> 01:42:48,466
(until she remembers she's an idol.)

2922
01:42:48,467 --> 01:42:50,437
Eun Ji, cheers!

2923
01:42:51,067 --> 01:42:52,936
- Yes! - Cheers!

2924
01:42:52,937 --> 01:42:54,107
Toruk Makto.

2925
01:42:56,807 --> 01:42:59,977
(2nd standing ovation)

2926
01:43:02,407 --> 01:43:03,747
(I love you, Chef!)

2927
01:43:04,377 --> 01:43:05,417
My gosh.

2928
01:43:06,717 --> 01:43:08,817
- It's new. - I get it. It's delicious.

2929
01:43:09,957 --> 01:43:11,386
Of course it's delicious.

2930
01:43:11,387 --> 01:43:13,016
It's hot and spicy at the same time.

2931
01:43:13,017 --> 01:43:14,486
The cheese is salty and gooey.

2932
01:43:14,487 --> 01:43:15,687
- We all get it. - Correct!

2933
01:43:15,927 --> 01:43:17,697
I can tell just by looking at it.

2934
01:43:18,057 --> 01:43:20,067
Yu Jin is so cute.

2935
01:43:20,767 --> 01:43:23,836
- It looks so good. - Is this dark meat? It's so soft.

2936
01:43:23,837 --> 01:43:26,807
- Gosh. - Eun Ji, I want it so bad.

2937
01:43:27,237 --> 01:43:28,737
It's fantastic!

2938
01:43:29,637 --> 01:43:32,307
I really hope you guys win this round.

2939
01:43:32,407 --> 01:43:34,676
- We should really win. - Let's help Yu Jin eat this, too!

2940
01:43:34,677 --> 01:43:36,147
- Good luck, guys! - Let's begin.

2941
01:43:36,347 --> 01:43:37,616
- Are you ready? - We can do this.

2942
01:43:37,617 --> 01:43:38,717
We're starting with Mimi.

2943
01:43:40,117 --> 01:43:41,346
- Mud? - Fish.

2944
01:43:41,347 --> 01:43:42,347
Correct.

2945
01:43:42,348 --> 01:43:43,656
- Video call? - Fan signing.

2946
01:43:43,657 --> 01:43:44,757
- Correct! - Gosh!

2947
01:43:45,087 --> 01:43:46,556
- Oran? - Gutan.

2948
01:43:46,557 --> 01:43:47,657
Correct.

2949
01:43:47,827 --> 01:43:49,226
- No? - Comment.

2950
01:43:49,227 --> 01:43:50,227
Correct.

2951
01:43:50,257 --> 01:43:52,557
(They reached the halfway point easily.)

2952
01:43:53,297 --> 01:43:55,026
- Shocking? - Transformation!

2953
01:43:55,027 --> 01:43:56,267
- Correct! - Good job.

2954
01:43:57,367 --> 01:43:59,067
- Jambon? - Beurre.

2955
01:43:59,137 --> 01:44:00,337
- Correct! - Young Ji!

2956
01:44:00,807 --> 01:44:02,107
- Mimi! - Likes, comments?

2957
01:44:05,737 --> 01:44:06,776
Wrong!

2958
01:44:06,777 --> 01:44:09,277
(Please leave nice comments.)

2959
01:44:10,177 --> 01:44:13,317
(That's my Mimi.)

2960
01:44:14,247 --> 01:44:17,617
(You don't know what you've got until you've lost it.)

2961
01:44:19,817 --> 01:44:22,627
(I love you, Mimi.)

2962
01:44:22,827 --> 01:44:24,556
What is it supposed to be?

2963
01:44:24,557 --> 01:44:25,996
- Likes, comments... - It's likes, comments...

2964
01:44:25,997 --> 01:44:27,197
- subscriptions, and notifications. - Subscriptions, notifications.

2965
01:44:27,797 --> 01:44:30,367
(Please like, subscribe, and turn notifications on!)

2966
01:44:31,597 --> 01:44:33,466
(All members have said this at least once.)

2967
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:37,137
(Like, subscribe, turn notifications on)

2968
01:44:37,237 --> 01:44:39,337
(Like, subscribe, turn notifications on)

2969
01:44:40,277 --> 01:44:43,277
(You should know this, Mimi.)

2970
01:44:43,577 --> 01:44:44,646
I feel so refreshed.

2971
01:44:44,647 --> 01:44:45,647
(For some reason, Eun Ji feels better.)

2972
01:44:45,648 --> 01:44:47,516
- Mimi really spoke our minds. - Goodness.

2973
01:44:47,517 --> 01:44:49,116
- Mimi. - My goodness.

2974
01:44:49,117 --> 01:44:50,617
You spoke on behalf of all E-caders.

2975
01:44:50,757 --> 01:44:51,817
- My Gosh. - That was amazing.

2976
01:44:52,057 --> 01:44:53,287
- You're the best. - Thank you.

2977
01:44:53,427 --> 01:44:54,927
That was legendary.

2978
01:44:55,557 --> 01:44:58,226
- Confident Mimi. - That was amazing.

2979
01:44:58,227 --> 01:44:59,526
I'm so jealous.

2980
01:44:59,527 --> 01:45:01,466
- How can you not be? - I'm jealous, too. She's so funny.

2981
01:45:01,467 --> 01:45:03,566
We can't have the food, and you just cursed...

2982
01:45:03,567 --> 01:45:05,597
(Spicy stir-fried chicken and cheese is out.)

2983
01:45:06,067 --> 01:45:08,067
- Mimi, you were hilarious. - We asked you for just one dish.

2984
01:45:08,107 --> 01:45:09,167
- It was incredible. - Well...

2985
01:45:09,507 --> 01:45:10,507
What's that?

2986
01:45:11,377 --> 01:45:12,636
This is amazing.

2987
01:45:12,637 --> 01:45:13,776
- It looks great. - It's Yu Jin's favorite, right?

2988
01:45:13,777 --> 01:45:15,207
- It's Yu Jin's comfort food. - This round is for Yu Jin!

2989
01:45:15,447 --> 01:45:17,476
- It's Yu Jin's comfort food. - It's pork ribs,

2990
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:19,646
- but with braised galbi sauce. - Right.

2991
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:21,617
It's going to be so sweet and tasty.

2992
01:45:22,487 --> 01:45:25,357
(Marinated pork with sweet sauce)

2993
01:45:26,787 --> 01:45:29,687
(Let's get a closer look at the delicious food.)

2994
01:45:30,357 --> 01:45:33,097
(Galbijjim)

2995
01:45:33,227 --> 01:45:34,666
Since galbijjim is...

2996
01:45:34,667 --> 01:45:36,196
our youngest, Yu Jin's favorite...

2997
01:45:36,197 --> 01:45:37,536
as well as her comfort food,

2998
01:45:37,537 --> 01:45:39,137
I really hope you guys get it.

2999
01:45:39,197 --> 01:45:41,836
- Should we change our seats? - Should we?

3000
01:45:41,837 --> 01:45:42,936
- It'll be a fresh start. - That's a good idea.

3001
01:45:42,937 --> 01:45:44,306
- Let's start moving. - Where should I go?

3002
01:45:44,307 --> 01:45:45,507
- I'll go last. - Okay.

3003
01:45:45,837 --> 01:45:48,407
(Mimi and Eun Ji sit in the middle.)

3004
01:45:48,647 --> 01:45:50,217
- Should I begin? - Sounds good.

3005
01:45:50,277 --> 01:45:51,277
We'll start with Young Ji.

3006
01:45:51,278 --> 01:45:52,817
- Young Ji's feeling good. - Okay.

3007
01:45:53,687 --> 01:45:54,717
Let's begin.

3008
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:58,517
- Cos? - Mos.

3009
01:45:58,617 --> 01:45:59,687
Correct.

3010
01:45:59,817 --> 01:46:01,527
- Student? - Status.

3011
01:46:02,487 --> 01:46:04,797
- Since we're spies. - Okay, correct.

3012
01:46:06,027 --> 01:46:07,596
- Birch? - Tree.

3013
01:46:07,597 --> 01:46:08,626
- Correct! - Wow!

3014
01:46:08,627 --> 01:46:10,437
(She turned into a pufferfish.)

3015
01:46:11,437 --> 01:46:12,896
- Ballet? - Dancer.

3016
01:46:12,897 --> 01:46:14,007
Correct.

3017
01:46:14,867 --> 01:46:16,736
- Gra? - Gra... It's me?

3018
01:46:16,737 --> 01:46:17,737
- Wrong! - No!

3019
01:46:18,807 --> 01:46:20,676
It's granola. We had it for breakfast.

3020
01:46:20,677 --> 01:46:22,247
- I didn't have it. - Granola.

3021
01:46:22,677 --> 01:46:23,677
(I should've had it.)

3022
01:46:23,678 --> 01:46:24,917
- I didn't have it. - You didn't have it.

3023
01:46:25,177 --> 01:46:27,846
- So it was granola. - "It's me." Oh, no.

3024
01:46:27,847 --> 01:46:29,216
Eun Ji, don't look to your left.

3025
01:46:29,217 --> 01:46:31,017
Someone must be on my left.

3026
01:46:32,217 --> 01:46:34,286
- This is driving me crazy. - This is driving me crazy.

3027
01:46:34,287 --> 01:46:36,797
(Yu Jin's favorite dish, galbijjim is out.)

3028
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:42,027
She took off her jacket since it was too hot.

3029
01:46:42,427 --> 01:46:43,696
Her arms are red.

3030
01:46:43,697 --> 01:46:45,267
- She's angry. - Yu Jin.

3031
01:46:45,367 --> 01:46:46,367
Let's go.

3032
01:46:47,607 --> 01:46:49,066
It's jjajangmyeon. Yu Jin,

3033
01:46:49,067 --> 01:46:50,436
- let's eat jjajangmyeon. - It's jjajangmyeon.

3034
01:46:50,437 --> 01:46:52,307
It's a good dish. It looks so tasty.

3035
01:46:53,037 --> 01:46:55,877
(It's hard to believe that it was made in Lisbon.)

3036
01:46:56,917 --> 01:47:00,147
(The combination of chewy noodles and sweet and salty sauce)

3037
01:47:00,717 --> 01:47:03,486
(Jjajangmyeon)

3038
01:47:03,487 --> 01:47:05,156
- Jjajangmyeon is the last dish. - It's the last dish.

3039
01:47:05,157 --> 01:47:06,187
Is it the last dish?

3040
01:47:07,127 --> 01:47:08,887
- Is it the last dish? - We haven't eaten anything.

3041
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:11,427
(They haven't eaten anything, but they're on the last dish.)

3042
01:47:11,627 --> 01:47:12,796
Shall I go first?

3043
01:47:12,797 --> 01:47:14,627
- Yes, Young Ji. - Young Ji, go first.

3044
01:47:15,327 --> 01:47:16,696
- Let's begin. - Make a round trip.

3045
01:47:16,697 --> 01:47:17,967
- A round trip. - Yes. Let's begin.

3046
01:47:20,607 --> 01:47:21,966
Mala?

3047
01:47:21,967 --> 01:47:23,737
- Soup. - Wrong.

3048
01:47:24,277 --> 01:47:25,377
(Chuckling)

3049
01:47:25,507 --> 01:47:27,747
It's "Xiang guo."

3050
01:47:27,847 --> 01:47:29,507
- We don't need to eat. - Xiang guo.

3051
01:47:30,377 --> 01:47:31,646
- Xiang guo. - It isn't our day to eat.

3052
01:47:31,647 --> 01:47:33,487
- I can't believe it. - Xiang guo.

3053
01:47:33,847 --> 01:47:35,647
- It's "Xiang guo." - Stop.

3054
01:47:36,717 --> 01:47:39,557
- What do you eat every day? - Mala xiang guo.

3055
01:47:39,657 --> 01:47:41,626
- She did the challenge earlier. - So why did you fail?

3056
01:47:41,627 --> 01:47:42,986
Earlier, Producer Hyun Yong and I talked about...

3057
01:47:42,987 --> 01:47:44,226
- the Mala Tanghulu Challenge. - We talked about...

3058
01:47:44,227 --> 01:47:46,096
the Mala Tanghulu Challenge...

3059
01:47:46,097 --> 01:47:47,097
on our way here.

3060
01:47:47,367 --> 01:47:48,397
The Mala Tanghulu Challenge.

3061
01:47:48,967 --> 01:47:51,466
The Mala Tanghulu Challenge is too old.

3062
01:47:51,467 --> 01:47:52,497
What's the Mala Tanghulu Challenge?

3063
01:47:52,597 --> 01:47:54,536
- Tang, tang, hulu, hulu. - Hulu, hulu.

3064
01:47:54,537 --> 01:47:56,737
(For a penalty, she picked the Mala Tanghulu Challenge.)

3065
01:47:56,937 --> 01:47:58,006
Mala?

3066
01:47:58,007 --> 01:47:59,076
- Soup. - Wrong.

3067
01:47:59,077 --> 01:48:00,907
(She closed the door for the Mala Tanghulu Challenge.)

3068
01:48:01,007 --> 01:48:02,747
Mala soup. I'm so sorry.

3069
01:48:03,947 --> 01:48:05,876
- You were focused on "Tang." - I'm sorry.

3070
01:48:05,877 --> 01:48:06,887
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

3071
01:48:07,247 --> 01:48:09,016
This is hard.

3072
01:48:09,017 --> 01:48:10,957
- We haven't eaten at all, right? - Yes.

3073
01:48:11,257 --> 01:48:13,727
- This never happens. - This never happens.

3074
01:48:13,827 --> 01:48:15,086
- We haven't eaten at all. - At a Korean restaurant too.

3075
01:48:15,087 --> 01:48:16,827
- At a Korean restaurant too. - We haven't eaten at all.

3076
01:48:17,057 --> 01:48:19,257
(They looked forward to the Korean restaurant.)

3077
01:48:20,427 --> 01:48:26,067
(Due to the parade of incorrect answers)

3078
01:48:26,467 --> 01:48:28,907
(Wrong!)

3079
01:48:29,537 --> 01:48:32,937
(The Wrong Boy had to work especially hard.)

3080
01:48:33,037 --> 01:48:34,647
(In the end)

3081
01:48:35,447 --> 01:48:37,616
(Out of 9 Korean dishes, )

3082
01:48:37,617 --> 01:48:40,247
(they ate 0 dishes.)

3083
01:48:40,647 --> 01:48:42,046
This is... What should we do?

3084
01:48:42,047 --> 01:48:43,756
Let's have them play a bonus round.

3085
01:48:43,757 --> 01:48:44,757
I'm so sorry.

3086
01:48:44,758 --> 01:48:47,056
Still, you need to eat something.

3087
01:48:47,057 --> 01:48:49,286
We'll give you the very last chance.

3088
01:48:49,287 --> 01:48:50,296
Thank you so much.

3089
01:48:50,297 --> 01:48:52,056
Pick a dish you want to eat the most.

3090
01:48:52,057 --> 01:48:53,496
- Kimchi stew. - Kimchi stew.

3091
01:48:53,497 --> 01:48:54,866
- Mimi, how about you? - Kimchi stew.

3092
01:48:54,867 --> 01:48:56,467
Let's have it heated up.

3093
01:48:56,627 --> 01:48:59,537
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3094
01:48:59,637 --> 01:49:01,967
(A bonus round for the kimchi stew)

3095
01:49:02,767 --> 01:49:04,807
I'll do well. Let's do a cheer.

3096
01:49:05,277 --> 01:49:06,277
Three, two, one.
- E-cade! - E-cade!

3097
01:49:07,278 --> 01:49:08,607
- We can do it. - Young Ji will go first.

3098
01:49:10,077 --> 01:49:11,077
It's the last round.

3099
01:49:12,047 --> 01:49:13,316
- Carou? - Sel.

3100
01:49:13,317 --> 01:49:14,317
Correct.

3101
01:49:14,817 --> 01:49:15,986
- Budae? - Jjigae.

3102
01:49:15,987 --> 01:49:16,987
Correct.

3103
01:49:18,757 --> 01:49:20,486
- Very big? - Very cute.

3104
01:49:20,487 --> 01:49:21,487
Correct.

3105
01:49:22,257 --> 01:49:23,557
- Food? - Truck.

3106
01:49:24,757 --> 01:49:25,757
Correct.

3107
01:49:26,097 --> 01:49:27,097
My heart hurts.

3108
01:49:27,797 --> 01:49:29,567
(They safely get past the halfway point.)

3109
01:49:30,367 --> 01:49:32,037
- Slow? - Aging.

3110
01:49:32,737 --> 01:49:34,466
- How did you do that? - A blood sugar spike.

3111
01:49:34,467 --> 01:49:35,467
Aging.

3112
01:49:35,737 --> 01:49:38,136
- How did you do that? - A blood sugar spike.

3113
01:49:38,137 --> 01:49:39,537
- Two more. - A blood sugar spike.

3114
01:49:40,237 --> 01:49:42,807
(We're proud of you, Yu Jin.)

3115
01:49:43,077 --> 01:49:44,247
Eun Ji, you can do it.

3116
01:49:45,547 --> 01:49:47,047
- Secret to? - Longevity.

3117
01:49:47,847 --> 01:49:49,347
Correct. The last one.

3118
01:49:49,987 --> 01:49:52,157
(It'll be their first success if Young Ji answers correctly.)

3119
01:49:52,917 --> 01:49:56,287
(Will they succeed in the mission and eat kimchi stew?)

3120
01:49:57,897 --> 01:49:59,127
- Short? - Track.

3121
01:49:59,227 --> 01:50:00,257
Correct.

3122
01:50:01,367 --> 01:50:02,727
- Short? - Track.

3123
01:50:02,997 --> 01:50:05,397
(Finally, they taste their first success.)

3124
01:50:05,567 --> 01:50:08,506
It was a clean success.

3125
01:50:08,507 --> 01:50:12,807
- We can do it! - We can do it!

3126
01:50:13,277 --> 01:50:15,046
- North and Central America are... - North and Central America are...

3127
01:50:15,047 --> 01:50:16,376
- the US, - the US,

3128
01:50:16,377 --> 01:50:17,446
- Canada, - Canada...

3129
01:50:17,447 --> 01:50:18,476
and Mexico.

3130
01:50:18,477 --> 01:50:19,776
Thank you for the food. Hurry up and eat it.

3131
01:50:19,777 --> 01:50:21,486
- It was hard. - This is incredible.

- Eat it. - Thank you for the food.

3133
01:50:23,957 --> 01:50:25,817
(The oldest member takes a big bite.)

3134
01:50:26,317 --> 01:50:29,157
(Humming in approval)

3135
01:50:29,427 --> 01:50:30,427
How does it taste?

3136
01:50:33,457 --> 01:50:35,997
(Yu Jin finally takes a bite.)

3137
01:50:36,767 --> 01:50:37,767
How does it taste?

3138
01:50:38,267 --> 01:50:40,037
- It's so tasty. - It's so tasty.

3139
01:50:42,437 --> 01:50:45,506
Where did they get such tasty kimchi?

01:50:45,507 --> 01:50:46,577
I'm so curious.

3141
01:50:48,147 --> 01:50:50,307
- We make our own kimchi. - Do you make your own kimchi here?

3142
01:50:50,817 --> 01:50:53,216
- They make it. - They make it here.

3143
01:50:53,217 --> 01:50:56,486
- I should've known. It's different. - I should've known.

3144
01:50:56,487 --> 01:50:57,956
The taste is deep...

3145
01:50:57,957 --> 01:50:59,587
because they make the kimchi and age it.

3146
01:51:00,187 --> 01:51:02,587
Kimchi stew should be made with tasty kimchi. It's so tasty.

3147
01:51:06,397 --> 01:51:07,767
The taste is very clean.

3148

3152
01:51:26,377 --> 01:51:27,817

Yu Jin, you really like kimchi stew.

3158
01:51:42,497 --> 01:51:44,796
We finished the kimchi stew. We can see the bottom.

3159
01:51:44,797 --> 01:51:45,797
- Yes. - We can see the bottom.

3160
01:51:46,097 --> 01:51:47,106

(Brother Yeong Seok seeks revenge.)

3166
01:52:01,617 --> 01:52:03,587

(If it gets 1 million views in 10 minutes, )

3168
01:52:05,857 --> 01:52:06,857

01:52:07,157 --> 01:52:09,187

3171
01:52:13,127 --> 01:52:14,967
(1 million views in 10 minutes?)

3172
01:52:15,067 --> 01:52:16,067
(I'll give you the digital flex and buy you anything you want.)

3173
01:52:16,167 --> 01:52:17,837
(However, if you fail)

3174
01:52:18,737 --> 01:52:20,237
(Silence)

3175
01:52:20,397 --> 01:52:24,237
(The return of the Mouth Detox)

3176
01:52:24,437 --> 01:52:25,437
(Gosh, I'm so nervous.)

3177
01:52:25,537 --> 01:52:28,907
(They even resort to Instagram Live.)

3178
01:52:29,007 --> 01:52:32,447
(The E-caders become desperate.)
