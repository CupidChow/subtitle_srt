1
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:38,029
(Earth Arcade 3)

2
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,329
(Previously)

3
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,328
(Guys!)

4
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:43,798
Guys!

5
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,968
(They finally showed themselves.)

6
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,468
(Cheol Yong...)

7
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,008
(and Torong)

8
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:49,409
(There he is!)

9
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:50,609
Catch him!

10
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:51,609
(Catch him!)

11
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,208
(A chase began in the middle of Lisbon.)

12
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:54,808
(Young Ji's glasses got taken away again.)

13
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,479
We need to get information from the Riddle Master.

14
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:58,978
(Featuring the Riddle Master with a serious face)

15
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,888
(Thanks to An Yu Genius with insane deductive skills, )

16
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:04,049
(they could chase after Torong smoothly.)

17
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:05,789
(They had to catch him before he stowed away!)

18
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:07,358
(The E-caders chased after Torong and Cheol Yong...)

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,629
(with passion.)

20
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:10,989
(Eun Ji caught Cheol Yong.)

21
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:13,698
(She began her last chase after Torong.)

22
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,898
(Torong Hunter didn't let him get away.)

23
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:18,199
(2 minutes before departure, Torong got apprehended.)

24
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:19,938
(For the E-caders who succeeded in capturing Torong, )

25
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:21,439
(a Korean food party was thrown.)

26
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,339
(Complete the Word)

27
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:24,578
(Young Ji?)

28
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:25,579
(I love you.)

29
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:27,108
(Sobo?)

30
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:28,909
(Gorosobororo)

31
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,079
Likes, Comments?

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,479
(The relay of wrong answers continued.)

33
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,078
(After failing 9 times in a row, )

34
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,649
(they had their first success.)

35
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,589
(They finally earned their tear-soaked meal.)

36
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,689
(After the meal of happiness)

37
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:39,958
I'm sure you heard this on your way here.

38
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,328
Today, you succeeded in catching Torong.

39
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:44,528
(The agents succeeded in catching Torong.)

40
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:46,199
Thus, Jade Emperor sent a message.

41
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,069
"Since they completed the mission successfully,"

42
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:53,768
"send them on a trip to Portugal's best vacation spot."

43
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:55,068
- We love that idea.
- Nice! Finally!

44
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:56,768
- A trip?
- A vacation spot.

45
00:01:56,769 --> 00:01:57,938
Will it be a total vacation?

46
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,838
- Tomorrow, we'll move...
- It'll be so nice.

47
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:02,509
- to Albufeira.
- Albufeira.

48
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:07,278
(Located next to the Atlantic Ocean, )

49
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:09,919
(it's a vacation spot in Portugal.)

50
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:12,518
(Eun Ji, isn't it really pretty over there?)

51
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:13,519
(It's so pretty.)

52
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:18,199
(Its charms are different from those of Lisbon.)

53
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,999
(Let's leave for Albufeira.)

54
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:25,069
(They return to the lodging.)

55
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:26,938
We'll be smiling with excitement.

56
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,069
- We'll wear full-face makeup.
- It's so nice.

57
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:31,209
(They'll leave on a vacation tomorrow.)

58
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:33,509
Are you done packing?

59
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:35,249
I'm nearly done.

60
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:37,679
(The organized spot, the unorganized spot)

61
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,179
How about you?

62
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:42,089
To be honest, I just need to close the suitcase.

63
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:45,288
Everything is inside, so I just need to close it.

64
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,589
(The older members finish packing in no time.)

65
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:49,589
(They immediately turn on the resting mode.)

66
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:51,359
(Meanwhile, the younger members)

67
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:56,669
(They practice a challenge instead of packing.)

68
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,139
One, two.

69
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:01,769
(Feeling electric)

70
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:04,109
(It feels like they're practicing for "MBC Music Festival.")

71
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:09,078
(They go on for a while even after they go outside.)

72
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:10,348
- Hey!
- My goodness.

73
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,379
It's so exhausting.

74
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,419
(Thus, this video came to be.)

75
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:14,789
(Young Ji and Yu Jin)

76
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,349
(The youngest members' Let's Groove Challenge)

77
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:18,689
(Pointing)

78
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,659
(They boogie down with perfect teamwork.)

79
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,999
(They even pull off the Dog Leg Dance in a hip way.)

80
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:28,469
(The older members come out and check the video.)

81
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:29,898
- It's so hip.
- You guys did well.

82
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:30,968
- Thank you.
- Nice.

83
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,639
(The compliments make her give a show.)

84
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,438
- Oh, hey. How far will you go down?
- Hey.

85
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,039
- Look at her.
- It's fun.

86
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,539
(The youngest member's talent show excites the older ones.)

87
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:41,379
- Let's film something for the 4.
- The 4.

88
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,309
It's cold. Please go inside.

89
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,179
(Picking the challenge they're going to film)

90
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:50,549
- What's this?
- I like it.

91
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,919
- We need to do it like this.
- Yes.

92
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:54,419
Like this.

93
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:57,828
(Looking around)

94
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,959
No.

95
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:02,099
(She shyly grooves to the Ppikki Ppiki Rhythm.)

96
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,069
(It's more touching than a three-pitch strikeout.)

97
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:05,799
(Giggling)

98
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:08,409
(I'm embarrassed.)

99
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:10,209
(Even the exit was perfect.)

100
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:13,538
We could do a really old one and surprise people.

101
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:16,109
- One plus one is...
- A cutie.

102
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:17,849
(Young Ji's solo demonstration)

103
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,648
Come on.

104
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,119
(Her girly side comes out.)

105
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:24,349
It's nice.

106
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,659
Use the makeup filter.

107
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:29,389
The head size.

108
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,999
- Stop it.
- It isn't like that.

109
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:34,459
Young Ji, isn't that the size of a newborn's head?

110
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:36,168
Hey, that's a newborn.

111
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:37,829
Young Ji, that's a newborn.

112
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,939
(It's hard to look away from these faces.)

113
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,879
(Chuckling)

114
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:59,659
(Pushing through)

115
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,169
Six plus six.

116
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,048
(A touching experience)

117
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:24,309
Eun Ji.

118
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,148
Yu Jin is good.

119
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,248
She's good.

120
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:28,518
- Yes.
- She's absorbed.

121
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,248
Mimi, are you sending someone a code?

122
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,388
Morse code.

123
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:34,729
(Morse code?)

124
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:40,558
Hold on a second.

125
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,869
I'll send it to the group chat.

126
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:43,898
(Lee Young Ji: Promise me you will watch this before going to bed.)

127
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:45,568
(Lee Young Ji: Producer Na, let's film it tomorrow.)

128
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:46,668
(Producer Na: Will I look handsome as well?)

129
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:48,839
- "Will I look handsome as well?" - "Will I look handsome as well?"

130
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:52,509
(Rolling over in laughter)

131
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:55,448
- He doesn't disappoint.
- Young Ji.

132
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,879
- Young Ji.
- I want to invite him right now.

133
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,049
- Producer Na, let's film it.
- Let's film it.

134
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:02,789
(Lee Young Ji)

135
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:04,649
(Producer Na: Film it tomorrow. Hurry up and go to bed.)

136
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,519
(An Yu Jin: I'm hungry.)

137
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:09,329
"I'm hungry."

138
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:10,659
That was strong.

139
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,558
I laughed so hard for the first time in a while.

140
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,399
(They spend the last night in Lisbon.)

141
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:21,539
(The day of departure has come.)

142
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:26,139
(The weather is clear today.)

143
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,579
(There's even a breeze.)

144
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:33,519
(It's the perfect day to hit the road.)

145
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:35,288
(Cup tteokbokki)

146
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:37,849
(Breakfast should be simple and tasty!)

147
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,589
I can't wait for cup tteokbokki. I'm so hungry.

148
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,888
(It's getting cooked.)

149
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,059
(She can't take her eyes off.)

150
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:53,669
It's so tasty that I'll eat all before anyone gets to it.

151
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:55,468
You're really good.

152
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:57,339
(She won't miss a single drop.)

153
00:06:58,509 --> 00:06:59,579
It's so tasty.

154
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:04,979
(Eating)

155
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:06,979
There's one cheese flavor left.

156
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:08,719
After finishing this...

157
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:10,189
(Shall we pour it in?)

158
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,488
- Shall we mix them?
- Let's pour in the cheese.

159
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:12,759
- It'll be tasty.
- My goodness.

160
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:14,519
What's up with you?

161
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,558
- It looks like a cheese topping.
- Let's try it.

162
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,728
(Cheese flavor and spicy flavor)

163
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,729
It looks tasty.

164
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,928
The cheese cup tteokbokki...

165
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:21,199
looks like a cheese topping.

166
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,699
How is it? Is it tasty?

167
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,499
- Is that it?
- No way.

168
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,239
I did it.

169
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,469
You did it?

170
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:31,168
You don't disappoint.

171
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:32,178
(She approves.)

172
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,209
- Mimi.
- It's incredible.

173
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:36,049
My goodness.

174
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:39,179
The more you eat it, the tastier it gets. Yes.

175
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:40,948
(We received permission from the hotel...)

176
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:42,018
(regarding the outside food.)

177
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:43,149
It was a good meal.

178
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:44,489
How is it so tasty?

179
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,518
(They have a satisfying breakfast.)

180
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,019
(After breakfast)

181
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:50,358
We were going to film Producers Hyun Yong...

182
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,858
- and Yeong Seok.
- Really?

183
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,228
Producer Hyun Yong can go first.

184
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:54,698
- After filming with it...
- You mean, "Give me the money."

185
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,298
- Yes. "Give me the money." - Yes.

186
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:57,469
- I'll call over Producer Hyun Yong.
- Right away.

187
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:00,039
Producer, let's film a challenge.

188
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:01,539
Why?

189
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:03,239
Let's do it together. It'll only take three minutes.

190
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:04,838
- Yu Jin.
- Yes?

191
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,278
- Will I look pretty?
- Yes, you're the main character...

192
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,308
who appears at the end.

193
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:08,348
- Really?
- Yes.

194
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:10,308
- We'll take turns.
- My goodness.

195
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:11,618
- Then...
- Producer Hyun Yong.

196
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:12,648
Princess Yeong Seok.

197
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:13,918
Producer Hyun Yong.

198
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,948
What are we doing?

199
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:15,949
We'll take turns.

200
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,088
- Please make sure...
- Producer Hyun Yong, come on.

201
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:18,118
That I look pretty.

202
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,589
- Of course. We'll use a filter.
- You'll look pretty.

203
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:21,829
- Come on over.
- I'll tell you how it's done.

204
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:23,628
- Come on.
- We'll take turns and go,

205
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,358
"Give me my money."

206
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,598
- Then go, "Yes!" One at a time.
- "Yes!"

207
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,228
- "Give me my money." - Go, "Yes!"

208
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,599
(He doesn't understand.)

209
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:32,568
Don't try to understand. Just do it.

210
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:34,098
- Go at the end.
- Go at the end.

211
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:36,368
- Come on out.
- Why?

212
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:37,438
You're going last.

213
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:38,508
- And...
- Cheer with us.

214
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:41,138
After all of us go, you'll go last.

215
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,248
Okay? Let's begin.

216
00:08:42,249 --> 00:08:43,378
- One, two, three, - You win if you get...

217
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:44,448
- four, five...
- the most amount of cheers.

218
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,718
- Four?
- After Yu Jin.

219
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,719
Yes. You go after Yu Jin.

220
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,488
- Make sure you cheer with us...
- Okay.

221
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:49,988
- after each person goes.
- Is it "Give me the money?"

222
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:50,989
- "Give me my money." - Who will go first?

223
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,219
- Me.
- "Give me my money."

224
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,458
One, two, three, four, five, six.

225
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:55,558
Let's begin. Set, go.

226
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,989
(The challenge begins.)

227
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:58,428
Let's begin. Set, go.

228
00:08:58,429 --> 00:08:59,998
Give me my money.

229
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,768
- Yes!
- Yes!

230
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,168
Give me my money.

231
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:05,099
- Yes!
- Yes!

232
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,238
Give me my money.

233
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:09,238
- Yes!
- Yes!

234
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,738
Give me my money.

235
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:12,478
- Yes!
- Yes!

236
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:13,708
Give me my money.

237
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:15,649
- Yes!
- Yes!

238
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:17,548
Give me my money.

239
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:18,779
Yes!

240
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:25,619
Give me my money.

241
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,019
(Crying)

242
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:31,559
(A shout in silence)

243
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,169
Young Ji. Lee Young Ji.

244
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,939
It was so funny. I'm in tears.

245
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:42,038
It was legendary.

246
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,439
- Lee Young Ji, follow me.
- It was so funny.

247
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,038
- It was so funny.
- I'm in tears.

248
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,608
- Who wants to watch it?
- I'm in tears.

249
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:52,049
- It was so funny. I'm dying.
- I'm dying.

250
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:53,778
Young Ji, have a word with me.

251
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:55,219
- I'm dying.
- It was incredible.

252
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,288
I'm so upset right now.

253
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:58,289
(They go to spread the news.)

254
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,259
(Jade Emperor confirms it.)

255
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,229
Give me my money!

256
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:05,858
(A friend of 20 years became a fool.)

257
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:07,159
You guys are so mean.

258
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:09,669
You guys did really well.

259
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,599
It was so funny.

260
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,298
(Running away)

261
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:15,908
Seriously.

262
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:18,108
- We'll need to talk.
- It was so funny.

263
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:19,679
- We'll need to talk.
- Seriously.

264
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:22,008
- It was legendary.
- I think it'll be necessary.

265
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:24,548
It's even sadder because you did it so diligently.

266
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:26,619
- You did it so diligently.
- Your eyes were bulging out.

267
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:28,749
It's even sadder because you did it so diligently.

268
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:30,718
I... I'll tell my dad what you've done.

269
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:33,788
- "I'll tell my dad." - I didn't expect you to do so well.

270
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:35,228
He gave it his all.

271
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:37,589
Look how excited he is in the back.

272
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:38,958
He's clapping.

273
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,799
(Passionate)

274
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:48,099
(The side of him he has never seen before)

275
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:53,178
(Young Ji has never looked so happy while filming Earth Arcade.)

276
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:57,008
I'll have my revenge on you, okay?

277
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:58,618
- It was so funny.
- Lee Young Ji!

278
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,819
Seriously. It was so funny.

279
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:04,488
- I won't let you be.
- It was so funny.

280
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:06,589
Mimi, I'm about to pass out.

281
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:12,059
I was trying to help you in any way I could.

282
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,158
But all you want to do is mock me.

283
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,199
Seriously.

284
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:17,069
You aren't even listening to me.

285
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:23,969
(Watching for the 4th time)

286
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:27,339
(The more they watch, the more charming the video gets.)

287
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:28,909
I'm in tears.

288
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:31,918
(Watching again)

289
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,149
Stop watching. How many times are you watching it?

290
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:37,318
I'll have a talk with your manager.

291
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:40,219
(Watching for the 5th time)

292
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:42,558
(Passing out)

293
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,159
It's so funny.

294
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,098
- It's insane.
- Seriously.

295
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:48,398
Seriously, you'll be punished.

296
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,368
I'll be blessed.

297
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:51,938
No, you'll be punished.

298
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:54,799
For giving people laughter, I'll be blessed.

299
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,708
Producer Na, thank you for ten million views.

300
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,478
Seriously, you'll be punished...

301
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,938
- later on.
- Give me my money!

302
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,208
- Yes!
- Yes!

303
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:03,549
You'll be punished.

304
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,978
Give me my money!

305
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:07,048
Yes!

306
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:08,379
Please clean up, okay?

307
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,149
Please.

308
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:12,088
- Close the suitcase.
- I'm done.

309
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,018
There are so many things. What are you talking about?

310
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:15,088
All of them belong to Yu Jin.

311
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:16,328
Whose is this eggiscoming jacket?

312
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:17,858
- It's Producer Yeong Seok's.
- Whose is it?

313
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:19,528
Give me back my jacket if you aren't going to wear it.

314
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:20,958
Whose is this issue of "Dazed?"

315
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,098
It's ours.

316
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:23,169
My charger.

317
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:24,569
Here you go, Producer Na.

318
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:27,098
- Take the eggiscoming jacket.
- Give me my money!

319
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:28,438
- Yes!
- Yes!

320
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:30,109
They take my clothes...

321
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:31,979
and mock me.

322
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:34,509
How did we film such a funny video?

323
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,108
(Watching again)

324
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:39,548
- People will think...
- Young Ji, please pack up.

325
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,518
- Your bra is hanging out.
- Eun Ji.

326
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,918
(Mom becomes furious in the end.)

327
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,189
Pack up already. Get your toothbrush and toothpaste.

328
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,818
The bathroom is littered with your items.

329
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:49,088
(Mom is the only one who gets her to work.)

330
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:51,059
(They finish packing up.)

331
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:54,099
As I announced yesterday, you'll leave...

332
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,899
for a warm vacation spot in the south.

333
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,798
Before you do that,

334
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,868
- you'll need to eat lunch.
- Yes.

335
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:04,408
Yes. In Portugal,

336
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,739
you've tried many traditional Portuguese dishes.

337
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,408
For lunch today, you'll eat...

338
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:10,579
- the food Portuguese Gen Zers like.
- Gen Zers.

339
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,979
You'll enjoy a casual, light meal.

340
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,079
That's me.

341
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,819
(The Gen Z crew members' favorite place)

342
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,889
(The food is pretty and tasty.)

343
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:25,029
(The food is pretty and tasty in a hip way.)

344
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:27,959
(The food is pretty and tasty in a hip and picturesque way.)

345
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:30,899
It won't be fun if you eat without any challenges.

346
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,639
So we have a small suggestion.

347
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:39,809
We've closely studied your behaviors since yesterday.

348
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:41,779
- I mean...
- Ever since...

349
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:45,078
Young Ji got her phone back after 82 hours...

350
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,318
I don't even know how many challenges she has filmed.

351
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:50,348
I'm behind, so...

352
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:52,719
We can't sleep at night because it's so loud.

353
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:54,788
We're extremely tired.

354
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:56,659
If you guys are so interested in the challenges...

355
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,929
and so confident about the views,

356
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:00,758
let's have a small bet.

357
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:03,899
- What kind of a bet?
- We'll be very thankful.

358
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:06,369
Asian Culture President, step forward.

359
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:07,469
Step forward.

360
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,568
- Do you hold grudges?
- Akh!

361
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:10,868
- Do you hold grudges?
- Akh!

362
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:11,869
All right!

363
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,809
- It'll be a bit hard for us.
- We...

364
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:18,308
It can be anything. It can be a challenge, a video,

365
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:19,419
or a mission.

366
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,318
We'll give you 30 minutes,

367
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,389
so plan and film in that time.

368
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:25,189
Then upload the video.

369
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:28,628
It can be your social media account, YouTube channel,

370
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:30,029
Instagram, or TikTok.

371
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:32,029
- Upload it anywhere.
- Okay.

372
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:35,159
In ten minutes,

373
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:37,829
get 500,000 views.

374
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,168
(500,000 views)

375
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:42,909
- Easy.
- Is it easy?

376
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:44,269
- On Instagram?
- Easy.

377
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:45,708
- It doesn't matter.
- On Instagram?

378
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,208
- It doesn't matter. It's easy.
- It doesn't matter.

379
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:48,978
- Make it one million.
- One million.

380
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:50,178
- Come on.
- Come on.

381
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:51,908
- Don't be like that.
- We only have ten minutes.

382
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:54,418
- It's barely enough time.
- One million views won't be easy.

383
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:57,088
President, be conscientious and tell us...

384
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:58,189
if it's easy to get 500,000 views.

385
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:59,718
- It isn't easy.
- It isn't easy.

386
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:00,989
- Is it barely enough time?
- It's barely enough time.

387
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:03,328
Young Ji, shall I put on a bikini and do the Zero Two Dance?

388
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:04,828
No.

389
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:05,958
(Refusal)

390
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,799
- It's okay.
- It's okay, right?

391
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,329
- It's okay.
- I think we'll be fine.

392
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:10,728
It's okay. It'll be too much.

393
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:12,869
(You can upload the video here if you're disappointed.)

394
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:15,569
If you get 500,000 views in 10 minutes,

395
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:18,838
you'll eat happily and go to Albufeira happily.

396
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:19,908
It's totally doable.

397
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,309
If you fail...

398
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:24,349
- to get 500,000 views, - Then what?

399
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,719
You'll give us what we've always dreamed of. Silence.

400
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:29,319
- We...
- I can't believe it.

401
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,948
- Why do you try to silence us?
- Don't you want to hear our voices?

402
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:33,518
Don't you want to hear our voices?

403
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,058
- You'll do that...
- This is driving me crazy.

404
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,589
During the trip to the restaurant and meal.

405
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:39,799
What kind of a variety show tells the cast members not to talk?

406
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,529
I'm so curious about that.

407
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,328
It's just for the trip to the restaurant and meal.

408
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,338
During that time? Young Ji, what do you think?

409
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:48,238
- I...
- It's up to you.

410
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,168
Asian Culture President's opinion matters.

411
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:53,179
I want to share my objective view.

412
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:56,809
We filmed a reel earlier with Producer Yeong Seok, right?

413
00:15:57,149 --> 00:15:59,219
It'll get 1 million views in 10 minutes.

414
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:02,188
(1 million views in 10 minutes)

415
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:03,219
I'm serious.

416
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:05,919
- Reels?
- Instagram Reels.

417
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,759
I want to make this suggestion.

418
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:10,729
If we get 1 million views in 10 minutes,

419
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,429
what will you do for us?

420
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,328
- One million views in ten minutes?
- One million views in ten minutes?

421
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:18,029
- What do you think?
- One million views in ten minutes?

422
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,569
- It's 9am right now.
- Do you think you're the president?

423
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,268
(For some reason, Brother Yeong Seok gets annoyed.)

424
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:23,908
- In Korea...
- That's...

425
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:26,308
Even if I do YouTube Live like crazy,

426
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:27,408
I get less than 100,000 views.

427
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:30,149
He became aggravated.

428
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:31,348
Don't become sullen.

429
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:32,848
- He became aggravated.
- Don't become sullen.

430
00:16:32,849 --> 00:16:34,178
- Hold on.
- Let's have a meeting.

431
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:35,319
They're having a meeting.

432
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,148
- After all...
- Not bad.

433
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,058
May I give you an objective reason?

434
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:41,858
- Go ahead.
- I think that reel is...

435
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:43,489
a pot of gold.

436
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:45,129
It has so much power.

437
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:47,028
Usually, if I'm being honest,

438
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:48,658
a reel I post in the golden time period gets...

439
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:49,729
about 300,000 views in 10 minutes.

440
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,198
- About 300,000 views.
- About 400,000 views.

441
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,199
What time is it in Korea now?

442
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,409
- It's 9pm. It's the perfect time.
- Is it perfect?

443
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:57,939
After I post it,

444
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,209
- everyone should share it.
- Everyone should share it.

445
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:04,409
Then we'll get 700,000 to 800,000 views...

446
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:05,648
- in ten minutes.
- That's your guess.

447
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,719
Yes. That's my guess.

448
00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:09,088
- That won't be half bad.
- So you want to make a deal...

449
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,188
- for 1 million views in 10 minutes.
- Yes.

450
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:13,588
- That's a good idea.
- Let's go to the enemy team...

451
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,589
- and ask.
- They're having a meeting.

452
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,089
(The meeting drags on.)

453
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,758
Come to think of it, 1 million views in 10 minutes will be a bit hard.

454
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,568
(She becomes a bit nervous.)

455
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,569
Deal.

456
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,468
- I'm back.
- Hello.

457
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:28,469
(He comes back solemnly.)

458
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,169
If you're so confident,

459
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,808
- we'll accept your suggestion.
- Okay.

460
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:35,809
- Okay.
- Will you accept it?

461
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:37,648
If you get one million views...

462
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:39,119
- in ten minutes, - Okay.

463
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:42,248
You'll get a digital flex...

464
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:44,019
- instead of a digital detox.
- What is it?

465
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:47,519
We'll buy each one of you the electronic device you wanted.

466
00:17:47,689 --> 00:17:52,198
Still, you need to be conscientious.

467
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,698
It can't be too expensive.

468
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,728
Okay.

469
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:56,169
Your phone broke, right?

470
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:59,438
- It broke while filming the show.
- Yes.

471
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,338
We'll buy each one of you something like that.

472
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:03,208
- We need a Bluetooth speaker.
- That's right.

473
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:05,069
- I don't want to borrow it.
- Producer.

474
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:07,439
Well...

475
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,808
- It hurts our pride to borrow it.
- Young Ji, be quiet.

476
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:10,949
No. Can we get 15 minutes instead?

477
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:13,048
- Fifteen minutes.
- Ten minutes.

478
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,018
- Ten minutes.
- All right.

479
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:16,288
- It's okay, Young Ji.
- All right.

480
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:17,488
- All right.
- What's this?

481
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:19,959
- With that attitude...
- You said you were the president.

482
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,619
- You were so confident.
- All right.

483
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:23,828
- I can't believe it.
- It's doable.

484
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:27,599
If you fail to get one million views...

485
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:30,929
We promised a digital flex and adhered to your terms.

486
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,669
So the penalty will be silence as well as a digital detox...

487
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:38,169
for all four of you until the sun rises tomorrow.

488
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:39,279
I don't want to do this.

489
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,479
I give up.

490
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,679
- I give up.
- I give up.

491
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:47,579
I'm not the president. I'm a citizen.

492
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:50,019
Talk among yourselves.

493
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,649
Young Ji's confidence is on the line.

494
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:53,288
Young Ji's confidence is on the line.

495
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,559
- One million views is a lot.
- You know...

496
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,658
- What should we do, Young Ji?
- Isn't one million views a lot?

497
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:01,159
- Let's sit down.
- I want to tell you do.

498
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:03,899
- Let's talk in a calm manner.
- The reel we filmed earlier...

499
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,399
There's a term called "A one-in-a-century idol," right?

500
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,569
- Yes.
- It's a one-in-a-century reel.

501
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,139
That's what I think.

502
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,738
Thus, we have a chance.

503
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:14,708
But will people recognize it in ten minutes?

504
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:17,579
It'll definitely get 1 million views in 30 minutes.

505
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:22,448
- What do you think?
- Why did you ask for ten minutes?

506
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:24,019
To show my spirits,

507
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:27,188
- I talked big. I'm sorry.
- What was your idea...

508
00:19:27,189 --> 00:19:30,229
- for promoting the reel?
- Yes.

509
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,429
- Instagram Live is a good option.
- Okay.

510
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:36,169
If each of you has an Instagram Live...

511
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,868
after ten minutes...

512
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:39,298
- I'm losing my confidence.
- Listen.

513
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,969
- Okay.
- I'll do what Young Ji wants.

514
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:43,639
- Okay.
- I want to give it a go.

515
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:45,238
- Okay.
- What do you think?

516
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:46,509
- Let's do it.
- But a digital detox...

517
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:48,579
is painful and terrible.

518
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:51,779
If we have a digital detox, the crew members will suffer more.

519
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:53,078
- You're right.
- So...

520
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:55,988
It'll be better if all four of us have a digital detox.

521
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:57,348
Time passed quickly then.

522
00:19:57,349 --> 00:19:58,618
Then the four of us can play together.

523
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,059
That's right. We can play together.

524
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:02,428
Will you trust me and follow me even if we fail?

525
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:04,759
- Of course.
- That goes without saying.

526
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:07,498
- Young Ji, just do it.
- It doesn't matter.

527
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,558
- It doesn't matter.
- Young Ji.

528
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,969
I might resent you a bit.

529
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:12,898
- Just do it.
- I'll bear it.

530
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:14,598
- Just do it.
- We won't get 100,000 views...

531
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,408
- in ten minutes.
- Okay. Let's go.

532
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:18,508
- I'll help in any way I can.
- This is touching.

533
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,608
- One million views in ten minutes?
- It's like "One Piece."

534
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,008
"E-cade, we can do it."

535
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:22,078
- We can do it.
- Three, two, one.

536
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,278
- E-cade!
- E-cade!

537
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,508
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

538
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:27,618
(1 million views in 10 minutes)

539
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:29,648
(Success will result in a digital flex.)

540
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:32,148
(Failure will result in silence and digital detox.)

541
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,719
(Current time in Lisbon: 11:30am)

542
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:36,189
A hundred thousand views in ten minutes?

543
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:38,658
- Then...
- It's 1 million in 10 minutes.

544
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:39,998
- If it's 100,000 views...
- If it's 100,000 views,

545
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,198
- Oh, one million views.
- we'll be thankful.

546
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,328
- One million views.
- Can we do that instead?

547
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:43,429
- Let's begin.
- Let's have a meeting.

548
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:45,968
- Okay.
- We'll begin the stopwatch.

549
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:48,668
- All right. Would it be okay...
- Hold on.

550
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:50,268
To turn on Instagram Live?

551
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:52,508
Hold on. I need to receive permission from my agency.

552
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,078
Yu Jin needs to receive permission.

553
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,378
- Then...
- Do other things first.

554
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,379
- we won't have Instagram Live now.
- We'll talk about other things.

555
00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:00,279
"We'll upload a reel ten minutes later."

556
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:03,119
"If it gets a lot of views,"

557
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,088
- "a very good thing will happen." - Okay.

558
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,059
- Let's make that comment.
- Okay.

559
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,889
- Let's upload it as a story.
- A story. Okay.

560
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:13,728
Let's do it at 8:50pm in Korean time.

561
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:16,698
- At 8:50pm.
- At 8:50pm.

562
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:18,129
- Okay.
- At 8:50pm.

563
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:20,339
Team Leader, what are you doing?

564
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:23,769
It's an important issue.

565
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:27,579
It's an important issue. On Earth Arcade,

566
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:31,649
we made a bet about the views on Instagram Reels.

567
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:36,519
We need to get 1 million views in 10 minutes.

568
00:21:37,189 --> 00:21:39,358
To do that, we need to promote the reel.

569
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,119
So I need to turn on Instagram Live.

570
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:42,789
The sooner, the better.

571
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:44,758
Okay.

572
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,159
(She waits for the confirmation from the agency.)

573
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:47,928
Tell us when it's 8:50pm.

574
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:50,268
- I can count down.
- Well done.

575
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:51,568
- Then...
- I think...

576
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:54,168
I can go live...

577
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:56,169
- in 10 minutes.
- At 8:50pm.

578
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:58,768
- Let's go live at 8:50pm.
- Let's go live...

579
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:00,809
- and reveal the reel then.
- Okay.

580
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:02,779
Then people will gather around and watch it right away.

581
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:03,879
Okay.

582
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,819
(Step 3, Upload the mission video.)

583
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,979
It'll be my first Instagram Live.

584
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,019
- You'll do it because of us.
- Yes.

585
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:11,419
Let's do it on your account.

586
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:14,318
If I get permission, it'll be better to do it on my account.

587
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,319
- Okay.
- Good.

588
00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:16,988
It should be the two members with the most followers.

589
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:18,658
Then you and I should do it.

590
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,828
- Then let's split up...
- Okay.

591
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:22,598
- and go live.
- Okay.

592
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:23,868
You and I.

593
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:24,899
Good.

594
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,139
"It's for a mission on Earth Arcade. At 8:50pm..."

595
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,468
- Live.
- Will you post a story?

596
00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:30,469
"Please watch Instagram Live."

597
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,068
"Please watch Instagram Live." Tag me.

598
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:33,079
And...

599
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,508
(It's for a mission on Earth Arcade.)

600
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:35,809
(At 8:50pm, please watch Instagram Live.)

601
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,248
(Please gather around.)

602
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:39,349
(They shared the story.)

603
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:42,819
(20 minutes before the mission)

604
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:46,659
Isn't it extremely difficult to get one million views?

605
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:49,659
Where is Min Hwan, our marketing expert?

606
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:51,388
- Is one million possible?
- No.

607
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:53,158
Honestly, getting 500,000 views is already difficult.

608
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,398
Getting 500,000 views is difficult.

609
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:56,668
- Let me ask the president.
- Yes?

610
00:22:56,669 --> 00:22:59,338
Up until now... Don't you check the number of views...

611
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:00,798
- after uploading a video?
- Yes.

612
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,608
Do you have any media content that got one million views...

613
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:04,239
- within ten minutes?
- I have none.

614
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,109
This will be her first.

615
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,239
Congratulations, everyone.

616
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,278
- We'll eat lunch quietly today.
- One million is...

617
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,449
I said one million views...

618
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,949
- on impulse.
- We'll enjoy some peace.

619
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,779
Silence is golden.

620
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:18,219
The last reel that I uploaded was...

621
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:20,058
I should look at Lee Young Ji's recent number of views.

622
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,518
- Young Ji.
- Even if we fail...

623
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,188
I usually get from 7 to 8 million views.

624
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:24,288
- Gosh.
- Usually.

625
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:26,058
(The number of views on Young Ji's recent reels on Instagram)

626
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:27,799
(8.95 million, 8.25 million, 7.40 million views)

627
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:29,699
- But we don't know in ten minutes.
- Right.

628
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:32,299
Usually, it takes about 2 to 3 days.

629
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,038
(She also has many videos with a higher number of views.)

630
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,338
(24.8 million, 23.9 million, 20.04 million views)

631
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:39,308
(Her video with the highest number of views was with Lisa.)

632
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:40,679
(30.25 million views)

633
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:44,349
Based on the final result I've had,

634
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:46,548
I believe that it's possible to get 10 million views with that reel.

635
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:47,549
I see.

636
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,318
- But in 10 minutes...
- What's hard is 10 minutes.

637
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:51,418
- Ten minutes are short.
- The time limit is...

638
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:52,618
We have five minutes before the live video.

639
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:53,619
- Okay.
- Okay.

640
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,718
Are you on live right now?

641
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,728
- We're announcing it beforehand.
- We'll go live soon.

642
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:58,659
- Yu Jin as well?
- You said we could give a notice.

643
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:00,758
This is Yu Jin's first time going live...

644
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,999
- on her Instagram account.
- It's my first time.

645
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:04,069
That's how I live.

646
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:06,369
That's how I live.

647
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:10,009
(Yu Jin on a rampage)

648
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:11,968
Where do you click to go live?

649
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:12,978
She's asking where.

650
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:14,678
- To go live...
- Where do you do it?

651
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:16,548
- Click this.
- That's how she lives.

652
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:17,578
This is Yu Jin.

653
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:19,249
She's doing a lot for the first time because of Earth Arcade.

654
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:21,518
It's her first time putting on makeup.

655
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,148
- Her first time putting on makeup.
- Her first live show.

656
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:24,489
Her first live show.

657
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:26,359
She drank alcohol for the first time.

658
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:28,388
It's thanks to Earth Arcade.

659
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:29,658
(The youngest is growing with Earth Arcade.)

660
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:31,189
(Plan 2: Promotional live show)

661
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:32,758
- We have one minute left.
- Young Ji...

662
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,359
- Young Ji is nervous.
- We have one minute left.

663
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:37,198
Yu Jin and I do it together.

664
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,969
- Mimi and Young Ji do it together.
- Yes.

665
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:40,238
- Shall we stay apart...
- For the sound...

666
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:41,569
to keep the sound clean?

667
00:24:42,369 --> 00:24:44,038
- Are you okay, Young Ji?
- Let's stay apart.

668
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,208
What's wrong?

669
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:46,709
Young Ji, are you okay?

670
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:49,508
(Getting ready for the joint live video)

671
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:52,509
(Accounts: youngji and yujin an)

672
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:54,579
We're ready. Turn it on.

673
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:56,719
- What?
- Turn it on.

674
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:58,949
What's going on?

675
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,959
I don't even know what you're doing.

676
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,789
- "Checking the connection." - "Checking the connection."

677
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:05,859
Yu Jin, don't worry.

678
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:07,798
(Start)

679
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,399
Yu Jin, this feels so strange.

680
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:12,168
Yu Jin's Instagram account.

681
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:15,068
This is Yu Jin's first time being on live.

682
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:17,538
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

683
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:18,938
There are 193... It's 600.

684
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:20,408
Six hundred people are already watching it.

685
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:21,538
Hello, everyone.

686
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:22,948
- This is so fascinating.
- Yu Jin, accept my invitation.

687
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:25,078
- We will.
- Accept our invitation.

688
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,349
- We'll accept it.
- It's done.

689
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,448
- Hello.
- It's on.

690
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:30,018
- Hello.
- Hello, everyone.

691
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:32,719
We have an important announcement to make.

692
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,519
We made a bet on the number of views.

693
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:36,328
Within ten minutes,

694
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:38,528

- Yes.

695
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:39,798
- That's right.
- We absolutely need to reach them.

696
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:40,799
Absolutely.

697
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,028
It's not the number of views for this live video.

698
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:45,298
We will be uploading a reel soon.

699
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,099
We'll be uploading a reel.

700
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:50,168
It needs to get over 1 million views within 10 minutes.

701
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,208
Within ten minutes.

702
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:52,538
- Within ten minutes.
- This live video is...

703
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:54,578
being watched by 84,000 people in 1 minute.

704
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:56,278
- It's 88,000.
- Thank you, everyone.

705
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,578
(It exceeded the seating capacity of Sangam Stadium.)

706
00:25:57,579 --> 00:25:58,908
- Otherwise, - This is the right speed.

707
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:00,048
My mobile phone will be taken away.

708
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:02,549
- Right, we'll be in trouble.
- They'll make us retire.

709
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:03,918
We'll be in trouble.

710
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,088
If we don't get 1 million views within 10 minutes,

711
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:06,658
- we'll have to retire.
- We'll be doomed.

712
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,259
- The reel will be uploaded...
- This looks good.

713
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,729
At 9pm.

714
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:14,259

Eun Ji, we aren't on the radio.

723
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:30,378
(It feels like I'm doing a live commerce.)

724
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:32,919
Please help us defeat Producer Na Yeong Seok.

725
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:35,149
Everyone, don't you want to see Brother Yeong Seok?

726
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,448
- Do you want to see him?
- I'll show him to you.

727
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:38,449
Where did he go?

728
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,919
- Brother Yeong Seok.
- I'll show him to you.

729
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:42,088
Everyone, you don't need to watch it.

730
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:43,228
- Yes, you do.
- Everyone.

731
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:45,228
- The video will be very boring, - You must watch it.

732
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,698
- so you don't need to watch it.
- Don't listen to Yeong Seok.

733
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:50,328
Please watch the show on TV when it gets aired.

734
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:51,668
- Please, no.
- Don't.

735
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:52,669
You don't need to watch it.

736
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,998
(Boo)

737
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:55,399
Boo to you.

738
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:57,539
- Brother Yeong Seok, boo.
- An Yu Jin, boo.

739
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,868

- Yeong Seok is...

741
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,638
- Please help us.
- trying to torment us.

742

Account name "mkh," thank you for saying that I look pretty.

743
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,819
Where? Where do you mean?

744
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:09,349
You read that?

745
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,889
- Did you really read that comment?
- Yes.

746
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:13,389
We'll be off now.

747
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:15,159
- After five minutes.
- Bye.

748
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:18,129
- Please make sure to watch it.
- We'd appreciate it.

749
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:20,399
(The live video ends.)

750
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,868
I just saw a glimmer of hope.

751
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:24,398
Didn't we get a high number of views?

752
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,168
About 90,000 people watched...

753
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,068
- our live show within two minutes.
- Right.

754
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:31,238
That's why I saw a glimmer of hope.

755
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,639
- We have a chance.
- It was fun.

756
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:37,278

(1. Editing the video)

760
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:44,949

761
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,389
Give me my money.

762
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:48,858
(Bursting out laughing)

763
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:50,689
It’s hilarious every time I watch it.

764
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:54,859
(2. Select the cover image)

765
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:57,669
I will use this for the cover image.

766
00:27:58,229 --> 00:27:59,468
You have three minutes left.

767
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,668
This will be the cover image.

768
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:02,499
- Let me see.
- The reel's cover image.

769
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:04,608
- This is the cover image.
- We have three minutes?

770
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:05,668
We have three minutes left.

(3. Write the content)

772
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:09,609
(Caption: 1000)

773
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:11,548
What should we write for the text?

774
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:12,549
The text?

775
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,748
I'm usually spontaneous, and I tend to keep it simple.

776
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:17,419
How about "Could we exceed one million views?"

777
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,719
"A 10 Million Reel."

778
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:22,189
"A 10 Million Reel" sounds good.

779
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,688

780
00:28:24,689 --> 00:28:25,689

783
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:33,468

- It'll be uploaded in two minutes.
- Yes.

786
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,909
Depending on the result at 12:10pm, if you fail,

787
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:42,879
you must be silent right away.

788
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:44,749

789
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:46,978

00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,788
It takes time to upload it, so I'll start it now.

794
00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:59,899
Okay, let's go.

795
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:08,498
It's uploaded. Please make it public.

796

- Where?
- I knew it.

806
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:39,325
Where is it, Young Ji?

807
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:41,294
- High-five.
- What kind of thumbnail is that?

808
00:29:41,295 --> 00:29:43,434
- Let's try it.
- Let's try a good one.

809
00:29:43,435 --> 00:29:44,534
Excuse me,

810
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:46,664
but you should've discussed the thumbnail with me.

811
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:48,665
Were we supposed to discuss it?

812
00:29:48,865 --> 00:29:51,104
Never mind. Just keep it.

- Which one looks better?
- I feel nervous.

816
00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:57,614
Put it up on your stories.

817
00:29:57,615 --> 00:29:58,714
We have over 3,000 already.

(3,667 views right after the upload)

819
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:02,485
Young Ji, from your account,

820
00:30:02,815 --> 00:30:03,815
how many views do you see?

821
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:06,284
I don't know if the number of views is accurate.

822
00:30:06,285 --> 00:30:07,485
- I'll take a look.
- Okay.

823
00:30:08,855 --> 00:30:10,854
Currently, I have 6,800 views.

824

829
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:21,835
Okay.

(Sharing)

831
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,905
I saw this look in the movie "Tazza."

832

What is it?

833
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,515
(I put everything on the line.)

834
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:34,045
It looks like she put her whole life on the line.

835
00:30:34,515 --> 00:30:35,944

836

838
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:42,455
It's 37,000.

839
00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:43,694
- Within one minute?
- That was the fastest.

840

- We got 37,000 views in 1 minute.
- In 1 minute?

- We got 37,000 views in 1 minute.
- In 1 minute?

842
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:48,394
This will work, Young Ji.

843
00:30:48,395 --> 00:30:50,234
It will be around 370,000 views in 10 minutes.

844
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:52,134
It will work, Young Ji. Don't go in.

845
00:30:52,135 --> 00:30:53,564
I thought that she was jumping in.

846
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:55,135
Please.

847
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:56,574
This is very fast,

848

- Isn't that quite fast?
- We don't know much about it.

- That's why...
- I don't know much either.

Good job. Thank you.

00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:30,505
It's been two minutes so far.

866
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,674
- It's 170,000.
- It's 170,000.

867
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:36,104
- Eun Ji, we have a chance.
- We really do.

868
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:37,945
It's 170,000, and it's been 3 minutes.

869
00:31:38,245 --> 00:31:40,445
(178,919 views within 3 minutes)

870
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:42,284
It's only been three minutes. We have a chance.

871
00:31:42,285 --> 00:31:44,285
We can do it.

872
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:46,285
It's only been three minutes. We have a chance.

873
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:50,425
(Maximum tension)

874
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:53,825
"It's my first time waiting each second to watch a reel."

875
00:31:54,365 --> 00:31:56,194
"Can I take a shower, sleep, go to work, get off work,"

876
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:57,995
"and exercise while playing the reel, Young Ji?"

877
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,664
You can do all that in ten minutes?

878
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:00,705
That's amazing.

879
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:02,105
It's 220,000.

880
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:03,634
Mine is more accurate.

881
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:05,605
- Let me show you.
- How do I...

882
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,244
It's 240,000.

883
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:09,504
It's 240,000.

884
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:11,375
(239,174 views in 4 minutes)

885
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:12,745
I'll keep playing it too.

886
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:14,014
It slowed down.

887
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,385
Is it 220,000?

888
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:17,314
- About 200 with Eun Ji?
- Yu Jin.

889
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:20,425
All the staff can talk as much as they want while eating today.

890
00:32:22,325 --> 00:32:24,925
(Banging her head)

891
00:32:24,995 --> 00:32:27,194
What's wrong?

892
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,364
What's going on?

893
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,565
What did you say to provoke her?

894
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,194
What did they say to you?

895
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:33,434
It's a day of detox for Sun Woo.

896
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:35,505
Sun Woo will get to cleanse his ears.

897
00:32:36,235 --> 00:32:38,674
The sound supervisor's ears will be cleansed.

898
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:40,375
Sun Woo Detox.

899
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:42,274
(The moment he's been waiting for 3 years)

900
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:44,215
Sun Woo, this will be...

901
00:32:44,475 --> 00:32:48,314
This will be a detox for Sun Woo.

902
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:50,384
- This is serious.
- Young Ji's pride depends on it.

903
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,514
Okay, we can do it.

904
00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:53,085
It's definitely possible within 15 minutes.

905
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:55,755
- It'd be possible without a doubt.
- Right.

906
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:57,554
I like what you said.

907
00:32:57,555 --> 00:32:58,794
It's 280,000.

908
00:32:58,795 --> 00:33:00,094
Let me refresh it.

909
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:01,565
- Has it been 5 minutes?
- Yes, 5 minutes.

910
00:33:01,825 --> 00:33:02,864
It's over.

911
00:33:02,865 --> 00:33:04,164
It's 320,000.

912
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:05,964
- We have 5 minutes left.
- We have 5 minutes left.

913
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:07,835
- Congratulations, Sun Woo.
- We have five minutes left.

915
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:12,535
(Getting ahead of himself)

916
00:33:12,635 --> 00:33:14,774
- Congratulations, Sun Woo.
- We have five minutes left.

917
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:16,914
- Congratulations, Sun Woo.
- Thank you.

918
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:18,245
(Happy)

919
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:20,844
(They've never seen him so happy.)

920
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:22,515
- Sun Woo!
- Sun Woo won.

921
00:33:25,215 --> 00:33:28,185
- No.
- IVE's STARSHIP Entertainment.

922

923
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:30,924
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

924
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,365
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your popularity.

925
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:36,764
(Supported by many people)

926
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:37,935
It's 400,000.

927
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:38,965
- Okay.
- It's 400,000.

928
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:40,864
- We can do it.
- Let's go.

929
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:42,135
Please.

930
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:43,165
It's 400,000.

931
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:44,874
- Okay.
- It's 400,000.

932
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,274
- We can do it.
- Let's go.

933
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,144
Please.

934
00:33:48,145 --> 00:33:49,544
Thank you, Eun Ji. Whatever happens,

935
00:33:49,545 --> 00:33:51,645
- thank you so much.
- We have five minutes left.

936
00:33:51,845 --> 00:33:52,915
Let's dance.

937
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:54,184
(Playing with fire)

938
00:33:54,185 --> 00:33:55,915
Please.

939
00:33:58,415 --> 00:34:00,085
- It's 470,000 right now.
- Okay.

940
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:01,255
We have 500,000 views.

941
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:03,085
- Young Ji, we can't stay still.
- We have 500,000 views.

942
00:34:03,355 --> 00:34:05,054
This will make me fail.

943
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:06,294
- This will make me fail.
- High-five.

944
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:07,925
- Don't do it.
- Don't do it.

945
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:10,365
This is what they call slaves to the number of views.

946
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:13,195
- It's over 500,000.
- What can we do more?

947
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:15,405
Play the reel on your phone.

948
00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:17,134
- Yes, you should watch it.
- Okay.

949
00:34:17,135 --> 00:34:18,904
- Watch it.
- I've been watching it.

950
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:20,375
- Everyone, play it.
- Since a moment ago...

951
00:34:20,545 --> 00:34:22,604
- Please play it, everyone.
- Give me my mobile phone.

952
00:34:22,605 --> 00:34:23,814
- Give me your phones.
- Give me your phones.

953
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:24,974
We won't watch it.

954
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:26,885
It's 520,000 views.

955
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:29,345
This is insane.

956
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:31,755
- This is insane.
- Please.

957
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:33,784
- By the way, - We have four minutes.

958
00:34:33,785 --> 00:34:36,124
Getting 500,000 views in 10 minutes is amazing too.

959
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,624
- Of course.
- I agree with you.

960
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,825
That's unbelievable.

961
00:34:38,895 --> 00:34:40,064
Min Hwan, what do you think...

962
00:34:40,065 --> 00:34:41,894
of the number of views within ten minutes?

963
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:43,194
Mr. Marketer.

964
00:34:43,195 --> 00:34:44,864
The number is very high.

965
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:45,865
- Right?
- Yes.

966
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:47,334
- Okay.
- Aren't you proud of us?

967
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,335
Aren't you proud of us?

968
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,804
Unfortunately, you said one million on impulse...

969
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:51,174
I'm sorry.

970
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:53,575
If you had agreed on 500,000 views,

971
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,745
you would have won.

972
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,414
It's okay.

973
00:34:57,415 --> 00:34:59,944
I'd like to apologize beforehand. I'm very sorry.

974
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:01,184
(8 minutes have passed.)

975
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:02,214
It's okay.

976
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:03,554
REI shared the video.

977
00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:04,814
- REI.
- REI.

978
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:05,955
- The guinea pig dance.
- Thank you, REI.

979
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:08,684
(The guinea pig dance with gratitude)

980
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:09,925
It's over 600,000 views.

981
00:35:11,295 --> 00:35:12,824
We just need 400,000 more.

982
00:35:12,825 --> 00:35:13,894
It's 600,000 views.

983
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:15,065
(606,122 views in 8 minutes)

984
00:35:15,725 --> 00:35:17,334
Thank you, REI.

985
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:21,965
(To REI)

986
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:26,405
(Right before a mental breakdown)

987
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,104
- We have 1 minute left.
- You have 1 minute.

988
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:29,645
Realistically speaking, it's a failure.

989
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,815
- It's 700,000.
- It's over 700,000.

990
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:34,645
It's been nine minutes.

991
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:36,244
That's still impressive.

992
00:35:36,245 --> 00:35:38,485
- Unbelievable. We're so close.
- It's incredible.

993
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:39,655
We can do it.

994
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:43,285
(Wanting to hold onto anything for hope)

995
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:45,355
(She refreshes it again.)

996
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,724
It's 740,000.

997
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:48,194
This is amazing.

998
00:35:48,195 --> 00:35:50,965
- Within 10 minutes.
- If it was within 15 minutes...

999
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:53,805
Ten, nine, eight,

1000
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:56,775
seven, six, five,

1001
00:35:57,075 --> 00:36:00,675
four, three, two, one.

1002
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:02,675
The last one.

1003
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:03,945
(Refreshing for the last time)

1004
00:36:05,945 --> 00:36:08,284
With 760,000 views...

1005
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:10,155
(The final record of 761,708 views)

1006
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:11,984
- Silence.
- It's the last one.

1007
00:36:11,985 --> 00:36:14,925
(Silence starts.)

1008
00:36:15,185 --> 00:36:17,624
With 760,000 views...

1009
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,525
(Producer Na: With 760,000 views...)

1010
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,065
You failed to clear the mission.

1011
00:36:21,465 --> 00:36:22,524
From now on...

1012
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:23,565
(The mission failed.)

1013
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:25,995
Mouth Detox will start and continue...

1014
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:28,135
until you finish eating.

1015
00:36:28,665 --> 00:36:30,275
Congratulations, Sun Woo.

1016
00:36:31,975 --> 00:36:35,745
(The biggest beneficiary, Sound Supervisor Kim Sun Woo)

1017
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:41,485
(Comforting each other in silence)

1018
00:36:42,085 --> 00:36:43,654
After you finish eating at the restaurant,

1019
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:45,554
please turn in your mobile phones.

1020
00:36:45,555 --> 00:36:47,985
(Well done, everyone.)

1021
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,194
Do you want to say something?

1022
00:36:50,195 --> 00:36:51,254
Tell me.

1023
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:52,855
(The mission with the number of view ended.)

1024
00:36:53,025 --> 00:36:55,665
I'd like to know when it will reach one million views.

1025
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,965
Actually, I'm curious.

1026
00:36:57,995 --> 00:37:00,664
(We decided to keep our eye on it.)

1027
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:01,834
This is unbelievable.

1028
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:04,375
(Certain of reaching it in 15 minutes)

1029
00:37:04,835 --> 00:37:06,434
(You are...)

1030
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:07,675
(the best.)

1031
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:09,044
(Moved)

1032
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:11,745
(Tears)

1033
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:13,374
It's been 14 minutes.

1034
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,385
(14 minutes have passed.)

1035
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:17,084
It's 970,000.

1036
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:19,555
(970,402 views in 14 minutes)

1037
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,255
It will be 1 million in exactly 15 minutes.

1038
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:26,864
- It's one million.
- One million.

1039
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:27,995
Goodness.

1040
00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:32,935
(It finally reached 1 million views.)

1041
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,304
- It's 1 million.
- It took 14 minutes and 30 seconds.

1042
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:38,135
(Successful within 14 minutes 30 seconds)

1043
00:37:39,335 --> 00:37:43,375
(An amazing record)

1044
00:37:43,615 --> 00:37:46,445
That's impressive. Even though you failed,

1045
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,845
I'd like to say that it was impressive.

1046
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:54,855
(Currently, this video, on June 19, 2025)

1047
00:37:55,725 --> 00:37:59,595
(It has 37.8 million views.)

1048
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:01,225
The reel that I just played...

1049
00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:03,695
may be possible once in a thousand years.

1050
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:05,295
That's what I think.

1051
00:38:06,095 --> 00:38:11,634
(It has the highest number of views on Young Ji's Instagram.)

1052
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:12,834
(37.8 million, 30.25 million)

1053
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,605
(Yeong Seok got more views than Lisa.)

1054
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:16,814
(Special thanks to Young Ji's 5.28 million followers on Instagram, )

1055
00:38:16,815 --> 00:38:18,014
(Eunjirang fans, OH MY GIRL fans, Miracle, and IVE fans, DIVE)

1056
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:19,114
(We thank everyone who watched live on Instagram until late at night...)

1057
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:20,185
(and who played the reel.)

1058
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:22,385
This is really amazing.

1059
00:38:22,815 --> 00:38:24,985
- If it was 15 minutes...
- It'd have been possible.

1060
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:27,455
- If...
- Everyone is on Kakaotalk.

1061
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:31,455
Leave a message in the group chat if you need anything.

1062
00:38:33,025 --> 00:38:34,994
You can use it until you finish eating.

1063
00:38:34,995 --> 00:38:37,165
Turn in your phone after the meal.

1064
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:39,895
Shall we take off their microphones?

1065
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:41,434
- I think so.
- Yes.

1066
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:43,675
We'll turn on the clip audio.

1067
00:38:44,175 --> 00:38:45,404
It doesn't matter. Take it off.

1068
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:46,875
You don't need the microphone anymore.

1069
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:49,275
It's wasteful to use such expensive equipment.

1070
00:38:51,975 --> 00:38:54,415
It's wasteful to use batteries too.

1071
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:58,654
I'll let Sun Woo get off work for a while.

1072
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:00,625
- Gosh, it's so quiet.
- It's really nice.

1073
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:02,224
(Taking it off themselves)

1074
00:39:02,225 --> 00:39:04,195
By the way,

1075
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:06,225
you deserve a round of applause.

1076
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:10,995
I had no idea that these people I work with...

1077
00:39:11,865 --> 00:39:14,064
were this influential.

1078
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:15,635
I'm impressed.

1079
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:21,175
(He took away the voices of those who are influential.)

1080
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:24,115
(Leaving work early)

1081
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:26,645
(For recognizing us)

1082
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:27,985
Thank you.

1083
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:29,885
"Thank you for recognizing us?"

1084
00:39:31,855 --> 00:39:37,555
(Young Ji is speechless until the end.)

1085
00:39:38,995 --> 00:39:40,524
Goodbye.

1086
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:43,635
(Saying goodbye to their lodging in Lisbon silently)

1087
00:39:44,595 --> 00:39:46,065
It's so quiet everywhere.

1088
00:39:47,305 --> 00:39:48,334
(Dragging their feet to the restaurant)

1089
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:49,904
It's so peaceful.

1090
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:51,305
Isn't it very peaceful?

1091
00:39:53,905 --> 00:39:55,145
It's so quiet everywhere.

1092
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:57,415
(Punch)

1093
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:03,785
We're going to the restaurant.

1094
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:06,885
(Heading to the restaurant in silent mode)

1095
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:10,755
(Everyone is conversing on a messenger.)

1096
00:40:10,995 --> 00:40:13,325
(Their phones will be seized after the meal.)

1097
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:14,764
(Brother Yeong Seok, why are you riding with us all of a sudden?)

1098
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:16,225
(Yu Jin: You're right. Mimi: I have no idea.)

1099
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:17,334
(Yeong Seok: To unwind.)

1100
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:19,195
(Today, Yeong Seok is also in detox.)

1101
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:20,435
Gosh, this is nice.

1102
00:40:23,105 --> 00:40:25,005
(Laughing)

1103
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,745
(The eldest keeps laughing.)

1104
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:29,804
(Young Ji: Are we allowed to laugh?)

1105
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:30,944
(Hyun Yong: Please restrain. Eun Ji: Laughing)

1106
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:33,745
(A rule is a rule.)

1107
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:37,015
(Inhaling and exhaling)

1108
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:40,385
(It's also difficult for them.)

1109
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,224
(It's understandable...)

1110
00:40:42,225 --> 00:40:44,595
(because usually, they are usually...)

1111
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:48,625
(On their 1st day)

1112
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:51,835
(2nd day)

1113
00:40:52,335 --> 00:40:54,935
(3rd day)

1114
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:58,105
(As long as they could talk, they enjoyed themselves without phones.)

1115
00:40:58,675 --> 00:41:02,175
(4th day)

1116
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:04,415
(5th day)

1117
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:06,875
(6th day)

1118
00:41:07,585 --> 00:41:12,385
(Not a single day went by without singing or talking in the car)

1119
00:41:12,415 --> 00:41:14,655
(The present)

1120
00:41:15,155 --> 00:41:17,394
(They stopped talking for the first time on their 7th day.)

1121
00:41:17,395 --> 00:41:20,055
(At peace)

1122
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:24,735
(Meanwhile, the youngest is immersed in something.)

1123
00:41:26,265 --> 00:41:28,605
Brother Yeong Seok, I'm sorry.

1124
00:41:28,805 --> 00:41:30,434
(A sound that disrupts the calm)

1125
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:31,835
What is this?

1126
00:41:32,435 --> 00:41:34,374
- She's using AI.
- With AI...

1127
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:35,575
(Nice)

1128
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:39,275
(An Yu Genius found a new and creative way.)

1129
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,315
- That startled me.
- It's frustrating.

1130
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:43,815
- What?
- I'm sorry. It's frustrating.

1131
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:45,115
Did you say something's urgent?

1132
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:46,515
- I'm sorry.
- Shush. It's frustrating.

1133
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:48,954
- It's frustrating?
- It's frustrating.

1134
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:50,285
(Even when they talk through AI, they talk at the same time.)

1135
00:41:50,895 --> 00:41:52,025
Hi, Yu Jin.

1136
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,925
Hi.

1137
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:55,494
Hi, Yu Jin.

1138
00:41:55,495 --> 00:41:56,594
(They're talking even more.)

1139
00:41:56,595 --> 00:41:58,835
- They're louder.
- This is bugging me even more.

1140
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:01,765
(Laughing through AI)

1141
00:42:01,865 --> 00:42:02,964
Gosh, seriously...

1142
00:42:02,965 --> 00:42:05,034
(They're moving further away from the original intention.)

1143
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:07,345
Gosh, you guys are so annoying.

1144
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:08,705
- Please.
- What?

1145
00:42:09,805 --> 00:42:12,875
We're almost there. Let's enjoy some peace and silence.

1146
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:15,615
- It got 2.2 million views.
- That's amazing.

1147
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:17,485
How is this possible?

1148
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:18,485
(It's been 38 minutes and the video is already at 2.2 million views.)

1149
00:42:18,785 --> 00:42:20,155
Thank you.

1150
00:42:21,785 --> 00:42:22,855
No problem.

1151
00:42:23,555 --> 00:42:24,755
I'm sorry.

1152
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:27,225
Papago is difficult.

1153
00:42:27,895 --> 00:42:29,195
Are you dumb?

1154
00:42:29,295 --> 00:42:30,734
(Laughing)

1155
00:42:30,735 --> 00:42:32,294
(Yu Jin: You guys are stupid.)

1156
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:35,005
(She's making fun of the E-caders through AI.)

1157
00:42:35,165 --> 00:42:37,035
They've found new ways.

1158
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:40,444
(It seems like they've quieted down.)

1159
00:42:40,445 --> 00:42:41,445
I'm hungry.

1160
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:43,675
I'm hungry.

1161
00:42:45,075 --> 00:42:46,845
- Wait.
- Yu Jin.

1162
00:42:48,815 --> 00:42:51,885
"Wait." Why did it pronounce it like that?

1163
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:53,615
All right, we're here.

1164
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:55,655
Let's get out of the car.

1165
00:42:55,725 --> 00:42:57,595
Your faces are all blank since you're not talking.

1166
00:42:58,725 --> 00:43:01,465
(The E-caders will soon be smiling once again at...)

1167
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,495
(this last restaurant in Lisbon.)

1168
00:43:05,235 --> 00:43:07,305
(This restaurant is trending among Millennials and Gen Z of Lisbon.)

1169
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:10,905
(It has a hipster European vibe.)

1170
00:43:12,835 --> 00:43:15,174
(The vibes and food are both perfect...)

1171
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,345
(at this social media-famous spot.)

1172
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:19,945
(These are bite-sized pieces of crispy, sweet, and savory chicken.)

1173
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:21,645
(Chicken lollipops)

1174
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:24,555
(A combination of aromatic basil and creamy spinach)

1175
00:43:24,655 --> 00:43:26,615
(Basil and spinach pasta)

1176
00:43:27,425 --> 00:43:29,425
(Crispy battered calamari with a deep, savory flavor)

1177
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:31,425
(Calamari)

1178
00:43:31,925 --> 00:43:35,625
(Casual dining with a modern twist on traditional Portuguese cuisine)

1179
00:43:36,095 --> 00:43:38,365
(Welcome)

1180
00:43:38,735 --> 00:43:39,764
(They quietly enter the restaurant.)

1181
00:43:39,765 --> 00:43:40,765
You can sit over there.

1182
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:41,765
Thank you.

1183
00:43:42,535 --> 00:43:44,104
Let's all share the plates.

1184
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:45,105
(Sounds great)

1185
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,545
(Their pre-ordered dishes are served.)

1186
00:43:47,775 --> 00:43:49,145
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1187
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:51,844
(They never forget to say thank you.)

1188
00:43:51,845 --> 00:43:52,845
Thank you.

1189
00:43:52,845 --> 00:43:53,845
Thank you for the food.

1190
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:55,215
(Shush)

1191
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,484
(Right)

1192
00:43:56,485 --> 00:43:58,054
(For the first time in Earth Arcade, we're having a quiet meal.)

1193
00:43:58,055 --> 00:43:59,215
(Please enjoy it with us.)

1194
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:00,525
Thank you for the food.

1195
00:44:00,825 --> 00:44:02,325
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1196
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:06,625
(The sound of Eun Ji serving the salad to Yu Jin)

1197
00:44:07,265 --> 00:44:10,935
(The sound of Mimi passing around straws)

1198
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:13,635
(The sound of Young Ji recommending a good dish)

1199
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:16,935
(The sound of Yu Jin expressing appreciation)

1200
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:21,505
(When something tastes good, Young Ji's nostrils flare.)

1201
00:44:24,145 --> 00:44:26,675
(Yu Jin's eyes and mouth go wide.)

1202
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:31,615
(Eun Ji's brows draw together with her genuine emotion.)

1203
00:44:32,815 --> 00:44:35,685
(Mimi just enjoys the food.)

1204
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:40,255
(We can get to know each other better in silence.)

1205
00:44:40,795 --> 00:44:45,234
(Only the sound of slurping noodles and chewing breaks the silence.)

1206
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:47,435
(Crunch)

1207
00:44:47,635 --> 00:44:50,404
(Involuntary ASMR)

1208
00:44:50,405 --> 00:44:53,035
Come to think of it, we rented the whole restaurant.

1209
00:44:53,675 --> 00:44:56,705
For just ten seconds, tell me what you think of the food.

1210
00:44:58,645 --> 00:44:59,675
No.

1211
00:45:00,445 --> 00:45:01,445
She said "No."

1212
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:02,445
(At times like these, Yu Jin sticks to the rules.)

1213
00:45:03,515 --> 00:45:06,215
The tomato and avocado go really well together.

1214
00:45:06,315 --> 00:45:09,325
I've never had this sauce before and it's good.

1215
00:45:09,425 --> 00:45:11,654
Thank you.

1216
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:13,755
(The eldest member is the only one concerned about the show.)

1217
00:45:13,965 --> 00:45:16,125
(Even Yu Jin is typing something enthusiastically.)

1218
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:19,035
(The chicken lollipops taste like Korean soy sauce fried chicken, )

1219
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:22,305
(but the sauce tastes like Greek yogurt, which is new.)

1220
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:24,335
Thank you.

1221
00:45:24,775 --> 00:45:25,934
(Yeong Seok approaches Young Ji next.)

1222
00:45:25,935 --> 00:45:26,935
One more.

1223
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:28,445
(Clean)

1224
00:45:28,445 --> 00:45:29,445
One more?

1225
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:34,685
(They return to eating elegantly.)

1226
00:45:35,085 --> 00:45:36,815
(Sighing)

1227
00:45:37,655 --> 00:45:39,815
(Sighing too)

1228
00:45:40,415 --> 00:45:46,025
(Meanwhile, in one corner, a group is deep in lively conversation.)

1229
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:48,965
(Gosh, they're hurting my ears.)

1230
00:45:49,295 --> 00:45:51,695
(She's being grumpy because she's jealous.)

1231
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:53,835
(Typing)

1232
00:45:54,005 --> 00:45:56,665
Don't you feel a bit disappointed that we're not talking?

1233
00:45:57,235 --> 00:46:00,004
No, this is perfect.

1234
00:46:00,005 --> 00:46:01,045
This is perfect.

1235
00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:03,775
Noted.

1236
00:46:04,815 --> 00:46:07,214
(Her concern was pointless.)

1237
00:46:07,215 --> 00:46:08,244
Did that get to you?

1238
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:10,045
(That did get to her.)

1239
00:46:10,515 --> 00:46:11,515
What are they up to?

1240
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:12,515
(It seems like the youngest has something to say.)

1241
00:46:12,555 --> 00:46:14,625
Who made this?

1242
00:46:15,325 --> 00:46:18,555
(Getting into gear)

1243
00:46:18,795 --> 00:46:20,895
(All right, I'm jumping in.)

1244
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:23,525
This is sexy food.

1245
00:46:23,925 --> 00:46:27,035
(They're getting further away from vocal detox.)

1246
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:28,665
Slurp.

1247
00:46:28,735 --> 00:46:29,735
(Laughing out loud)

1248
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:30,805
(Shaking with laughter)

1249
00:46:30,975 --> 00:46:33,175
(They're practically talking at this point.)

1250
00:46:33,275 --> 00:46:34,545
What do you mean by "slurb?"

1251
00:46:35,205 --> 00:46:37,615
(Why did you laugh when you don't know what she said?)

1252
00:46:37,775 --> 00:46:38,775
It's an interjection.

1253
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:40,445
(I see.)

1254
00:46:40,645 --> 00:46:43,314
(Finally, desserts are served.)

1255
00:46:43,315 --> 00:46:44,455
Cookies and cream.

1256
00:46:45,985 --> 00:46:47,855
(Cookies and cream gelato)

1257
00:46:48,255 --> 00:46:50,625
(A combination of creamy milk and sweet cookies)

1258
00:46:51,495 --> 00:46:54,025
(The Dessert Captain takes the first bite.)

1259
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:56,665
(Yum)

1260
00:46:57,595 --> 00:47:00,535
(Once the taste has been verified, Yu Jin takes a bite as well.)

1261
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:04,835
The demon of desserts, the authority on desserts, the dessert overlord.

1262
00:47:05,775 --> 00:47:08,545
(She uses AI to compliment the dish.)

1263
00:47:09,145 --> 00:47:11,645
(Right then, Young Ji gets startled by something.)

1264
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:15,615
(3.56 million views and 299 days of watch time within 1 hour)

1265
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:18,555
It's been 1 hour and the video got 3.5 million views.

1266
00:47:20,615 --> 00:47:21,984
(The demon of challenges, the authority on challenges, )

1267
00:47:21,985 --> 00:47:23,355
(the challenge overlord.)

1268
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:25,555
Thank you so much, everyone.

1269
00:47:27,425 --> 00:47:28,595
You did a great job.

1270
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,735
I'm going to unsubscribe from "Channel Fullmoon."

1271
00:47:34,135 --> 00:47:36,865
(In anger, she decides to get revenge.)

1272
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:40,235
When you're done eating, you can return your phones and talk.

1273
00:47:40,975 --> 00:47:42,644
(Young Ji is the first to hand in her phone.)

1274
00:47:42,645 --> 00:47:45,315
- Phone received.
- I feel so wronged.

1275
00:47:45,545 --> 00:47:47,214
It's not that you didn't prove yourself.

1276
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:49,385
Take her phone, please.

1277
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:51,554
(Mouth Detox is over.)

1278
00:47:51,555 --> 00:47:53,414
(Digital Detox begins. It will go on for 18 hours.)

1279
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:54,424
(They leave Lisbon...)

1280
00:47:54,425 --> 00:47:56,625
(and are on their way to Albufeira.)

1281
00:47:56,925 --> 00:47:59,324
My hands do feel much lighter without my phone.

1282
00:47:59,325 --> 00:48:00,325
Yes, it's nice.

1283
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,294
- A MacBook.
- I brought our laptop.

1284
00:48:03,295 --> 00:48:04,364
Can we use our laptop?

1285
00:48:04,365 --> 00:48:05,595
- Can we use our laptop?
- Of course.

1286
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:08,335
You can use anything aside from your phones.

1287
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:09,605
Let's play music.

1288
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:11,735
(As soon as they're given the laptop, )

1289
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:13,504
Let's watch "Hospital Playlist."

1290
00:48:13,505 --> 00:48:14,604
(a familiar tune fills the car.)

1291
00:48:14,605 --> 00:48:16,445
No, I have to watch "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

1292
00:48:17,275 --> 00:48:18,945
There's a 10-minute summary video up to Episode 16.

1293
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:20,674
Can we watch a full series binge-watch video?

1294
00:48:20,675 --> 00:48:21,785
- Sure.
- A full series binge-watch video.

1295
00:48:22,115 --> 00:48:25,255
(They're now binge-watching "I'm Sorry, I Love You.")

1296
00:48:26,015 --> 00:48:29,054
(The two younger members are instantly immersed.)

1297
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:31,324
(And so is Yeong Seok.)

1298
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,624
From behind, Producer Na looks genuinely interested.

1299
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:35,964
He's very interested.

1300
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:37,195
He's focused.

1301
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:38,894
(The show grew on Brother Yeong Seok.)

1302
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:40,495
(Serious)

1303
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:43,265
(They finished Episode 1 in no time.)

1304
00:48:43,565 --> 00:48:46,675
- What?
- Where's Episode 2?

1305
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:48,574
- Where's Episode 2? Here it is.
- Gosh.

1306
00:48:48,575 --> 00:48:50,204
That scared me. Here's Episode 2.

1307
00:48:50,205 --> 00:48:52,175
Gosh, it was hidden. That scared me.

1308
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:53,445
(Short laugh)

1309
00:48:53,446 --> 00:48:54,945
(Laughing)

1310
00:48:55,585 --> 00:48:57,855
(Amazed)

1311
00:48:59,185 --> 00:49:00,185
What's with the hat?

1312
00:49:00,555 --> 00:49:02,725
(The passengers in the back are slowly dozing off.)

1313
00:49:03,055 --> 00:49:04,124
(The passengers in the front are glued to the screen.)

1314
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,125
Goodness.

1315
00:49:06,225 --> 00:49:08,995
(Binge-watching "I'm Sorry, I Love You.")

1316
00:49:10,225 --> 00:49:14,335
(They don't even notice the change of scenery.)

1317
00:49:14,435 --> 00:49:15,435
Goodness.

1318
00:49:16,505 --> 00:49:18,334
(Gasp)

1319
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,175
(Things really escalate quickly in the second half of the series.)

1320
00:49:21,805 --> 00:49:23,574
(They've been watching...)

1321
00:49:23,575 --> 00:49:25,315
("I'm Sorry, I Love You" for 3 hours.)

1322
00:49:25,675 --> 00:49:26,675
(The drive was 3 hours.)

1323
00:49:26,676 --> 00:49:28,184
(They arrived at Albufeira.)

1324
00:49:28,185 --> 00:49:29,644
- Let's watch Episode 7.
- No.

1325
00:49:29,645 --> 00:49:30,814
Turn it off.

1326
00:49:30,815 --> 00:49:33,815
We have to film our arrival.

1327
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:37,385
This is the most famous vacation spot in southern Portugal.

1328
00:49:37,495 --> 00:49:39,254
- Albufeira.
- Albufeira.

1329
00:49:39,255 --> 00:49:40,894
- Albufeira.
- We're almost there, right?

1330
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:43,394
We'll stop by the observation deck and head to our accommodation.

1331
00:49:43,395 --> 00:49:44,595
(We'll stop by the observation deck and head to our accommodation!)

1332
00:49:45,595 --> 00:49:46,595
This is insane.

1333
00:49:46,596 --> 00:49:47,935
(Gasp)

1334
00:49:48,005 --> 00:49:50,465
- Goodness.
- This is amazing.

1335
00:49:51,005 --> 00:49:52,775
This is insane. It's like we're in a painting.

1336
00:49:53,605 --> 00:49:55,305
Gosh, the sun is so bright.

1337
00:49:56,205 --> 00:49:57,945
This is beautiful.

1338
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:00,044
Even the sand is a different color.

1339
00:50:00,045 --> 00:50:01,215
- Look at that.
- It's darker.

1340
00:50:02,485 --> 00:50:05,315
(Albufeira)

1341
00:50:05,915 --> 00:50:08,955
(The hidden pearl of southern Portugal)

1342
00:50:09,855 --> 00:50:13,854
(The emerald green sea...)

1343
00:50:13,855 --> 00:50:17,225
(and breathtaking cliffside views come together in perfect harmony...)

1344
00:50:17,965 --> 00:50:21,605
(as a paradise for travelers.)

1345
00:50:22,735 --> 00:50:24,035
(Old Town)

1346
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:29,575
(One of the world's top 10 caves and Mother Nature's masterpiece, )

1347
00:50:29,675 --> 00:50:34,945
(the Benagil Caves)

1348
00:50:35,685 --> 00:50:37,915
(There's a winery too.)

1349
00:50:38,355 --> 00:50:42,885
(Travelers immerse themselves in nature with daytime activities.)

1350
00:50:43,555 --> 00:50:48,625
(At night, they bask in the romance of the waves' gentle melody.)

1351
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:54,405
(A city of culinary treasures on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean)

1352
00:50:54,765 --> 00:50:57,135
(Welcome to Albufeira.)

1353
00:50:57,265 --> 00:51:00,945
- Albufeira.
- Albufeira.

1354
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:02,205
Parrot Mim.

1355
00:51:03,405 --> 00:51:04,575
Yes, Princess.

1356
00:51:07,045 --> 00:51:08,684
- The color of the sea is...
- It's different.

1357
00:51:08,685 --> 00:51:11,854
- It's so clear.
- And the color is darker overall.

1358
00:51:11,855 --> 00:51:13,385
I want to live here.

1359
00:51:14,185 --> 00:51:15,784
- Gosh.
- I want to live here.

1360
00:51:15,785 --> 00:51:16,854
Yu Jin, you stay here.

1361
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:18,755
- I'm going home.
- This is so nice.

1362
00:51:20,825 --> 00:51:23,594
(The refreshing sea...)

1363
00:51:23,595 --> 00:51:26,265
(and the golden beach)

1364
00:51:26,865 --> 00:51:30,135
(The E-caders are in the best mood from the vacation vibe.)

1365
00:51:30,735 --> 00:51:32,405
Our driver is so cool.

1366
00:51:33,035 --> 00:51:34,035
He's so cool.

1367
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:37,205
- This place is beautiful.
- Right.

1368
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:41,145
I'm so excited.

1369
00:51:42,215 --> 00:51:44,385
On our right is a cliff.

1370
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:47,554
The beach stretches along that cliff...

1371
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:49,184
and there are accommodations along that.

1372
00:51:49,185 --> 00:51:50,455
This is insane.

1373
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:55,294
(Accommodations in Albufeira are gathered along the beach.)

1374
00:51:55,295 --> 00:51:58,065
On your left is where we'll be staying.

1375
00:51:59,195 --> 00:52:00,334
(The E-cade accommodation is one of them.)

1376
00:52:00,335 --> 00:52:01,365
Amazing.

1377
00:52:02,065 --> 00:52:03,164
That's it.

1378
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:04,405
Chang Dae is right there.

1379
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:06,774
This place feels like LA.

1380
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:07,945
I love this.

1381
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:09,675
(Amazed)

1382
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:11,175
(In awe)

1383
00:52:11,275 --> 00:52:14,074
There are bikes.

1384
00:52:14,075 --> 00:52:15,685
- Let's go biking.
- Let's go biking.

1385
00:52:18,115 --> 00:52:20,315
(An infinity pool reminiscent of the ocean)

1386
00:52:21,325 --> 00:52:23,525
(The Jade Emperor never forgets a favor, so he went all out...)

1387
00:52:24,255 --> 00:52:25,994
(and rented a 2-story private pool villa for them.)

1388
00:52:25,995 --> 00:52:27,195
This is so nice.

1389
00:52:28,025 --> 00:52:29,325
Gosh.

1390
00:52:29,725 --> 00:52:31,164
- Goodness.
- It's so nice.

1391
00:52:31,165 --> 00:52:32,265
(Excited)

1392
00:52:32,395 --> 00:52:33,464
- This is so nice.
- This is amazing.

1393
00:52:33,465 --> 00:52:35,364
Thank you, Jade Emperor.

1394
00:52:35,365 --> 00:52:36,705
Gosh, there's a pool.

1395
00:52:36,965 --> 00:52:38,234
It looks perfect for a swim.

1396
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:40,105
I dare you to dive in right now.

1397
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:43,605
(The pool stays ready.)

1398
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:44,845
Let's go check out the rooms.

1399
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,475
Come on.

1400
00:52:47,175 --> 00:52:48,544
(Gasp)

1401
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:49,585
This is insane.

1402
00:52:50,185 --> 00:52:51,615
This place is so nice. There's a living room.

1403
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:53,114
What is that?

1404
00:52:53,115 --> 00:52:54,724
- I can't believe this.
- Gosh, what is that?

1405
00:52:54,725 --> 00:52:56,484
- Is that for fire-gazing?
- It's a stove.

1406
00:52:56,485 --> 00:52:58,325
Thank you so much, Jade Emperor.

1407
00:52:58,395 --> 00:53:00,194
I saw something like this in Abu Dhabi.

1408
00:53:00,195 --> 00:53:02,224
That's right. Those are expensive.

1409
00:53:02,225 --> 00:53:03,324
(A couch...)

1410
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:04,895
(this long fits nicely...)

1411
00:53:05,465 --> 00:53:08,005
(in this spacious living room, also known as the game zone.)

1412
00:53:08,865 --> 00:53:09,935
(Next to the living room...)

1413
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:11,974
I see fruits.

1414
00:53:11,975 --> 00:53:13,605
(is a kitchen perfect for the E-caders who are always hungry.)

1415
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:16,504
There's a full-length mirror here.

1416
00:53:16,505 --> 00:53:17,874
I want to see.

1417
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:19,245
(At the sight of a mirror, Mimi instinctively strikes a pose.)

1418
00:53:19,475 --> 00:53:20,475
- Okay.
- Okay.

1419
00:53:20,476 --> 00:53:22,184
- Let's go.
- Parrot Mim.

1420
00:53:22,185 --> 00:53:24,414
- Princess Eun Ji.
- Parrot Mim.

1421
00:53:24,415 --> 00:53:26,114
Princess Eun Ji, let's go upstairs together.

1422
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:27,855
(At the top of the stairs, )

1423
00:53:29,055 --> 00:53:31,055
(an inner door comes into view.)

1424
00:53:31,325 --> 00:53:33,524
- This is amazing.
- There's a living room.

1425
00:53:33,525 --> 00:53:35,125
There's a living room.

1426
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:37,595
(The mini living room has plenty of natural light.)

1427
00:53:37,695 --> 00:53:39,095
(This will be the main living space for the E-caders.)

1428
00:53:39,195 --> 00:53:41,234
- Gosh.
- Look, there's a hot tub.

1429
00:53:41,235 --> 00:53:42,235
Is this it?

1430
00:53:42,835 --> 00:53:44,604
- Hot tub.
- This place is perfect.

1431
00:53:44,605 --> 00:53:45,874
- Hot tub.
- This is awesome.

1432
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:47,075
It's like paradise.

1433
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:49,074
- This is incredible.
- This is insane.

1434
00:53:49,075 --> 00:53:50,145
Eun Ji.

1435
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,045
We have to go inside right now.

1436
00:53:53,275 --> 00:53:56,485
I love it here.

1437
00:53:56,615 --> 00:53:59,984
- Thank you, Jade Emperor.
- Thank you, Jade Emperor.

1438
00:53:59,985 --> 00:54:01,325
Jade Emperor,

1439
00:54:02,025 --> 00:54:04,155
- you're the best.
- It's so bright here.

1440
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:06,724
(Check-in at Albufeira is complete.)

1441
00:54:06,725 --> 00:54:08,464
I don't even need my phone. This place is awesome.

1442
00:54:08,465 --> 00:54:09,794
No, I need my phone.

1443
00:54:09,795 --> 00:54:11,534
- No, you don't.
- I need my phone.

1444
00:54:11,535 --> 00:54:13,765
- You honestly don't.
- Yes, I do.

1445
00:54:14,905 --> 00:54:17,235
This is a smart TV.

1446
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:18,934
(Move.)

1447
00:54:18,935 --> 00:54:19,935
I hear there's Netflix.

1448
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:21,374
What episode of "I'm Sorry, I Love You" are you on?

1449
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:22,945
- We have to start Episode 7.
- Okay.

1450
00:54:23,145 --> 00:54:24,174
This is perfect.

1451
00:54:24,175 --> 00:54:26,515
The sun is too bright, though.

1452
00:54:26,645 --> 00:54:28,314
- I want to watch too.
- Let's watch together.

1453
00:54:28,315 --> 00:54:30,285
Gosh, this is nice. It has YouTube too?

1454
00:54:30,585 --> 00:54:31,984
This isn't Digital Detox.

1455
00:54:31,985 --> 00:54:33,684
"I'm Sorry, I Love You."

1456
00:54:33,685 --> 00:54:34,985
- Binge-watching.
- Ten-minute summaries.

1457
00:54:35,585 --> 00:54:37,125
(They play a video right away.)

1458
00:54:37,325 --> 00:54:39,225
(Group watching mode)

1459
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:40,795
They're kissing again?

1460
00:54:41,265 --> 00:54:43,394
(Dramas back then used to have a lot of unexpected kissing scenes.)

1461
00:54:43,395 --> 00:54:45,664
(Footage provided by KBS)

1462
00:54:45,665 --> 00:54:48,305
(And they always took place inside elevators.)

1463
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,335
(Gasp)

1464
00:54:50,505 --> 00:54:51,674
(It's one of those shows where knowing the plot...)

1465
00:54:51,675 --> 00:54:52,875
(doesn't make it any less fun.)

1466
00:54:53,105 --> 00:54:54,305
(Glancing over)

1467
00:54:54,435 --> 00:54:55,905
(Here comes Choi Yoon.)

1468
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:58,345
(He spots his girlfriend with a man he's never seen before.)

1469
00:54:58,515 --> 00:54:59,915
(Open the door.)

1470
00:55:00,745 --> 00:55:01,985
(Bothered by his loud voice)

1471
00:55:02,745 --> 00:55:03,985
(Playing music)

1472
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:06,555
(Open the door!)

1473
00:55:06,685 --> 00:55:09,725
(Laughing)

1474
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:12,655
Him playing music is hilarious.

1475
00:55:14,325 --> 00:55:15,564
Open the door!

1476
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:16,565
(Young people these days don't understand the mood.)

1477
00:55:16,565 --> 00:55:17,565
It's raining.

1478
00:55:17,566 --> 00:55:18,794
- What is he doing?
- He's lost it.

1479
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:21,265
Gosh, Yoon.

1480
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:24,435
(Back in the day, they used to have these iconic rain scenes.)

1481
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:28,005
(He gets in his car and starts driving in the heavy rain.)

1482
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:31,445
(The car starts swerving.)

1483
00:55:33,275 --> 00:55:35,745
(Falling into the water)

1484
00:55:36,285 --> 00:55:38,015
He could have hit the brakes.

1485
00:55:39,255 --> 00:55:41,355
He shouldn't be driving.

1486
00:55:41,825 --> 00:55:44,385
(Neither of them has a driver's license.)

1487
00:55:45,255 --> 00:55:47,254
- His father.
- Right, that's his son.

1488
00:55:47,255 --> 00:55:48,465
(The E-caders are completely immersed.)

1489
00:55:48,665 --> 00:55:50,625
(The thing is, )

1490
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:54,035
(the sunsets in Albufeira are absolutely stunning.)

1491
00:55:54,295 --> 00:55:55,504
(The pool villa where the E-caders are staying...)

1492
00:55:55,505 --> 00:55:56,905
(is especially perfect to watch the sunset.)

1493
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:01,174
(Even as the pink twilight sky...)

1494
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:03,505
(settles over the village, )

1495
00:56:04,005 --> 00:56:05,715
Is that the context?

1496
00:56:06,615 --> 00:56:08,514
- That's so touching.
- Right.

1497
00:56:08,515 --> 00:56:10,315
(the E-caders have no intention of stepping outside.)

1498
00:56:10,545 --> 00:56:11,584
- Guys.
- What is it?

1499
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:13,015
Where are we?

1500
00:56:13,215 --> 00:56:14,955
- Where are we?
- "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

1501
00:56:16,025 --> 00:56:17,224
We came all the way to Albufeira...

1502
00:56:17,225 --> 00:56:18,455
and you're just watching "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

1503
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:21,124
There's a drone camera waiting for you outside.

1504
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:22,294
Go take a look at the sunset.

1505
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,265
- Let's go watch the sunset.
- Gosh, so beautiful.

1506
00:56:31,575 --> 00:56:32,874
- It's so pretty.
- This is breathtaking.

1507
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:34,945
(It actually feels good to be outside.)

1508
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:37,005
It's beautiful.

1509
00:56:37,475 --> 00:56:39,415
- This is amazing.
- I can't believe this.

1510
00:56:40,175 --> 00:56:42,085
- Look at that.
- How stunning.

1511
00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:44,244
(They would have regretted it if they missed this view.)

1512
00:56:44,245 --> 00:56:45,715
I want to live here with my dog.

1513
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:48,285
(They return to the couch in no time.)

1514
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:49,925
So are we going to stop watching "I'm Sorry, I Love You?"

1515
00:56:50,385 --> 00:56:52,895
- Is it over?
- Have we come back to reality?

1516
00:56:53,155 --> 00:56:55,395
(There's no way.)

1517
00:56:55,725 --> 00:56:57,624
(In the following episodes, )

1518
00:56:57,625 --> 00:57:00,194
(Footage provided by KBS)

1519
00:57:00,195 --> 00:57:02,335
(Moo Hyeok doesn't have much time left to live.)

1520
00:57:02,865 --> 00:57:04,065
Why does he have to die?

1521
00:57:05,075 --> 00:57:06,635
Did he go to the hospital by himself?

1522
00:57:06,975 --> 00:57:08,345
(A deceased person)

1523
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:13,145
(Fingers lightly touching)

1524
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:15,415
That means he is nearing death.

1525
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:18,214
(The "I'm Sorry, I Love You" commentator has returned.)

1526
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:19,584
Why are you providing commentary?

1527
00:57:19,585 --> 00:57:20,914
He's so cool.

1528
00:57:20,915 --> 00:57:22,085
(You're making this even more sad.)

1529
00:57:22,425 --> 00:57:23,655
(Groaning from sadness)

1530
00:57:24,355 --> 00:57:26,424
Young Ji, look at my eyes.

1531
00:57:26,425 --> 00:57:27,454
Gosh.

1532
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:28,564
(Wet with tears)

1533
00:57:28,565 --> 00:57:29,595
Are you crying?

1534
00:57:29,965 --> 00:57:31,095
This drama is insane.

1535
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:33,035
She said, "This drama is insane."

1536
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:35,334
(Meanwhile, Choi Yoon developed heart problems...)

1537
00:57:35,335 --> 00:57:36,635
(due to the car accident.)

1538
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,874
I think Lim Soo Jung...

1539
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:41,175
decided to stay by Yoon's side.

1540
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:43,374
Because he's dying?

1541
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:44,875
She doesn't know Cha Moo Hyeok is dying too, right?

1542
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:48,385
(Sighing)

1543
00:57:48,585 --> 00:57:50,844
(I'll take my heart out...)

1544
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:52,785
(and give it to Yoon.)

1545
00:57:53,885 --> 00:57:55,454
(Moo Hyeok is willing to risk his life...)

1546
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,124
(to win Eun Chae's heart.)

1547
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,125
(Don't joke around about life!)

1548
00:57:59,455 --> 00:58:01,795
- Karma will get you for that.
- She thinks he's joking.

1549
00:58:02,925 --> 00:58:04,065
This is so annoying.

1550
00:58:04,695 --> 00:58:06,195
(Eun Chae, that's not what he's doing.)

1551
00:58:06,435 --> 00:58:07,795
(How long did you say you have left?)

1552
00:58:08,135 --> 00:58:10,864
(Eun Chae goes as far as saying cruel words at Moo Hyeok.)

1553
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:12,075
She's out of her mind.

1554
00:58:13,205 --> 00:58:15,245
(I told you not to mention Yoon to me.)

1555
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:18,775
(Eun Chae's thoughts are filled with only Yoon until the very end.)

1556
00:58:19,215 --> 00:58:20,875
(I told you not to mention him!)

1557
00:58:21,315 --> 00:58:23,215
(Hurt)

1558
00:58:23,885 --> 00:58:27,355
(In the end, Moo Hyeok takes off by himself.)

1559
00:58:27,655 --> 00:58:29,755
(Sad)

1560
00:58:29,955 --> 00:58:31,495
I'm so sad.

1561
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,024
What's wrong with her?

1562
00:58:33,025 --> 00:58:34,124
(Laughing)

1563
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:36,225
- You're so funny.
- Are you crying, Yu Jin?

1564
00:58:36,665 --> 00:58:37,824
Yu Jin's crying again.

1565
00:58:37,825 --> 00:58:39,934
- This is so frustrating.
- Sit down, Young Ji. It's cold.

1566
00:58:39,935 --> 00:58:40,965
Gosh.

1567
00:58:41,235 --> 00:58:43,004
This is so frustrating. I can't stand it.

1568
00:58:43,005 --> 00:58:44,235
What's wrong with her?

1569
00:58:44,705 --> 00:58:48,005
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1570
00:58:48,105 --> 00:58:49,175
It's okay.

1571
00:58:49,675 --> 00:58:51,245
Yu Jin.

1572
00:58:51,515 --> 00:58:53,245
Do something.

1573
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:54,945
- Hey.
- Yu Jin.

1574
00:58:55,315 --> 00:58:56,415
Get up.

1575
00:58:56,585 --> 00:58:57,914
- I feel so bad for him.
- It's because this is Episode 11.

1576
00:58:57,915 --> 00:59:00,054
- It's the saddest episode.
- Episode 11 is sad.

1577
00:59:00,055 --> 00:59:01,055
Yu Jin.

1578
00:59:01,655 --> 00:59:04,155
- Your tears.
- I feel so sorry for him.

1579
00:59:05,895 --> 00:59:07,125
I know.

1580
00:59:07,225 --> 00:59:08,825
(Stop crying.)

1581
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:13,235
(Are you done crying now? Let's continue where we left off.)

1582
00:59:13,665 --> 00:59:15,565
It's so soft and nice.

1583
00:59:17,865 --> 00:59:19,405
Fleece is totally in these days.

1584
00:59:20,005 --> 00:59:21,075
That figures.

1585
00:59:27,715 --> 00:59:30,345
(They're ready for a cozy vacation!)

1586
00:59:30,515 --> 00:59:31,954
(Dinner time)

1587
00:59:31,955 --> 00:59:33,985
- Let's go.
- Come downstairs.

1588
00:59:34,085 --> 00:59:36,125
- North and Central America.
- North and Central America.

1589
00:59:36,455 --> 00:59:38,354
- North and Central America.
- North and Central America.

1590
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:39,624
- The US.
- The US.

1591
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:40,954
- Canada.
- Canada.

1592
00:59:40,955 --> 00:59:43,194
- Mexico.
- Mexico.

1593
00:59:43,195 --> 00:59:44,394
We can do it!

1594
00:59:44,395 --> 00:59:45,594
- We can do it!
- We can do it!

1595
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:47,934
(They make a boisterous entrance...)

1596
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:49,965
(declaring their intention to have dinner.)

1597
00:59:50,105 --> 00:59:51,705
Was all of that necessary?

1598
00:59:52,105 --> 00:59:53,204
- Akh.
- We've been waiting for ages,

1599
00:59:53,205 --> 00:59:54,205
- Producer Na.
- Akh.

1600
00:59:54,206 --> 00:59:56,205
All right, thanks for your patience. It's now dinner time again.

1601
00:59:56,275 --> 00:59:57,405
(Applauding)

1602
00:59:57,645 --> 00:59:58,675
(Young Ji spots something.)

1603
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,174
- Right. A speaker.
- There's a Bluetooth speaker.

1604
01:00:00,175 --> 01:00:01,884
You can probably tell from this.

1605
01:00:01,885 --> 01:00:03,314
What do you think we're about to do, Young Ji?

1606
01:00:03,315 --> 01:00:05,215
- Random Play Dance.
- Yes.

1607
01:00:05,715 --> 01:00:08,855
(It's been 3 years since the E-caders first met.)

1608
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:13,495
(You all have dance DNA within you.)

1609
01:00:15,925 --> 01:00:17,294
My heart fluttered a little

1610
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:19,665
Head. Shoulders. Legs.

1611
01:00:20,165 --> 01:00:21,364
I'm a new thing Everything I own is new

1612
01:00:21,365 --> 01:00:22,365
This way?

1613
01:00:26,775 --> 01:00:32,475
(It's the first and signature game of Earth Arcade.)

1614
01:00:32,745 --> 01:00:33,945
Why are you leaving me?

1615
01:00:34,675 --> 01:00:36,985
(And...)

1616
01:00:40,255 --> 01:00:43,085
(Let's begin Season 3's Random Play Dance.)

1617
01:00:43,225 --> 01:00:44,654
We didn't play this in Lisbon because we were afraid...

1618
01:00:44,655 --> 01:00:47,425
the cops might show up from all the noise.

1619
01:00:47,725 --> 01:00:49,525
- We don't have any neighbors here, - All right.

1620
01:00:49,595 --> 01:00:51,835
So you can be as loud as you want.

1621
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,394
(There is no one else...)

1622
01:00:53,395 --> 01:00:55,235
(staying near their accommodation.)

1623
01:00:55,535 --> 01:00:58,974
(Pro: We can be loud.)

1624
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:00,874
Meals are not included in our stay here.

1625
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:02,244
(Con: There aren't any restaurants nearby.)

1626
01:01:02,245 --> 01:01:03,274
I see.

1627
01:01:03,275 --> 01:01:05,675
There are franchise restaurants close by.

1628
01:01:06,445 --> 01:01:07,475
Fast food chains.

1629
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:10,544
- Nice.
- So we ordered delivery.

1630
01:01:10,545 --> 01:01:12,815
Thank you.

1631
01:01:13,115 --> 01:01:15,455
(Albufeira is a destination visited by people from around the world.)

1632
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:18,425
(All the popular franchise restaurants are here.)

1633
01:01:18,695 --> 01:01:21,425
(And, of course, they deliver.)

1634
01:01:21,695 --> 01:01:24,264
(They made last-minute orders and quickly got deliveries from...)

1635
01:01:24,265 --> 01:01:26,895
(local spots of familiar fast food franchises.)

1636
01:01:27,035 --> 01:01:28,635
(McDonald's)

1637
01:01:28,835 --> 01:01:30,065
(Burger King)

1638
01:01:30,305 --> 01:01:31,605
(Subway)

1639
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:32,905
(Taco Bell)

1640
01:01:33,035 --> 01:01:35,275
(Ramyeon specialist and writer Choi Jae Yeong is also...)

1641
01:01:36,045 --> 01:01:39,974
(on standby to make them Korean fast food.)

1642
01:01:39,975 --> 01:01:41,444
We called all the franchises that were open for delivery.

1643
01:01:41,445 --> 01:01:43,644
We ordered them all. We'll bet one on each,

1644
01:01:43,645 --> 01:01:45,714
- and do the Random Play Dance.
- Okay.

1645
01:01:45,715 --> 01:01:47,954
If you succeed, you get to keep the food.

1646
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:49,354
If you fail, we'll take them out instantly.

1647
01:01:49,355 --> 01:01:50,355
- Yes.
- Okay.

1648
01:01:50,356 --> 01:01:51,955
(Random Play Dance)

1649
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,924
You pick out a song.

1650
01:01:53,925 --> 01:01:55,565
It's "APT" by Rose.

1651
01:01:55,925 --> 01:01:58,735
(Be mindful of noise between floors in apartments.)

1652
01:01:58,835 --> 01:02:02,305
(If they all dance exactly the same, they succeed.)

1653
01:02:02,435 --> 01:02:04,434
Left, right, up, down...

1654
01:02:04,435 --> 01:02:05,635
We'll be watching closely.

1655
01:02:05,905 --> 01:02:08,074
If anyone's moves are unclear,

1656
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:09,545
we will call it "wrong" right away.

1657
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:14,544
Shall we show you the first dish?

1658
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:15,545
- Yes!
- Okay!

1659
01:02:16,915 --> 01:02:18,885
- What?
- It looks like nachos.

1660
01:02:19,385 --> 01:02:20,615
It is.

1661
01:02:21,355 --> 01:02:23,025
(They are still digital detoxing.)

1662
01:02:23,225 --> 01:02:26,055
(Nachos are topped with diced tomatoes, olives, beef, and more.)

1663
01:02:27,155 --> 01:02:28,995
(Taco salad from Taco Bell)

1664
01:02:29,095 --> 01:02:30,964
- It looks good.
- I saw you.

1665
01:02:30,965 --> 01:02:33,034
- Looks so good.
- I saw Eun Ji buy a bottle of wine.

1666
01:02:33,035 --> 01:02:34,434
It will go well with the wine.

1667
01:02:34,435 --> 01:02:35,464
How did he find out?

1668
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:36,635
(She bought it at a rest stop on the way here.)

1669
01:02:36,705 --> 01:02:38,434
- You can do it!
- Right.

1670
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:39,704
- We'll get the nachos.
- I'll stay back a bit.

1671
01:02:39,705 --> 01:02:40,875
It's nacho salad.

1672
01:02:41,135 --> 01:02:43,405
Don't you have Roo'Ra's song or something like that?

1673
01:02:44,305 --> 01:02:45,314
Something like "3!4!" by Roo'Ra.

1674
01:02:45,315 --> 01:02:46,645
In 1, 2, 3.

1675
01:02:47,945 --> 01:02:48,945
Oh, no.

1676
01:02:50,164 --> 01:02:51,504
Don't you have Roo'Ra's song or something like that?

1677
01:02:52,374 --> 01:02:53,374
Something like "3!4!" by Roo'Ra.

1678
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:54,834
In 1, 2, 3.

1679
01:02:55,644 --> 01:02:57,003
("Igloo" by KISS OF LIFE)

1680
01:02:57,004 --> 01:02:58,374
It's "Igloo" by KISS OF LIFE.

1681
01:02:59,044 --> 01:03:01,043
("Igloo" by KISS OF LIFE)

1682
01:03:01,044 --> 01:03:03,383
(A chic, edgy choreography with a hip-hop base.)

1683
01:03:03,384 --> 01:03:06,484
(It shows a touch of wit and uses sunglasses as a prop.)

1684
01:03:06,584 --> 01:03:10,184
(The younger girls practiced in Abu Dhabi.)

1685
01:03:10,424 --> 01:03:12,524
(Her face lights up.)

1686
01:03:12,624 --> 01:03:13,694
Which direction do we go first?

1687
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:14,994
Which way first?

1688
01:03:15,154 --> 01:03:16,963
- Shall we go to the right?
- Okay.

1689
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:18,294
(It seems like they all know.)

1690
01:03:18,634 --> 01:03:20,294
We'll start the music.

1691
01:03:20,934 --> 01:03:22,933
Do you want to stand a bit at the back?

1692
01:03:22,934 --> 01:03:24,004
- Thank you.
- To the front.

1693
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,304
Eun Ji, where are you going?

1694
01:03:25,474 --> 01:03:27,973
Idols usually stand in pairs like this.

1695
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:29,004
We go by height.

1696
01:03:29,344 --> 01:03:30,344
That's right.

1697
01:03:31,244 --> 01:03:32,374
- We're ready.
- Music, cue!

1698
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:36,713
(They put on sunglasses.)

1699
01:03:36,714 --> 01:03:37,784
Ready.

1700
01:03:41,214 --> 01:03:43,354
(Eun Ji seemed unsure at first but she nails it.)

1701
01:03:43,784 --> 01:03:45,124
(Mom's hands are magic hands.)

1702
01:03:45,724 --> 01:03:48,354
(The younger girls who practiced in Abu Dhabi are perfect.)

1703
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:51,494
(Mimi's personal color is igloo.)

1704
01:03:51,724 --> 01:03:53,064
(Cheeky girl sticks out her tongue.)

1705
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:55,264
(She keeps sticking out her tongue too.)

1706
01:03:55,764 --> 01:03:57,234
(Yes!)

1707
01:03:57,534 --> 01:04:00,104
(They end with freestyle dancing.)

1708
01:04:00,374 --> 01:04:01,504
(A hand kiss for the ending)

1709
01:04:01,574 --> 01:04:02,703
(They taunt the judges with their hand gestures.)

1710
01:04:02,704 --> 01:04:03,843
This is not a big deal for us.

1711
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,203
Feeling unsure, right?

1712
01:04:05,204 --> 01:04:06,644
Feeling unsure, right?

1713
01:04:08,784 --> 01:04:09,914
Correct!

1714
01:04:11,084 --> 01:04:12,414
I want to know what you did.

1715
01:04:12,584 --> 01:04:14,254
- I did exactly what you guys did.
- Right.

1716
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:16,123
- You did really well.
- Right.

1717
01:04:16,124 --> 01:04:18,253
- But you don't seem very happy.
- Right.

1718
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:19,724
No, I'm very happy.

1719
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:24,224
(The nacho salad they acquired...)

1720
01:04:24,464 --> 01:04:26,564
(is placed on the table.)

1721
01:04:26,594 --> 01:04:28,264
(Nacho salad secured!)

1722
01:04:28,294 --> 01:04:30,504
For us, the next food is important.

1723
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:31,834
This is great!

1724
01:04:33,374 --> 01:04:34,434
- Oh!
- Nice.

1725
01:04:34,934 --> 01:04:38,344
(Hamburgers appear.)

1726
01:04:39,044 --> 01:04:41,214
It must be the big ones. They look so good.

1727
01:04:41,374 --> 01:04:44,744
You know what they are, right? They're very familiar.

1728
01:04:45,684 --> 01:04:48,514
(A sesame bun with two all-beef patties)

1729
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:51,824
(M company's Big M)

1730
01:04:51,884 --> 01:04:54,093
- If you just get this, - Okay.

1731
01:04:54,094 --> 01:04:55,393
- your dinner will be taken care of.
- We'll be full.

1732
01:04:55,394 --> 01:04:57,064
- Right.
- I want to have it.

1733
01:04:57,164 --> 01:04:58,393
- Who wants to pick it?
- Here?

1734
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,664
- The section is the key.
- It is.

1735
01:05:00,594 --> 01:05:02,603
(What is the next song?)

1736
01:05:02,604 --> 01:05:03,804
- I'm opening it.
- Okay.

1737
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:04,964
Let's go.

1738
01:05:05,734 --> 01:05:07,733
- What is it?
- No. It's...

1739
01:05:07,734 --> 01:05:09,073
It's "Attitude" by IVE.

1740
01:05:09,074 --> 01:05:11,544
("Attitude" by IVE)

1741
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,573
(With Yu Jin as the leader, the song is known for...)

1742
01:05:13,574 --> 01:05:15,583
(its addictive point choreography like...)

1743
01:05:15,584 --> 01:05:17,783
(the “Won Young Turn,” “Wiper Dance,” and “Raging Guinea,”)

1744
01:05:17,784 --> 01:05:20,054
(along with powerful and refreshing performances.)

1745
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:28,194
(Young Ji has already done the challenge before.)

1746
01:05:28,594 --> 01:05:29,993
(Puppy An, the original artist is surprised.)

1747
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:31,363
- Will you do this or that?
- Yu Jin!

1748
01:05:31,364 --> 01:05:33,564
- This or that?
- Yu Jin, go to the back.

1749
01:05:33,694 --> 01:05:36,764
(Yeong Seok steps in and sends Yu Jin to the back!)

1750
01:05:36,864 --> 01:05:38,204
This first, right?

1751
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:40,333
Young Ji, why are you at the front?

1752
01:05:40,334 --> 01:05:42,344
- I'm really confident about this.
- You're the leader?

1753
01:05:42,574 --> 01:05:44,144
Yu Jin, I made the challenge, remember?

1754
01:05:44,204 --> 01:05:46,044
(Not a very trusting look)

1755
01:05:46,344 --> 01:05:48,473
(She has already switched to IVE mode.)

1756
01:05:48,474 --> 01:05:49,584
Let's do this.

1757
01:05:49,914 --> 01:05:51,384
- Yes!
- We're ready.

1758
01:05:51,444 --> 01:05:52,614
Music, start!

1759
01:05:56,884 --> 01:06:00,754
(The original artist goes right into Won Young Turn.)

1760
01:06:00,994 --> 01:06:04,824
(The eldest watches and copies.)

1761
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:08,904
(Young Ji does Won Young Turn only with her expressions.)

1762
01:06:09,234 --> 01:06:12,934
(Team BB's moves are completely unrelated to the song.)

1763
01:06:14,674 --> 01:06:17,103
- Incorrect!
- This is not the time!

1764
01:06:17,104 --> 01:06:18,673
- This isn't the part!
- This is not it!

1765
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:20,173
- We have to go with this first.
- It's not right

1766
01:06:20,174 --> 01:06:21,243
- This is not the dance part.
- It's wrong.

1767
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:22,313
- It's not it.
- That's important.

1768
01:06:22,314 --> 01:06:24,384
- Wiper Dance is the important part.
- Right.

1769
01:06:24,484 --> 01:06:26,113
Don't you usually start...

1770
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:27,453
- with Won Young Turn?
- No.

1771
01:06:27,454 --> 01:06:31,154
The part we pushed as the challenge section this time...

1772
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:33,223
- was Raging Guinea.
- Right.

1773
01:06:33,224 --> 01:06:34,393
(Raging Guinea)

1774
01:06:34,394 --> 01:06:35,564
You did go that way.

1775
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:38,023
Young Ji stepped up but ended up dancing a completely different move.

1776
01:06:38,024 --> 01:06:40,834
No, I just thought this part would come out first.

1777
01:06:40,934 --> 01:06:42,633
There's an issue with the section.

1778
01:06:42,634 --> 01:06:43,864
Let's check one more time if she's really doing it right.

1779
01:06:45,304 --> 01:06:46,934
We'll just look at that part.

1780
01:06:47,134 --> 01:06:48,404
You'll be so amazed.

1781
01:06:48,634 --> 01:06:50,274
(Feeling shaky)

1782
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:52,773
(Young Ji, like this.)

1783
01:06:52,774 --> 01:06:54,344
- Like this.
- Okay.

1784
01:06:55,074 --> 01:06:57,644
- I love that part.
- Music is starting.

1785
01:06:59,354 --> 01:07:01,884
(Mirror-mode Wiper Dance)

1786
01:07:02,054 --> 01:07:03,984
(Bouncing adorably)

1787
01:07:06,094 --> 01:07:07,593
(The next move is shoulder shake.)

1788
01:07:07,594 --> 01:07:10,064
Incorrect for Young Ji!

1789
01:07:11,094 --> 01:07:13,934
(Raging Young Ji)

1790
01:07:14,094 --> 01:07:18,304
(She rages on before anyone else.)

1791
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:19,533
(Feigning innocence)

1792
01:07:19,534 --> 01:07:20,803
What's the matter?

1793
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:23,103
- Young Ji danced differently alone.
- No!

1794
01:07:23,104 --> 01:07:24,143
That's not possible.

1795
01:07:24,144 --> 01:07:26,073
- We did the challenge together.
- Yes.

1796
01:07:26,074 --> 01:07:27,874
- You must have seen it wrong.
- What?

1797
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,314
- You think we can't see straight?
- No.

1798
01:07:30,484 --> 01:07:32,584
Yu Jin, you watch from the side.

1799
01:07:32,654 --> 01:07:33,983
Be honest and fair.

1800
01:07:33,984 --> 01:07:35,724
- Honest and fair.
- I'll just focus on this side.

1801
01:07:35,854 --> 01:07:37,253
Put IVE on the line!

1802
01:07:37,254 --> 01:07:38,683
- I can't do that.
- Put Yu Jin on the line!

1803
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:40,294
- We can do it!
- Put STARSHIP on the line!

1804
01:07:40,494 --> 01:07:41,593
- Put STARSHIP...
- Put your contract on the line!

1805
01:07:41,594 --> 01:07:42,893
- Why are we betting so big?
- Okay.

1806
01:07:42,894 --> 01:07:44,823
- Just put the burger on the line.
- Bet everything.

1807
01:07:44,824 --> 01:07:46,764
- We can do this!
- We can do this!

1808
01:07:48,034 --> 01:07:49,833
- All right.
- Remember it, Young Ji.

1809
01:07:49,834 --> 01:07:51,204
- Of course.
- Remember the last time.

1810
01:07:51,764 --> 01:07:53,803
(Under the watchful eye of Puppy An)

1811
01:07:53,804 --> 01:07:54,874
Go, Young Ji!

1812
01:07:54,934 --> 01:07:56,874
(Window-wiping flirting dedicated to the original artist)

1813
01:07:57,104 --> 01:07:58,403
(Smitten)

1814
01:07:58,404 --> 01:07:59,443
Let's go!

1815
01:07:59,444 --> 01:08:02,414
(Body cringed to the max)

1816
01:08:02,984 --> 01:08:04,514
(She doesn't forget about showing off her shoulder blades.)

1817
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:06,113
(Moving to the beat)

1818
01:08:06,114 --> 01:08:07,153
Let's go!

1819
01:08:07,154 --> 01:08:08,954
(Raging Young Ji, coming through!)

1820
01:08:10,024 --> 01:08:11,424
She's good.

1821
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:14,094
- She's good.
- Her dancing is good.

1822
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:16,463
Her dancing is perfect.

1823
01:08:16,464 --> 01:08:17,864
That was perfect!

1824
01:08:18,024 --> 01:08:19,794
(Self-celebration!)

1825
01:08:19,894 --> 01:08:21,593
You failed to get the hamburgers.

1826
01:08:21,594 --> 01:08:23,664
- Take them out.
- Why?

1827
01:08:24,304 --> 01:08:26,403
- Why is that a fail?
- Nice job reviewing.

1828
01:08:26,404 --> 01:08:28,774
You have to do it properly like this from the start.

1829
01:08:28,874 --> 01:08:30,274
Understood.

1830
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:32,944
(Totally scared)

1831
01:08:33,274 --> 01:08:35,044
(She pretends not to see anything.)

1832
01:08:35,174 --> 01:08:37,244
(Hamburgers are taken out.)

1833
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:39,914
Show us the next dish.

1834
01:08:40,114 --> 01:08:42,783
- I love that.
- Onion rings.

1835
01:08:42,784 --> 01:08:43,884
They're onion rings.

1836
01:08:43,984 --> 01:08:45,923
- They're so good.
- Is it squid rings?

1837
01:08:45,924 --> 01:08:47,053
- It's onion rings.
- Onion rings.

1838
01:08:47,054 --> 01:08:48,524
They taste good.

1839
01:08:49,094 --> 01:08:51,264
- They taste better overseas.
- Right.

1840
01:08:52,594 --> 01:08:54,234
- Shall we give this turn to Yu Jin?
- The youngest.

1841
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:55,464
Okay.

1842
01:08:56,104 --> 01:08:57,104
- What happened?
- It's this one.

1843
01:08:57,304 --> 01:08:59,204
(She leaves their fate to the dropped piece of paper.)

1844
01:08:59,304 --> 01:09:00,433
Shamanism.

1845
01:09:00,434 --> 01:09:01,434
Do you know this one?

1846
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:02,573
- Shamanism.
- This.

1847
01:09:02,574 --> 01:09:03,874
It's "Get a Guitar" by RIIZE.

1848
01:09:04,804 --> 01:09:06,713
(The highlight is the air guitar move, )

1849
01:09:06,714 --> 01:09:09,214
(spiced up with rhythmic and detailed footwork.)

1850
01:09:09,414 --> 01:09:13,584
(Ultra-high-difficulty air guitar steps!)

1851
01:09:13,684 --> 01:09:14,913
(The one who picked the song is looking a bit flustered.)

1852
01:09:14,914 --> 01:09:16,153
Let's try our best.

1853
01:09:16,154 --> 01:09:18,254
- I don't know.
- The steps are a bit tricky.

1854
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:20,354
- I think Mimi should know it.
- I don't.

1855
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:22,263
- We'll give it a go.
- I'm not sure.

1856
01:09:22,264 --> 01:09:23,363
We'll go with this.

1857
01:09:23,364 --> 01:09:26,164
Watch Yu Jin closely. She doesn't know the dance.

1858
01:09:26,864 --> 01:09:29,464
(Yu Jin's steps are a bit different from Mimi's.)

1859
01:09:29,534 --> 01:09:31,404
Mimi, go to the front.

1860
01:09:31,464 --> 01:09:32,633
I've never danced this before.

1861
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:34,073
It's okay. There's no pressure.

1862
01:09:34,074 --> 01:09:35,643
- Is Mimi the center?
- Yes.

1863
01:09:35,644 --> 01:09:36,644
Mimi, you go here.

1864
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:38,244
Give us the signal when you're ready.

1865
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:40,644
Yu Jin, why are you hiding?

1866
01:09:40,814 --> 01:09:42,343
When we are in even numbers,

1867
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:43,983
- we have a back center.
- Girl groups are like that.

1868
01:09:43,984 --> 01:09:45,684
Yu Jin, take a step to the side.

1869
01:09:46,284 --> 01:09:47,314
Let's go!

1870
01:09:47,454 --> 01:09:49,184
("Get a Guitar" by RIIZE)

1871
01:09:49,324 --> 01:09:51,354
(She totally has high-teen male lead vibes.)

1872
01:09:51,484 --> 01:09:53,454
(Male lead's friend number 1)

1873
01:09:53,694 --> 01:09:55,594
(The puppy is just having fun.)

1874
01:09:55,924 --> 01:09:57,864
(The center fires hearts.)

1875
01:09:58,224 --> 01:09:59,894
(Entering the air guitar section)

1876
01:10:00,794 --> 01:10:02,564
(In the midst of those desperate foot tricks...)

1877
01:10:02,734 --> 01:10:05,704
(there's one person with especially unique footwork.)

1878
01:10:06,634 --> 01:10:08,734
(Defeated)

1879
01:10:09,044 --> 01:10:10,944
- Incorrect!
- Why?

1880
01:10:11,144 --> 01:10:13,043
(It's because of this person.)

1881
01:10:13,044 --> 01:10:14,374
We did a good job.

1882
01:10:14,774 --> 01:10:16,944
- It's Yu Jin.
- Why?

1883
01:10:17,084 --> 01:10:20,254
(Both feet have to leave the ground.)

1884
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:24,124
(One foot just refused to leave the ground.)

1885
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:25,423
Let's have Yu Jin come to the front.

1886
01:10:25,424 --> 01:10:27,253
- We'll see her moves once more.
- Good idea.

1887
01:10:27,254 --> 01:10:29,324
- I'll play the guitar.
- Start the music again.

1888
01:10:29,624 --> 01:10:31,164
(Cheering with air guitar)

1889
01:10:33,134 --> 01:10:34,194
Yu Jin.

1890
01:10:34,594 --> 01:10:36,064
(Determined)

1891
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:40,303
She's doing it right! She's good!

1892
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:41,333
Incorrect!

1893
01:10:41,334 --> 01:10:44,273
(She's trying to shake off the gum stuck to her foot.)

1894
01:10:44,274 --> 01:10:45,573
- Incorrect!
- Why?

1895
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,113
That’s pretty good, all things considered!

1896
01:10:47,114 --> 01:10:48,343
- That's good enough!
- Show us.

1897
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:49,513
- This is difficult.
- How do you do it?

1898
01:10:49,514 --> 01:10:50,514
Like this.

1899
01:10:51,244 --> 01:10:52,583
(Mimi is known to be good at male idols' dance moves.)

1900
01:10:52,584 --> 01:10:54,783
I'm doing this for the first time.

1901
01:10:54,784 --> 01:10:56,053
I don't even know if I'm doing it correctly.

1902
01:10:56,054 --> 01:10:57,424
- How do you do it?
- How?

1903
01:10:58,324 --> 01:11:00,054
So even Yu Jin has something she can’t do.

1904
01:11:00,154 --> 01:11:01,154
(The idols are passing on their secret tips.)

1905
01:11:01,155 --> 01:11:03,323
This is my first time doing it, so I don't really know.

1906
01:11:03,324 --> 01:11:04,494
Is this right?

1907
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,964
How do you do this? What do you think about this?

1908
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,233
(Wrapping a single rose)

1909
01:11:09,234 --> 01:11:11,234
(Gently in paper)

1910
01:11:11,404 --> 01:11:15,004
(The junior comedian also joins the performance.)

1911
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,374
I got it! It's City Kids!

1912
01:11:17,904 --> 01:11:20,043
("At the Moonlit Window" by City Kids, released in 1986)

1913
01:11:20,044 --> 01:11:22,944
(Yeong Seok would know this song, but how does Eun Ji know it?)

1914
01:11:23,184 --> 01:11:30,424
(She even knows the dance perfectly.)

1915
01:11:31,024 --> 01:11:34,953
(City Idols)

1916
01:11:34,954 --> 01:11:37,594
- You're like Michol.
- Let's go! Hey!

1917
01:11:38,324 --> 01:11:41,894
(Remix)

1918
01:11:41,994 --> 01:11:44,934
(A retro take on “Get a Guitar”)

1919
01:11:46,004 --> 01:11:47,004
This is hard.

1920
01:11:47,874 --> 01:11:49,573
- That's a fail.
- She did it right.

1921
01:11:49,574 --> 01:11:51,504
(They take out the onion rings.)

1922
01:11:51,604 --> 01:11:53,274
(It's time to hydrate.)

1923
01:11:53,374 --> 01:11:54,543
(This is hard training.)

1924
01:11:54,544 --> 01:11:55,614
She keeps doing that move.

1925
01:11:55,714 --> 01:11:57,044
I can't seem to do this. Wait!

1926
01:11:57,144 --> 01:11:58,383
Why is this so hard?

1927
01:11:58,384 --> 01:12:00,083
Yu Jin, what's wrong? You're such a good dancer.

1928
01:12:00,084 --> 01:12:01,084
Go!

1929
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:02,654
(Pulled tight)

1930
01:12:02,655 --> 01:12:03,824
She can't do that step.

1931
01:12:04,184 --> 01:12:06,194
(Light and graceful)

1932
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:09,823
(Broken)

1933
01:12:09,824 --> 01:12:11,894
There's something Yu Jin can’t do!

1934
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,033
- This is really hard.
- It's hard.

1935
01:12:15,034 --> 01:12:16,304
If only you weren’t here!

1936
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:19,374
If only you weren’t here!

1937
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,874
(Laughing)

1938
01:12:23,974 --> 01:12:25,403
(Why are you such a good dancer?)

1939
01:12:25,404 --> 01:12:27,414
- It's "Whispering Corridors." - Hey, Cha Moo Hyeok!

1940
01:12:27,514 --> 01:12:28,874
- It's like "Whispering Corridors." - Calm down, Moo Hyeok.

1941
01:12:29,314 --> 01:12:30,513
- An Moo Hyeok.
- If it wasn't for you,

1942
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:32,114
I’d be number one.

1943
01:12:32,684 --> 01:12:33,884
She's like that character.

1944
01:12:36,154 --> 01:12:38,284
I got chills all over!

1945
01:12:39,124 --> 01:12:40,153
It's like a scene from "Whispering Corridors."

1946
01:12:40,154 --> 01:12:41,593
(Just joking)

1947
01:12:41,594 --> 01:12:43,763
- Boy group dances...
- Boy group dances are tough.

1948
01:12:43,764 --> 01:12:44,764
The difficulty level is high.

1949
01:12:44,765 --> 01:12:45,833
Show us the next dish.

1950
01:12:45,834 --> 01:12:46,863
(The next dish appears.)

1951
01:12:46,864 --> 01:12:48,194
Tuna salad.

1952
01:12:48,294 --> 01:12:49,863
It's tuna salad.

1953
01:12:49,864 --> 01:12:50,864
(Tuna salad from Subway)

1954
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:53,434
Not a big fan of this one.

1955
01:12:53,704 --> 01:12:54,934
Let's take it easy.

1956
01:12:55,234 --> 01:12:57,304
- Not this one.
- Not a big fan of this.

1957
01:12:57,844 --> 01:12:59,473
- Mimi, you pick this time.
- Okay.

1958
01:12:59,474 --> 01:13:00,474
Tuna salad?

1959
01:13:00,614 --> 01:13:01,913
- It's tuna salad.
- Salad?

1960
01:13:01,914 --> 01:13:03,284
Let's take it easy.

1961
01:13:03,744 --> 01:13:04,744
I hope we get a tough one.

1962
01:13:05,144 --> 01:13:07,354
"With You, Everything, This Moment" by JAESSBEE.

1963
01:13:07,914 --> 01:13:09,623
- What? Can you say that again?
- What did you say?

1964
01:13:09,624 --> 01:13:12,824
JAESSBEE's "With You, Everything," I mean, "Every Moment With You."

1965
01:13:13,354 --> 01:13:15,094
("Every Moment With You" by JAESSBEE)

1966
01:13:15,154 --> 01:13:17,293
(The highlight of this song is the dreamy, emotional vibe...)

1967
01:13:17,294 --> 01:13:21,334
(paired with easy-to-follow hand gestures.)

1968
01:13:21,664 --> 01:13:24,203
(The group's member Gabee is...)

1969
01:13:24,204 --> 01:13:28,133
(Eun Ji Tonton's bestie.)

1970
01:13:28,134 --> 01:13:32,304
(She’s also the choreographer for Yu Jin’s group, IVE.)

1971
01:13:32,404 --> 01:13:33,444
- Let's do this.
- We have to...

1972
01:13:33,714 --> 01:13:35,674
- give it a wistful vibe.
- Show us.

1973
01:13:35,884 --> 01:13:36,884
Wistful vibes.

1974
01:13:37,114 --> 01:13:38,843
- Give it a wistful vibe.
- Just show me the beginning.

1975
01:13:38,844 --> 01:13:39,853
(Learning)

1976
01:13:39,854 --> 01:13:40,854
(Gabee's friends are doing well.)

1977
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:41,984
I got it.

1978
01:13:42,854 --> 01:13:43,854
Okay.

1979
01:13:44,084 --> 01:13:45,523
I'm sorry, but Young Ji,

1980
01:13:45,524 --> 01:13:47,254
- I can see you hiding.
- No, I'm just...

1981
01:13:48,194 --> 01:13:49,564
Music, cue!

1982
01:13:50,924 --> 01:13:52,164
(Soft and intense)

1983
01:13:52,364 --> 01:13:54,194
(Hahoe mask)

1984
01:13:56,204 --> 01:13:57,904
(Wistful)

1985
01:13:58,764 --> 01:13:59,834
Oh! Don’t film me!

1986
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:04,304
Ah! That’s cold! Don’t splash water!

1987
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:06,974
(Switching out of wistful mode)

1988
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,744
(In the midst of Gabee's friends, )

1989
01:14:12,184 --> 01:14:16,084
(Feisty Young Ji tries to keep up.)

1990
01:14:16,884 --> 01:14:20,494
(Mimi is now back as an aerobics instructor.)

1991
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:22,864
(Highlight hand-move choreography)

1992
01:14:24,624 --> 01:14:27,734
(It's a total mess.)

1993
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:29,364
Turn like this.

1994
01:14:30,234 --> 01:14:31,904
(Giggling away)

1995
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:35,274
(They're winging this part by covering it with vibes.)

1996
01:14:35,474 --> 01:14:37,404
(Dancing hard)

1997
01:14:37,504 --> 01:14:41,644
(Correct choreography)

1998
01:14:42,014 --> 01:14:45,914
(Random choreography)

1999
01:14:46,254 --> 01:14:50,224
(Mimi follows along but keeps missing the beat.)

2000
01:14:50,724 --> 01:14:53,953
Hey, stop for a minute!

2001
01:14:53,954 --> 01:14:56,624
Stop for a minute!

2002
01:14:56,894 --> 01:14:59,333
We were doing so well!

2003
01:14:59,334 --> 01:15:00,493
Mimi and Young Ji, come to the front.

2004
01:15:00,494 --> 01:15:01,564
Mimi and Young Ji, come to the front.

2005
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,903
- I was doing so well at the back.
- We have to look properly.

2006
01:15:03,904 --> 01:15:05,764
Why is there so much panting coming from the back?

2007
01:15:06,604 --> 01:15:07,633
Are you okay?

2008
01:15:07,634 --> 01:15:08,734
Why are you so good at this dance?

2009
01:15:09,374 --> 01:15:10,374
Did you do a challenge?

2010
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:11,574
I like this song because it's Gabee's.

2011
01:15:12,304 --> 01:15:13,773
- This and this.
- Lively and wistfully.

2012
01:15:13,774 --> 01:15:16,013
- She says...
- If the two of you do it perfectly,

2013
01:15:16,014 --> 01:15:17,544
- to do it lively and wistfully.
- we'll call it a success.

2014
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:18,914
Mimi and Young Ji have to...

2015
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:20,853
- do it perfectly.
- If you don't know, just do this.

2016
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:21,913
(Do it like this and this.)

2017
01:15:21,914 --> 01:15:23,953
- Ready?
- That way.

2018
01:15:23,954 --> 01:15:25,024
Lively and wistfully.

2019
01:15:25,784 --> 01:15:28,924
(They're ready to be lively and wistful.)

2020
01:15:31,524 --> 01:15:33,264
- Good.
- Go.

2021
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:36,004
Hey, wait a moment!

2022
01:15:36,834 --> 01:15:38,764
(She's doing the "Now" move above her head.)

2023
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:41,233
(She's planting the "Now" move into the ground.)

2024
01:15:41,234 --> 01:15:42,744
There is no "Now."

2025
01:15:43,404 --> 01:15:46,213
Where did that "Now" come from?

2026
01:15:46,214 --> 01:15:48,343
The way I see it, Young Ji’s got her own quirk.

2027
01:15:48,344 --> 01:15:49,344
- Me?
- You have a quirk.

2028
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:51,183
- What kind?
- She just has a strong personality.

2029
01:15:51,184 --> 01:15:53,484
Her quirks are usually something like this.

2030
01:15:54,214 --> 01:15:56,724
Or this.

2031
01:15:56,824 --> 01:15:58,984
- That's true.
- Like this.

2032
01:15:59,694 --> 01:16:02,023
You're not supposed to pull a surprise move in a group dance.

2033
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:03,893
I'm sorry. But when I don't know what to do,

2034
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:05,063
I might as well make it funny.

2035
01:16:05,064 --> 01:16:06,894
- Good call.
- Right.

2036
01:16:07,364 --> 01:16:08,863
(But you're a singer.)

2037
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:09,864
Take out the salad.

2038
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:10,903
(Tuna salad is taken out.)

2039
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:13,103
- We'll show you the next dish.
- The next dish.

2040
01:16:13,104 --> 01:16:14,703
- You should...
- We have to get that.

2041
01:16:14,704 --> 01:16:17,273
You should win something like this.

2042
01:16:17,274 --> 01:16:19,343
There are three patties in there.

2043
01:16:19,344 --> 01:16:20,573
- This is great.
- It's crazy.

2044
01:16:20,574 --> 01:16:21,714
(King Burger's Triple Whopper)

2045
01:16:21,814 --> 01:16:23,013
I think this is the best dish.

2046
01:16:23,014 --> 01:16:24,344
- It's the best.
- We have to eat this.

2047
01:16:24,444 --> 01:16:25,743
- This is the main dish.
- It's Young Ji's favorite.

2048
01:16:25,744 --> 01:16:27,413
- You know Young Ji's King Burger?
- King Burger.

2049
01:16:27,414 --> 01:16:28,753
- Yes.
- It's Young Ji's.

2050
01:16:28,754 --> 01:16:30,253
- King Burger.
- She loves King Burger.

2051
01:16:30,254 --> 01:16:31,254
It's the best hamburger.

2052
01:16:31,255 --> 01:16:34,054
No, I'm trying to pick one.

2053
01:16:36,394 --> 01:16:37,494
Pick one!

2054
01:16:37,824 --> 01:16:38,994
Go for it.

2055
01:16:39,664 --> 01:16:40,664
What is it?

2056
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,033
I did a challenge of this one.

2057
01:16:44,034 --> 01:16:45,334
"If I Say, I Love You"?

2058
01:16:46,434 --> 01:16:48,473
(The choreography of this song by BOYNEXTDOOR playfully and...)

2059
01:16:48,474 --> 01:16:53,844
(cutely expresses the sadness and frustration of post-breakup blues.)

2060
01:16:54,014 --> 01:17:00,414
(Young Ji also did a challenge of the song's dance.)

2061
01:17:01,414 --> 01:17:03,083
I did a challenge of this one.

2062
01:17:03,084 --> 01:17:04,424
"If I Say, I Love You"?

2063
01:17:04,524 --> 01:17:05,923
- What?
- One at the center.

2064
01:17:05,924 --> 01:17:06,994
Let's do this.

2065
01:17:07,094 --> 01:17:08,593
- You did the challenge, right?
- It seems Young Ji knows.

2066
01:17:08,594 --> 01:17:09,923
And also Yu Jin.

2067
01:17:09,924 --> 01:17:11,823
Is it the "I'll love you only for today" part?

2068
01:17:11,824 --> 01:17:13,063
You have to watch Mimi and Eun Ji carefully.

2069
01:17:13,064 --> 01:17:15,063
- "I'll love you only for today"?
- Just jump.

2070
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:16,263
"For today."

2071
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:18,364
(Younger girls are syncing up.)

2072
01:17:20,534 --> 01:17:21,604
(Exclaiming)

2073
01:17:23,474 --> 01:17:25,004
(Her quirk popped right out.)

2074
01:17:25,144 --> 01:17:28,973
She's showing her quirk again.

2075
01:17:28,974 --> 01:17:30,113
Got it.

2076
01:17:30,114 --> 01:17:31,183
- Follow my quirk.
- Okay.

2077
01:17:31,184 --> 01:17:32,413
I'll just follow you.

2078
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:34,114
- I'll talk you through it.
- We'll follow you.

2079
01:17:34,754 --> 01:17:39,994
(She teaches choreography with her mouth.)

2080
01:17:40,194 --> 01:17:44,324
(She’s a top-tier storytelling dance instructor.)

2081
01:17:44,424 --> 01:17:46,394
(Episode on highlight choreography from "Sugar Rush Ride")

2082
01:17:46,494 --> 01:17:47,794
(The thing that was on the knee...)

2083
01:17:47,894 --> 01:17:50,533
(was the wriggler.)

2084
01:17:50,534 --> 01:17:52,303
We even did the wriggler.

2085
01:17:52,304 --> 01:17:53,703
First, start by jumping for "For today" part.

2086
01:17:53,704 --> 01:17:55,073
I'm sure Mimi will get it wrong.

2087
01:17:55,074 --> 01:17:56,574
Do the "For today" part then swing.

2088
01:17:56,874 --> 01:17:58,103
Swing.

2089
01:17:58,104 --> 01:17:59,714
- Then it's "I love you." - "I love you."

2090
01:17:59,774 --> 01:18:02,344
I'm sorry but Cha Moo Hyeok is here.

2091
01:18:03,714 --> 01:18:04,883
One million dollars!

2092
01:18:04,884 --> 01:18:06,483
(I'm sorry, I don't know the moves.)

2093
01:18:06,484 --> 01:18:07,683
- Moo Hyeok.
- Just do what I tell you.

2094
01:18:07,684 --> 01:18:09,154
- Just do what I tell you.
- Got it.

2095
01:18:09,254 --> 01:18:10,483
Jaehyun!

2096
01:18:10,484 --> 01:18:11,524
Are you watching? Let's do this.

2097
01:18:11,884 --> 01:18:12,893
Let's go!

2098
01:18:12,894 --> 01:18:14,294
("If I Say, I Love You" by BOYNEXTDOOR)

2099
01:18:15,194 --> 01:18:17,024
(She dominates from the start with her singing.)

2100
01:18:17,924 --> 01:18:19,163
("Get a Guitar")

2101
01:18:19,164 --> 01:18:21,063
(She still can't do it.)

2102
01:18:21,064 --> 01:18:22,094
Just jump!

2103
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:24,034
Jump then right-left-right!

2104
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:26,403
(Right-left-right!)

2105
01:18:26,404 --> 01:18:28,604
Let's do this! Three, two, one.

2106
01:18:30,374 --> 01:18:31,944
Right-left-pull!

2107
01:18:33,014 --> 01:18:34,014
Point!

2108
01:18:34,274 --> 01:18:35,274
(Jump)

2109
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:36,283
(Right-left-right)

2110
01:18:36,284 --> 01:18:38,144
(Older girls are keeping up nicely with the routine.)

2111
01:18:38,544 --> 01:18:40,954
"I Love You" part. Now hit your head.

2112
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:42,684
(This is the accurate “hit-your-head” scene.)

2113
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:44,224
(This is the head-pounding scene.)

2114
01:18:44,654 --> 01:18:47,353
(Students gather at the center.)

2115
01:18:47,354 --> 01:18:49,094
- One more.
- Now, shoot me!

2116
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:54,134
(This top-tier instructor's last lesson.)

2117
01:18:54,534 --> 01:18:57,764
(Shoot me and go.)

2118
01:18:58,104 --> 01:19:01,674
(Their performance is completed with the instructor's sacrifice.)

2119
01:19:01,874 --> 01:19:02,944
That's a success!

2120
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:05,243
You're the best!

2121
01:19:05,244 --> 01:19:06,244
(Students shower her with the highest praise.)

2122
01:19:06,245 --> 01:19:08,073
She's such a good teacher!

2123
01:19:08,074 --> 01:19:09,214
Jaehyun, I succeeded.

2124
01:19:10,014 --> 01:19:11,344
(They win the triple whopper.)

2125
01:19:11,444 --> 01:19:13,253
(The top-tier instructor's lessons continue.)

2126
01:19:13,254 --> 01:19:15,384
("Fighting" by B.S.S featuring Lee Young Ji)

2127
01:19:15,814 --> 01:19:16,824
You just have to go this way.

2128
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:20,223
- Then the fan.
- Like this.

2129
01:19:20,224 --> 01:19:21,354
- Like this.
- Right.

2130
01:19:21,754 --> 01:19:24,263
- Then, you do this and go there.
- Okay.

2131
01:19:24,264 --> 01:19:25,463
("Fighting" by B.S.S featuring Lee Young Ji)

2132
01:19:25,464 --> 01:19:26,534
(Original song by B.S.S, Choreo teaching by Feisty Young Ji)

2133
01:19:26,694 --> 01:19:28,294
(Cha Moo Hyeok is already going for it.)

2134
01:19:28,434 --> 01:19:29,904
(The guitarist is raving up her engine.)

2135
01:19:30,104 --> 01:19:31,104
Young Ji, let's do this!

2136
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:34,474
(The top-tier instructor is also ready.)

2137
01:19:34,504 --> 01:19:36,034
- Up! Above the head!
- Okay!

2138
01:19:36,474 --> 01:19:39,843
(Please enjoy some Earth Arcade fighting spirit.)

2139
01:19:39,844 --> 01:19:40,844
Front!

2140
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:44,044
This way!

2141
01:19:46,284 --> 01:19:47,353
We are!

2142
01:19:47,354 --> 01:19:48,984
- We are Earth Arcade!
- We are Earth Arcade!

2143
01:19:49,654 --> 01:19:50,984
- We fight for it!
- We fight for it!

2144
01:19:51,424 --> 01:19:52,424
Success!

2145
01:19:53,194 --> 01:19:54,194
Thank you.

2146
01:19:54,195 --> 01:19:55,523
(Thanks to the top-tier instructor, they succeed once again.)

2147
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:57,194
(They win bacon and French fries.)

2148
01:19:57,294 --> 01:19:59,163
(Yu Jin takes it.)

2149
01:19:59,164 --> 01:20:00,994
(And she stores it with others.)

2150
01:20:01,164 --> 01:20:02,393
This is what I wanted.

2151
01:20:02,394 --> 01:20:04,733
Yes. If we finish shooting this show...

2152
01:20:04,734 --> 01:20:07,003
without doing the Random Play Dance, it just doesn't feel right.

2153
01:20:07,004 --> 01:20:08,503
- I agree.
- I know.

2154
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:10,103
It was so much fun. You guys are amazing.

2155
01:20:10,104 --> 01:20:12,503
Really? People enjoy it when we dance.

2156
01:20:12,504 --> 01:20:13,644
That's true.

2157
01:20:13,944 --> 01:20:15,114
That looks great too.

2158
01:20:15,214 --> 01:20:16,614
- What is that?
- That's great. What is it?

2159
01:20:16,714 --> 01:20:18,443
This is the Subway sandwich. You know what it is, right?

2160
01:20:18,444 --> 01:20:20,054
- The thing you eat in the subway.
- Right.

2161
01:20:21,214 --> 01:20:22,924
(Charades)

2162
01:20:22,954 --> 01:20:24,024
I got it. Gangnam Station.

2163
01:20:27,254 --> 01:20:29,024
- Line No. 2.
- Line No. 2.

2164
01:20:31,324 --> 01:20:33,694
- Hey, hey, hey.
- We're really serious about this.

2165
01:20:34,034 --> 01:20:35,534
- We are at best with this game.
- Right.

2166
01:20:35,834 --> 01:20:36,964
Yu Jin is doing so well.

2167
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:46,003
("Genie" by Girls' Generation)

2168
01:20:46,004 --> 01:20:48,843
(This song has a clean formation and perfectly timed group dance.)

2169
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:52,083
(The point dance is the "Jegi Kicking Dance...")

2170
01:20:52,084 --> 01:20:55,283
(and the "Long Legs Dance.")

2171
01:20:55,284 --> 01:20:57,723
- I can't remember the older songs.
- I look forward to the performance.

2172
01:20:57,724 --> 01:20:59,353
(Eun Ji tries to remember the 2009 song.)

2173
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,954
Does it begin with the "I love you" part?

2174
01:21:01,324 --> 01:21:03,863
(Their memories are foggy.)

2175
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:05,694
This is difficult. We don't remember.

2176
01:21:06,024 --> 01:21:07,593
- We just need to do this.
- We just need to kick the jegi.

2177
01:21:07,594 --> 01:21:08,663
Right, that's all we need to do.

2178
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:10,433
- Oh, is that all you need to do?
- No, of course not.

2179
01:21:10,434 --> 01:21:11,903
We're also going to change formation!

2180
01:21:11,904 --> 01:21:12,934
That's right!

2181
01:21:13,174 --> 01:21:14,703
- All right, we'll watch.
- Okay!

2182
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:16,343
- Good luck.
- The formation is going to be hard.

2183
01:21:16,344 --> 01:21:17,903
- Right.
- That's the hardest part.

2184
01:21:17,904 --> 01:21:19,613
Why aren't you saying anything, Young Ji?

2185
01:21:19,614 --> 01:21:20,713
- Young Ji!
- I'm just trying to focus.

2186
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:21,714
- You're just trying to focus?
- I am.

2187
01:21:21,714 --> 01:21:22,714
- She is.
- All right.

2188
01:21:22,715 --> 01:21:24,043
Why are you doing that to Young Ji?

2189
01:21:24,044 --> 01:21:27,253
I was just curious and worried about Young Ji.

2190
01:21:27,254 --> 01:21:28,354
- You got this, right?
- Yes.

2191
01:21:29,354 --> 01:21:30,523
- Let's go.
- Judging from her expression,

2192
01:21:30,524 --> 01:21:32,023
- we should keep an eye on Young Ji.
- You got it.

2193
01:21:32,024 --> 01:21:33,494
- Let's begin.
- I'm tricking you guys.

2194
01:21:34,524 --> 01:21:35,694
You should take a few steps forward.

2195
01:21:36,864 --> 01:21:37,924
Just throw everything away

2196
01:21:37,994 --> 01:21:40,964
(The older members immediately kick their jegi.)

2197
01:21:41,494 --> 01:21:43,764
(All four of them do the Jegi Kicking Dance.)

2198
01:21:44,064 --> 01:21:45,704
(Saluting)

2199
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:47,834
Baby. I love you

2200
01:21:48,004 --> 01:21:49,234
I trust you always

2201
01:21:50,504 --> 01:21:52,074
(They change formation as planned.)

2202
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:53,914
(Chaotic)

2203
01:21:54,544 --> 01:21:57,914
(Directing traffic)

2204
01:21:58,114 --> 01:22:00,983
(It turns into a complete mess.)

2205
01:22:00,984 --> 01:22:01,984
The jegi!

2206
01:22:02,354 --> 01:22:06,324
(The one thing they know is the Jegi Kicking Dance.)

2207
01:22:06,624 --> 01:22:10,194
(Tutting instead of jegi)

2208
01:22:10,524 --> 01:22:13,293
(How far can your legs go up?)

2209
01:22:13,294 --> 01:22:14,334
Shake it!

2210
01:22:15,534 --> 01:22:17,563
(They tell us their wish in different directions.)

2211
01:22:17,564 --> 01:22:18,564
- Other way!
- Gosh.

2212
01:22:20,434 --> 01:22:21,533
(Feisty joins in late, )

2213
01:22:21,534 --> 01:22:22,534
Wave!

2214
01:22:22,535 --> 01:22:24,503
(and tries to do something.)

2215
01:22:24,504 --> 01:22:25,904
Just tell me your wish

2216
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:27,874
Okay, that was terrible. Fail!

2217
01:22:28,144 --> 01:22:29,514
All right, that's that.

2218
01:22:30,144 --> 01:22:31,283
Good thinking on the formation change.

2219
01:22:31,284 --> 01:22:32,413
- Okay.
- You...

2220
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:33,883
You made us finish the dance...

2221
01:22:33,884 --> 01:22:35,654
just to say we failed.

2222
01:22:35,814 --> 01:22:37,083
If we did "I Got a Boy..."

2223
01:22:37,084 --> 01:22:38,784
I can do that, too!

2224
01:22:39,024 --> 01:22:40,024
(Singing)

2225
01:22:40,154 --> 01:22:42,824
(My prince)

2226
01:22:43,824 --> 01:22:44,994
My prince

2227
01:22:47,294 --> 01:22:49,634
(Chuckling)

2228
01:22:49,834 --> 01:22:51,363
(She continues to do the dance.)

2229
01:22:51,364 --> 01:22:52,534
Yes!

2230
01:22:52,764 --> 01:22:54,734
- This is how it really goes.
- She's right.

2231
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:58,804
(It doesn't count, but they dance "I Got a Boy" by Girls’ Generation.)

2232
01:22:59,004 --> 01:23:00,573
(They're good!)

2233
01:23:00,574 --> 01:23:02,143
(The Subway sandwiches are out.)

2234
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:03,943
- The next dish is...
- What's next?

2235
01:23:03,944 --> 01:23:05,343
(It's time for the next round.)

2236
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:07,013
(Exclaiming)

2237
01:23:07,014 --> 01:23:08,283
Isn't this a taco?

2238
01:23:08,284 --> 01:23:10,083
Yes, they're soft tacos.

2239
01:23:10,084 --> 01:23:11,323
We got soft tacos this time.

2240
01:23:11,324 --> 01:23:12,353
(Yu Jin is onto them.)

2241
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:13,754
Are these Mexican tacos?

2242
01:23:14,154 --> 01:23:15,824
You wrap them up and eat them.

2243
01:23:16,154 --> 01:23:17,723
I like softer tacos.

2244
01:23:17,724 --> 01:23:18,793
- Me too.
- I think it's better.

2245
01:23:18,794 --> 01:23:20,364
- I prefer it to the hard ones.
- Soft tacos.

2246
01:23:20,594 --> 01:23:21,664
Mimi, you should pick.

2247
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:25,004
Let's see.

2248
01:23:26,064 --> 01:23:27,473
Oh, we know this song!

2249
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:30,244
("Good Boy" by G-DRAGON and Taeyang)

2250
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:33,643
("Good Boy" by G-DRAGON and Taeyang)

2251
01:23:33,644 --> 01:23:36,543
(The song is famous for powerful waves and popping moves.)

2252
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:39,383
(The point dance is the bad boy hand gestures.)

2253
01:23:39,384 --> 01:23:40,683
You need to roll the noodles.

2254
01:23:40,684 --> 01:23:41,913
- From the right!
- Right first.

2255
01:23:41,914 --> 01:23:43,153
(Rolling them already)

2256
01:23:43,154 --> 01:23:44,523
You guys are confident.

2257
01:23:44,524 --> 01:23:46,024
What comes after this?

2258
01:23:46,224 --> 01:23:47,324
This move.

2259
01:23:47,924 --> 01:23:48,993
Got it, thanks.

2260
01:23:48,994 --> 01:23:50,964
(Ventriloquism learning)

2261
01:23:51,224 --> 01:23:53,023
We can just do it like G-DRAGON and Taeyang, right?

2262
01:23:53,024 --> 01:23:54,063
- Yes.
- Okay.

2263
01:23:54,064 --> 01:23:55,193
I got it.

2264
01:23:55,194 --> 01:23:56,904
- You like BigBang.
- Let's begin.

2265
01:23:57,134 --> 01:23:59,104
(She's getting in the mood.)

2266
01:23:59,604 --> 01:24:02,504
(She's going overboard with it.)

2267
01:24:04,404 --> 01:24:06,373
(Getting ready to roll the noodles)

2268
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,374
- Hey!
- Let's go!

2269
01:24:08,514 --> 01:24:10,084
(Waiting for the noodles)

2270
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:14,453
(They roll in perfect sync.)

2271
01:24:14,454 --> 01:24:15,454
- My gosh!
- That's great!

2272
01:24:15,514 --> 01:24:18,024
(A dance full of wrapped noodles)

2273
01:24:18,824 --> 01:24:20,524
- My gosh!
- That's great!

2274
01:24:21,854 --> 01:24:22,953
Slice!

2275
01:24:22,954 --> 01:24:25,594
(Thanks to Young Ji, they moved on to the next point dance.)

2276
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,264
Right!

2277
01:24:29,434 --> 01:24:30,434
(Right!)

2278
01:24:30,964 --> 01:24:31,964
- Wait!
- Mimi!

2279
01:24:31,965 --> 01:24:34,403
(She missed for a second, but got back on track.)

2280
01:24:34,404 --> 01:24:35,774
Your first warning!

2281
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:37,004
(Eun G-DRAGON)

2282
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:38,104
This part is freestyle.

2283
01:24:38,444 --> 01:24:40,444
(Tae Young Ji)

2284
01:24:40,674 --> 01:24:41,973
(They did make some mistakes.)

2285
01:24:41,974 --> 01:24:43,143
I'm not sure about this one.

2286
01:24:43,144 --> 01:24:44,444
- Okay.
- There were too many point dances.

2287
01:24:44,544 --> 01:24:46,014
You guys were shaky on some parts,

2288
01:24:46,484 --> 01:24:48,813
but you were mostly right. So you are successful!

2289
01:24:48,814 --> 01:24:50,424
(Success)

2290
01:24:51,184 --> 01:24:53,224
(Yu Jin quickly grabs the food, )

2291
01:24:53,424 --> 01:24:55,693
(and adds it to the pile.)

2292
01:24:55,694 --> 01:24:57,823
(Soft tacos acquired)

2293
01:24:57,824 --> 01:24:58,893
- Should I pick?
- The next food...

2294
01:24:58,894 --> 01:24:59,894
- The food.
- Wait.

2295
01:24:59,895 --> 01:25:01,863
(Here comes the next food.)

2296
01:25:01,864 --> 01:25:02,993
- It's kebab.
- Kebab!

2297
01:25:02,994 --> 01:25:04,333
- The next food is kebab.
- Kebab!

2298
01:25:04,334 --> 01:25:05,433
- Kebab.
- It looks yummy.

2299
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,733
- Please pick the next song.
- Young Ji!

2300
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:08,004
- Wait, I meant Eun Ji.
- Young Ji?

2301
01:25:09,334 --> 01:25:11,444
I hope it's a girl group song.

2302
01:25:11,944 --> 01:25:13,973
- Kebab.
- What is it?

2303
01:25:13,974 --> 01:25:16,373
- What is it?
- It's "Klaxon."

2304
01:25:16,374 --> 01:25:18,044
("Klaxon" by (G)I-DLE)

2305
01:25:18,544 --> 01:25:20,713
("Klaxon" by (G)I-DLE)

2306
01:25:20,714 --> 01:25:22,983
(It's a song with light beats that you can sway to.)

2307
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:25,253
(The point dance is moves like honking a car horn.)

2308
01:25:25,254 --> 01:25:26,624
I even did a challenge.

2309
01:25:27,854 --> 01:25:30,394
(The K-pop ghost also knows right away.)

2310
01:25:30,724 --> 01:25:32,663
- Start the music!
- Right away.

2311
01:25:32,664 --> 01:25:34,194
(Round 9, "Klaxon" by (G)I-DLE)

2312
01:25:34,564 --> 01:25:38,433
(The two members who did the challenge are relaxed.)

2313
01:25:38,434 --> 01:25:40,974
(Yu Jin just knows everything.)

2314
01:25:41,174 --> 01:25:46,343
(The chorus is coming up.)

2315
01:25:46,344 --> 01:25:47,774
I love you

2316
01:25:48,174 --> 01:25:50,413
(It's a different part from the challenge, so they're confused.)

2317
01:25:50,414 --> 01:25:52,484
Why is this part playing?

2318
01:25:52,844 --> 01:25:55,554
- Look at me, lady - Lady

2319
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:59,523
(They're just faking it until they make it with their skills.)

2320
01:25:59,524 --> 01:26:00,654
It's starting!

2321
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,594
(They're not bad.)

2322
01:26:06,264 --> 01:26:07,393
(When you start to get confused...)

2323
01:26:07,394 --> 01:26:09,264
Chest, chest, hips, honk!

2324
01:26:09,494 --> 01:26:11,834
(just do what Instructor Young Ji tells you to do.)

2325
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:14,434
Hips!

2326
01:26:14,434 --> 01:26:15,434
(Got it.)

2327
01:26:15,674 --> 01:26:17,473
(Nonchalantly controlling them)

2328
01:26:17,474 --> 01:26:19,704
- Chest, chest!
- Hit that klaxon

2329
01:26:20,244 --> 01:26:21,773
(They made it through the end.)

2330
01:26:21,774 --> 01:26:23,013
What should we do with this?

2331
01:26:23,014 --> 01:26:24,283
Mimi didn't get it at the beginning.

2332
01:26:24,284 --> 01:26:25,884
- Mimi...
- I didn't get that much wrong!

2333
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:28,214
(The beginning in question)

2334
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:30,084
- Baby - Why is this part playing?

2335
01:26:30,284 --> 01:26:33,754
(Actually, except for Yu Jin, )

2336
01:26:33,994 --> 01:26:36,253
(you were all wrong.)

2337
01:26:36,254 --> 01:26:37,263
(Kebab is out.)

2338
01:26:37,264 --> 01:26:38,294
Goodbye!

2339
01:26:39,224 --> 01:26:40,664
I think we need...

2340
01:26:41,064 --> 01:26:42,263
- more energy.
- I know.

2341
01:26:42,264 --> 01:26:43,763
- It's so...
- We're not...

2342
01:26:43,764 --> 01:26:46,003
- sweating enough right now.
- Right.

2343
01:26:46,004 --> 01:26:47,533
What kind of genre do you want?

2344
01:26:47,534 --> 01:26:48,534
Like...

2345
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:51,974
- "Whiplash!" - Yes, pick "Whiplash!"

2346
01:26:52,274 --> 01:26:53,343
I will.

2347
01:26:53,344 --> 01:26:54,444
- I'll pick that song.
- Do it for us.

2348
01:26:54,774 --> 01:26:55,943
We need to have this.

2349
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:57,144
(The next food is...)

2350
01:26:57,314 --> 01:26:58,813
- It's kebab loaded fries.
- Gosh.

2351
01:26:58,814 --> 01:26:59,844
They're potatoes.

2352
01:27:00,154 --> 01:27:02,254
I need some fries. We need to get this right.

2353
01:27:02,754 --> 01:27:05,324
Whiplash

2354
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:06,953
(Young Ji picks the next song.)

2355
01:27:06,954 --> 01:27:08,123
Whiplash Spirit.

2356
01:27:08,124 --> 01:27:09,394
- Whiplash Spirit!
- Whiplash

2357
01:27:10,094 --> 01:27:11,293
Whiplash

2358
01:27:11,294 --> 01:27:12,464
- This is insane.
- Goodness!

2359
01:27:13,594 --> 01:27:14,594
- This is insane.
- Goodness!

2360
01:27:14,595 --> 01:27:15,663
("Whiplash" by aespa in the flesh)

2361
01:27:15,664 --> 01:27:16,664
- She really did it!
- Wow!

2362
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,164
(Shocked)

2363
01:27:18,264 --> 01:27:19,264
(Taking a step back)

2364
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:20,603
- What's going on?
- Gosh!

2365
01:27:20,604 --> 01:27:21,773
(Frozen)

2366
01:27:21,774 --> 01:27:22,774
(Fluttering down)

2367
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:24,044
- Hey!
- What?

2368
01:27:24,174 --> 01:27:25,473
- Whiplash!
- Whiplash!

2369
01:27:25,474 --> 01:27:27,014
(The spirit came back after a while, )

2370
01:27:27,514 --> 01:27:30,013
(and the others start chanting right away.)

2371
01:27:30,014 --> 01:27:31,443
- Whiplash!
- Hey!

2372
01:27:31,444 --> 01:27:34,014
- The Whiplash Spirit is here!
- Hey!

2373
01:27:34,384 --> 01:27:36,583
- That was amazing.
- Let's begin.

2374
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:37,654
You're awesome, Young Ji.

2375
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:41,793
("Whiplash" by aespa)

2376
01:27:41,794 --> 01:27:45,123
(It's a song with hip-hop beats and powerful performances.)

2377
01:27:45,124 --> 01:27:48,434
(The key is the neck turning and controlled movements.)

2378
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:54,174
(The point dances come after a sudden shift in the music.)

2379
01:27:54,634 --> 01:27:57,404
- I don't know this one.
- It's okay, Eun Ji. You can do it!

2380
01:27:57,504 --> 01:27:58,643
- You got this.
- It's fine.

2381
01:27:58,644 --> 01:28:00,774
It's okay, Eun Ji. Just hit the neck.

2382
01:28:01,374 --> 01:28:03,384
- Start the music!
- Let's go!

2383
01:28:05,444 --> 01:28:06,644
Do we start with the neck?

2384
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:08,654
- Is it the neck?
- Yes, the neck.

2385
01:28:08,984 --> 01:28:10,153
Guys, the neck.

2386
01:28:10,154 --> 01:28:11,954
(Everyone's ready except for 1 person.)

2387
01:28:12,224 --> 01:28:13,254
Let's go!

2388
01:28:14,624 --> 01:28:16,794
(Exclaiming)

2389
01:28:16,994 --> 01:28:19,064
(Her expression changed as soon as the music started.)

2390
01:28:19,424 --> 01:28:20,994
(Puppy An turned chic.)

2391
01:28:21,064 --> 01:28:22,393
(They're smooth sailing.)

2392
01:28:22,394 --> 01:28:23,403
You guys are so cool.

2393
01:28:23,404 --> 01:28:26,363
(Mimi is relaxed, too.)

2394
01:28:26,364 --> 01:28:27,373
Push!

2395
01:28:27,374 --> 01:28:29,804
(Random Play Dance Group since 2022)

2396
01:28:29,934 --> 01:28:30,943
Head!

2397
01:28:30,944 --> 01:28:32,343
(A complicated hand dance...)

2398
01:28:32,344 --> 01:28:33,844
(is copied right away with just a glance.)

2399
01:28:34,244 --> 01:28:35,613
Heads.

2400
01:28:35,614 --> 01:28:36,614
From the right?

2401
01:28:36,615 --> 01:28:37,713
(Confused the part)

2402
01:28:37,714 --> 01:28:39,013
(Suddenly changing their strategy)

2403
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:40,014
Lean!

2404
01:28:40,015 --> 01:28:42,114
(He didn't even notice it.)

2405
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,053
- You come this way.
- Okay.

2406
01:28:44,054 --> 01:28:45,623
- Young Ji!
- I'll be WINTER.

2407
01:28:45,624 --> 01:28:46,723
Everyone behind Young Ji!

2408
01:28:46,724 --> 01:28:49,224
(While Young Ji does the performances...)

2409
01:28:49,354 --> 01:28:50,593
Who's going to be GISELLE?

2410
01:28:50,594 --> 01:28:51,693
- Yu Jin!
- I'll do it!

2411
01:28:51,694 --> 01:28:53,433
- Yu Jin is GISELLE!
- I'll go to the left!

2412
01:28:53,434 --> 01:28:54,963
- I'll be on the left.
- Then I'll be on the right!

2413
01:28:54,964 --> 01:28:57,004
(This is their first time doing this dance.)

2414
01:29:03,374 --> 01:29:05,173
(They're unbelievably synced...)

2415
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:07,114
(considering their lack of practice.)

2416
01:29:08,314 --> 01:29:10,044
- Wow!
- Push!

2417
01:29:10,744 --> 01:29:13,654
(When confused, go back to basics.)

2418
01:29:14,514 --> 01:29:16,314
- Is it the neck?
- Let's go!

2419
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,954
(The idol's "Whiplash")

2420
01:29:21,124 --> 01:29:22,824
(The comedienne's "Whiplash")

2421
01:29:24,264 --> 01:29:26,094
(Their dance is perfectly timed.)

2422
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:27,864
(Relaxed)

2423
01:29:28,564 --> 01:29:31,204
(Eun Ji is getting a bit confused.)

2424
01:29:31,434 --> 01:29:33,504
(Yu Jin spotted her.)

2425
01:29:33,774 --> 01:29:35,333
(There were some little mistakes.)

2426
01:29:35,334 --> 01:29:38,144
I think this was a success. Success!

2427
01:29:38,274 --> 01:29:40,114
- Yes!
- Thank you.

2428
01:29:40,314 --> 01:29:41,343
- E-cade.
- Thank you.

2429
01:29:41,344 --> 01:29:42,613
(Chanting)

2430
01:29:42,614 --> 01:29:45,184
- E-cade!
- E-cade!

2431
01:29:45,484 --> 01:29:46,953
(Everyone's excited.)

2432
01:29:46,954 --> 01:29:48,854
- You guys were amazing.
- This is great.

2433
01:29:49,214 --> 01:29:50,883
- So amazing!
- GISELLE and WINTER.

2434
01:29:50,884 --> 01:29:51,923
- That was...
- Gosh.

2435
01:29:51,924 --> 01:29:53,454
- Hi, WINTER!
- Nice to see you, GISELLE.

2436
01:29:54,224 --> 01:29:55,323
We didn't even practice.

2437
01:29:55,324 --> 01:29:57,063
You guys were great together.

2438
01:29:57,064 --> 01:29:58,694
We didn't do this dance once.

2439
01:29:58,794 --> 01:30:00,694
But do you know how it looks from the very back?

2440
01:30:00,764 --> 01:30:01,934
Eun Ji, left?

2441
01:30:02,134 --> 01:30:03,734
Are you going right?

2442
01:30:04,404 --> 01:30:05,503
(Who's going to be GISELLE?)

2443
01:30:05,504 --> 01:30:06,504
(Yu Jin?)

2444
01:30:06,764 --> 01:30:07,933
(Yu Jin is GISELLE!)

2445
01:30:07,934 --> 01:30:08,934
(Face pressed in)

2446
01:30:08,935 --> 01:30:10,274
(I'll be on the right!)

2447
01:30:10,404 --> 01:30:12,243
(After 7 seconds of discussing, )

2448
01:30:12,244 --> 01:30:14,744
(aespa arrived.)

2449
01:30:15,544 --> 01:30:17,744
We weren't able to see all that.

2450
01:30:18,244 --> 01:30:19,513
Could you recreate that?

2451
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:21,113
- The moment Young Ji stepped up...
- Okay.

2452
01:30:21,114 --> 01:30:22,683
- So this is the front.
- Right.

2453
01:30:22,684 --> 01:30:24,453
Let's start.

2454
01:30:24,454 --> 01:30:27,554
(While Young Ji was doing her dance, )

2455
01:30:27,854 --> 01:30:29,593
Hey, Mimi. I'll be on the left.

2456
01:30:29,594 --> 01:30:30,763
- I'll go left.
- No, Eun Ji. Go right.

2457
01:30:30,764 --> 01:30:31,794
- I should go right?
- I'll be left.

2458
01:30:31,994 --> 01:30:33,123
(Chaos behind Young Ji)

2459
01:30:33,124 --> 01:30:34,933
- Okay.
- Good.

2460
01:30:34,934 --> 01:30:37,203
(The moment is coming up.)

2461
01:30:37,204 --> 01:30:38,264
- Boom!
- Let's go!

2462
01:30:41,034 --> 01:30:44,404
(This is what 4 years of teamwork looks like.)

2463
01:30:44,874 --> 01:30:46,914
(Eun Ji and Young Ji are popping out.)

2464
01:30:47,844 --> 01:30:50,014
That was amazing.

2465
01:30:50,584 --> 01:30:52,844
It's so fun to watch from the back.

2466
01:30:53,554 --> 01:30:55,584
(Kebab loaded fries acquired)

2467
01:30:55,884 --> 01:30:56,983
We got a lot.

2468
01:30:56,984 --> 01:30:58,484
(While Eun Ji brought the food to the pile, )

2469
01:30:58,754 --> 01:30:59,754
It's ice cream!

2470
01:30:59,755 --> 01:31:01,453
(the next food arrives.)

2471
01:31:01,454 --> 01:31:03,324
- It's ice cream?
- I must have it.

2472
01:31:03,864 --> 01:31:05,164
I have to eat it.

2473
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:07,733
We got them from a local store here.

2474
01:31:07,734 --> 01:31:09,294
It's local ice cream!

2475
01:31:09,494 --> 01:31:11,104
- Let's do the ice cream first.
- Okay.

2476
01:31:11,204 --> 01:31:12,264
Please pick the song.

2477
01:31:12,704 --> 01:31:14,473
- Do I go?
- Spirit of aespa.

2478
01:31:14,474 --> 01:31:15,504
Aespa.

2479
01:31:15,874 --> 01:31:17,273
Supernova!

2480
01:31:17,274 --> 01:31:19,304
(The song they want is aespa's "Supernova.")

2481
01:31:19,704 --> 01:31:23,244
(Is the aespa Spirit here with them?)

2482
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:24,943
- Oh?
- That's good.

2483
01:31:24,944 --> 01:31:26,283
- Great.
- Good.

2484
01:31:26,284 --> 01:31:28,054
("Fast Forward" by Jeon So Mi)

2485
01:31:28,314 --> 01:31:29,784
The spirit was trying to give us this song!

2486
01:31:30,854 --> 01:31:32,623
("Fast Forward" by Jeon So Mi)

2487
01:31:32,624 --> 01:31:34,693
(The song has bouncy beats, )

2488
01:31:34,694 --> 01:31:36,693
(with tecktonik elements in the choreography.)

2489
01:31:36,694 --> 01:31:38,594
(The points are arm movements and fast steps.)

2490
01:31:38,724 --> 01:31:40,233
- Eun Ji, just do this.
- This is tecktonik.

2491
01:31:40,234 --> 01:31:41,333
- You're good with this, Eun Ji.
- Right, tecktonik.

2492
01:31:41,334 --> 01:31:42,334
I'm very good.

2493
01:31:42,335 --> 01:31:44,104
(Everyone seems to be familiar with the song.)

2494
01:31:44,464 --> 01:31:46,563
- Start the music!
- Our formation is weird.

2495
01:31:46,564 --> 01:31:47,904
(Round 11, "Fast Forward" by Jeon So Mi)

2496
01:31:53,644 --> 01:31:55,873
(Despite the fast beats, )

2497
01:31:55,874 --> 01:31:58,614
(their dance is synced perfectly.)

2498
01:31:58,844 --> 01:32:01,053
(The next dance is almost like doing makeup.)

2499
01:32:01,054 --> 01:32:02,054
Putting the makeup on.

2500
01:32:02,055 --> 01:32:04,424
(Everyone is powdering normally, except...)

2501
01:32:05,284 --> 01:32:07,694
Hey, Lee Young Ji!

2502
01:32:08,054 --> 01:32:09,124
What?

2503
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:11,694
It's perfect. We were perfect.

2504
01:32:12,064 --> 01:32:14,193
(That detail was inspiring.)

2505
01:32:14,194 --> 01:32:16,034
- That was perfect.
- Hey.

2506
01:32:16,394 --> 01:32:17,533
Success!

2507
01:32:17,534 --> 01:32:18,564
Okay!

2508
01:32:18,904 --> 01:32:20,534
You are successful, but...

2509
01:32:21,134 --> 01:32:24,203
one of you brushed your teeth while putting makeup on.

2510
01:32:24,204 --> 01:32:25,343
But it's necessary.

2511
01:32:25,344 --> 01:32:26,543
- She's absolutely right.
- It's realistic.

2512
01:32:26,544 --> 01:32:28,114
I'm sure Jeon So Mi wanted this, too.

2513
01:32:28,214 --> 01:32:29,243
(Realistic)

2514
01:32:29,244 --> 01:32:30,244
I'm serious.

2515
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:32,613
You put makeup on, check your teeth,

2516
01:32:32,614 --> 01:32:34,453
- and perfume yourself.
- Right.

2517
01:32:34,454 --> 01:32:36,913
Why would you check your teeth while putting makeup on?

2518
01:32:36,914 --> 01:32:37,923
Your lipstick gets on your teeth.

2519
01:32:37,924 --> 01:32:39,023
Oh, it does?

2520
01:32:39,024 --> 01:32:41,393
This is important. It's embarrassing when someone else tells you.

2521
01:32:41,394 --> 01:32:43,453
- I see.
- You give it a sweep.

2522
01:32:43,454 --> 01:32:45,424
(Ice cream acquired)

2523
01:32:45,564 --> 01:32:49,733
We just have three dishes remaining.

2524
01:32:49,734 --> 01:32:50,763
Three!

2525
01:32:50,764 --> 01:32:52,633
- The last three dishes...
- Only three left?

2526
01:32:52,634 --> 01:32:54,004
- That's a shame.
- cannot be presented here.

2527
01:32:54,134 --> 01:32:55,204
- Why?
- What?

2528
01:32:55,734 --> 01:32:57,573
But if you do succeed in each round,

2529
01:32:57,574 --> 01:32:58,604
(Could it be?)

2530
01:32:58,644 --> 01:33:00,543
our chef will make the dish on the spot.

2531
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,714
Could it be?

2532
01:33:02,044 --> 01:33:03,113
Is it really?

2533
01:33:03,114 --> 01:33:05,114
Introducing Chef Choi...

2534
01:33:05,214 --> 01:33:06,883
(Writer Choi Jae Yeong, 32 years of ramyeon experience)

2535
01:33:06,884 --> 01:33:08,984
(He recently defeated Young Ji in competition.)

2536
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:12,923
and his ramyeon, jjajang ramyeon, and bibim ramyeon.

2537
01:33:12,924 --> 01:33:14,023
My gosh!

2538
01:33:14,024 --> 01:33:15,453
- We need this.
- Definitely.

2539
01:33:15,454 --> 01:33:17,623
- We have to win.
- This is the endgame.

2540
01:33:17,624 --> 01:33:19,993
We need to pick a good song.

2541
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:21,864
- We have to win.
- I want jjajang...

2542
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:23,563
Calm down, Yu Jin.

2543
01:33:23,564 --> 01:33:27,234
I really wanted to have the jjajang ramyeon.

2544
01:33:27,304 --> 01:33:30,204
Yu Jin has been talking about his ramyeon for days now.

2545
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:31,404
- Wait.
- Yu Jin...

2546
01:33:31,874 --> 01:33:33,504
Please hear Young Ji out.

2547
01:33:33,644 --> 01:33:34,974
"I'm a bit upset."

2548
01:33:35,014 --> 01:33:37,044
(Oops)

2549
01:33:37,114 --> 01:33:40,014
She ran around like she had won the lottery.

2550
01:33:40,714 --> 01:33:42,184
I don't need to have it.

2551
01:33:42,254 --> 01:33:43,724
- But I'd love to have it.
- Right!

2552
01:33:44,454 --> 01:33:45,854
(Sorry, Young Ji.)

2553
01:33:45,924 --> 01:33:48,253
Then how about we make the first round simple...

2554
01:33:48,254 --> 01:33:50,153
with just ramyeon?

2555
01:33:50,154 --> 01:33:51,793
- Okay.
- Any one of them is good.

2556
01:33:51,794 --> 01:33:53,093
Then this round is ramyeon.

2557
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:54,134
- Okay.
- Got it.

2558
01:33:54,164 --> 01:33:55,994
I sent "Supernova" vibes to Eun Ji.

2559
01:33:56,264 --> 01:33:57,733
- I sent it to you, Eun Ji.
- You did?

2560
01:33:57,734 --> 01:33:59,434
- The spirit is inside you.
- I'll feel it out.

2561
01:33:59,464 --> 01:34:01,004
It's there. You'll pick that song.

2562
01:34:01,234 --> 01:34:02,634
- It's there.
- Great.

2563
01:34:02,934 --> 01:34:04,174
- The spirit is there.
- Gosh.

2564
01:34:04,244 --> 01:34:06,274
- It's that one.
- Yes, that one.

2565
01:34:06,604 --> 01:34:08,714
(Eun Ji picked a song.)

2566
01:34:11,384 --> 01:34:14,454
(Everyone is shocked by the results.)

2567
01:34:14,554 --> 01:34:16,153
("Supernova" by aespa)

2568
01:34:16,154 --> 01:34:17,584
- Young Ji!
- What's happening to you?

2569
01:34:17,684 --> 01:34:19,024
- What's wrong?
- Young Ji!

2570
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:21,293
(Everyone gathers around the Clock Spirit.)

2571
01:34:21,294 --> 01:34:22,723
- What is this?
- Goodness!

2572
01:34:22,724 --> 01:34:23,794
I got chills.

2573
01:34:24,224 --> 01:34:26,894
(The spirit can't believe this, either.)

2574
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:32,164
(It is getting too spooky, so it should stop.)

2575
01:34:32,404 --> 01:34:33,834
She said she sent the spirit to me.

2576
01:34:34,174 --> 01:34:35,603
- She's the real thing.
- My gosh.

2577
01:34:35,604 --> 01:34:37,373
(While everyone is still in shock, )

2578
01:34:37,374 --> 01:34:39,044
(Yu Jin starts practicing on her own.)

2579
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,813
All she has on her mind is ramyeon.

2580
01:34:40,814 --> 01:34:42,344
(In the zone)

2581
01:34:42,674 --> 01:34:44,184
(So cute)

2582
01:34:45,014 --> 01:34:47,154
We're going to check how good you guys are.

("Supernova" by aespa)

2585
01:34:55,854 --> 01:34:58,223
(This very addictive song has straight arm movements...)

2586
01:34:58,224 --> 01:35:01,063
(matched with the song, and another point is the mismatch...)

2587
01:35:01,064 --> 01:35:03,834

01:35:07,004 --> 01:35:08,134
We can get this.

2591
01:35:08,704 --> 01:35:12,374
(This round is very important to...)

2592
01:35:12,744 --> 01:35:16,244
(all those who want ramyeon desperately.)

2593
01:35:19,484 --> 01:35:20,614
- Wow!
- My gosh.

2594
01:35:20,814 --> 01:35:22,854
(Ramyeon is imminent Ah Oh Ay)

2595
01:35:24,954 --> 01:35:26,924
(Everyone kicks and turns at the same time.)

2596
01:35:27,324 --> 01:35:28,994
(Relaxed)

2597
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:30,964
(They all got to the main dance without an issue.)

2598
01:35:31,124 --> 01:35:34,594
(But Eun Ji is starting to run out of moves she knows.)

2599
01:35:36,834 --> 01:35:38,003
(Where did we come from Oh Ay)

2600
01:35:38,004 --> 01:35:39,134
Abu Dhabi!

2601
01:35:39,834 --> 01:35:40,834
Abu Dhabi!

2602
01:35:41,004 --> 01:35:42,403
(An acceptable ending pose)

2603
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:44,004
(But it isn't over.)

2604
01:35:45,344 --> 01:35:47,244
(She really has no idea now.)

2605
01:35:50,214 --> 01:35:52,213
(So she picks a fight with the camera instead.)

2606
01:35:52,214 --> 01:35:54,654
(These two are engaged in a pillow fight.)

2607
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:59,054
(Anyone ask for a pot?)

2608
01:35:59,384 --> 01:36:01,954
(Chaotic)

2609
01:36:02,354 --> 01:36:04,224
(We have no idea what they're doing, )

2610
01:36:05,024 --> 01:36:06,463
(but we're scared to say that they failed.)

2611
01:36:06,464 --> 01:36:07,763
Success?

2612
01:36:07,764 --> 01:36:08,764
Definitely successful.

2613
01:36:08,765 --> 01:36:09,894
Success!

2614
01:36:11,704 --> 01:36:12,864
This was...

2615
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:16,373
hard to see as a clean win.

2616
01:36:16,374 --> 01:36:17,903
- Our judges were...
- Is that so?

2617
01:36:17,904 --> 01:36:19,944
Talking about calling this a fail.

2618
01:36:20,244 --> 01:36:22,243
- But your teamwork was so good.
- Thank you.

2619
01:36:22,244 --> 01:36:23,344
- Perfect.
- So I say this was successful!

2620
01:36:24,514 --> 01:36:26,584
That's that, but...

2621
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:28,583
you should only bring that...

2622
01:36:28,584 --> 01:36:30,524
after we say "success."

2623
01:36:30,984 --> 01:36:32,784
Should we turn the stove on?

2624
01:36:33,384 --> 01:36:35,054
Jae Yeong's ramyeon is...

2625
01:36:35,754 --> 01:36:36,793
(Sighing)

2626
01:36:36,794 --> 01:36:39,463
How are you? Are you a little upset, or...

2627
01:36:39,464 --> 01:36:40,494
No, not at all.

2628
01:36:40,664 --> 01:36:42,294
(She's definitely not upset.)

2629
01:36:42,464 --> 01:36:44,733
We'll move on to the next round, jjajang ramyeon.

2630
01:36:44,734 --> 01:36:47,634
- I really want this one.
- Jjajang ramyeon.

2631
01:36:47,734 --> 01:36:49,933
- I really want this, Eun Ji.
- "Supernova" should've been here.

2632
01:36:49,934 --> 01:36:51,303
- I got chills when you picked that.
- Eun Ji, but...

2633
01:36:51,304 --> 01:36:52,944
"Plot Twist" should be in there.

2634
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:55,774
Right, we might pick it soon.

2635
01:36:55,974 --> 01:36:57,284
I sent the spirit to Yu Jin.

2636
01:36:57,444 --> 01:36:58,684
Pick "Plot Twist."

2637
01:36:59,544 --> 01:37:01,383
Don't you have "Come A Come" by Chakra?

2638
01:37:01,384 --> 01:37:04,624
(Born in 1992, not good with new songs)

2639
01:37:04,854 --> 01:37:06,584
(Eun Ji got excited.)

2640
01:37:06,824 --> 01:37:08,924
(Producer Na knows that one, too.)

2641
01:37:09,054 --> 01:37:10,393
Did you really pick...

2642
01:37:10,394 --> 01:37:12,093
("Magnetic" by ILLIT)

2643
01:37:12,094 --> 01:37:13,124
- Oh!
- It's even better!

2644
01:37:15,094 --> 01:37:17,163
("Magnetic" by ILLIT)

2645
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:19,403
(This bright song focuses on the emotions of a school girl.)

2646
01:37:19,404 --> 01:37:22,204
(The point dance is the addictive hand gestures.)

2647
01:37:22,634 --> 01:37:23,733
(Smiling right away)

2648
01:37:23,734 --> 01:37:25,303
- Oh!
- It's even better!

2649
01:37:25,304 --> 01:37:29,644
(Eun Ji already did the challenge.)

2650
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:31,943
Guys, can you do this song...

2651
01:37:31,944 --> 01:37:34,984
with innocence and elegance?

2652
01:37:35,084 --> 01:37:36,684
(We're ready!)

2653
01:37:36,714 --> 01:37:38,854
Eun Ji, this is the Gen Z style.

2654
01:37:39,154 --> 01:37:40,824
(Eun Z is ready.)

2655
01:37:40,924 --> 01:37:41,993
Let's begin.

2656
01:37:41,994 --> 01:37:43,024
(The jjajang ramyeon round, "Magnetic" by ILLIT)

2657
01:37:43,294 --> 01:37:45,594
(Innocent Eun Ji is waiting for the song.)

2658
01:37:45,694 --> 01:37:47,763
(She is playing innocent.)

2659
01:37:47,764 --> 01:37:49,894
(At least, we think she is.)

2660
01:37:50,194 --> 01:37:54,134
(Mimi also doesn't know how to play innocence.)

2661
01:37:58,974 --> 01:38:00,714
(All members are doing the same dance, )

2662
01:38:00,874 --> 01:38:02,814
(except for Young Ji.)

2663
01:38:03,144 --> 01:38:04,514
Hey, Lee Young Ji!

2664
01:38:04,684 --> 01:38:08,483
(The real choreograph in the first verse)

2665
01:38:08,484 --> 01:38:12,254
(The real choreograph in the second verse)

2666
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:14,424
(Young Ji did the dance for...)

2667
01:38:14,554 --> 01:38:16,394
(the first verse.)

2668
01:38:16,454 --> 01:38:18,394
(While others did the dance for...)

2669
01:38:18,424 --> 01:38:20,634
(the second verse.)

2670
01:38:20,764 --> 01:38:22,964
(He thought Young Ji got it wrong.)

2671
01:38:23,834 --> 01:38:25,503
(But she caught up quickly.)

2672
01:38:25,504 --> 01:38:26,534
Together!

2673
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:30,844
(Looking around to copy)

2674
01:38:30,904 --> 01:38:33,243
(Watch closely!)

2675
01:38:33,244 --> 01:38:34,374
- Let's go!
- Yes!

2676
01:38:35,474 --> 01:38:37,614
(They're getting more synced up.)

2677
01:38:38,444 --> 01:38:40,484
(Confidence boost)

2678
01:38:41,754 --> 01:38:44,154
(But after that part, she's unsure of the dance.)

2679
01:38:45,124 --> 01:38:48,524
(The moves become suspiciously repetitive.)

2680
01:38:48,724 --> 01:38:52,464
(And their hand gestures look too old to be a school girl's.)

2681
01:38:52,594 --> 01:38:55,094
Wait a minute!

2682
01:38:55,134 --> 01:38:56,964
The two on the very end...

2683
01:38:57,134 --> 01:38:58,504
were good, but...

2684
01:38:59,664 --> 01:39:01,874
(Trying to get the laughter points)

2685
01:39:02,004 --> 01:39:03,304
What's the problem?

2686
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:05,773
If the two in the middle succeed,

2687
01:39:05,774 --> 01:39:06,904
the jjajang ramyeon is yours.

2688
01:39:07,204 --> 01:39:09,174
- Judges, watch closely.
- Okay.

2689
01:39:09,374 --> 01:39:10,743
Let's be cute.

2690
01:39:10,744 --> 01:39:11,784
(Checking round, "Magnetic" by ILLIT)

2691
01:39:11,884 --> 01:39:16,314
(They're starting with some facial expressions.)

2692
01:39:19,124 --> 01:39:20,693
(Will they be able to pull off the chorus part?)

2693
01:39:20,694 --> 01:39:21,794
You got this!

2694
01:39:24,624 --> 01:39:26,464
(Everything's different.)

2695
01:39:26,864 --> 01:39:28,093
(They fumble their way through...)

2696
01:39:28,094 --> 01:39:30,134
(until they reach a part they know.)

2697
01:39:31,464 --> 01:39:33,763
- Go! That's right!
- Gosh.

2698
01:39:33,764 --> 01:39:36,033
(They slowly start to harmonize.)

2699
01:39:36,034 --> 01:39:37,034
You're doing great!

2700
01:39:37,035 --> 01:39:38,104
- Let's go.
- Just one more time!

2701
01:39:38,504 --> 01:39:40,644
(Let's get that jjajang ramyeon!)

2702
01:39:40,814 --> 01:39:43,044
(Suddenly they're synced perfectly.)

2703
01:39:43,374 --> 01:39:45,284
(Two innocent school girls)

2704
01:39:45,384 --> 01:39:48,914
(Laughing)

2705
01:39:48,954 --> 01:39:49,983
Let's go!

2706
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,654
(One more time)

2707
01:39:51,924 --> 01:39:53,524
(Posing)

2708
01:39:54,994 --> 01:39:56,923
(And the perfect finale)

2709
01:39:56,924 --> 01:39:58,894
- Success!
- Yes!

2710
01:39:59,864 --> 01:40:01,963
- You guys were great!
- I know!

2711
01:40:01,964 --> 01:40:03,833
- Good work, you guys.
- Wait.

2712
01:40:03,834 --> 01:40:05,033
These comic duos...

2713
01:40:05,034 --> 01:40:07,164
make it hard for us to say "fail."

2714
01:40:07,204 --> 01:40:09,604
(Jjajang ramyeon acquired)

2715
01:40:09,834 --> 01:40:11,943
You won the jjajang ramyeon as well.

2716
01:40:11,944 --> 01:40:12,974
- My gosh.
- Yes.

2717
01:40:13,044 --> 01:40:15,143
If you guys win the last bibim ramyeon, too...

2718
01:40:15,144 --> 01:40:16,643
it'll be a total festival today.

2719
01:40:16,644 --> 01:40:18,143
- Should we start the round?
- Okay!

2720
01:40:18,144 --> 01:40:20,584
We don't even need the food. Let's just keep going.

2721
01:40:21,614 --> 01:40:23,184
- Aren't you guys tired?
- Not at all.

2722
01:40:23,214 --> 01:40:24,353
Is it "Plot Twist?"

2723
01:40:24,354 --> 01:40:25,354
It's "Smoke."

2724
01:40:26,024 --> 01:40:27,054
("Smoke" by Dynamic Duo and Lee Young Ji)

2725
01:40:28,354 --> 01:40:30,253
("Smoke" by Dynamic Duo and Lee Young Ji)

2726
01:40:30,254 --> 01:40:32,563
(This song was huge in 2023 with dance challenges.)

2727
01:40:32,564 --> 01:40:35,564
(The intro with the lighter and the hook are the key.)

2728
01:40:35,934 --> 01:40:38,033
(SEVENTEEN and V did the challenge, too.)

2729
01:40:38,034 --> 01:40:40,464
(It was the top trend challenge in 2023.)

2730
01:40:40,664 --> 01:40:42,273
(More than anything, Young Ji participated in the song!)

2731
01:40:42,274 --> 01:40:45,373
(This is Young Ji.)

2732
01:40:45,374 --> 01:40:46,504
- All of us can do it.
- Okay.

2733
01:40:47,544 --> 01:40:49,373
- We need to start from the back.
- Okay.

2734
01:40:49,374 --> 01:40:50,514
Turn around and command the stage.

2735
01:40:53,584 --> 01:40:55,514
(Did you call for me?)

2736
01:40:55,614 --> 01:40:56,983
(Playing a guard)

2737
01:40:56,984 --> 01:40:57,984
Shake off your body.

2738
01:40:59,384 --> 01:41:00,424
Lighter.

2739
01:41:03,294 --> 01:41:04,764
(They're pretty in sync.)

2740
01:41:06,064 --> 01:41:08,994
(Meanwhile, Mimi is doing a great job.)

2741
01:41:09,194 --> 01:41:12,464
(Young Ji and Yu Jin are doing well too.)

2742
01:41:15,504 --> 01:41:16,733
(After flapping around, )

2743
01:41:16,734 --> 01:41:18,544
(Eun Ji lost the flow.)

2744
01:41:18,644 --> 01:41:20,444
(Mimi shows the class of the main dancer.)

2745
01:41:23,244 --> 01:41:24,413
That's cool.

2746
01:41:24,414 --> 01:41:25,683
(Yu Jin shows a heart.)

2747
01:41:25,684 --> 01:41:27,414
(The production crew laughs.)

2748
01:41:30,454 --> 01:41:33,424
(She stays true to the lyrics.)

2749
01:41:33,524 --> 01:41:35,654
(Let's stop here.)

2750
01:41:35,754 --> 01:41:37,053
(You're watching...)

2751
01:41:37,054 --> 01:41:39,224
(the comedienne who is acting out the lyrics...)

2752
01:41:39,324 --> 01:41:41,234
(and Father Na who has to stop her.)

2753
01:41:41,334 --> 01:41:43,294
(Eun Ji?)

2754
01:41:43,964 --> 01:41:45,303
(He blocks the cameras for the first time in history.)

2755
01:41:45,304 --> 01:41:47,774
I mean...

2756
01:41:48,074 --> 01:41:51,173
- What are you doing?
- I mean, we were laughing.

2757
01:41:51,174 --> 01:41:53,744
We were playing, okay?

2758
01:41:55,444 --> 01:41:58,414
- Gosh, that was so funny.
- It was hilarious.

2759
01:41:58,844 --> 01:42:00,583
- Don't do that.
- Okay.

2760
01:42:00,584 --> 01:42:02,284
- Don't do that.
- Okay.

2761
01:42:03,354 --> 01:42:05,484
(A model example)

2762
01:42:06,254 --> 01:42:08,624
(They acquire bibim ramyeon.)

2763
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:11,724
Well done.

2764
01:42:12,564 --> 01:42:14,934
- It was so much fun.
- Thank you.

2765
01:42:15,764 --> 01:42:16,863
It was very fun.

2766
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:19,303
When should we have the chef ready?

2767
01:42:19,304 --> 01:42:21,604

01:42:25,974 --> 01:42:26,974
Chef Choi, thank you.

2771
01:42:26,975 --> 01:42:28,444
Writer Choi Jae Yeong is so cool.

2772
01:42:29,044 --> 01:42:31,114
(Chef Jae Yeong begins to cook.)

2773
01:42:31,214 --> 01:42:33,884
(He begins with bibim ramyeon since it doesn't get soggy.)

2774
01:42:36,084 --> 01:42:38,224
(He uses ice water to bring out the chewiness.)

2775
01:42:38,654 --> 01:42:40,084
(Producer Na joins in.)

2776
01:42:40,424 --> 01:42:43,524
(While Producer Na does the easy task, )

2777
01:42:43,994 --> 01:42:46,124
(Chef Choi adds something to the jjajang ramyeon.)

2778
01:42:47,394 --> 01:42:49,134
(It's gochujang!)

2779
01:42:49,564 --> 01:42:54,674
(He adds dried laver flakes to ramyeon.)

2780
01:42:55,334 --> 01:42:58,974
(He's making the most out of the limited ingredients.)

2781
01:42:59,444 --> 01:43:01,474
(Chef Jae Yeong works with 2 pots.)

2782
01:43:02,174 --> 01:43:05,344
(The ramyeon boils.)

2783
01:43:06,884 --> 01:43:08,153
(Chef Jae Yeong's dish is complete.)

2784
01:43:08,154 --> 01:43:12,323
I smell ramyeon. Gosh, he's plating it.

2785
01:43:12,324 --> 01:43:14,053
Gosh, thank you so much.

2786
01:43:14,054 --> 01:43:15,223
This is incredible.

2787
01:43:15,224 --> 01:43:17,393
- Choi Jae Yeong!
- Writer Choi Jae Yeong!

2788
01:43:17,394 --> 01:43:18,463

2790
01:43:20,794 --> 01:43:22,733
- Thank you so much.
- Choi Jae Yeong.

2791
01:43:22,734 --> 01:43:24,634
- Choi Jae Yeong!
- Writer!

2792
01:43:26,134 --> 01:43:27,934
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food!

2793
01:43:28,074 --> 01:43:29,733
- Choi Jae Yeong!
- I like these noodles.

2794
01:43:29,734 --> 01:43:30,734
Writer!

2795
01:43:31,444 --> 01:43:32,474
- Good.
- This is insane.

2796
01:43:33,944 --> 01:43:34,944
Look at this.

2797
01:43:35,774 --> 01:43:36,774
(Impressed)

2798
01:43:37,014 --> 01:43:39,413
(The corners of her mouth turn up.)

2799
01:43:39,414 --> 01:43:40,414
Is it tasty?

2800
01:43:40,415 --> 01:43:41,814
(Nodding)

2801
01:43:42,314 --> 01:43:44,824
It's the consistency I love.

2802
01:43:44,984 --> 01:43:46,954
(Clapping endlessly)

2803
01:43:47,254 --> 01:43:49,194
(Mimi quietly slurps the noodles.)

2804
01:43:49,454 --> 01:43:51,824
This is incredible. This is insane.

2805
01:43:53,124 --> 01:43:55,863
- How does he cook them so well?
- He doesn't disappoint.

2806
01:43:55,864 --> 01:43:56,964
- I know.
- It's so fascinating.

2807
01:43:57,594 --> 01:43:59,603
- It's so tasty.
- Master Young Ji, how is it?

2808
01:43:59,604 --> 01:44:00,804
I'm not a master.

2809
01:44:01,134 --> 01:44:02,473
Writer Choi Jae Yeong is.

2810
01:44:02,474 --> 01:44:03,833
(Bibim ramyeon master from 2002 to 2025)

2811
01:44:03,834 --> 01:44:04,844
It's so tasty.

2812
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:09,674
(She works her chopsticks nonstop.)

2813
01:44:10,214 --> 01:44:11,214
(My goodness)

2814
01:44:11,214 --> 01:44:12,214
(Her eyes are glazed over.)

2815
01:44:12,215 --> 01:44:13,814
- It's unbelievable.
- It's insane.

2816
01:44:14,384 --> 01:44:15,654
It's so tasty.

2817
01:44:16,854 --> 01:44:18,253
(This is it.)

2818
01:44:18,254 --> 01:44:19,984
- How is it?
- The burger is so tasty.

2819
01:44:20,454 --> 01:44:21,454
Fries with bacon.

2820
01:44:21,455 --> 01:44:24,154
(Mimi tries the fries.)

2821
01:44:24,524 --> 01:44:26,724
(She enjoys bibim ramyeon as well.)

2822
01:44:27,024 --> 01:44:28,494
Bibim ramyeon is no joke.

2823
01:44:29,164 --> 01:44:32,364
(They enjoy various food items.)

2824
01:44:32,464 --> 01:44:36,634
(She's crazy about jjajang ramyeon.)

2825
01:44:36,734 --> 01:44:38,973
(Laughing)

2826
01:44:38,974 --> 01:44:40,604
Yu Jin only focuses on one item.

2827
01:44:42,474 --> 01:44:43,643
(She focuses on jjajang ramyeon.)

2828
01:44:43,644 --> 01:44:44,744
It's okay.

2829
01:44:45,484 --> 01:44:47,383
How is jjajang ramyeon so moist?

2830
01:44:47,384 --> 01:44:48,384
It's amazing.

2831
01:44:48,714 --> 01:44:50,584
Yu Jin, what do you think? You finally got what you wanted.

2832
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:52,384
- Eun Ji.
- She's done.

2833
01:44:53,354 --> 01:44:54,924
Tell me if you need tissue paper.

2834
01:44:55,254 --> 01:44:56,393
It's okay.

2835
01:44:56,394 --> 01:44:58,063
(She clears the dish.)

2836
01:44:58,064 --> 01:44:59,864
- It's so tasty, right?
- Yes.

2837
01:45:00,694 --> 01:45:02,194
I'm so jealous.

2838
01:45:02,834 --> 01:45:05,404
- Of his ramyeon-cooking skills?
- Of people around him.

2839
01:45:07,404 --> 01:45:08,834
We can watch "I'm Sorry, I Love You" with a full stomach.

2840
01:45:09,134 --> 01:45:11,203
"What's wrong, my son?"

2844
01:45:19,318 --> 01:45:20,988
(What are you doing?)

2845
01:45:21,088 --> 01:45:22,887
(Once a suspicion rises, )

2846
01:45:22,888 --> 01:45:25,957

01:45:30,668 --> 01:45:31,767
(Grinning)

2850
01:45:31,768 --> 01:45:33,497
(Mimi turned smart...)

2851
01:45:33,498 --> 01:45:37,107
(and came up with an evil plan.)

2852
01:45:37,108 --> 01:45:40,178
(Yu Jin falls asleep as if she has given up.)

2853
01:45:40,508 --> 01:45:43,947

2858
01:45:59,528 --> 01:46:01,967
(is a romantic picnic set.)

2859
01:46:01,968 --> 01:46:04,568
(To keep up with the energy of the excited E-caders.)

2860
01:46:04,668 --> 01:46:06,897
(they prepared an assortment of retro games.)

2861
01:46:06,898 --> 01:46:07,908

(Due to the endless games, )

2868
01:46:17,578 --> 01:46:19,378
(the oldest member loses it.)

2869
01:46:19,478 --> 01:46:21,888
(It was more nerve-racking than a comedian test.)

2870
01:46:21,988 --> 01:46:24,317

2871
