1
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:11,902
(Earth Arcade 3)

2
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:17,031
(The E-cade members' energy was the same even after 2 years.)

3
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:20,672
(Thus, they lived without a few things this time.)

4
00:00:20,872 --> 00:00:23,642
(Under the hot sun of Abu Dhabi, )

5
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:25,812
(they distanced themselves from digital devices.)

6
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:27,681
(I want to use my cell phone.)

7
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:29,411
(I want to watch Reels.)

8
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:31,952
(They lost their minds due to the digital detox.)

9
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:34,282
(In the romantic city of Lisbon, )

10
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:38,461
(they practiced silence without uttering a word.)

11
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:39,462
(Eun Ji: It's sexy food.)

12
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:40,761
(It's sexy food.)

13
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:43,432
(As always, the E-cade members found a way.)

14
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:45,422
(Thanks to the detox, the E-cade members...)

15
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:47,772
(Lee Young Ji, turn on the jukebox.)

16
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:50,372
(They had everything from the E-cade AI skit...)

17
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:54,002
(to the musical that turned the lodging into a stage.)

18
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:56,611
(As "I'm Sorry, I Love You" fanatics, they laughed...)

19
00:00:56,612 --> 00:00:58,782
(and cried together.)

20
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:02,581
(They filled the empty space with each other.)

21
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:04,982
(If we do a detox, they'll suffer more than us.)

22
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:06,851
(Brother Yeong Seok!)

23
00:01:06,852 --> 00:01:08,422
(Is this the advance party?)

24
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:11,391
(Despite the detox, the production crew suffered...)

25
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:13,592
(because the E-cade members' energy remained the same.)

26
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:15,332
(Thus, the last detox has been prepared.)

27
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:19,162
(The finale of the grand journey of detoxes...)

28
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:22,832
(will unfold soon in Albufeira.)

29
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:26,702
(After "Love Square")

30
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:28,842
"Popular" by Jeong Sun Ah.

31
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:31,382
(Oh, my!)

32
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:33,011
(It's a musical video that became their favorite...)

33
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:34,912
(after watching "I'm Sorry, I Love You.")

34
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:37,882
(Yu Jin enters.)

35
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:39,822
(Jumping)

36
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:45,761
(She does a cover of "Popular" in earnest.)

37
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:47,162
How do you know the number so well?

38
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:49,132
(A duet part)

39
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,162
(Moving)

40
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:53,002
(Fascinated)

41
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:56,402
Popular

42
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:59,572
(Dancing)

43
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:03,612
(She hops around as if she stepped on Lego bricks.)

44
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:05,182
(Heave-ho!)

45
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:07,912
Popular

46
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:10,152
(The grand finale)

47
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:11,481
(Meanwhile, on the 1st floor, )

48
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:13,051
(the popular producer is before the table.)

49
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:14,081
The first one.

50
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:16,022
(There are mysterious items on the table.)

51
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:20,291
(The crew members take turns passing them.)

52
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:21,332
For the third one,

53
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:23,231
- this one. - The third one.

54
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:24,232
How about you?

55
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:27,602
(The crew members are startled because of something.)

56
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:30,232
(Brother Yeong Seok is unfazed.)

57
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:32,042
(What are they doing?)

58
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:34,871
We prepared dinner in a special way.

59
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:35,872
What is it?

60
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:38,512
Take turns to go to the kitchen on the first floor.

61
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:41,511
- Okay. - Producer Na will be waiting.

62
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:43,682
- Riddle Master? - Riddle Master.

63
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:47,321
(The old man who will give them dinner)

64
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:49,242
- Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

65
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:50,552
Rock-paper-scissors.

66
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,182
(Yu Jin lost in rock-paper-scissors again.)

67
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:57,232
Eun Ji, Young Ji, Mimi, and Yu Jin.

68
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:58,561
Mimi and Yu Jin.

69
00:02:58,562 --> 00:02:59,802
Watch this, girls.

70
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:01,202
I'm hungry.

71
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:02,732
"Aida" by Jeong Sun Ah.

72
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:04,701
(Picking on a younger member right away)

73
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:05,801
All right, girls.

74
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,322
- All right, girls. - You startled me.

75
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:10,372
- I'll get going. - Okay. Eun Ji will go first.

76
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:12,741
- What? - The expressway.

77
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:14,982
(She resumes teasing Yu Jin as soon as Mom leaves.)

78
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:21,022
Warriors.

79
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:25,892
(Shush!)

80
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:28,591
(It's the Mouth Detox again.)

81
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:30,732
(Wait!)

82
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:32,532
It's dinnertime.

83
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:34,731
I'm dying of hunger!

84
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:35,932
Are you ready, warrior?

85
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:38,102
The warrior is ready.

86
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:39,942
All right.

87
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:42,472
The concept of dinner is...

88
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:47,081
(You Are an Open Book)

89
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:48,152
It's Part Two.

90
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:52,752
(You Are an Open Book, Part 2)

91
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:56,292
(There are various items on the table.)

92
00:03:56,652 --> 00:04:02,862
(Let's go over them briefly.)

93
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:05,561
(Sirloin)

94
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:08,102
(Pork belly)

95
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:10,702
(Ssamjang and kimchi)

96
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:13,672
(Vegetables for the grill and wraps)

97
00:04:13,902 --> 00:04:15,812
(Rice)

98
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,441
Among these ingredients,

99
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:18,541
(Choose 1 of the 6 ingredients.)

100
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,482
you'll only choose one.

101
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:23,681
Then you'll take the ingredient and move to a secluded spot.

102
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:25,482
A secluded spot?

103
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:30,152
Your dinner will only consist of the chosen ingredients.

104
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:35,162
If you can predict what the other members will choose...

105
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:38,901
and give a variety in the choices, it'll be nice.

106
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:40,102
- Exactly. - Yes.

107
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:43,602
Please choose one.

108
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:47,472
We talked about pork jowl a lot.

109
00:04:47,672 --> 00:04:51,212
So I think I should choose meat, the most important ingredient.

110
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:53,512
Other members could choose it as well.

111
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:56,252
No. I think Young Ji will choose kimchi.

112
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:58,652
Mimi will choose rice.

113
00:04:58,722 --> 00:04:59,722
Yu Jin will go,

114
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:02,422
"Wouldn't it be nice to have vegetables as well?"

115
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:05,038
Do you expect Yu Jin to choose the vegetables when there's meat?

116
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:06,822
She'll expect me to have chosen the meat.

117
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:08,862
Don't you like pandan?

118
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:11,272
- Where's pandan? - There's something similar.

119
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:14,162
These are asparagus.

120
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:16,092
(His sense of judgment has been diminished.)

121
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:19,242
The girls know the order.

122
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,442
Me, so-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so.

123
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:24,212
They'll think, "Eun Ji must've chosen the meat."

124
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:25,911
You're 100 percent sure that they'll be on the same page?

125
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:27,412
Yes. Hold on. Yu Jin...

126
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,112
Yu Jin and Young Ji are sending me telepathic messages.

127
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:32,452
(They didn't send any telepathic messages.)

128
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:33,852
I'll choose meat.

129
00:05:34,722 --> 00:05:37,791
(Eun Ji chooses pork belly.)

130
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:40,022
(She gets isolated in a room next to the living room.)

131
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:43,192
I think it'll be too easy. Yes.

132
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,562
(Pork belly)

133
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:48,272
(After Eun Ji goes into the room, )

134
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:51,442
(pork belly is set up again.)

135
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:53,902
Young Ji, you're next.

136
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:55,541
What could this be,

137
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,702
- Producer Hyun Yong? - Seriously, what could this be?

138
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:00,282
(Checking her appearance)

139
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:03,282
(Peeking)

140
00:06:03,512 --> 00:06:04,751
(Young Ji comes down to the 1st floor.)

141
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:06,222
(Eun Ji's isolation room)

142
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:07,522
(Staring)
(Shush!)

143
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:11,622
I didn't say anything.

144
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:14,061
(He's overly absorbed in the concept.)

145
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:15,392
I didn't say... I didn't...

146
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,332
(Covering her mouth)

147
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:21,201
I'll explain the dinner mission.

148
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:22,372
The dinner mission is...

149
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:25,471
(You Are an Open Book)

150
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:27,342
You must be obsessed with Jannabi's song.

151
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:28,442
Part Two.

152
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:32,941
(Explaining the rules)

153
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:34,512
However, keep this in mind.

154
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:38,451
Your dinner will only consist of the chosen ingredients.

155
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:39,781
(Their dinner will only consist of the chosen ingredients.)

156
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:40,822
Why?

157
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:43,621
Then we might not have any ssamjang or lettuce...

158
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:45,222
(Production crew: Shush!)

159
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:47,892
What will Young Ji choose?

160
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:50,832
(She can barely make out the words.)

161
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:53,402
I bet Eun Ji was considerate of the other members.

162
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:55,701
(Young Ji's prediction)

163
00:06:55,702 --> 00:06:58,002
I bet she took rice or kimchi.

164
00:06:58,202 --> 00:07:00,672
Would you keep your voice down?

165
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:03,372
Keep your voice down, warrior.

166
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:06,311
What about Eun Ji?

167
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:08,032
To be considerate of the following members,

168
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:12,222
she would've chosen rice or kimchi.

169
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:14,922
Young Ji knows that I'll choose meat no matter what.

170
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:16,992
She knows.

171
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:20,061
She'll think, "Eun Ji must've chosen meat."

172
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:21,742
(This girl wasn't very considerate today.)

173
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:24,532
Thus, I'll choose meat.

174
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:27,901
Mimi and Yu Jin...

175
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:30,902
will expect me to take the meat.

176
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:35,742
Okay. Is your decision final?

177
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,912
- Yes. - Okay.

178
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:40,182
Producer Bo Gyeong, take her.

179
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:45,252
(She gets isolated in a room next to the kitchen.)

180
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:46,922
It looks tasty.

181
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:49,591
(She's very hungry.)

182
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:51,122
It looks so tasty.

183
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:53,321
(Pork belly)

184
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:54,792
(Pork belly, Pork belly)

185
00:07:54,832 --> 00:07:57,962
Your dinner will only consist of the ingredients...

186
00:07:58,332 --> 00:07:59,402
the four members chose.

187
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:02,732
Is there no oil sauce?

188
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:05,572
I prefer the oil sauce to ssamjang.

189
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:08,142
(Stifling his laughter)

190
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:09,611
(Chuckling)

191
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:12,582
She's talking about her taste. She asked if there was no oil sauce.

192
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:15,752
Pick one of these ingredients...

193
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:17,281
and leave.

194
00:08:17,282 --> 00:08:18,282
(Mimi's prediction)

195
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:20,282
Young Ji would've chosen a meat.

196
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:24,122
Eun Ji would've chosen the vegetables.

197
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,562
Are you asking me?

198
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:29,962
- Which one should I choose? - What?

199
00:08:31,132 --> 00:08:32,801
I think Yu Jin will choose kimchi.

200
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:35,431
(Young Ji: Meat, Eun Ji: Vegetables, Yu Jin: Kimchi)

201
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,772
There's a chance the ones before you didn't take the meat.

202
00:08:39,142 --> 00:08:41,041
I'm certain it was meat. Young Ji would've chosen the meat.

203
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:43,142
I'm certain Young Ji was like this.

204
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:47,552
She talked about me just now, right?

205
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:50,792
- Shall I choose this one? - Will you choose pork belly?

206
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:52,282
This one?

207
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:53,722
Don't ask me.

208
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:55,592
I'll choose this one.

209
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:56,752
Okay.

210
00:08:57,122 --> 00:08:58,592
- Take it. - Take it.

211
00:08:58,722 --> 00:08:59,722
Will it be excluded?

212
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:01,832
- You can take it. - Take it.

213
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:04,961
She took the ingredient without saying what she chose.

214
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,861
Why didn't she say it when she's being filmed?

215
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:09,302
I wanted to hear it.

216
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:13,172
I think she chose the vegetables.

217
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:15,972
Is this a thinking chair?

218
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:21,412
(Pork belly, Pork belly)

219
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,411
(Hello)

220
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:27,021
(The cool wind feels just right)

221
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:29,152
(And I'm in a great mood)

222
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:33,221
("Take Good Care of Me" by EX)

223
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:36,962
(The puppy arrives on the 1st floor in an excited state.)

224
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:40,162
Stop singing and choose already.

225
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:42,601
(Loud)

226
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:43,672
She has good vocalization.

227
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:46,572
I knew that this would happen!

228
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,542
- What do you mean? - Aren't we choosing...

229
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:51,071
an ingredient each?

230
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:52,081
You're right.

231
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:53,181
(Her deductive skills are impressive.)

232
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:54,182
It looks delicious.

233
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:55,351
- All right. - Yes?

234
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:58,381
The older members took one ingredient each.

235
00:09:58,382 --> 00:10:00,121
Today's dinner will only consist...

236
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:02,122
of the ingredients the four members chose.

237
00:10:02,522 --> 00:10:04,851
Yu Jin is the last one.

238
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:07,192
She needs to pick rice.

239
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:09,092
Rice.

240
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,461
Yu Jin, please pick rice.

241
00:10:11,462 --> 00:10:14,001
(She's desperate for carbs.)

242
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:15,231
I don't feel like eating rice.

243
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:17,232
I had a lot of carbs today.

244
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:19,402
- You ate three rolls of gimbap. - Yes.

245
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,841
How could she not choose rice...

246
00:10:21,842 --> 00:10:24,312
just because she doesn't feel like eating it?

247
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:25,642
What about us?

248
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:27,111
The most needed ingredients are...

249
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:28,352
- the two cuts of meat, - Okay.

250
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:30,781
Ssamjang, and kimchi.

251
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:32,742
To be honest, I just need these four ingredients.

252
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:35,652
- That's you. - You're right.

253
00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:38,321
You should think about the other members...

254
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:40,421
and predict what they chose.

255
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,892
Among these four,

256
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:45,731
Eun Ji must've taken ssamjang or kimchi.

257
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,462
- After all, she's the eldest. - I see.

258
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:51,471
Why would I do that? Since I went first, I took the meat.

259
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:53,418
(It's her fault for being so considerate in the past.)

260
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:55,741
Mimi would've gone, "Shall I take the meat?"

261
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:56,972
"Shall I take the vegetables?"

262
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,711
(Yu Jin copies Eun Ji who copies Mimi.)

263
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:03,052
"Young Ji would've taken the meat."

264
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:04,482
"Vegetables?"

265
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:07,422
(Humiliated)

266
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:10,251
Young Ji would've gone, "Meat is all we need."

267
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,122
- She would've taken the meat. - Okay.

268
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:15,461
Is there a possibility that they didn't take the meat?

269
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:17,491
(She becomes unsure about whether or not there's meat.)

270
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:19,432
Did Eun Ji take the meat?

271
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:23,172
That's right. There's no way we didn't take the meat, Yu Jin!

272
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:27,042
I think kimchi is a must when you eat pork belly.

273
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:28,811
Pork belly?

274
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:30,312
- Kimchi? - Kimchi?

275
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,242
These two always go together.

276
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,051
Choose 1 of the 2.

277
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:37,912
(Which one will she choose between the two?)

278
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:39,751
(Kimchi!)

279
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:41,452
Yu Jin, choose kimchi!

280
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:44,592
(The eldest member sends a telepathic message for kimchi.)

281
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:47,791
Take the meat. The meat.

282
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,138
(Mimi wants her to take the meat just in case there isn't any.)

283
00:11:49,162 --> 00:11:50,362
Did you make up your mind?

284
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:51,701
Yes.

285
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:52,762
(What did Yu Jin choose?)

286
00:11:53,032 --> 00:11:57,632
(Yu Jin gets isolated in the room behind the kitchen.)

287
00:11:57,672 --> 00:12:00,672
(Pork belly, Pork belly)

288
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:02,712
All the members chose an ingredient.

289
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:06,112
All right. The member who came first,

290
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,782
Eun Ji.

291
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:12,222
(Because I'm your lady)

292
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:16,622
(A cliched entrance song as someone who was born in the 90s)

293
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:18,421
(Eun Ji brings pork belly.)

294
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:19,462
It's this one.

295
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:22,191
Young Ji will be next.

296
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:24,432
- Okay. I'm so nervous. - What do you want her to bring?

297
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:26,061
Vegetables.

298
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:27,531
- I see. There's meat, after all. - Yes.

299
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:29,001
It'll be nice if there are...

300
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:31,171
meat and vegetables on the side.

301
00:12:31,172 --> 00:12:32,402
- Okay. - Yes.

302
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,272
Young Ji,

303
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:36,742
please come on out with your ingredient.

304
00:12:37,312 --> 00:12:41,752
(Singing)

305
00:12:47,452 --> 00:12:48,452
Because I'm

306
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:52,062
(Two plates of pork belly)

307
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:55,531
(Devastated)

308
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:57,491
Isn't it natural to choose vegetables when you go second?

309
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:59,361
But you're considerate...

310
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,032
- and generous. - Okay.

311
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,631
I expected you to choose the vegetables first.

312
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:06,172
Why would I choose the vegetables when I went first?

313
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:07,941
- Unbelievable. Still... - Moreover,

314
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:09,911
we didn't choose sirloin and pork belly.

315
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:11,911
- Pork belly and pork belly. - Pork belly and pork belly. Gosh.

316
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:14,011
- So far, it isn't bad. - Having two plates of meat...

317
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:15,151
- isn't bad. - No.

318
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:16,511
Which ingredients do you want?

319
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:18,681
I just want kimchi and rice.

320
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:21,051
To be honest, ssamjang is the most important one for me.

321
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:22,091
Same here.

322
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,498
- Really? - Vegetables are important too.

323
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:25,221
Would Mimi have chosen ssamjang?

324
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,721
She went third, so there's a possibility.

325
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,022
- She went 3rd. - She went 3rd.

326
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:32,902
(Mimi is thinking. What's the meaning of her smile?)

327
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:34,401
Mimi!

328
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:35,832
Mimi, please come on out.

329
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:40,072
(She sings the song of the past once more.)

330
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:42,211
(She walks over shyly.)

331
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,512
Perhaps she can't come out because she feels guilty.

332
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,542
- Mimi! - She's coming.

333
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:48,451
(Ta-da!)

334
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,251
It's ssamjang!

335
00:13:51,252 --> 00:13:53,551
Well done, Mimi!

336
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:55,491
- I did well, right? - You did so well, Mimi!

337
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:56,721
It would've been a disaster without ssamjang.

338
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:58,122
Young Ji, are you surprised?

339
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:02,332
Why? Didn't you trust me?

340
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:05,401
- Was it so hard to trust me? - I should've chosen the lettuce.

341
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:07,101
- It's okay. - I should've chosen the lettuce.

342
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:08,571
- It's okay. - It's okay. We can eat more meat.

343
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:09,931
- That's right. - We can eat a lot of meat.

344
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,031
The more the meat, the better it is.

345
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:12,541
We'll be set if there's rice.

346
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:13,542
Seriously.

347
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:15,841
(What if Yu Jin chose the meat again?)

348
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:18,272
(Currently, they have 2 plates of pork belly and ssamjang.)

349
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:21,141
What do you think Yu Jin chose?

350
00:14:21,142 --> 00:14:22,311
- We need kimchi. - Rice.

351
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:23,312
- Kimchi. - Rice.

352
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:24,351
Kimchi or rice?

353
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:25,632
Guys, send a telepathic message.

354
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,122
It's already over.

355
00:14:27,852 --> 00:14:30,492
- She already chose an ingredient. - Still, we should support her.

356
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:33,561
(Yu Jin was torn between pork belly and kimchi.)

357
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:35,161
Yu Jin!

358
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:36,231
(Did she receive the telepathic message?)

359
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:38,231
- Yu Jin! - Yu Jin, which one is it?

360
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:39,331
- Yu Jin, which one is it? - It's rice!

361
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,131
I can't see it yet, Yu Jin.

362
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:42,471
Please let it be kimchi.

363
00:14:42,472 --> 00:14:44,772
Yu Jin, I hope you chose kimchi.

364
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:46,194
- Yu Jin, which one is it? - It's rice!

365
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:47,993
I can't see it yet, Yu Jin.

366
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:49,303
Please let it be kimchi.

367
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:51,564
Yu Jin, I hope you chose kimchi.

368
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,073
It's kimchi.

369
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,574
(She chose kimchi.)

370
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:57,143
(Their wish came true.)

371
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:59,874
- Nice. Not bad. - Well done.

372
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:01,043
It's pretty good.

373
00:15:01,044 --> 00:15:02,283
- You know, a meal... - It'll be tasty.

374
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:04,383
Of meat and these two ingredients will be nice.

375
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,913
- It's nearly the best combination. - I know.

376
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,483
- That's right. - It's really nice.

377
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:10,084
It's totally nice.

378
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:13,323
(Pork belly, Pork belly, Ssamjang, Kimchi)

379
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:15,523
- Do you know what everyone said? - What?

380
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:17,884
"I don't need to choose meat. Young Ji would've chosen it."

381
00:15:18,224 --> 00:15:20,364
"Meat is all we need!"

382
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:22,203
"Meat is all we need!"

383
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:24,404
"We'll be set as long as we have meat!"

384
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:28,944
(Three Young Jis' feistiness)

385
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:31,073
(The actual Young Ji is annoyed.)

386
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:32,374
We know her so well.

387
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,743
Young Ji did exactly that.

388
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:35,944
You're right.

389
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:38,483
- Thanks to that, you did well. - My mouth is watering.

390
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:39,753
- In my opinion, - We did pretty well.

391
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:41,430
You guys read each other well and chose a nice combination...

392
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:43,023
for You Are an Open Book.

393
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:44,253
- Nice! - Yes.

394
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:47,423
- E-cade! - You Are an Open Book

395
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:52,534
(They sing together once more.)

396
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:56,163
I'll grill the meat.

397
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,463
Young Ji, are you good at grilling meat?

398
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,174
- Yes. - That's great.

399
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:00,803
May we use salt and pepper?

400
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:02,604
You can use them for seasoning.

401
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:07,073
(She begins to grill the pork belly.)

402
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:09,344
Young Ji, won't you sing "The Meat-Grilling Song?"

403
00:16:09,714 --> 00:16:11,413
- "The Meat-Grilling Song?" - Yes.

404
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:12,713
I'm too hungry right now.

405
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:14,553
How could you change so much?

406
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:16,353
We promised not to lose the initial enthusiasm.

407
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:17,660
- I didn't lose it. - How could you be like that?

408
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:19,223
How could you be like that?

409
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:21,124
How could you change so much?

410
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:22,593
It looks delicious.

411
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:24,594
(She ignores them.)

412
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:30,433
(Since she's hungry, she cooks four strips at once.)

413
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:32,033
I wish we had a stew.

414
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,673
It would've been perfect.

415
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:34,833
How about this?

416
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:37,243
Shall we use one strip to make pork and kimchi stew?

417
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:38,273
- I love that idea. - One strip.

418
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:39,620
- Can we do that? - I love that idea.

419
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:41,244
As far as I know...

420
00:16:41,744 --> 00:16:42,813
(Pork belly, ssamjang, and kimchi)

421
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:44,160
(The E-cade members' recipe for pork and kimchi stew)

422
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:48,614
(Slice pork belly into bite-sized pieces.)

423
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:51,024
- Olive oil. - Is it over there?

424
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:52,254
We found it.

425
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:54,294
- Is it a spray? - Yes.

426
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:56,593
- There are bones. - We chose the ingredients well.

427
00:16:56,594 --> 00:16:57,623
Seriously.

428
00:16:57,624 --> 00:16:58,993
We can add kimchi now.

429
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:00,994
Yes. How much should I add?

430
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:03,203
- Nice. - You're good.

431
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:04,710
- Yu Jin, that's great. - You're good.

432
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:06,803
Young Ji, you grilled the pork belly nicely.

433
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:07,974
It isn't done yet.

434
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:10,403
- There are bones. - It looks delicious.

435
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,673
- It looks delicious. - It must be because it's foreign.

436
00:17:11,674 --> 00:17:13,473
- That must be it. - Shall I turn up the heat?

437
00:17:13,474 --> 00:17:14,544
It's bound to be tasty.

438
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:16,314
You can add water now, Yu Jin.

439
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:19,654
(Add water and boil.)

440
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:24,124
(Add sweetness and umami with ssamjang.)

441
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:25,654
Can you pass me kimchi?

442
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:27,454
(There's leftover kimchi from cooking the stew.)

443
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:28,494
Thanks.

444
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:31,464
(It gets grilled with pork belly.)

445
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,594
(They make full use of the ingredients they acquired.)

446
00:17:34,864 --> 00:17:38,404
(The dishes are getting ready.)

447
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:40,203
It would've been nice to have rice.

448
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:42,673
- I know. I'm craving rice. - I'm craving rice.

449
00:17:42,674 --> 00:17:45,104
Can't we buy it with the five euros we received yesterday?

450
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,673
- Oh, my. I didn't think of that. - It's a good idea.

451
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:48,943
Let's buy it from the production crew.

452
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,143
- It's a good idea. - Shall we ask?

453
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:52,453
Go and ask, Yu Jin. I'll go with you.

454
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:56,823
- Knock, knock. - Is anyone here?

455
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:57,854
No.

456
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:01,323
We came to ask you about something.

457
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:02,363
Yes.

458
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:04,363
Would you give us the ten euros we won yesterday...

459
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,163
through Random Play Dance?

460
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:07,493
- We can do that. - We can give you the money.

461
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:10,133
However, what we want to receive isn't cash.

462
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:13,433
- Why don't you give us... - That's right.

463
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:15,803
Ten euros' worth of rice and vegetables?

464
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,544
We make this suggestion with caution.

465
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:19,544
I don't know. Ask Tiger Woozoo.

466
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:21,544
We ask this question to Tiger Woozoo.

467
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:24,513
We don't want a lot. We just want a small bit.

468
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:25,984
Shall we ride a unicycle here?

469
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:27,114
Tiger Woo Jung.

470
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:29,454
Tiger Woo Jung.

471
00:18:29,884 --> 00:18:30,884
Please do us this favor.

472
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:32,493
Please let us know after a meeting.

473
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:33,494
Okay.

474
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,154
Please call us.

475
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:37,064
They're right there.

476
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:38,594
How about gonggi?

477
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:40,733
Gonggi? They're good at gonggi.

478
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,434
With that game... All right.

479
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:44,534
Give me the meat.

480
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,434
Give me the meat.

481
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:47,903
Are you done cooking the meat?

482
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:48,943
- Yes, we're nearly done. - I'm still cooking it.

483
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:51,773
What else do you need?

484
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:52,974
Rice and lettuce.

485
00:18:53,474 --> 00:18:57,513
Then you should've won them earlier.

486
00:18:57,514 --> 00:18:59,013
They were on the table.

487
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,853
We didn't go back to hear those words.

488
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:06,593
In that case, here's what I think. For instant rice...

489
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:07,994
- Nice. - Nice.

490
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:10,993
But there are logistics costs that come with the instant rice.

491
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:13,663
It's very expensive since we took a flight here.

492
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:14,694
Okay.

493
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:17,964
The confident one among the four members...

494
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:20,474
should pass a small mission.

495
00:19:20,574 --> 00:19:22,473
Then we'll give 2 instant rice for 10 euros.

496
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:23,503
No way.

497
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:25,973
Isn't 10 euros a bit expensive for 2 instant rice?

498
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:26,974
Fine then.

499
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:29,044
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

500
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:32,383
I misspoke. That wasn't my intention.

501
00:19:32,384 --> 00:19:33,754
I'm begging you to forgive me.

502
00:19:34,254 --> 00:19:36,053
- Don't be upset. - Two instant rice for ten euros.

503
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:37,054
Leave it there anywhere.

504
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:38,383
Would you like to hear about the small mission?

505
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:39,393
- Yes. - What is it?

506
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:40,794
(Jade Emperor's mission)

507
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:43,294
- What could it be? - Yu Jin.

508
00:19:43,394 --> 00:19:45,734
- Yes? - It's gonggi.

509
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,733
- Let's go. An Yu Jin. - What?

510
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:49,304
- There she goes. - Good luck.

511
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,564
An Yu Jin!

512
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:54,474
If you reach ten years in gonggi,

513
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:56,673
we'll give 2 instant rice for 10 euros.

514
00:19:56,674 --> 00:19:59,573
If you fail, you won't get another chance.

515
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,013
- Do we get one chance? - Of course.

516
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:03,143
- One chance. - One chance.

517
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:05,104
- You must reach ten years. - Are you good at it?

518
00:20:05,614 --> 00:20:06,614
I'm not very good at it.

519
00:20:06,714 --> 00:20:09,924
Do well. We need rice.

520
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:12,184
(Reach 10 years in gonggi, Player An Yu Jin)

521
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:14,093
- Without a single mistake? - Without a single mistake,

522
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:16,394
- This is how you do it. - reach ten years.

523
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:26,834
(Her gonggi skills are pretty solid.)

524
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:34,214
(They're surprised by her skills.)

525
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:39,484
(Be quiet.)

526
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:41,714
(She enters Level 4.)

527
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:44,954
Hold on. What was it called? Pole?

528
00:20:45,054 --> 00:20:47,854
Stamp? The Little Mermaid?

529
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:50,093
- I thought it wasn't allowed. - Is it allowed?

530
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:51,094
Is mermaid allowed?

531
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:52,634
Where are you from?

532
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,933
I'm from Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province.

533
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:54,934
Yu Jin, are you doing well?

534
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:56,063
It smells so good.

535
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:57,064
It smells good, right?

536
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:58,364
Have a bite, Producer Na.

537
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:00,673
I really want to eat it.

538
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:01,704
Take a big bite.

539
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:04,984
- You even grilled kimchi. - We even grilled kimchi.

540
00:21:05,204 --> 00:21:08,173
(He sates his hunger after making Yu Jin play gonggi.)

541
00:21:08,174 --> 00:21:11,114
Are you going to be like that when there are amateurs?

542
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:13,414
- Why do you need rice? - Rice?

543
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:15,383
What you have is delicious enough.

544
00:21:15,384 --> 00:21:16,723
- We need to eat rice. - Rice is needed.

545
00:21:16,724 --> 00:21:18,130
It'll be even better if we eat rice.

546
00:21:18,154 --> 00:21:20,353
(She does the flip after the rules are sorted out.)

547
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:22,024
It's okay.

548
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:23,963
How about Arirang?

549
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:26,364
(Arirang: Catch the stones twice, you win twice the points.)

550
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,603
(In her attempt to do Arirang)

551
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:34,134
- You failed. - It's impossible, Mimi.

552
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,604
Let's have a salty meal today.

553
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:39,244
Yu Jin, Mimi, come and eat.

554
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:41,013
Seriously.

555
00:21:41,014 --> 00:21:42,514
(Why is Brother Yeong Seok eating?)

556
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,243
Why is Brother Yeong Seok eating?

557
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:46,354
Brother Yeong Seok!

558
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:49,683
She told me to try it.

559
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:50,884
Hold on. This is...

560
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:52,284
- What? - Objection!

561
00:21:52,754 --> 00:21:53,824
- Objection! - Objection!

562
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:57,063
- Just now, Brother Yeong Seok... - Objection!

563
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:58,824
- ate our meat. - This is just wrong.

564
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:00,563
She told me to try it.

565
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:02,533
Young Ji told me to try it.

566
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:03,603
Young Ji!

567
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:05,504
- Deny it. - I didn't say...

568
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:07,574
that it was free.

569
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:10,144
- You ate it. - That's right.

570
00:22:10,304 --> 00:22:11,474
Writer Woo Jung.

571
00:22:11,574 --> 00:22:12,613
- For goodness' sake. - Did you eat it?

572
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:13,873
- Dragon King. - Did you eat it?

573
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,243
It's Jade Emperor, not Dragon King.

574
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:17,344
- Jade Emperor. - "Dragon King."

575
00:22:17,744 --> 00:22:20,284
Your secretary made a big mistake.

576
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:21,684
Please give us one instant rice.

577
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:24,223
Why would we give you instant rice? You failed the gonggi mission.

578
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:26,093
- But you ate our meat. - Yes.

579
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,553
We were going to give up without any objections.

580
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,853
Young Ji told me to eat it!

581
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:30,763
Our labor costs are very expensive.

582
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:31,963
Eun Ji and Young Ji...

583
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:34,340
(Na Young Seok, age 49, married, He will pay for the meat soon.)

584
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:35,903
- It looks delicious. - I grilled this one first.

585
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:37,204
(Let's eat dinner first.)

586
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,804
(The square pork belly pieces are heated up.)

587
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:44,704
(The stew with the square kimchi pieces is boiled.)

588
00:22:45,244 --> 00:22:47,513
(The Korean food enthusiast tries the stew first.)

589
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:48,673
- Eun Ji. - Yes?

590
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:50,214
It's a new type of kimchi stew.

591
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:52,243
It's like doenjang and kimchi stew.

592
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:53,484
That makes sense.

593
00:22:54,014 --> 00:22:55,783
- It must be because of ssamjang. - Right.

594
00:22:55,784 --> 00:22:56,784
It's tasty.

595
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:58,053
(Mimi tries the kimchi stew first.)

596
00:22:58,054 --> 00:22:59,823
It takes less than three minutes to grill this.

597
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:01,154
It's very tasty.

598
00:23:01,624 --> 00:23:03,323
- The stew is tasty. - Let's eat.

599
00:23:03,324 --> 00:23:04,324
It's a unique stew.

600
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:05,810
(They made the best stew with limited ingredients.)

601
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:09,404
(And there's pork belly Chef Lee Young Ji grilled.)

602
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:14,903
- Really? Is it okay? - Ssamjang.

603
00:23:14,904 --> 00:23:16,704
(Her reaction means that it's the tastiest.)

604
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:23,143
- It's tasty. - Is it okay?

605
00:23:23,144 --> 00:23:24,314
Yes. It's so tasty.

606
00:23:24,414 --> 00:23:26,784
- Young Ji, you grilled it well. - Really?

607
00:23:28,414 --> 00:23:32,183
(She eats the pork belly she grilled.)

608
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:39,063
(They enjoy dinner.)

609
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:41,394
Rice would've made the meal perfect.

610
00:23:41,494 --> 00:23:43,204
We just need rice.

611
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:45,833
(Upon hearing the E-cade members' cries)

612
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:47,974
- We should give them rice. - I know.

613
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:50,043
We should give them rice.

614
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:51,320
(Jade Emperor and the representative are embarrassed about eating.)

615
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:54,214
- By any chance, - Okay.

616
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:57,213
Would you have a gonggi battle for instant rice?

617
00:23:57,214 --> 00:24:00,453
The 4 of you need to reach 40 years in total.

618
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:03,484
(The 4 of them need to reach 40 years in total.)

619
00:24:03,754 --> 00:24:06,254
- Forty years by the four of us? - We can totally do it.

620
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:08,793
The ones who are bad at gonggi should go first.

621
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:10,964
- Then the others should follow. - We can do it.

622
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:13,333
(Thus began...)

623
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:15,934
(the Gonggi Battle for Instant Rice.)

624
00:24:16,534 --> 00:24:18,433
- Shall we begin? - May I go first...

625
00:24:18,434 --> 00:24:20,514
- since I'm the worst at it? - Okay. I'll go second.

626
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:22,304
Neither of us has done it often.

627
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:24,844
Shall we begin?

628
00:24:25,274 --> 00:24:26,474
- All right. - Here I go.

629
00:24:26,574 --> 00:24:28,213
Once you yell, "Here I go," you can't stop.

630
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:29,443
Okay. Here I go.

631
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:30,484
Are you starting now?

632
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:35,713
Don't give such a reaction. Young Ji will get intimidated.

633
00:24:35,714 --> 00:24:37,000
(How skilled is the first player, Young Ji?)

634
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:39,024
- Don't provoke her. - Be careful.

635
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:41,224
- Good. - Well done.

636
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:43,564
You failed.

637
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:46,194
(She fails right away.)

638
00:24:46,494 --> 00:24:47,794
(Embarrassed)

639
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:50,964
(The air instantly turns frigid.)

640
00:24:51,764 --> 00:24:53,074
You're really bad at it.

641
00:24:53,774 --> 00:24:55,434
That was why I grilled meat diligently.

642
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:56,673
- Well done. - Well done.

643
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:58,743
Seriously. I'm 34 years old.

644
00:24:58,744 --> 00:24:59,913
- I haven't done it in a while. - You'll do well. You're thorough.

645
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:01,373
Older girls are usually good at it.

646
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,413
Here I go.

647
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:04,114
(How skilled is the eldest member?)

648
00:25:05,644 --> 00:25:08,054
(The stones are spread out nicely for Level 1.)

649
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:12,454
(She's better than Young Ji.)

650
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:18,693
You should say it first.

651
00:25:18,694 --> 00:25:19,694
(She passes Level 1.)
Then...

652
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:23,704
- I threw the stones badly. - It's okay.

653
00:25:23,804 --> 00:25:26,374
Good luck, Eun Ji. You can do it. You're the mom of E-cade.

654
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:28,204
You're the mom of E-cade. Mom.

655
00:25:28,504 --> 00:25:29,974
Mom, I want rice.

656
00:25:30,704 --> 00:25:31,704
Okay.

657
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:33,614
- All right. - Nice.

658
00:25:35,144 --> 00:25:36,144
Mom, that's...

659
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:37,344
- All right. - Nice.

660
00:25:37,544 --> 00:25:38,884
(Mom's Challenge ends.)

661
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:40,353
(Two members remain.)

662
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:42,274
That means the 2 of them need to reach 40 years.

663
00:25:42,484 --> 00:25:44,684
You guys need to reach 20 years each.

664
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:47,254
- Hold on a second. - You guys can do it.

665
00:25:47,354 --> 00:25:49,493
- Here I go. - Mimi, good luck.

666
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:53,234
- I start at 2 years, right? - You start at 2 years.

667
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:56,394
(She scatters the stones well so that they're in groups of two.)

668
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,803
(The stones are close together.)

669
00:25:59,804 --> 00:26:01,633
No, it's fine. It's fine, Mimi.

670
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:05,444
- That's not bad. - Right. It's fine.

671
00:26:06,244 --> 00:26:07,543
- Nice. - She moved triangularly.

672
00:26:07,544 --> 00:26:08,573
- Triangle. - Nice.

673
00:26:08,574 --> 00:26:09,814
Ms. Kim Mi Hyun is currently...

674
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:14,513
(She has the vibe of a master.)

675
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:16,124
All right. Gosh.

676
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,754
Nice. Mimi.

677
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,153
- There are 16 years left. - You're so sexy, Mimi.

678
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:22,154
Four years.

679
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:24,224
(She moves on to the next level without delay.)

680
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:27,494
- Four years? - Okay.

681
00:26:28,894 --> 00:26:30,434
- That was good. - Gosh.

682
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:36,103
(Mimi failed.)

683
00:26:36,104 --> 00:26:37,703
- Fail. Your turn is over. - Did you just...

684
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:39,103
try to hide it?

685
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:40,613
(Mimi was good, but unfortunately, she has been eliminated.)

686
00:26:40,614 --> 00:26:42,213
- It's fine. - Yu Jin, there are 36 years left.

687
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:44,113
- There are 36 years left. - How am I supposed to reach that?

688
00:26:44,114 --> 00:26:46,183
- Gosh, Yu Jin. - I think we got this.

689
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:47,453
- Here I go. - You got this.

690
00:26:47,454 --> 00:26:48,690
- Here we go. - Let's go, An Yu Jin.

691
00:26:48,714 --> 00:26:49,783
Here we go.

692
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:50,984
Right? This is better.

693
00:26:59,064 --> 00:27:00,894
Okay.

694
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:03,263
You're good.

695
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:04,334
(Breathing)

696
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:05,764
Nice.

697
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:07,033
Nice.

698
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:08,434
- Eight years. - You're doing well.

699
00:27:10,844 --> 00:27:12,943
- I have 30... - You have 32 years left.

700
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:14,914
It's okay, Yu Jin. You're 23 years old.

701
00:27:21,354 --> 00:27:22,513
Nice.

702
00:27:22,514 --> 00:27:24,634
(She's surviving the longest out of all the members.)

703
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:28,324
(I can't watch!)

704
00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:30,564
She's doing well. She's like a pro.

705
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,204
It's like she's part of the national team.

706
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:35,863
(Her second wrist flip)

707
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:36,864
Okay.

708
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:39,804
Gosh.

709
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:43,204
(That was close.)

710
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:44,673
(Applauding)

711
00:27:44,674 --> 00:27:45,703
That makes it 28 years.

712
00:27:45,704 --> 00:27:46,873
- There are 28 years left. - So 28 years.

713
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:47,943
Yu Jin, you should keep going.

714
00:27:47,944 --> 00:27:49,044
(The undeniable ace)

715
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:54,384
Again.

716
00:27:57,754 --> 00:27:58,754
You got this.

717
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:13,004
(Frantically waving her hand)

718
00:28:13,204 --> 00:28:15,034
Everyone has gone quiet.

719
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:16,903
But guys...

720
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,503
- Gosh, I'm... - No, you did great.

721
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:19,843
I'm sweating.

722
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:21,843
(I'm sweating.)

723
00:28:21,844 --> 00:28:23,483
(They have failed to obtain the rice.)

724
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,413
If the four of you practice...

725
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:28,554
and succeed, we'll grant you one wish.

726
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:30,083
- Let's go. - They'll grant us a wish.

727
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,153
- They'll grant us a wish. - If we practice...

728
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:32,253
- and succeed in reaching 40 years. - If you reach 40 years...

729
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:33,653
- We can do that. - For now, eat your food.

730
00:28:33,654 --> 00:28:35,070
I didn't mean you should do it right now.

731
00:28:35,094 --> 00:28:36,893
It's been so long since I played gonggi...

732
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:38,724
- that my hands are stiff. - No.

733
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:40,193
If we can practice for just ten minutes,

734
00:28:40,194 --> 00:28:41,933
- I think we can succeed. - Right.

735
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:43,580
- My hands are so stiff right now. - Right.

736
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:45,233
I told them that if the 4 of them can successfully reach 40 years,

737
00:28:45,234 --> 00:28:46,473
we'll grant them one wish no matter what.

738
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,474
- Right. - This was so fun.
- The wish could be huge. - The four of them...

739
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:50,103
It would be fun to see them practice later too.

740
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,204
(But what if they fail?)

741
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:54,544
(Same place, 14 hours later)

742
00:28:54,874 --> 00:28:57,614
(If you fail to succeed after this, )

743
00:28:57,884 --> 00:29:00,453
(you still have to follow the same schedule, but...)

744
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:01,454
(But it won't air on TV?)

745
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:04,284
(We won't be filming it.)

746
00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:06,594
(In other words, it's Camera Detox.)

747
00:29:06,894 --> 00:29:09,824
(I'm only working this hard because I'm being filmed!)

748
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:11,364
- Here I go. - Here I go.

749
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:17,364
(To mark the grand finale of Season 3)

750
00:29:18,164 --> 00:29:19,204
All right.

751
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:22,633
(let's play some gonggi.)

752
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:24,874
(To be revealed shortly)

753
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:27,613
Before the end of this season,

754
00:29:27,614 --> 00:29:29,714
you only get one chance to shout "Here I go."

755
00:29:29,944 --> 00:29:31,243
- You can practice until then. - When can we practice?

756
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:32,853
You're free to practice anytime.

757
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,854
(Chapter 1: Practice)

758
00:29:34,714 --> 00:29:36,384
- Should we practice? - Let's do it.

759
00:29:36,724 --> 00:29:38,083
Do you have another set of gonggi stones?

760
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:39,324
Yes, we have lots of them.

761
00:29:39,794 --> 00:29:41,524
We'll grant you one wish, whatever it is.

762
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:44,964
(Putting away the cameras)

763
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,694
This is just practice.

764
00:29:47,964 --> 00:29:50,104
(She's overly eager from the start.)

765
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:52,974
(Preparing for a wrist flip)

766
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,433
How do you...

767
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:56,644
How do you do it?

768
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:58,103
I'm not even trying to be funny.

769
00:29:58,104 --> 00:29:59,743
- I really want to be good at this. - The wrist flip is...

770
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:01,673
- Here. Put them close together. - I'll just copy you.

771
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,843
- Put them in a circle. - Got it.

772
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,114
And then throw them lightly.

773
00:30:05,914 --> 00:30:07,114
There's no way.

774
00:30:07,784 --> 00:30:08,884
He said, "There's no way."

775
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:10,754
Flip like this.

776
00:30:11,084 --> 00:30:12,324
- That's right. - You got it.

777
00:30:12,584 --> 00:30:13,724
Now throw them.

778
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:14,924
Catch them. That's it!

779
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:17,444
You're good if you just get them on the back of your hand.

780
00:30:18,724 --> 00:30:20,394
How do we have so much content to film?

781
00:30:20,764 --> 00:30:22,394
I mean,

782
00:30:22,634 --> 00:30:24,764
we have so much content to film in just one day.

783
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:27,333
(The Morning Mission, morning run, breakfast, the winery tour, etc.)

784
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:28,403
And then that one. Yes.

785
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:29,604
(Yu Jin has joined them.)

786
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:31,643
(The solid skills of an ace)

787
00:30:31,644 --> 00:30:32,704
Like this.

788
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,873
I'm the only one who's bad at this.

789
00:30:35,874 --> 00:30:37,783
No, you got this.

790
00:30:37,784 --> 00:30:40,713
(Even with people talking nonstop, Yu Jin's focus is on another level.)

791
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:41,814
- It's fine. - I'm sorry.

792
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:43,684
(She's already doing the wrist flip.)

793
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,554
- Gosh, she did the Arirang. - How did you do it?

794
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:50,093
(You put the stones on the back of your hand, )

795
00:30:50,094 --> 00:30:52,054
(throw them, and catch them in 2 separate moves.)

796
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:54,864
(Moving your hand in a U-shaped curve is the key.)

797
00:30:55,494 --> 00:30:56,863
Do we get twice the points if we succeed at an Arirang?

798
00:30:56,864 --> 00:30:57,864
Yes.

799
00:30:58,204 --> 00:31:00,380
Then I'll keep doing Arirangs to get us twice the points.

800
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:01,404
What do you think?

801
00:31:01,604 --> 00:31:04,344
(Yu Jin, the ace, is still focused on practicing.)

802
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:05,644
Arirang is...

803
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:07,014
Mom's embrace!

804
00:31:07,714 --> 00:31:09,213
(Mom's embrace?)

805
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:10,583
(Now seems like the right time to go over...)

806
00:31:10,584 --> 00:31:12,114
(the 10 rules of gonggi.)

807
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:14,253
(Mom's embrace)

808
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:16,600
(Cradling the stones close to the body to keep them from falling)

809
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,223
(Pole)

810
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:20,270
(Using one arm for support to maintain a stable posture)

811
00:31:20,294 --> 00:31:23,664
(Move: Moving into a more advantageous position)

812
00:31:24,394 --> 00:31:25,523
(Bean)

813
00:31:25,524 --> 00:31:26,533
Bean!

814
00:31:26,534 --> 00:31:28,010
(You must shout "Bean" before catching a stone that slipped out)

815
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:29,034
(Piano)

816
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:31,234
(Rearranging the stones to make the wrist flip easier)

817
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:32,763
(Rice)

818
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:33,833
(You must shout "Rice" before catching stones that you dropped)

819
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:34,834
Rice!

820
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:37,073
(Nongae)

821
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:39,074
(Dropping a stone to make the wrist flip easier)

822
00:31:39,674 --> 00:31:40,713
(Mermaid)

823
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:43,090
(Tucking your legs to the side and assuming a relaxed posture)

824
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:44,343
(Rice washing)

825
00:31:44,344 --> 00:31:46,904
(Gathering the stones during the wrist flip for easier throwing)

826
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:48,513
(The Himalayas)

827
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:50,724
(Throwing the stones high above your head)

828
00:31:51,354 --> 00:31:54,694
(Please note that the names may vary slightly by region or school.)

829
00:31:55,924 --> 00:31:57,663
Where would be comfortable for us?

830
00:31:57,664 --> 00:31:59,063
I think here is nice.

831
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:01,394
(They look for a place to begin practicing seriously.)

832
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,104
I'll do it at the venue.

833
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,834
- I'm quite bad at this. - Okay.

834
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:07,503
Where the venue is is important.

835
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:08,803
- Let's do it there. - I thought it was here.

836
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:10,020
- This is the venue? - This is it?

837
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:11,843
(It's essential to visit the exam location prior to a test.)

838
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:12,943
Do we have rice washing?

839
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:14,013
What's rice washing?

840
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:15,014
This.

841
00:32:15,015 --> 00:32:17,335
- Isn't this rice washing? - I think everything's allowed.

842
00:32:17,484 --> 00:32:19,604
- So rice washing's allowed? - Everything is allowed.

843
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,513
Guys.

844
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:22,554
Five. Catch all five.

845
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:24,484
Come on.

846
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:25,554
(She successfully reached 5 years at once.)

847
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:27,523
- You're good. - I'm only good at practice games.

848
00:32:27,524 --> 00:32:28,694
I'm sure that later, I'll...

849
00:32:28,894 --> 00:32:31,493
- Just do it. - Just do it.

850
00:32:31,494 --> 00:32:32,994
Goodness, I thought this was a puppy.

851
00:32:34,134 --> 00:32:37,664
(The puppy's point of view)

852
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:40,704
(Woof, woof)

853
00:32:41,874 --> 00:32:43,574
I thought that was a dachshund.

854
00:32:43,944 --> 00:32:45,074
A dachshund?

855
00:32:45,444 --> 00:32:47,413
This is the first time I saw you actually be startled.

856
00:32:47,414 --> 00:32:48,613
I was really startled.

857
00:32:48,614 --> 00:32:50,383
Mimi, the 1st one to reach 20 years wins.

858
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:51,543
- Reach 20 years? - I want to play too.

859
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:53,154
Why didn't you ask me to join?

860
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:55,283
- Let me join. - You can play with me.

861
00:32:55,284 --> 00:32:56,353
- Thanks, Eun Ji. - Let's do this.

862
00:32:56,354 --> 00:32:57,723
- One on one? - How many years?

863
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:58,724
- We'll do ten years. - Ten years?

864
00:32:58,725 --> 00:32:59,830
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

865
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:00,893
(The staff is having dinner.)

866
00:33:00,894 --> 00:33:02,270
(The less-advanced class and the advanced class)

867
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:05,194
(They continue practicing in their own ways.)

868
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:07,564
- Five years? - Five years.

869
00:33:08,264 --> 00:33:09,363
- Ten years. - Ten years.

870
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:10,434
What?

871
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:12,263
- I'm getting the hang of it now. - How many years?

872
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:14,010
(The advanced class is making progress quickly.)

873
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,904
- Did you tape down your bracelet? - Yes.

874
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:17,944
- Gosh. - I did.

875
00:33:18,174 --> 00:33:21,114
(It's now time for Yu Jin's wrist flip.)

876
00:33:24,484 --> 00:33:27,414
- Did you get 4 with Arirang? - It's 10 years.

877
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,254
I have to empty my head.

878
00:33:30,154 --> 00:33:31,723
Emptying my head is impossible, though.

879
00:33:31,724 --> 00:33:33,764
(Will Yu Jin's Arirang succeed in the actual game?)

880
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:36,564
(The only beginner is lost in thought.)

881
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:38,464
Why am I so bad at this?

882
00:33:38,664 --> 00:33:40,734
Gosh, this is seriously stressing me out.

883
00:33:41,794 --> 00:33:44,233
- Why? - I know I don't have the talent,

884
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:45,804
but I still have to keep trying.

885
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:48,373
(Even when everyone is watching her...)

886
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:49,604
Gosh.

887
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:51,643
Young Ji, just go first...

888
00:33:51,644 --> 00:33:53,114
and get out of the game.

889
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,974
I don't think you can succeed.

890
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:56,783
He just said we couldn't succeed.

891
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,224
We have to show them no matter what.

892
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:00,214
I'll master gonggi in one day.

893
00:34:00,684 --> 00:34:01,753
If you keep practicing,

894
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:02,884
you'll get the hang of it.

895
00:34:03,384 --> 00:34:04,984
The 1st one to reach 10 years wins.

896
00:34:05,484 --> 00:34:06,524
- Here I go. - Okay.

897
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:10,124
(Starting from Level 1, she begins practicing steadily.)

898
00:34:11,464 --> 00:34:12,724
I didn't touch it, right?

899
00:34:13,464 --> 00:34:14,464
You're good.

900
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:16,064
How do I throw it?

901
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:18,564
You have to think to yourself that you'll get two.

902
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:19,773
I can't do four.

903
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:21,874
Yes, just do that. Throw lightly.

904
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:23,444
(In awe)

905
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:25,004
Yes, I did it.

906
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:26,444
Watch this.

907
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:27,843
(Immediately training for the game)

908
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:29,314
Don't talk to Young Ji like that.

909
00:34:29,344 --> 00:34:30,344
(Amazed)

910
00:34:30,345 --> 00:34:31,484
She got better.

911
00:34:31,984 --> 00:34:33,113
You're shaking them too much.

912
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,583
(She attempts to succeed again in front of other people.)

913
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:35,584
(Surprised)

914
00:34:35,884 --> 00:34:37,024
(Gosh!)

915
00:34:37,224 --> 00:34:39,184
Did you do it, Young Ji? Did you do it?

916
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:41,494
- Thank you. - Four.

917
00:34:41,624 --> 00:34:42,994
Should we do it?

918
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:46,494
What? I can't do any of the earlier stages, though.

919
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:48,493
- Let's take this upstairs. - You can practice upstairs.

920
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:49,494
Right.

921
00:34:50,164 --> 00:34:53,274
(It's almost midnight right now.)

922
00:34:54,234 --> 00:34:56,133
Should we accept the challenge in the morning?

923
00:34:56,134 --> 00:34:58,294
- Let's do it in the morning. - As soon as we wake up.

924
00:34:58,644 --> 00:35:03,314
(It seems like they'll be practicing all night.)

925
00:35:05,544 --> 00:35:08,284
I can't perceive the distance correctly.

926
00:35:11,284 --> 00:35:12,523
(I can't do this.)

927
00:35:12,524 --> 00:35:13,554
I give up.

928
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:18,164
(Someone please help Young Ji.)

929
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:19,593
Eun Ji.

930
00:35:19,594 --> 00:35:21,993
- Mimi. - Young Ji's hopeless.

931
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,034
Mimi.

932
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,104
Mimi, don't give up on me.

933
00:35:25,734 --> 00:35:28,473
I want to help you by at least reaching one year...

934
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:29,474
- when we do it. - Okay.

935
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:35,114
(Young Ji begins training to reach at least 1 year before elimination.)

936
00:35:36,244 --> 00:35:37,743
I want to use the bathroom, but I can't.

937
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:38,784
I have to do this.

938
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:43,454
(From that point on, Young Ji remained alone.)

939
00:35:44,784 --> 00:35:46,183
- Heading to bed? - Goodnight.

940
00:35:46,184 --> 00:35:47,323
- Is everyone sleeping? - Yes.

941
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:48,453
Goodnight.

942
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:50,814
(After saying goodnight to all of her teachers at 1:40am, )

943
00:35:50,994 --> 00:35:54,834
(Young Ji falls asleep in the living room.)

944
00:35:57,104 --> 00:36:01,174
(At last, the long-awaited final day has come.)

945
00:36:03,274 --> 00:36:06,444
(Whether it's a good sign or a bad sign, it's raining.)

946
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:11,114
(Chapter 2: Let's eat before all else)

947
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:15,684
(Mimi has been practicing as soon as she woke up.)

948
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:19,284
Right, we have to practice.

949
00:36:19,454 --> 00:36:20,654
Come on, Eun Ji.

950
00:36:21,324 --> 00:36:22,753
My hand is stiff again because it's morning.

951
00:36:22,754 --> 00:36:24,623
Right? It's okay.

952
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:26,570
(This looks like a typical morning at an elementary school.)

953
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:28,133
(Even Young Ji gets to practice...)

954
00:36:28,134 --> 00:36:29,974
(as soon as she comes out to the living room.)

955
00:36:30,904 --> 00:36:32,404
My morning view...

956
00:36:32,664 --> 00:36:34,434
My morning view in Portugal is...

957
00:36:35,074 --> 00:36:36,644
- Producer Na. - Yes?

958
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:38,443
When are we doing the gonggi battle?

959
00:36:38,444 --> 00:36:40,164
Later. We're going to have breakfast first.

960
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:41,914
Gosh, I'm hungry.

961
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:44,084
- I'm hungry. - I'm hungry.

962
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,014
Gosh, I smell fried eggs.

963
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:50,924
(She's right.)

964
00:36:52,324 --> 00:36:56,024
(Surprisingly, the staff are busy preparing food on the 1st floor.)

965
00:36:57,064 --> 00:37:00,394
(There will now be an announcement about breakfast.)

966
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,164
- What is it? - Yesterday,

967
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:05,103
you gratefully listened to...

968
00:37:05,104 --> 00:37:07,603
the staff's relationship issues and provided...

969
00:37:07,604 --> 00:37:10,274
- Objectively. - objective counseling. As a result,

970
00:37:10,774 --> 00:37:12,374
- the staff... - Yes?

971
00:37:12,574 --> 00:37:14,814
Decided to share with you the Korean food...

972
00:37:15,074 --> 00:37:16,643
we brought in a separate luggage.

973
00:37:16,644 --> 00:37:17,714
Yes!

974
00:37:18,284 --> 00:37:21,214
(Let's forget about the gonggi match for now.)

975
00:37:21,654 --> 00:37:24,553
- The lovey-dovey - Gosh.

976
00:37:24,554 --> 00:37:25,924
This looks amazing.

977
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:29,023
- Did you use everything? - We used everything.

978
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:30,323
- Goodness. - The Korean food luggage...

979
00:37:30,324 --> 00:37:32,623
Gosh, dried laver. I've been craving it.

980
00:37:32,624 --> 00:37:34,064
(Today's breakfast has them in awe.)

981
00:37:35,094 --> 00:37:37,564
(Fresh out of the staff's luggage)

982
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:43,074
(A table full of Korean food)

983
00:37:45,204 --> 00:37:47,874
(Canned tuna the staff had hidden in their luggage)

984
00:37:50,984 --> 00:37:52,813
- Thank you for the food. - These look so good.

985
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:53,983
- Enjoy. - These look really good.

986
00:37:53,984 --> 00:37:55,054
Thank you for the food.

987
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:59,453
(Yu Jin puts a spoonful of canned tuna on her rice...)

988
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:02,194
(and takes a big bite.)

989
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:04,264
(Humming)

990
00:38:04,694 --> 00:38:06,334
- This is so good. - It's so good, right?

991
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:09,763
(Humming)

992
00:38:09,764 --> 00:38:11,064
It's really good.

993
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:13,473
- It's good. - This is a new version?

994
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:14,604
It's good.

995
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:16,244
The flavor is nutty and savory.

996
00:38:17,104 --> 00:38:19,274
Playing gonggi after eating this would be perfect.

997
00:38:19,804 --> 00:38:21,144
We should practice and go for it.

998
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:23,043
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

999
00:38:23,044 --> 00:38:25,214
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1000
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:27,814
We'll play 1-on-1 games with the staff.

1001
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:29,154
- Each of us? - Yes.

1002
00:38:29,414 --> 00:38:31,183
Who wants to play gonggi?

1003
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,524
(Chapter 3: Practice match)

1004
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:34,423
- Be serious. - Okay, let's be serious.

1005
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:37,194
- This is the real thing. - Yes, this is the real thing.

1006
00:38:37,364 --> 00:38:39,624
Be serious. Begin.

1007
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:44,104
(She shows off the skills she got from practicing all night.)

1008
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:48,403
(Look at her go!)

1009
00:38:48,404 --> 00:38:50,004
Now, the Himalayas. This is a tough one.

1010
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:51,504
(She failed again.)

1011
00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:53,743
Pretend you didn't see that. Men in Black.

1012
00:38:53,744 --> 00:38:55,844
(What is she doing?)

1013
00:38:56,074 --> 00:38:58,944
(The "Men in Black" Young Ji mentioned refers to...)

1014
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,053
(What's Men in Black?)

1015
00:39:01,054 --> 00:39:02,583
(Just like the movie "Men in Black,")

1016
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:04,983
(the technology makes humans forget they ever saw aliens...)

1017
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:06,024
(using this device.)

1018
00:39:07,024 --> 00:39:10,394
(All of you lost your memories too after looking into the light.)

1019
00:39:12,264 --> 00:39:15,094
(Basically, she's saying she gets another try.)

1020
00:39:15,494 --> 00:39:17,434
Young Ji, let's go against them.

1021
00:39:17,764 --> 00:39:18,933
- A match? - Without Men in Black.

1022
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:19,963
Without Men in Black?

1023
00:39:19,964 --> 00:39:21,003
Without Men in Black.

1024
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:22,884
- Without Men in Black? - Without Men in Black?

1025
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:24,714
Give us three chances to use Men in Black.

1026
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:26,104
Three per turn.

1027
00:39:26,374 --> 00:39:28,144
Are you okay with three?

1028
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:29,613
Are you okay with three?

1029
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:30,784
Thank you.

1030
00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:32,543
- All right. - Should we do ten years?

1031
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:33,984
- Or 20 years? - Yes, 20 years.

1032
00:39:34,054 --> 00:39:35,960
(The representative of Seongnam and the representative of Gyeongju)

1033
00:39:35,984 --> 00:39:38,384
(The staff goes first.)

1034
00:39:39,054 --> 00:39:40,094
Gosh.

1035
00:39:40,454 --> 00:39:41,494
Your hand is huge.

1036
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,663
(She tries sabotaging him from the beginning.)

1037
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:45,864
- She's trying to sabotage him. - You eat too much too.

1038
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:47,894
(Wait.)

1039
00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:49,563
(Slightly offended)

1040
00:39:49,564 --> 00:39:51,963
You're insulting him.

1041
00:39:51,964 --> 00:39:54,304
- Men in Black. - That's all she can say.

1042
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:57,043
- Forget it. - Men in Black.

1043
00:39:57,044 --> 00:39:58,774
Gosh, you're...

1044
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:00,573
(Now, it's Young Ji's turn.)

1045
00:40:00,574 --> 00:40:01,874
You got this.

1046
00:40:04,714 --> 00:40:07,014
(A gonggi falls from her hand.)

1047
00:40:07,284 --> 00:40:09,583
- You failed. - Rice!

1048
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:11,283
- Rice! - Rice!

1049
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,723
- We have rice. - We can say rice.

1050
00:40:12,724 --> 00:40:15,294
- We can say rice. - It's one of the rules.

1051
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:17,824
There's one year left.

1052
00:40:18,064 --> 00:40:20,263
- Gosh. - It's over.

1053
00:40:20,264 --> 00:40:21,694
- Men in Black. - Men in Black.

1054
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,634
- This is the last one. - What's Men in Black?

1055
00:40:23,864 --> 00:40:25,534
They said, "Men in Black."

1056
00:40:25,904 --> 00:40:27,674
(Level 2, 19 years)

1057
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,143
(Gosh)

1058
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:33,273
- She's good. - She improved by leaps and bounds.

1059
00:40:33,274 --> 00:40:34,713
- How many? - Mimi.

1060
00:40:34,714 --> 00:40:35,814
- One. - Just one.

1061
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:38,394
(Mimi easily succeeds catching one stone.)

1062
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:40,553
- You did it. - I missed it

1063
00:40:40,554 --> 00:40:42,384
(Chapter 4: Final rehearsal)

1064
00:40:42,814 --> 00:40:44,254
We're starting in 30 minutes.

1065
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,793
- They're all eating right now. - Let's practice playing in a relay.

1066
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:48,193
Let's reach 40 years in a relay.

1067
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:49,514
We'll see if we can really do it.

1068
00:40:49,754 --> 00:40:52,994
(The players walk to the venue with fierce resolve.)

1069
00:40:53,864 --> 00:40:57,903
(They pass through the staff who are having breakfast...)

1070
00:40:57,904 --> 00:41:01,374
(and arrive at the venue.)

1071
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:02,873
Let's play in a relay.

1072
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:04,744
- Okay, I'll start first. - Okay.

1073
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,774
We have to succeed at least once to succeed in the real thing.

1074
00:41:08,274 --> 00:41:09,743
- No leniency. - No leniency.

1075
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:10,883
I'll go after.

1076
00:41:10,884 --> 00:41:11,983
(The final mission: The 4 of them have to reach 40 years in a relay.)

1077
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:13,954
(If they succeed, they get a wish.)

1078
00:41:14,714 --> 00:41:16,084
- Nice. - Three years.

1079
00:41:16,984 --> 00:41:19,683
- Okay, 6 years. - She reached 6 years by herself.

1080
00:41:19,684 --> 00:41:21,193
(They're at 6 years.)

1081
00:41:21,194 --> 00:41:22,254
That's eight years.

1082
00:41:22,854 --> 00:41:24,334
- That's 11 years. - That's 11 years.

1083
00:41:25,224 --> 00:41:26,664
- Nice. 15 years. - That's 15 years.

1084
00:41:27,794 --> 00:41:29,274
- That's 23 years. - That's 23 years.

1085
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:31,174
- Nice. 25 years. - That's 25 years.

1086
00:41:32,604 --> 00:41:34,084
- That's 28 years. - That's 28 years.

1087
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:36,274
That's 30 years.

1088
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:38,643
- That's 36 years. - That's 36 years.

1089
00:41:38,644 --> 00:41:39,743
Only four more years to go.

1090
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:42,374
(They're at 36 years.)

1091
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:44,943
- Again. - This is our last try.

1092
00:41:44,944 --> 00:41:46,464
- You go first, Eun Ji. - We got this.

1093
00:41:46,914 --> 00:41:48,313
We might actually have a chance.

1094
00:41:48,314 --> 00:41:49,683
We've got a shot if you reach many years.

1095
00:41:49,684 --> 00:41:51,124
- We got this. - I have to do a lot.

1096
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:52,623
What are we going to do?

1097
00:41:52,624 --> 00:41:54,023
- We should take it back. Come here. - Hey, come over here.

1098
00:41:54,024 --> 00:41:55,123
Let's have a quick three-minute meeting.

1099
00:41:55,124 --> 00:41:56,623
They're doing well.

1100
00:41:56,624 --> 00:41:57,940
(They're flustered that the members are quite serious about this.)

1101
00:41:57,964 --> 00:41:59,670
I think we need to put something bigger on the line.

1102
00:41:59,694 --> 00:42:02,364
We should tell them that this is really their last chance.

1103
00:42:02,664 --> 00:42:04,634
If they succeed, we'll grant their wishes.

1104
00:42:05,004 --> 00:42:06,163
- If they fail... - Right.

1105
00:42:06,164 --> 00:42:07,433
It's really the end.

1106
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:09,050
Should we just put finishing filming on the line too?

1107
00:42:09,074 --> 00:42:11,703
- What do you think? - Wait, should we really?

1108
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:13,443
We'll say, "You have a schedule that you have to follow,"

1109
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:15,143
"but we won't be filming it."

1110
00:42:15,144 --> 00:42:16,943
(A penalty tailored to the members)

1111
00:42:16,944 --> 00:42:18,813
(Camera Detox)

1112
00:42:18,814 --> 00:42:20,583
(They still have to finish the remaining schedule, )

1113
00:42:20,584 --> 00:42:22,304
(but the staff won't be filming it at all.)

1114
00:42:22,454 --> 00:42:23,684
A camera detox.

1115
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:25,884
Should we really make that the penalty?

1116
00:42:26,154 --> 00:42:27,594
- Should we be that reckless? - Yes.

1117
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:30,124
(It definitely is reckless because...)

1118
00:42:30,564 --> 00:42:33,694
(they had made reservations at locations to film.)

1119
00:42:34,664 --> 00:42:36,694
(Lunch: A seafood restaurant)

1120
00:42:38,404 --> 00:42:40,433
(Afternoon: A bowling alley)

1121
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:43,644
(Riding 4WD vehicles and a game arcade)

1122
00:42:44,304 --> 00:42:46,443
(And finally, )

1123
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:49,914
(a boat tour of the Benagil Cave)

1124
00:42:50,144 --> 00:42:52,714
So then, will this be the end? Is that okay?

1125
00:42:52,844 --> 00:42:56,454
There's a 95 percent chance that filming will end here.

1126
00:42:56,584 --> 00:42:57,783
- A 95 percent chance it will end. - Yes.

1127
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,053
(Not even Yeong Seok knows how things will go.)

1128
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:00,693
Let's go. Let's head inside.

1129
00:43:00,694 --> 00:43:01,894
Let's see how they do.

1130
00:43:02,424 --> 00:43:03,923
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

1131
00:43:03,924 --> 00:43:05,670
(The members are busy practicing without knowing all this.)

1132
00:43:05,694 --> 00:43:07,194
Why is my heart beating so fast?

1133
00:43:07,494 --> 00:43:09,394
- I'm so nervous. - I can relate.

1134
00:43:09,564 --> 00:43:10,863
Where's the Band-Aid?

1135
00:43:10,864 --> 00:43:11,904
Here it is.

1136
00:43:12,264 --> 00:43:14,024
- I'm playing with an injury. - We got this.

1137
00:43:14,304 --> 00:43:16,410
I'm playing with an injury. My hand was scraped on the floor.

1138
00:43:16,434 --> 00:43:17,574
I'm so nervous right now.

1139
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,414
(After the emergency meeting, )

1140
00:43:21,744 --> 00:43:25,514
(all the staff began gathering around the venue.)

1141
00:43:27,684 --> 00:43:29,484
- Are we starting right now? - We are.

1142
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:31,054
They're all gathered here.

1143
00:43:31,524 --> 00:43:33,164
- We have a huge audience. - I'm nervous.

1144
00:43:33,854 --> 00:43:35,594
Here are the rules of this gonggi contest.

1145
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:37,724
You all have to speak in telegraphic style.

1146
00:43:38,064 --> 00:43:40,563
And we have a new rule that I created.

1147
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:42,094
It's called Men in Black.

1148
00:43:42,694 --> 00:43:45,934
Once you hear it, it'll be like the neuralyzer erased your memories.

1149
00:43:46,204 --> 00:43:47,504
Begin the gonggi contest.

1150
00:43:47,904 --> 00:43:50,073
- All right. - Begin the gonggi contest.

1151
00:43:50,074 --> 00:43:51,604
(This could be the end of Season 3.)

1152
00:43:52,704 --> 00:43:55,944
(The gonggi contest begins now.)

1153
00:43:57,644 --> 00:44:00,584
Our small challenge continues from yesterday.

1154
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:03,953
It has now become a huge event, which is why we're here.

1155
00:44:03,954 --> 00:44:04,983
It's too huge.

1156
00:44:04,984 --> 00:44:06,484
I'm very nervous right now.

1157
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:08,053
- I can't breathe properly. - We're representing Korea.

1158
00:44:08,054 --> 00:44:11,064
First, tell us your wish.

1159
00:44:11,364 --> 00:44:13,123
We have to make a big wish.

1160
00:44:13,124 --> 00:44:15,333
Since we were talking about rings yesterday...

1161
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:17,704
- Friendship rings. - Friendship rings would be nice.

1162
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:20,234
A brand we have in mind is Chrome Hearts.

1163
00:44:22,234 --> 00:44:24,473
- Chrome Hearts friendship rings... - Chrome Hearts friendship rings?

1164
00:44:24,474 --> 00:44:26,343
They don't necessarily have to be from Chrome Hearts.

1165
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:27,743
We just want friendship rings...

1166
00:44:27,744 --> 00:44:29,543
- that would look good on us. - Vintage friendship rings.

1167
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:31,843
- That's not a small wish. - Good.

1168
00:44:31,844 --> 00:44:33,283
That's how big this challenge is for us.

1169
00:44:33,284 --> 00:44:34,554
Right. This is so difficult.

1170
00:44:34,614 --> 00:44:37,553
- So a friendship ring from a brand. - Yes.

1171
00:44:37,554 --> 00:44:39,683
- Okay. - By brand, we mean...

1172
00:44:39,684 --> 00:44:42,923
a brand that has a store at the airport...

1173
00:44:42,924 --> 00:44:44,723
where we're laying over.

1174
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:45,793
- Sounds good. - A duty-free store.

1175
00:44:45,794 --> 00:44:46,923
- Sounds great. - That's what I mean.

1176
00:44:46,924 --> 00:44:48,563
- Sounds amazing. Thank you. - So then,

1177
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:50,803
- you're getting a huge reward, - Yes.

1178
00:44:50,804 --> 00:44:53,164
- but failing is also a possibility. - Yes.

1179
00:44:53,664 --> 00:44:56,834
So here's the penalty we're suggesting for it.

1180
00:44:56,874 --> 00:44:58,373
If you fail...

1181
00:44:58,374 --> 00:45:00,713
- this challenge. - If we fail?

1182
00:45:00,714 --> 00:45:02,843
You know there's a long schedule we have ahead of us, right?

1183
00:45:02,844 --> 00:45:03,944
After this,

1184
00:45:04,344 --> 00:45:06,384
we were going to play games over lunch,

1185
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:08,653
go bowling,

1186
00:45:08,654 --> 00:45:10,654
visit the Benagil Cave,

1187
00:45:10,784 --> 00:45:13,284
and come back for dinner...

1188
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:14,923
and play more games.

1189
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:16,123
What do you like most?

1190
00:45:16,124 --> 00:45:17,663
You all want to be on TV, right?

1191
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:18,694
Right.

1192
00:45:18,964 --> 00:45:21,234
If you fail to succeed this,

1193
00:45:21,664 --> 00:45:24,333
you still have to follow the same schedule, but...

1194
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:26,280
- But it won't air on TV? - We won't be filming it.

1195
00:45:26,304 --> 00:45:28,174
- What? - What do you think you're doing?

1196
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:30,234
That's awful.

1197
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:33,574
I'm only working this hard because I'm being filmed!

1198
00:45:33,704 --> 00:45:34,943
We did the math,

1199
00:45:34,944 --> 00:45:36,813
and we've already reached the amount of footage...

1200
00:45:36,814 --> 00:45:38,083
- You have enough footage? - that we initially expected.

1201
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:40,313
- Unbelievable. - Then let's just...

1202
00:45:40,314 --> 00:45:41,913
do the wrap-up party.

1203
00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:43,053
No. Never.

1204
00:45:43,054 --> 00:45:44,583
Then you'll get way to comfortable,

1205
00:45:44,584 --> 00:45:46,323
and none of us want to see that.

1206
00:45:46,324 --> 00:45:47,953
- What's wrong with you? - This isn't fair!

1207
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,523
We're going to stick to the schedule.

1208
00:45:49,524 --> 00:45:51,423
But the cameras won't be there?

1209
00:45:51,424 --> 00:45:52,424
The cameras won't be there.

1210
00:45:52,425 --> 00:45:54,570
Then it's like we're just traveling with older family members.

1211
00:45:54,594 --> 00:45:56,864
- We'll be making memories. - Like a group retreat.

1212
00:45:57,094 --> 00:46:01,204
Isn't it a loss for you if we do something funny?

1213
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:02,974
We'll handle that.

1214
00:46:03,204 --> 00:46:05,373
Don't use it for the show.

1215
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:06,673
- Don't mind us. - I have a question.

1216
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:07,974
Are you removing the mics too?

1217
00:46:08,174 --> 00:46:10,713
It's a camera detox, not an audio detox.

1218
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:12,443
Why?

1219
00:46:12,444 --> 00:46:14,714
But... I do a question.

1220
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:17,784
- Do it. Do your question. - I do a question.

1221
00:46:17,824 --> 00:46:20,083
Are the cameramen not joining us as well?

1222
00:46:20,084 --> 00:46:21,724
I want Chang Dae to come with me.

1223
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:23,593
Chang Dae will join you but will have his arms crossed.

1224
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:25,293
- Without his camera. - We'll all go there.

1225
00:46:25,294 --> 00:46:28,433
- We'll all go and make memories. - We'll all go.

1226
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:31,033
- What a waste of manpower. - What is this?

1227
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:32,433
- I don't want to film. - What is this?

1228
00:46:32,434 --> 00:46:33,973
What are we doing this for?

1229
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:35,404
The memory will last a lifetime.

1230
00:46:36,074 --> 00:46:38,404
- But... - It'll be fun.

1231
00:46:38,944 --> 00:46:40,474
What is this?

1232
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:43,744
I've never seen such a show in my life.

1233
00:46:43,984 --> 00:46:47,084
What on earth... Let's just live in Seoul together.

1234
00:46:47,714 --> 00:46:48,983
- If you like that so much. - That's what I mean.

1235
00:46:48,984 --> 00:46:51,153
- I'd prefer that too. - Really? Me too.

1236
00:46:51,154 --> 00:46:52,753
It's fine if we fail too, actually.

1237
00:46:52,754 --> 00:46:54,553
We can just relax and have fun.

1238
00:46:54,554 --> 00:46:55,753
No, we'll make it very intense.

1239
00:46:55,754 --> 00:46:57,663
- We'll have fun intensely, then. - You'll go into the water there.

1240
00:46:57,664 --> 00:46:58,724
Let's go in together.

1241
00:46:59,794 --> 00:47:01,333
- I'm not scared. - Sure.

1242
00:47:01,334 --> 00:47:02,663
- Let's go. - Are you scared?

1243
00:47:02,664 --> 00:47:06,963
- Are you scared? - Are you scared?

1244
00:47:06,964 --> 00:47:08,433
(I am.)

1245
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:11,173
Let's decide on a few rules.

1246
00:47:11,174 --> 00:47:13,003
Like Mount Halla, Mount Baekdu, and the Himalayas.

1247
00:47:13,004 --> 00:47:14,874
- That's fine. - We accept them all.

1248
00:47:14,974 --> 00:47:16,173
- You'll accept them all? - We will.

1249
00:47:16,174 --> 00:47:18,713
- Let us propose what we need first. - We need them.

1250
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:19,714
- Go ahead. - The things we need.

1251
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:21,313
- A mermaid. - Young Ji's pose.

1252
00:47:21,314 --> 00:47:22,883
- A mermaid. - A mermaid.

1253
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:24,423
- A pole. - A pole.

1254
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,624
- Bean. - Bean.

1255
00:47:25,824 --> 00:47:27,894
Only if we shout it out first.

1256
00:47:28,094 --> 00:47:29,324
And rice.

1257
00:47:29,624 --> 00:47:31,764
- The Himalayas. - And the Himalayas.

1258
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:32,864
Throwing it high up.

1259
00:47:33,194 --> 00:47:34,333
What about the piano rule?

1260
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:35,733
- We can. - We can do the piano.

1261
00:47:35,734 --> 00:47:37,833
- That's everything. - We can't do nongae.

1262
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:39,263
- You can't. - Since we can't do nongae,

1263
00:47:39,264 --> 00:47:40,363
we should be allowed piano.

1264
00:47:40,364 --> 00:47:42,433
We're really bad at this. Please go easy on us.

1265
00:47:42,434 --> 00:47:45,003
This... Everything is allowed in Daejeon.

1266
00:47:45,004 --> 00:47:47,120
- We're really bad. - Fine, since you can't do nongae.

1267
00:47:47,144 --> 00:47:48,144
What about rice washing?

1268
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:49,573
- We can wash rice. - We can.

1269
00:47:49,574 --> 00:47:50,913
- Rice washing. - Let us do it.

1270
00:47:50,914 --> 00:47:52,144
But the piano...

1271
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,653
Wait. Allow us to use Men in Black twice.

1272
00:47:54,654 --> 00:47:55,753
For Eun Ji and me.

1273
00:47:55,754 --> 00:47:57,634
- Two each. - Two for Young Ji and Eun Ji each.

1274
00:47:57,684 --> 00:47:58,684
Give us two chances each.

1275
00:47:58,685 --> 00:47:59,723
Let's just do this.

1276
00:47:59,724 --> 00:48:02,723
Throughout the whole game, you're allowed two Men in Blacks.

1277
00:48:02,724 --> 00:48:04,364
Any one of you can use it.

1278
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,693
But it might be better for us two to use it...

1279
00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:09,563
- instead of you two. - You'd rather do that?

1280
00:48:09,564 --> 00:48:11,103
- So... - We'll see how things go.

1281
00:48:11,104 --> 00:48:12,804
- Let's see how things go. - Okay.

1282
00:48:13,064 --> 00:48:14,833
- You must cheer me on. - Of course.

1283
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:16,434
And there's a rule for the audience.

1284
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:18,274
Cheer loudly when I do well.

1285
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:22,074
Sorry, but when I'm playing, please don't make any sound.

1286
00:48:22,544 --> 00:48:24,083
We all have our own set of rules.

1287
00:48:24,084 --> 00:48:26,584
- Cheer loudly for me. - Keep quiet for me too.

1288
00:48:26,684 --> 00:48:28,654
- Me too. - Don't say a word.

1289
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:30,553
(If they succeed, they get to make a wish together)

1290
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:32,283
(But if they fail, they'll go through Camera Detox.)

1291
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,483
(Allowed rules: Mermaid, pole, bean, rice, the Himalayas, piano, )

1292
00:48:33,484 --> 00:48:34,653
(rice washing, Arirang, 2 Men in Blacks)

1293
00:48:34,654 --> 00:48:36,524
- Shall we start with Eun Ji? - I'll start.

1294
00:48:36,824 --> 00:48:38,564
You first. Say "Here I go."

1295
00:48:39,894 --> 00:48:41,694
Let's do the E-cade cheer.

1296
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:42,893
Two, three.

1297
00:48:42,894 --> 00:48:44,304
- E-cade. - E-cade.

1298
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,403
- I'll go. - Let's do it.

1299
00:48:46,404 --> 00:48:48,104
- Say "Here I go." - Are you starting?

1300
00:48:49,474 --> 00:48:52,304
(They've continued to play gonggi since yesterday.)

1301
00:48:53,404 --> 00:48:54,673
I'm nervous.

1302
00:48:54,674 --> 00:48:57,074
(How will it end?)

1303
00:48:59,284 --> 00:49:01,353
It's getting more intense.

1304
00:49:01,354 --> 00:49:03,314
Lee Eun Ji, you can do it.

1305
00:49:03,584 --> 00:49:05,054
- Here I go. - Start.

1306
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:11,124
(Can the 4 of them successfully accumulate 40 years?)

1307
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:17,471
It's getting more intense.

1308
00:49:17,472 --> 00:49:19,272
Lee Eun Ji, you can do it.

1309
00:49:19,611 --> 00:49:21,011
- Here I go. - Start.

1310
00:49:22,311 --> 00:49:27,221
(Can the 4 of them successfully accumulate 40 years?)

1311
00:49:32,661 --> 00:49:34,831
(Men in Black)

1312
00:49:36,231 --> 00:49:38,360
- Men in Black. - Don't use it.

1313
00:49:38,361 --> 00:49:39,731
Why did you say that?

1314
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:43,871
- Men in Black. - Don't use it. Why did you say it?

1315
00:49:44,701 --> 00:49:45,771
Oh, right.

1316
00:49:47,301 --> 00:49:48,940
I'm not supposed to use it.

1317
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:50,061
It's okay, we have one left.

1318
00:49:50,341 --> 00:49:52,981
(She can't watch.)

1319
00:49:53,981 --> 00:49:55,881
It's okay. We have one left.

1320
00:49:57,311 --> 00:49:58,380
Eun Ji.

1321
00:49:58,381 --> 00:49:59,701
(She focuses back on her gonggi.)

1322
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:03,120
Don't intimidate Eun Ji.

1323
00:50:03,121 --> 00:50:05,121
It's okay. Good job.

1324
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:07,121
I'm so nervous.

1325
00:50:07,461 --> 00:50:09,090
Take it slow. It's okay.

1326
00:50:09,091 --> 00:50:11,861
You can do it. Take it slow. You can take ten years to play.

1327
00:50:16,401 --> 00:50:17,401
Nice.

1328
00:50:18,001 --> 00:50:19,271
Can you be quiet?

1329
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:21,441
(My bad.)

1330
00:50:24,141 --> 00:50:25,841
- It's okay. - Two years.

1331
00:50:26,741 --> 00:50:28,351
- It's okay. - Two years.

1332
00:50:28,881 --> 00:50:31,420
Slowly.

1333
00:50:31,421 --> 00:50:34,791
(She starts back from Level 1 calmly.)

1334
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:40,321
(They're a bit iffy to split into twos.)

1335
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:42,160
(Sighing deeply)

1336
00:50:42,161 --> 00:50:43,730
It's okay.

1337
00:50:43,731 --> 00:50:45,961
- It's totally doable. - You're a genius.

1338
00:50:46,061 --> 00:50:47,401
Throw it high.

1339
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:49,901
It's okay. Don't doubt yourself.

1340
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:51,571
(Thanks for your support.)

1341
00:50:54,211 --> 00:50:55,911
Move to Hannam The Hill. Okay.

1342
00:50:56,841 --> 00:50:58,310
- You can do it. - Let's go. Don't be intimidated.

1343
00:50:58,311 --> 00:50:59,341
You can beat it all.

1344
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:02,911
Nice.

1345
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:06,481
I can't breathe.

1346
00:51:07,991 --> 00:51:09,551
Shall we stop saying anything at all?

1347
00:51:10,021 --> 00:51:12,121
- No, now is perfect. - Nice.

1348
00:51:16,861 --> 00:51:18,661
You can do it.

1349
00:51:19,631 --> 00:51:21,301
(Eun Ji is eliminated.)

1350
00:51:23,201 --> 00:51:24,870
(She was holding back her sneeze.)

1351
00:51:24,871 --> 00:51:26,070
It's the flip. You're good at it.

1352
00:51:26,071 --> 00:51:28,641
Does that make it two years?

1353
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,510
We need to save it.

1354
00:51:31,511 --> 00:51:33,710
(The staff members are murmuring.)

1355
00:51:33,711 --> 00:51:34,880
Don't laugh.

1356
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:36,480
- Do you want our reactions? - What would you like, Young Ji?

1357
00:51:36,481 --> 00:51:38,120
- How... - Just don't mock me.

1358
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:39,920
- Okay. - You're okay with cheering?

1359
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:41,191
- I like cheering. - I got it.

1360
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,091
Let's go.

1361
00:51:44,761 --> 00:51:45,790
Three years.

1362
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,337
(With 1 catch, it's 3 years, and 37 years remain.)

1363
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:48,391
Three years.

1364
00:51:48,831 --> 00:51:49,990
(It's more of a mockery than a cheer.)

1365
00:51:49,991 --> 00:51:55,330
- Lee Young Ji! - Lee Young Ji!

1366
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:57,170
(But she asked for it.)

1367
00:51:57,171 --> 00:51:59,001
- Let's go. - It's three years.

1368
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:01,011
You can do it. Stay calm.

1369
00:52:02,011 --> 00:52:03,840
(She throws the gonggi calmly.)

1370
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:04,981
Stay calm.

1371
00:52:05,711 --> 00:52:06,941
(Focused)

1372
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:11,521
Don't.

1373
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:15,690
(Laughing)

1374
00:52:15,691 --> 00:52:18,860
Don't. It's okay. You did well.

1375
00:52:18,861 --> 00:52:20,860
You did well.

1376
00:52:20,861 --> 00:52:22,430
(She is eliminated in Level 1.)

1377
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:26,561
After two days of practice...

1378
00:52:27,671 --> 00:52:29,700
- After 2 days of practice... - She practiced for 2 days,

1379
00:52:29,701 --> 00:52:31,141
but she got eliminated in Level 1.

1380
00:52:32,171 --> 00:52:33,800
(Shocking and terrifying)

1381
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:35,370
- Two days of practice... - Three years and Level One.

1382
00:52:35,371 --> 00:52:36,471
Why did you even practice?

1383
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:40,341
Be quiet, or you might lower Young Ji's self-esteem.

1384
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:42,351
(The 3rd player, Mimi)

1385
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:43,581
She caught one.

1386
00:52:49,351 --> 00:52:50,821
- Nice. - She's calm.

1387
00:52:51,891 --> 00:52:53,160
- She's good. - Mimi is good.

1388
00:52:53,161 --> 00:52:55,691
(She is rather stable.)

1389
00:52:55,991 --> 00:52:57,231
She taped her bracelets.

1390
00:52:57,561 --> 00:52:58,801
So that they won't move around.

1391
00:52:58,831 --> 00:52:59,901
- Nice. - Nice.

1392
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:02,331
- Nice. She's stable. - Seven years.

1393
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:03,801
She's stable.

1394
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:06,741
(She starts to speed up.)

1395
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:11,381
(She goes through the levels at a breakneck speed.)

1396
00:53:13,181 --> 00:53:14,910
(She catches 5, and it's 12 years with 28 years remaining.)

1397
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:16,380
- Twelve years. - Twelve years.

1398
00:53:16,381 --> 00:53:18,550
Did you see that? She caught all five.

1399
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:20,181
- Twelve years. - It's so shocking.

1400
00:53:21,721 --> 00:53:22,850
(Even when they are close to one another)

1401
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:24,931
- Which level is this? - It's okay. You've got this.

1402
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:28,361
- Nice. - Okay. Good job.

1403
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:30,531
Doesn't she look like a different person?

1404
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:32,561
- She's so sexy. - She's not the Mimi I know.

1405
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:34,971
Good job.

1406
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,000
- Nice, sixteen years. - Sixteen years.

1407
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:38,601
How can she be so calm?

1408
00:53:39,171 --> 00:53:41,211
(The audience is stirring up.)

1409
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:43,171
How can she stay so calm?

1410
00:53:43,271 --> 00:53:45,311
- The staff members are shocked. - Mimi.

1411
00:53:45,941 --> 00:53:49,181
(She starts speeding up again.)

1412
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:53,251
(A gonggi bounces off her hand.)

1413
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:55,120
- Rice. - Rice.

1414
00:53:55,121 --> 00:53:57,050
- That's rice. - Rice.

1415
00:53:57,051 --> 00:53:58,090
- That... - No.

1416
00:53:58,091 --> 00:54:01,761
(It fell out way too fast for it to be rice.)

1417
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:05,160
(Upon checking, she failed.)

1418
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:06,500
- That... - No.

1419
00:54:06,501 --> 00:54:07,660
To be honest, it is an out.

1420
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,941
This is a hard decision to make.

1421
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:11,841
Will you use Men in Black or not?

1422
00:54:12,101 --> 00:54:13,370
- Yu Jin... - How many years do we have?

1423
00:54:13,371 --> 00:54:14,570
- Sixteen years. - Sixteen years.

1424
00:54:14,571 --> 00:54:16,251
Let's use Men in Black and finish this up.

1425
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:17,741
How do you feel?

1426
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:19,680
Staying calm is not bad.

1427
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:21,511
- Use Men in Black. - You should use it then.

1428
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:22,981
- Static. - Mimi.

1429
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,121
Then from the flip?

1430
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:28,190
(Starting again from the flip with 16 years.)

1431
00:54:28,191 --> 00:54:29,550
You can use piano.

1432
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:31,791
- Twenty years. - She's good at that.

1433
00:54:31,891 --> 00:54:33,160
Good.

1434
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:34,841
(They've covered half of the total years.)

1435
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:36,830
It's okay.

1436
00:54:36,831 --> 00:54:38,061
You can do it.

1437
00:54:39,001 --> 00:54:40,031
- Nice. - Okay.

1438
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:46,201
(Mimi is eliminated.)

1439
00:54:52,241 --> 00:54:53,310
(She still did well, winning 17 years on her own.)

1440
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:54,411
Good job.

1441
00:54:54,951 --> 00:54:56,180
- I'm sorry. - You did well.

1442
00:54:56,181 --> 00:54:58,150
- You did well. - You're the best.

1443
00:54:58,151 --> 00:54:59,151
You're the best, Mimi.

1444
00:54:59,152 --> 00:55:00,280
- Oh, no! - An Yu Jin.

1445
00:55:00,281 --> 00:55:01,450
Don't push yourself with Arirang.

1446
00:55:01,451 --> 00:55:02,521
I...

1447
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:04,350
Complete silence for me, please.

1448
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:05,490
- Complete silence. - Complete silence.

1449
00:55:05,491 --> 00:55:07,060
(We'll play the music softer too.)

1450
00:55:07,061 --> 00:55:08,261
React with your faces only.

1451
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:16,031
(Exhaling)

1452
00:55:24,171 --> 00:55:25,841
- Twenty-six years. - Twenty-six years.

1453
00:55:26,511 --> 00:55:28,480
(She put 3 on the back of her hand...)

1454
00:55:28,481 --> 00:55:30,481
(and caught them using Arirang.)

1455
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:33,821
(That's it.)

1456
00:55:34,181 --> 00:55:36,521
(Please, Yu Jin.)

1457
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:43,191
(As the ace, she is stable.)

1458
00:55:49,631 --> 00:55:51,030
(She lands 5 with ease!)

1459
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:52,101
Play it safe.

1460
00:55:52,301 --> 00:55:54,470
(If she succeeds using Arirang, they hit 36 years.)

1461
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:55,511
Play it safe.

1462
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,281
Play it safe.

1463
00:55:58,511 --> 00:56:00,410
(A gonggi)

1464
00:56:00,411 --> 00:56:01,451
The end!

1465
00:56:02,011 --> 00:56:04,181
He's so annoying!

1466
00:56:04,551 --> 00:56:07,020
- I hate Brother Yeong Seok! - Give us one more chance each.

1467
00:56:07,021 --> 00:56:09,151
One each.

1468
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:12,290
Then is the filming for Earth Arcade 3 over?

1469
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:14,190
(Young Ji: Then is the filming for Earth Arcade 3 over?)

1470
00:56:14,191 --> 00:56:15,230
For real?

1471
00:56:15,231 --> 00:56:16,990
Is this really the end of the shoot?

1472
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:18,000
(Laughing)

1473
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:20,761
We end it with gonggi in Portugal?

1474
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:22,871
- Remove our mics! - Take them out!

1475
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,570
- We'll remove our mics. - Not the mics.

1476
00:56:24,571 --> 00:56:25,740
- I told you, not the mics. - We'll remove them.

1477
00:56:25,741 --> 00:56:26,770
- Why? - Why not?

1478
00:56:26,771 --> 00:56:28,740
- Why won't you remove the mics? - We already told you.

1479
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:30,640
We said before that we wouldn't...

1480
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:32,080
It's just a camera detox.

1481
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:33,210
Why won't you do an audio detox?

1482
00:56:33,211 --> 00:56:34,857
- I'll place my mic here then. - In case you act like this!

1483
00:56:34,881 --> 00:56:36,151
In case you act like this!

1484
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:37,711
We need to secure the evidence!

1485
00:56:38,421 --> 00:56:40,080
(Things are getting more heated.)

1486
00:56:40,081 --> 00:56:41,390
There's no use recording our voices.

1487
00:56:41,391 --> 00:56:42,850
We need to record in case you act like this!

1488
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:44,191
I have a suggestion.

1489
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:46,991
- I have a suggestion. - Go ahead.

1490
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,331
Father.

1491
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:50,290
- Our short-form video... - Yes?

1492
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:51,901
- exceeded 20 million views. - Yes.

1493
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:53,300
- Initially, - Yes.

1494
00:56:53,301 --> 00:56:55,201
We expected it to hit ten million views,

1495
00:56:55,301 --> 00:56:56,831
but it hit 20 million.

1496
00:56:56,901 --> 00:57:00,540
Since it doubled from 10 million and became 20 million,

1497
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:01,810
we should have two tries...

1498
00:57:01,811 --> 00:57:03,971
- at gonggi as well. - She is right.

1499
00:57:04,111 --> 00:57:06,640
When you perform well, you get an incentive.

1500
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:08,750
- But we won't ask for it. - I've never gotten one from you.

1501
00:57:08,751 --> 00:57:11,251
All we ask for is another chance at gonggi.

1502
00:57:11,421 --> 00:57:13,320
Father, can't you make it work?

1503
00:57:13,321 --> 00:57:15,450
- If we agree to it, - One more round.

1504
00:57:15,451 --> 00:57:16,790
- what will you do for us? - What will you do?

1505
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:18,120
We got you a video...

1506
00:57:18,121 --> 00:57:19,320
with 20 million views.

1507
00:57:19,321 --> 00:57:20,560
- That's not related. - Or what about...

1508
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:22,490
removing the "branded" condition from our friendship ring?

1509
00:57:22,491 --> 00:57:23,760
Just rings, not branded rings.

1510
00:57:23,761 --> 00:57:25,561
Like jade rings?

1511
00:57:25,931 --> 00:57:27,401
Non-branded rings?

1512
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:28,700
I'm for it.

1513
00:57:28,701 --> 00:57:30,000
- Let's do it. - Another 40 years?

1514
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:31,670
The friendship rings aren't important now.

1515
00:57:31,671 --> 00:57:32,800
I want to beat 40 years.

1516
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:34,041
- Exactly my thought. - Me too.

1517
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:35,310
- I don't need it. - Let's do it.

1518
00:57:35,311 --> 00:57:36,870
- You'll do it? - Yes.

1519
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:37,871
- Yes. - Let's do it.

1520
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:39,240
(If they succeed, they get non-branded friendship rings.)

1521
00:57:39,241 --> 00:57:41,211
(If they fail, it's camera detox time for real.)

1522
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:45,181
(Everyone sits back down to watch the actual final round.)

1523
00:57:46,351 --> 00:57:47,351
The second try.

1524
00:57:48,121 --> 00:57:50,520
This round has your non-branded friendship rings...

1525
00:57:50,521 --> 00:57:52,361
and your pride on the line.

1526
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,991
Let's do the E-cade cheer. Two, three.

1527
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:56,160
- E-cade. - E-cade.

1528
00:57:56,161 --> 00:57:57,361
Let's go, Eun Ji.

1529
00:57:58,561 --> 00:57:59,761
- Here I go. - Start.

1530
00:57:59,931 --> 00:58:01,701
Your second try starts now.

1531
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,001
(The final try)

1532
00:58:07,101 --> 00:58:08,781
(Wiping her sweat is part of her routine.)

1533
00:58:08,971 --> 00:58:12,141
(She concentrates hard again.)

1534
00:58:17,051 --> 00:58:18,051
Nice.

1535
00:58:19,421 --> 00:58:20,451
Fail!

1536
00:58:21,351 --> 00:58:22,390
- Okay. - Young Ji next.

1537
00:58:22,391 --> 00:58:24,150
- Aren't you going to use it? - You're not using it?

1538
00:58:24,151 --> 00:58:25,560
- She's not. - You didn't use it.

1539
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:27,067
(I won't make the same mistake twice.)

1540
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:28,160
It's Level Two.

1541
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:29,460
(Young Ji also puts behind her first failure.)

1542
00:58:29,461 --> 00:58:30,491
You can do it.

1543
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:34,161
Fail!

1544
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:36,200
(With one throw, it's over.)

1545
00:58:36,201 --> 00:58:37,271
She didn't catch one.

1546
00:58:37,701 --> 00:58:38,741
Fail!

1547
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:41,071
(A moment of silence)

1548
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:44,010
(There's no consolation left for her at this point.)

1549
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:45,941
- I'm so nervous. - It's okay.

1550
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,150
It's okay to fail.

1551
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,271
(Her mistake hits her hard.)

1552
00:58:50,481 --> 00:58:51,720
It's the challenge meant for these two anyway.

1553
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:53,481
Each of them has to do 20 years.

1554
00:58:54,221 --> 00:58:56,551
(Their saving grace...)

1555
00:58:57,491 --> 00:58:58,990
(is that they have 2 aces...)

1556
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:00,491
(and 2 Men in Blacks left.)

1557
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:03,791
(3rd player, Mimi)

1558
00:59:08,631 --> 00:59:09,631
Fail!

1559
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:10,900
- Men in Black. - Men in Black.

1560
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:12,340
(Men in Black)

1561
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:15,471
(They have one Men in Black left.)

1562
00:59:15,871 --> 00:59:16,911
I'm getting more nervous.

1563
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:18,481
It's okay.

1564
00:59:19,941 --> 00:59:20,941
Fail!

1565
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:23,651
It's year zero.

1566
00:59:23,751 --> 00:59:25,920
(Mimi's continued failure...)

1567
00:59:25,921 --> 00:59:28,121
(makes her rapidly anxious.)

1568
00:59:28,451 --> 00:59:30,321
You can do 40 years on your own, Yu Jin.

1569
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:32,560
Look at her palms sweating.

1570
00:59:32,561 --> 00:59:33,961
Her palms are all sweaty.

1571
00:59:34,931 --> 00:59:36,361
(She easily places 5.)

1572
00:59:37,531 --> 00:59:39,560
Fail! It's over.

1573
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:41,331
- Men in Black. - Men in Black.

1574
00:59:41,971 --> 00:59:44,200
(He thought it was over and shouted "Fail" excitedly.)

1575
00:59:44,201 --> 00:59:45,940
(Jade Emperor's urgent tapping)

1576
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:46,941
Okay.

1577
00:59:46,942 --> 00:59:48,422
She plays like it's the Summer Games.

1578
00:59:49,111 --> 00:59:50,511
(She places just 3 this time.)

1579
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:52,611
- Six years. - Six years.

1580
00:59:54,281 --> 00:59:57,451
(Why are they all so close to each other?)

1581
00:59:58,051 --> 01:00:01,221
(All she can do is laugh.)

1582
01:00:04,891 --> 01:00:06,360
Fail!

1583
01:00:06,361 --> 01:00:07,421
(Yu Jin fails.)

1584
01:00:07,591 --> 01:00:09,161
You failed. It's over!

1585
01:00:09,491 --> 01:00:12,700
(The cheers of the staff)

1586
01:00:12,701 --> 01:00:15,170
From now on, it's just our memories.

1587
01:00:15,171 --> 01:00:16,301
I'll remove the mounts too.

1588
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:18,071
Is it over?

1589
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:19,801
Is this the end of Earth Arcade 3?

1590
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:21,200
Hey.

1591
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:23,170
- Let's just drink some soju. - Let's drink soju.

1592
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:24,570
As I said, your mics are working.

1593
01:00:24,571 --> 01:00:26,181
This is why I didn't remove them.

1594
01:00:26,311 --> 01:00:28,711
- Cameramen, you can pack up. - Film us.

1595
01:00:28,951 --> 01:00:30,281
- I am here. - Let's go.

1596
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,520
(Meanwhile, the staff prepares at the next location)

1597
01:00:33,521 --> 01:00:35,821
For now, we'll pack up.

1598
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,190
Pardon?

1599
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:38,991
- For now, we'll pack up. - Okay.

1600
01:00:39,161 --> 01:00:40,260
Pack up for now.

1601
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,390
(They start packing up out of nowhere.)

1602
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:44,030
(The cameramen get off work.)

1603
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:45,061
Thank you for your work.

1604
01:00:45,161 --> 01:00:47,530
(And in the lodging too...)

1605
01:00:47,531 --> 01:00:48,600
One, two, three.

1606
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:50,330
(Clapping)

1607
01:00:50,331 --> 01:00:52,600
(Power off)

1608
01:00:52,601 --> 01:00:54,811
They're really packing the cameras.

1609
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:56,770
You can pack up.

1610
01:00:56,771 --> 01:00:58,381
They're removing the mounts too.

1611
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:00,511
Please take a photo of this.

1612
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:02,881
This will all become good memory.

1613
01:01:03,081 --> 01:01:04,550
Are we really leaving?

1614
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:05,620
(Memorable photo 1)

1615
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:06,650
Yes.

1616
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:08,120
(Memorable photo 1)

1617
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:09,890
Will we play games when we eat as well?

1618
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:10,920
(Memorable photo 2)

1619
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:12,190
We're going to play games when we eat?

1620
01:01:12,191 --> 01:01:13,191
Of course.

1621
01:01:13,192 --> 01:01:15,791
(Memorable photo 3)

1622
01:01:16,231 --> 01:01:18,731
The cameramen look so happy.

1623
01:01:18,961 --> 01:01:21,700
But Director Sun Woo has to keep working.

1624
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:24,501
(Kim Sun Woo, the audio director, usually has a smiley face.)

1625
01:01:24,701 --> 01:01:25,740
(During the Mouth Detox, )

1626
01:01:25,741 --> 01:01:26,741
(Thank you!)

1627
01:01:26,742 --> 01:01:28,871
(Sun Woo got off work.)

1628
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:31,431
Take a picture of me with Director Sun Woo.

1629
01:01:32,081 --> 01:01:34,181
His face will turn even darker.

1630
01:01:34,911 --> 01:01:36,311
The camera isn't turned off.

1631
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:37,811
This.

1632
01:01:38,351 --> 01:01:40,450
We're eating ice cream after the filming is over.

1633
01:01:40,451 --> 01:01:43,021
- Filming in secret. - What's the use of all this?

1634
01:01:43,591 --> 01:01:44,960
- What we're going to do now is... - Thank you.

1635
01:01:44,961 --> 01:01:47,191
We'll take a boat, and...

1636
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,260
You're so evil.

1637
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:50,741
(Even their last hope is taken away.)

1638
01:01:51,061 --> 01:01:52,500
- I'm hungry. - Me too.

1639
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:53,831
Aren't we going to eat now?

1640
01:01:54,061 --> 01:01:55,370
Why are we here?

1641
01:01:55,371 --> 01:01:56,600
It's the lunch game.

1642
01:01:56,601 --> 01:01:58,121
- Are we really playing? - You should.

1643
01:01:58,741 --> 01:02:00,371
- It's sad. - It's so bare and empty.

1644
01:02:00,901 --> 01:02:03,271
Seriously, what's this?

1645
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:06,610
(It looks so empty.)

1646
01:02:06,611 --> 01:02:08,811
This is the prettiest place. Why won't you film it?

1647
01:02:10,011 --> 01:02:11,351
What's this?

1648
01:02:12,621 --> 01:02:14,950
Let's see what kind of food...

1649
01:02:14,951 --> 01:02:16,350
they have.

1650
01:02:16,351 --> 01:02:18,191
- Bring in the food. - I can't believe this.

1651
01:02:18,421 --> 01:02:20,621
I really can't believe this. What are you doing?

1652
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:22,731
It looks delicious.

1653
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:25,130
- Can I start eating? - No.

1654
01:02:25,131 --> 01:02:26,691
- You must play a game. - It's a steak.

1655
01:02:26,761 --> 01:02:29,081
- Can I start eating right away? - There's a game to play.

1656
01:02:30,731 --> 01:02:32,501
- Start eating. - Play a game first.

1657
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:33,701
(Are you scared?)

1658
01:02:33,702 --> 01:02:34,911
Take a bite, Yu Jin.

1659
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:37,410
(Today's dishes, beware of the bad focus.)

1660
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:40,241
(Terrible food photos)

1661
01:02:40,611 --> 01:02:42,510
Look here. We'll take pictures.

1662
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:44,087
(Staff: Look here. We'll take pictures.)

1663
01:02:44,111 --> 01:02:45,980
The filming is over, so what are you doing?

1664
01:02:45,981 --> 01:02:47,980
- There's so many of them. - As I said just now,

1665
01:02:47,981 --> 01:02:50,291
we'll stick to the schedule as planned.

1666
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:51,721
For our memories.

1667
01:02:52,461 --> 01:02:54,261
The lunch game is...

1668
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:57,191
Hunminjeongeum Speed Quiz.

1669
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:58,701
Mimi said...

1670
01:02:59,231 --> 01:03:00,801
Yu Jin is like a model...

1671
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:02,101
- "Model." - "Model."

1672
01:03:03,131 --> 01:03:04,330
What was it?

1673
01:03:04,331 --> 01:03:05,470
Brownie.

1674
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,471
(This game can only be found in their memories.)

1675
01:03:06,472 --> 01:03:08,371
What's that round thing?

1676
01:03:08,441 --> 01:03:09,541
It looks fun.

1677
01:03:09,611 --> 01:03:10,640
Nice.

1678
01:03:10,641 --> 01:03:12,180
(Yu Jin screaming)

1679
01:03:12,181 --> 01:03:13,181
What is it?

1680
01:03:14,011 --> 01:03:16,251
(You won't be able to see it, but it's very fast.)

1681
01:03:16,511 --> 01:03:18,180
It won't move. How do I move it?

1682
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:19,320
(Young Ji is scared.)

1683
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:21,080
- I'm not going to bowl. - Me neither.

1684
01:03:21,081 --> 01:03:23,091
- I won't bowl. - I won't bowl.

1685
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:24,421
Start.

1686
01:03:25,561 --> 01:03:26,921
(The staff members are surprised.)

1687
01:03:26,961 --> 01:03:29,160
(They all are engrossed in the arcade.)

1688
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:30,891
- Here she goes. - Let's go.

1689
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:33,760
(Eun Ji throws a strong punch.)

1690
01:03:33,761 --> 01:03:36,131
I had a lot of fun, Earth Arcade.

1691
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:38,271
Producer Na.

1692
01:03:38,741 --> 01:03:40,270
Get us friendship rings.

1693
01:03:40,271 --> 01:03:41,541
I want jade rings.

1694
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:44,441
Get us friendship rings.

1695
01:03:44,981 --> 01:03:46,181
(Get us friendship rings.)

1696
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:50,781
(Torong, Bounty)

1697
01:03:55,851 --> 01:03:56,851
(Korea)

1698
01:03:56,852 --> 01:03:59,191
(From cold February in Seoul to Abu Dhabi to catch Torong)

1699
01:03:59,921 --> 01:04:04,561
(They caught Torong in Lisbon, the romantic city.)

1700
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:06,630
(As a reward for catching him, )

1701
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:09,501
(they enjoyed a holiday in Albufeira in the southern region.)

1702
01:04:10,131 --> 01:04:13,870
(And they safely arrived back in Seoul.)

1703
01:04:13,871 --> 01:04:15,371
(After a few months)

1704
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,811
(For the agents who worked hard to catch Torong, )

1705
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:20,441
(we're holding a rooftop party as a reward.)

1706
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:22,851
(Welcome to Jade Emperor's party.)

1707
01:04:23,311 --> 01:04:24,981
(From a glamorous photo zone...)

1708
01:04:25,451 --> 01:04:28,181
(to a red carpet for the members)

1709
01:04:28,551 --> 01:04:30,121
(And...)

1710
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:31,961
(These are a must at parties.)

1711
01:04:32,421 --> 01:04:36,131
(Sweet snacks to pump up your sugar level)

1712
01:04:36,761 --> 01:04:38,461
(Afternoon tea for the members)

1713
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:41,501
(There are friendship rings as promised.)

1714
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:44,871
(What will the agents wear to the party?)

1715
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:46,901
Hello. My gosh.

1716
01:04:47,271 --> 01:04:48,471
(Mimi is the first to arrive.)

1717
01:04:48,741 --> 01:04:50,441
It's a party!

1718
01:04:50,771 --> 01:04:52,141
- Hello! - Hello.

1719
01:04:52,781 --> 01:04:54,010
(She spots the photo zone.)

1720
01:04:54,011 --> 01:04:56,511
(She stands in the photo zone smoothly.)

1721
01:04:56,981 --> 01:04:58,010
(A flood of camera shutters greet her.)

1722
01:04:58,011 --> 01:04:59,550
- Mimi, your hair is so pretty. - Hello.

1723
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:00,551
Hello.

1724
01:05:00,781 --> 01:05:03,550
I thought about overdressing a bit.

1725
01:05:03,551 --> 01:05:05,221
But that seemed a bit clingy.

1726
01:05:05,491 --> 01:05:07,191
- "Clingy?" - I mean, cringy.

1727
01:05:07,491 --> 01:05:09,131
- Cringy. Clingy. - Clingy.

1728
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:11,130
I went for a chic look today.

1729
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:12,161
A chic look.

1730
01:05:12,201 --> 01:05:13,660
The frills here are the highlight.

1731
01:05:13,661 --> 01:05:15,530
- The frills. - Oh, that's cute.

1732
01:05:15,531 --> 01:05:17,730
Since it's summer, I dressed coolly.

1733
01:05:17,731 --> 01:05:19,371
Gold is for summer, everyone.

1734
01:05:19,641 --> 01:05:21,040
(Exclaiming)

1735
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:22,141
Feel this.

1736
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:24,211
I feel as if I'm standing in front of a giant fan.

1737
01:05:24,841 --> 01:05:27,281
This table is right where the sun is beaming down.

1738
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:29,451
It's right under the sun.

1739
01:05:30,411 --> 01:05:32,020
We are having tea here?

1740
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:33,050
That's right.

1741
01:05:33,051 --> 01:05:34,450
(Scowling)

1742
01:05:34,451 --> 01:05:35,811
(The present temperature is 32°C.)

1743
01:05:35,991 --> 01:05:37,290
I thought you liked hot weather.

1744
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:39,661
Yes, but I don't drink something hot when it's hot.

1745
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:44,291
(Next up is someone with an extraordinary look.)

1746
01:05:44,561 --> 01:05:45,881
Are we going for a rooftop party?

1747
01:05:46,431 --> 01:05:48,231
(Her aura shines through the blur.)

1748
01:05:48,471 --> 01:05:49,531
It's Eun Ji.

1749
01:05:50,231 --> 01:05:51,330
(Welcome.)

1750
01:05:51,331 --> 01:05:53,601
(Laughing)

1751
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,340
(She makes an entrance like a grand prince.)

1752
01:05:55,341 --> 01:05:56,741
You went for that look?

1753
01:05:56,941 --> 01:05:58,711
Goodness, Eun Ji.

1754
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:00,211
Eun Ji is here.

1755
01:06:00,681 --> 01:06:01,710
Eun Ji.

1756
01:06:01,711 --> 01:06:02,750
(Ta-da!)

1757
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:03,781
Hello.

1758
01:06:04,581 --> 01:06:05,901
This is as far as self-love goes.

1759
01:06:06,621 --> 01:06:07,780
That's awesome!

1760
01:06:07,781 --> 01:06:09,020
- Mimi. - Yes?

1761
01:06:09,021 --> 01:06:10,890
- How have you been? - What about you?

1762
01:06:10,891 --> 01:06:12,520
- I really missed you. - Me too.

1763
01:06:12,521 --> 01:06:15,230
You've been working hard.

1764
01:06:15,231 --> 01:06:17,361
- Go to the photo wall first. - The photo wall?

1765
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:19,830
I'm sorry, but are you wearing a curtain?

1766
01:06:19,831 --> 01:06:22,771
I don't know if I should say this, this is so cheap-looking.

1767
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:25,001
So cheap-looking.

1768
01:06:25,471 --> 01:06:26,571
Do I look okay?

1769
01:06:26,641 --> 01:06:28,671
Please look to the left.

1770
01:06:29,211 --> 01:06:30,241
To the center.

1771
01:06:30,771 --> 01:06:32,311
Look to this side, please.

1772
01:06:33,011 --> 01:06:35,381
I think we need to hear the concept of your look today.

1773
01:06:35,611 --> 01:06:37,010
I was told it was a party.

1774
01:06:37,011 --> 01:06:38,680
I came wearing my party outfit.

1775
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:40,550
- That's your own? - It's something I had at home.

1776
01:06:40,551 --> 01:06:41,551
For when there is a party?

1777
01:06:41,552 --> 01:06:44,920
Yes, I wore this to Gabee's birthday party.

1778
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:45,921
I remember.

1779
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:47,091
Hey!

1780
01:06:47,691 --> 01:06:49,361
- Right! Yes! - Yes!

1781
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,530
- I met So Ji Sub. - I know.

1782
01:06:51,531 --> 01:06:53,360
- We saw that. - It was unbelievable.

1783
01:06:53,361 --> 01:06:54,830
Didn't your heart beat like crazy?

1784
01:06:54,831 --> 01:06:58,171
It was the most nervous I’ve ever been on radio.

1785
01:06:58,371 --> 01:07:00,771
("Lee Eun Ji's Gayo Plaza" aired on May 30, 2025)

1786
01:07:00,971 --> 01:07:03,451
(She finally met Cha Moo Hyeok who came to promote his drama.)

1787
01:07:03,641 --> 01:07:04,810
(She jumps right into her Oh Deul Hee acting.)

1788
01:07:04,811 --> 01:07:06,780
(Shutting his eyes)

1789
01:07:06,781 --> 01:07:08,180
(Eun Ji’s signature dishwashing scene)

1790
01:07:08,181 --> 01:07:09,181
(Snorting)

1791
01:07:09,182 --> 01:07:10,450
What's wrong with me?

1792
01:07:10,451 --> 01:07:11,780
(Fascinated)

1793
01:07:11,781 --> 01:07:13,151
(What's wrong with me?)

1794
01:07:13,551 --> 01:07:14,580
(Showing her legendary acting to Cha Moo Hyeok)

1795
01:07:14,581 --> 01:07:16,491
(Moved)

1796
01:07:16,691 --> 01:07:19,460
Everyone I meet these days keeps talking about it.

1797
01:07:19,461 --> 01:07:21,067
(This "I'm Sorry, I Love You" fanatic is happy.)

1798
01:07:21,091 --> 01:07:23,991
(She's a true fan.)

1799
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:25,661
I was so grateful...

1800
01:07:25,931 --> 01:07:28,930
- because he gave me a signed CD. - CD?

1801
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:32,370
It was a rare "I'm Sorry, I Love You" CD.

1802
01:07:32,371 --> 01:07:34,300
- Gosh. - He personally signed it.

1803
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:36,110
He wrote on it "To Eun Ji, the 'I'm Sorry, I Love You' fanatic."

1804
01:07:36,111 --> 01:07:37,971
He signed the CD and gave it to me.

1805
01:07:38,371 --> 01:07:40,781
(CD with Cha Moo Hyeok's autograph)

1806
01:07:41,011 --> 01:07:43,411
(And an "I'm Sorry, I Love You" T-shirt)

1807
01:07:43,881 --> 01:07:46,381
(Thank you, Mr. Cha.)

1808
01:07:46,581 --> 01:07:48,750
The streaming platform...

1809
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:51,591
sent me some "I'm Sorry, I Love You" merch before.

1810
01:07:51,821 --> 01:07:53,360
So I asked them again.

1811
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:55,530
I told them there is a producer named Jun Young.

1812
01:07:55,531 --> 01:07:58,031
That he was on another level being a fanatic of the series.

1813
01:07:58,391 --> 01:08:01,431
So I got some merchandise for him too and sent them over.

1814
01:08:02,231 --> 01:08:04,030
I got them during the weekend, and I was in tears.

1815
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:05,600
- Really? - Yes.

1816
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:08,101
- They are really hard to get. - They are.

1817
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,310
I saw the challenge and everything,

1818
01:08:10,311 --> 01:08:11,570
- but I didn't see that. - Really?

1819
01:08:11,571 --> 01:08:13,581
- I hear some noise. - Someone's coming.

1820
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:15,080
(Screaming)

1821
01:08:15,081 --> 01:08:17,811
- She's so pretty! - Yu Jin, you look so pretty!

1822
01:08:18,281 --> 01:08:20,551
(Making an entrance with her long hair flowing, )

1823
01:08:21,451 --> 01:08:23,250
(Yu Jin has switched back to her idol self.)

1824
01:08:23,251 --> 01:08:24,521
You've lost so much weight.

1825
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:27,691
- How come you lost so much weight? - What's happening?

1826
01:08:27,861 --> 01:08:28,960
You look so pretty.

1827
01:08:28,961 --> 01:08:30,530
- You look so pretty. - Yu Jin.

1828
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:31,861
How come you lost so much weight?

1829
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:33,531
I'm an idol.

1830
01:08:33,701 --> 01:08:34,801
(Embarrassed)

1831
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:36,500
She's not the same person we went with.

1832
01:08:36,501 --> 01:08:38,641
- Are you making a comeback? - Who are you?

1833
01:08:38,741 --> 01:08:40,040
You're dressed for Coachella.

1834
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:42,547
- This is Coachella-style. - Yu Jin, are you making a comeback?

1835
01:08:42,571 --> 01:08:44,941
- We're preparing for it. - I see.

1836
01:08:44,971 --> 01:08:47,141
- Why are you talking like that? - I know!

1837
01:08:47,881 --> 01:08:49,250
- Go to photo zone. - I'm sorry. But you're not...

1838
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:50,350
- the person we went with. - The photo zone.

1839
01:08:50,351 --> 01:08:51,580
- Someone else has come. - It's a different person.

1840
01:08:51,581 --> 01:08:52,780
The photo zone.

1841
01:08:52,781 --> 01:08:55,220
- Why is Yu Jin such a lady today? - I know.

1842
01:08:55,221 --> 01:08:57,390
- Hey! - She looks so pretty.

1843
01:08:57,391 --> 01:08:58,451
She has...

1844
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:01,790
- Mimi, she's so... - That's so pretty.

1845
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:03,831
I'll tell you about the concept of my look today.

1846
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:07,261
I monitored Earth Arcade very closely.

1847
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:09,131
(Laughing)

1848
01:09:09,401 --> 01:09:11,201
- I figured, maybe it's time... - Yes?

1849
01:09:11,701 --> 01:09:13,141
- to show a quieter, - I see.

1850
01:09:13,401 --> 01:09:16,440
Prettier side of me for once.

1851
01:09:16,441 --> 01:09:17,470
We should do that for you.

1852
01:09:17,471 --> 01:09:18,680
You always looked pretty and cute.

1853
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:20,241
I looked a bit round.

1854
01:09:21,641 --> 01:09:23,180
It's because you loosened up after wrapping up promotions.

1855
01:09:23,181 --> 01:09:25,820
- I went for a more mature look. - I see.

1856
01:09:25,821 --> 01:09:27,281
Why are you talking like that?

1857
01:09:27,951 --> 01:09:29,851
Yu Jin, you really look pretty.

1858
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:32,390
- It's very nice. - There's something I wanted to say.

1859
01:09:32,391 --> 01:09:33,421
What is it?

1860
01:09:33,761 --> 01:09:36,390
Why is she laughing like that?

1861
01:09:36,391 --> 01:09:39,401
When did you ever cover your mouth when laughing?

1862
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:40,861
- What is that? - She's being shy.

1863
01:09:41,061 --> 01:09:42,470
She was doing this.

1864
01:09:42,471 --> 01:09:43,600
- What is that? - Stop it.

1865
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:45,201
- What is this? - Like this.

1866
01:09:45,401 --> 01:09:47,670
- Where did you learn this? - What's wrong with her?

1867
01:09:47,671 --> 01:09:49,047
(Yu Jin also feels awkward about her idol side.)

1868
01:09:49,071 --> 01:09:50,610
- What's happening? - No.

1869
01:09:50,611 --> 01:09:53,440
- I went into a meeting. - And?

1870
01:09:53,441 --> 01:09:55,110
I was talking with the managing director.

1871
01:09:55,111 --> 01:09:57,880
You guys did a live review of Earth Arcade.

1872
01:09:57,881 --> 01:10:00,680
And you said Yu Jin kind of became a troublemaker.

1873
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:02,590
That the staff had such a hard time.

1874
01:10:02,591 --> 01:10:04,221
And he told me seriously,

1875
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:05,920
"When you go back,"

1876
01:10:05,921 --> 01:10:07,660
"ask them sincerely when the cameras are off."

1877
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:10,690
"And if the staff say they really had a hard time,"

1878
01:10:10,691 --> 01:10:12,931
"it's right that you dial it down."

1879
01:10:13,431 --> 01:10:16,230
- That was a serious talk. - I mean...

1880
01:10:16,231 --> 01:10:18,200
Oh, no. That's not true.

1881
01:10:18,201 --> 01:10:21,141
I told him it probably wasn't that bad.

1882
01:10:21,241 --> 01:10:24,041
Then I thought about it at night before falling asleep.

1883
01:10:24,311 --> 01:10:25,340
- "What if that was true?" - "Is it true?"

1884
01:10:25,341 --> 01:10:27,340
- "What if that was true?" - "What if that was true?"

1885
01:10:27,341 --> 01:10:29,480
- No. - That's not true.

1886
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:33,050
We loved you being so lively and comfortable around us.

1887
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:34,550
- We really loved that. - That's right.

1888
01:10:34,551 --> 01:10:36,150
Also Yu Jin, if not here,

1889
01:10:36,151 --> 01:10:37,920
- where else can you live like that? - Right.

1890
01:10:37,921 --> 01:10:40,021
As long as you're here, do as you want to.

1891
01:10:41,091 --> 01:10:43,090
I think she's already doing that.

1892
01:10:43,091 --> 01:10:44,330
It's coming out again.

1893
01:10:44,331 --> 01:10:47,701
- We don't have to tell her. - It's coming out slowly.

1894
01:10:47,931 --> 01:10:49,531
(They are sitting around chatting.)

1895
01:10:49,831 --> 01:10:51,201
- Yes, Yu Jin... - Gosh!

1896
01:10:51,401 --> 01:10:53,301
What is it now?

1897
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:55,471
Franceska has appeared.

1898
01:10:56,171 --> 01:10:57,371
Hello.

1899
01:10:57,671 --> 01:11:00,141
(The return of Franceska)

1900
01:11:00,611 --> 01:11:02,151
(Who dares to summon me?)

1901
01:11:02,611 --> 01:11:03,650
(Deeply moved)

1902
01:11:03,651 --> 01:11:04,980
Is it supposed to be like this?

1903
01:11:04,981 --> 01:11:06,521
Doing something like this?

1904
01:11:06,781 --> 01:11:08,420
It's Rebecca.

1905
01:11:08,421 --> 01:11:11,021
- It's Rebecca. - Rebecca

1906
01:11:11,151 --> 01:11:14,060
My Rebecca

1907
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,391
(Identity crisis)

1908
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:17,111
Young Ji, aren't you feeling hot?

1909
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:18,661
This is the photo zone.

1910
01:11:19,161 --> 01:11:20,261
It's the photo zone.

1911
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:23,171
- I get it. - She wants you to move away.

1912
01:11:23,601 --> 01:11:24,800
She wants you to move out of the way.

1913
01:11:24,801 --> 01:11:26,801
To the left.

1914
01:11:27,171 --> 01:11:28,670
Please don't stick out your tongue.

1915
01:11:28,671 --> 01:11:29,910
- Look. - Please.

1916
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:32,111
Please do what you did at Seoul Jazz Festival.

1917
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:33,740
Just like Seoul Jazz Festival.

1918
01:11:33,741 --> 01:11:35,780
Right, you were a complete princess at the festival.

1919
01:11:35,781 --> 01:11:36,950
- Yes. - You look very pretty.

1920
01:11:36,951 --> 01:11:38,551
- Hello. - She was a Disney princess.

1921
01:11:38,781 --> 01:11:40,381
I'm the detox princess of Clock Kingdom.

1922
01:11:40,451 --> 01:11:41,651
(A classic comedian's comment)

1923
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,121
I am Young Ji Lee.

1924
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,790
(My Rebecca)

1925
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:50,260
(She throws off her shawl.)

1926
01:11:50,261 --> 01:11:52,360
She was feeling hot.

1927
01:11:52,361 --> 01:11:54,330
- Let's take a group photo. - Good idea.

1928
01:11:54,331 --> 01:11:57,201
Our styles don’t match at all.

1929
01:11:57,371 --> 01:11:59,240
Shouldn't we have talked about this beforehand?

1930
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:00,940
- Aren't there four of us? - I'm sweating here.

1931
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,471
Our individuality is showing here.

1932
01:12:02,841 --> 01:12:04,241
(They have different styles, )

1933
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:07,941
(but take a photo together as good friends.)

1934
01:12:09,911 --> 01:12:11,251
What kind of party is this?

1935
01:12:11,711 --> 01:12:13,781
- I don't know. - Everyone is dressed so randomly.

1936
01:12:14,721 --> 01:12:16,320
Is it all right for our styles to clash so badly?

1937
01:12:16,321 --> 01:12:19,020
Right, and the banner behind us is so cheap.

1938
01:12:19,021 --> 01:12:20,590
- Where? - Look at the decoration behind you.

1939
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:21,891
"Jade Emperor Party?"

1940
01:12:22,091 --> 01:12:25,061
I'm sorry. I've heard of biscuit parties and tteokbokki parties.

1941
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:26,660
But what on earth is Jade Emperor Party?

1942
01:12:26,661 --> 01:12:28,430
The Jade Emperor...

1943
01:12:28,431 --> 01:12:30,971
When you were trying to catch Torong and Cheol Yong,

1944
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:32,870
- he contacted us... - Jade Emperor?

1945
01:12:32,871 --> 01:12:34,800
- from behind-the-scenes. - I see.

1946
01:12:34,801 --> 01:12:37,310
I have my own reasons for dressing like this today.

1947
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,940
- What is it? - Are you doing a musical afterward?

1948
01:12:38,941 --> 01:12:40,011
No.

1949
01:12:40,381 --> 01:12:41,680
I'm not appearing in Seoul Jazz Festival again.

1950
01:12:41,681 --> 01:12:43,551
- You're looking to buy land. - No.

1951
01:12:43,711 --> 01:12:44,750
I have a very good reason.

1952
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:45,981
- First, - Yes?

1953
01:12:46,021 --> 01:12:48,220
As for the age range of the viewers who love Earth Arcade,

1954
01:12:48,221 --> 01:12:49,450
there are those in their teens and 20s.

1955
01:12:49,451 --> 01:12:50,850
But there a lot of viewers in their 40s and 50s.

1956
01:12:50,851 --> 01:12:52,460
- That's true. - But those in their 40s and 50s...

1957
01:12:52,461 --> 01:12:53,720
don't watch contents...

1958
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:55,120
- other than our program. - That's right.

1959
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,291
So they think I always go around looking like that.

1960
01:12:57,691 --> 01:12:59,331
When they see me outside...

1961
01:13:00,161 --> 01:13:02,931
(Yang Hee Eun who had her glasses stolen)

1962
01:13:03,331 --> 01:13:05,641
(Looking like she just rolled out of bed)

1963
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:08,141
(Producer Hyun Yong)

1964
01:13:08,471 --> 01:13:09,911
(How's my fashion today?)

1965
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:12,181
(Man from "Black Rubber Shoes")

1966
01:13:12,741 --> 01:13:15,381
(This is Young Ji's full makeup for E-cade.)

1967
01:13:16,651 --> 01:13:18,411
- When they see me outside, - Yes?

1968
01:13:18,781 --> 01:13:20,350
- both elderly men and women... - They are shocked?

1969
01:13:20,351 --> 01:13:22,120
- misunderstand me. - How?

1970
01:13:22,121 --> 01:13:23,490
They say, "She's thin!"

1971
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:25,250
- I see. - "She's pretty!"

1972
01:13:25,251 --> 01:13:26,420
They misunderstand me like so.

1973
01:13:26,421 --> 01:13:28,690
When they recognize me on the streets,

1974
01:13:28,691 --> 01:13:29,791
the older men...

1975
01:13:29,931 --> 01:13:32,300
- They don't say, "You're Eun Ji!" - What do they say?

1976
01:13:32,301 --> 01:13:33,361
- They go... - Yes?

1977
01:13:36,571 --> 01:13:39,070
(Rushing)

1978
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,571
"It's her!"

1979
01:13:40,871 --> 01:13:42,910
Then, I feel awkward.

1980
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:45,210
- It's embarrassing. - I feel embarrassed.

1981
01:13:45,211 --> 01:13:48,010
So, for the many older viewers who'll be watching today,

1982
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:49,580
I wanted throw them into shock.

1983
01:13:49,581 --> 01:13:51,711
So, you wanted to burn this image into their heads?

1984
01:13:52,111 --> 01:13:53,520
Doesn't she look like the Witch of the Waste?

1985
01:13:53,521 --> 01:13:56,220
Mimi, that's exactly the concept of my look today!

1986
01:13:56,221 --> 01:13:57,950
- Witch of the Waste. - From "Spirited Away."

1987
01:13:57,951 --> 01:13:59,120
- "Howl's Moving Castle." - The animation?

1988
01:13:59,121 --> 01:14:00,590
- Wearing that hat. - Yes, the Witch of the Waste.

1989
01:14:00,591 --> 01:14:02,330
- She wears a huge fedora. - It suits you.

1990
01:14:02,331 --> 01:14:04,391
- Yes, thank you. - I'm a disco ball.

1991
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:06,461
- Cheers! - Cheers!

1992
01:14:06,631 --> 01:14:09,130
Excuse me, but why are we doing this under the blazing sun?

1993
01:14:09,131 --> 01:14:11,291
Shouldn't we do this at a place with air conditioning?

1994
01:14:11,331 --> 01:14:12,640
- I'm dying here. - You...

1995
01:14:12,641 --> 01:14:15,071
- Your lips are shiny with sweat. - My look for today...

1996
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:17,310
- is too hot for this weather. - My dress is reflecting light.

1997
01:14:17,311 --> 01:14:18,471
It's getting hot.

1998
01:14:18,711 --> 01:14:20,980
- It really is hot! - It's like a furnace.

1999
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:22,180
It's really hot.

2000
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:23,480
(Here too)

2001
01:14:23,481 --> 01:14:25,981
- Twinkle - Today is your last get-together.

2002
01:14:26,021 --> 01:14:27,750
With your prize money,

2003
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:29,450
- Okay. - you asked us to get...

2004
01:14:29,451 --> 01:14:30,550
- friendship rings, right? - Jade rings.

2005
01:14:30,551 --> 01:14:31,551
- Jade rings? - Let's celebrate.

2006
01:14:31,552 --> 01:14:33,920
We'll be awarding you with friendship rings.

2007
01:14:33,921 --> 01:14:35,691
- Yes. - In order to do that,

2008
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:37,760
the person you're familiar with has come...

2009
01:14:37,761 --> 01:14:39,000
- from the moon. - Cheol Yong?

2010
01:14:39,001 --> 01:14:40,281
- Cheol Yong? - In this weather?

2011
01:14:40,801 --> 01:14:42,431
(Hidden in the bushes, )

2012
01:14:42,631 --> 01:14:44,351
(there is a lamp for summoning Cheol Yong.)

2013
01:14:44,631 --> 01:14:46,070
Oh, it's hot!

2014
01:14:46,071 --> 01:14:48,571
- It's really hot. - Let's go. Cheol Yong.

2015
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:49,770
It's all right.

2016
01:14:49,771 --> 01:14:51,317
- Come on, Cheol Yong. - I'm doing this.

2017
01:14:51,341 --> 01:14:52,380
Let's go.

2018
01:14:52,381 --> 01:14:55,481
- As-salamu alaykum. - As-salamu alaykum.

2019
01:14:55,911 --> 01:14:57,751
(They chant the spell.)

2020
01:14:58,181 --> 01:14:59,680
In this hot weather... Oh dear.

2021
01:14:59,681 --> 01:15:01,150
He must be so hot.

2022
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:03,620
- Oh, dear. - Are they earphones?

2023
01:15:03,621 --> 01:15:04,820
- Why are there five? - Oh, they're rings.

2024
01:15:04,821 --> 01:15:06,290
Why are there five rings?

2025
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:08,090
- Why? - Please take a look at them.

2026
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:10,691
- There are rings. - Could that be for Yeong Seok?

2027
01:15:12,361 --> 01:15:14,100
Wait a minute!

2028
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:15,101
- What's wrong with you? - What?

2029
01:15:15,102 --> 01:15:16,670
Yu Jin, Mimi, Eun Ji, Young Ji,

2030
01:15:16,671 --> 01:15:18,430
- and there's one more. - Who is it for?

2031
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:19,440
(Shocked)

2032
01:15:19,441 --> 01:15:21,100
- Girls, finally! - A new member?

2033
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:23,770
- A new member? - It's a new member? Who?

2034
01:15:23,771 --> 01:15:26,841
- Take off your mask. - There's not enough even for us.

2035
01:15:27,441 --> 01:15:30,050
We can't be caring for other people's lot too.

2036
01:15:30,051 --> 01:15:32,921
I won't be able to handle it if there's one more younger member.

2037
01:15:33,421 --> 01:15:35,381
(E-cade members' first friendship ring.)

2038
01:15:35,851 --> 01:15:39,121
(Pure gold rings were bought with prize money for catching Torong.)

2039
01:15:39,861 --> 01:15:42,360
(Light turns on when you open the box.)

2040
01:15:42,361 --> 01:15:44,467
- Stuff like this lasts. - Is there something inside?

2041
01:15:44,491 --> 01:15:46,030
- What? - Is there a message?

2042
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:47,660
- There's a message. - We did that before.

2043
01:15:47,661 --> 01:15:49,371
- I have "For." - I have "To."

2044
01:15:50,201 --> 01:15:51,201
I have "For."

2045
01:15:52,171 --> 01:15:53,470
Mimi can't read it.

2046
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,540
(Mimi is far-sighted.)

2047
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:55,541
I can't see.

2048
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:57,110
- It's "Ever." - Okay.

2049
01:15:57,111 --> 01:15:59,080
- I have "For." - I have "Ever."

2050
01:15:59,081 --> 01:16:00,980
- "To" for me. - I have "Ge."

2051
01:16:00,981 --> 01:16:02,240
- This is "Ther." - Who is that for?

2052
01:16:02,241 --> 01:16:03,350
Who is this one for?

2053
01:16:03,351 --> 01:16:04,880
We had them custom-made.

2054
01:16:04,881 --> 01:16:06,080
- What happened was... - Yes?

2055
01:16:06,081 --> 01:16:09,021
The total prize money was 1,330 dollars.

2056
01:16:09,121 --> 01:16:11,650
- You won 1,330 dollars times 4. - Yes.

2057
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:13,521
Then there is the money you spent.

2058
01:16:13,621 --> 01:16:15,790
We deducted 1,200 dollars for MacBook.

2059
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:18,860
Each ring cost 820 dollars.

2060
01:16:18,861 --> 01:16:20,000
That's not bad.

2061
01:16:20,001 --> 01:16:21,761
Since we were making it with leftover money,

2062
01:16:21,931 --> 01:16:24,500
- we were left with 840 dollars. - Exactly?

2063
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:26,341
So we thought...

2064
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,300
- we should make another one. - So thorough.

2065
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:29,311
Make another one...

2066
01:16:29,371 --> 01:16:32,171
And the production staff will keep it.

2067
01:16:32,911 --> 01:16:35,110
(Like the rings connecting people in "I'm Sorry, I Love You")

2068
01:16:35,111 --> 01:16:36,180
(For...)

2069
01:16:36,181 --> 01:16:37,181
(ever)
(To...)

2070
01:16:38,181 --> 01:16:39,181
(ge...)
(ther)

2071
01:16:40,381 --> 01:16:43,391
(Earth Arcade, forever together)

2072
01:16:43,991 --> 01:16:46,190
(So with that in mind, we prepared 5 of them.)

2073
01:16:46,191 --> 01:16:49,090
Then, how about we give them out with a survival?

2074
01:16:49,091 --> 01:16:50,091
Give us an example.

2075
01:16:50,092 --> 01:16:51,660
We become the ones proposing the game.

2076
01:16:51,661 --> 01:16:53,800
You could suggest games, or they could come out and dance 1 by 1.

2077
01:16:53,801 --> 01:16:54,831
That's all right.

2078
01:16:54,931 --> 01:16:56,570
Let's see you dance.

2079
01:16:56,571 --> 01:16:58,270
- I know what it is. - Let's do it.

2080
01:16:58,271 --> 01:16:59,470
- The Random Play Dance. - Yes.

2081
01:16:59,471 --> 01:17:01,111
- You guys do that. - Come out and dance.

2082
01:17:02,571 --> 01:17:03,610
Are you ready?

2083
01:17:03,611 --> 01:17:05,017
(This is their first matching E-cade friendship ring.)

2084
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:06,980
- This is better. - This will last for a long time.

2085
01:17:06,981 --> 01:17:08,940
- It goes naturally with others. - That's true.

2086
01:17:08,941 --> 01:17:11,281
There was just one spot left, and it's filled now.

2087
01:17:12,721 --> 01:17:13,721
Do they fit you properly?

2088
01:17:13,722 --> 01:17:14,880
- They fit perfectly. - They do.

2089
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:17,291
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

2090
01:17:20,421 --> 01:17:22,220
(It's time to grab a cool drink.)

2091
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:25,801
On a hot day like this, I need a little sugar boost.

2092
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:28,301
But I'm watching my diet, so I don’t want to gain weight.

2093
01:17:28,501 --> 01:17:29,931
What should I do?

2094
01:17:30,371 --> 01:17:32,031
(Taking a cool sip)

2095
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:36,041
It tastes exactly the same.

2096
01:17:36,741 --> 01:17:38,211
Oh, delicious.

2097
01:17:39,011 --> 01:17:40,340
The taste is exactly the same.

2098
01:17:40,341 --> 01:17:42,381
- It is. - It's exactly the same.

2099
01:17:46,151 --> 01:17:48,480
(They have quenched their thirst.)

2100
01:17:48,481 --> 01:17:50,920
(The main event of the rooftop party is about to begin.)

2101
01:17:50,921 --> 01:17:52,150
- Thank you so much. - Let's go inside...

2102
01:17:52,151 --> 01:17:53,190
- and talk some more. - Okay.

2103
01:17:53,191 --> 01:17:54,560
- Now... - It's too hot here.

2104
01:17:54,561 --> 01:17:56,460
I didn't know there was a place like this here.

2105
01:17:56,461 --> 01:17:57,691
Hey, Yu Jin.

2106
01:17:58,331 --> 01:18:00,730
- Oh, yes! - What is this for?

2107
01:18:00,731 --> 01:18:02,230
- What is this? - What do we do with this?

2108
01:18:02,231 --> 01:18:04,271
- Do we have to crawl on the floor? - What is this?

2109
01:18:05,401 --> 01:18:06,641
Are we going to work out?

2110
01:18:09,141 --> 01:18:10,470
- It's so cool in here. - It's yutnori!

2111
01:18:10,471 --> 01:18:12,151
- It's yutnori. - We mustn't play yutnori.

2112
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:15,261
- Doesn't it have yutnori vibes? - I have nightmares about the game.

2113
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:16,651
It has yutnori vibes.

2114
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:22,791
(Why have they hidden it so thoroughly?)

2115
01:18:22,991 --> 01:18:25,350
- From there... - Before we play the game...

2116
01:18:25,351 --> 01:18:26,390
- Yes? - I think it's yutnori.

2117
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:29,731
Mimi, will you take off this cover?

2118
01:18:30,091 --> 01:18:31,731
- What is this? - What is it?

2119
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:33,600
- Starting with this? - Carefully.

2120
01:18:33,601 --> 01:18:34,630
- What is it? - Carefully.

2121
01:18:34,631 --> 01:18:35,730
Mimi, hold the edges.

2122
01:18:35,731 --> 01:18:36,931
- Is it a prize? - Pull it up.

2123
01:18:37,231 --> 01:18:38,671
In 1, 2, 3.

2124
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:42,371
- Gosh! - Gosh! Girls!

2125
01:18:43,404 --> 01:18:44,974
In 1, 2, 3.

2126
01:18:45,912 --> 01:18:48,512
- Gosh! - Gosh! Girls!

2127
01:18:49,512 --> 01:18:52,981
(Souvenirs from Portugal)

2128
01:18:52,982 --> 01:18:55,221
- Things we couldn't buy. - Look at these!

2129
01:18:55,222 --> 01:18:56,902
- What are those? - Stuff we couldn't buy.

2130
01:18:56,952 --> 01:18:58,422
Aren't they things we couldn't buy?

2131
01:18:59,305 --> 01:19:02,004
(Portuguese souvenirs they couldn't buy...)

2132
01:19:02,005 --> 01:19:04,774
(because they had to end the shoot.)

2133
01:19:04,775 --> 01:19:06,644

(Sardine soap, Piri-piri sauce)

2141

(A whole collection of souvenirs from Portugal)

2142
01:19:22,085 --> 01:19:23,824
- I wanted to buy that. - Is that sardine soap?

2143
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,824
- Where is it? - It's sardine soap.

2144
01:19:25,825 --> 01:19:27,771
- There's piri-piri sauce too. - Yes, piri-piri sauce.

2145
01:19:27,795 --> 01:19:30,965
It's that toothpaste I was talking about!

2146
01:19:31,235 --> 01:19:32,534
- What is that? - Toothpaste!

2147
01:19:32,535 --> 01:19:34,804
(It's the toothpaste Eun Ji saw in a blog post.)

2148
01:19:34,805 --> 01:19:37,674
Mimi, Yu Jin. It's the egg tart cup we wanted to get.

2149
01:19:37,675 --> 01:19:39,004
That's right.

2150
01:19:39,005 --> 01:19:40,774
- What is it? - It's the egg tart cup.

2151
01:19:40,775 --> 01:19:42,445
- It's so cute. - It's the egg tart cup.

2152
01:19:42,975 --> 01:19:45,844
(A cup shaped like an egg tart)

2153
01:19:45,845 --> 01:19:48,184
- Mimi, you couldn't buy the tile. - I couldn't.

2154
01:19:48,185 --> 01:19:49,215
She couldn't buy them.

2155

- Our years are all written here. - You're right.

2158
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:59,624
- It's 1992, 2003, and 2002. - Right.

2159
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:01,785
(Cans with the birth years of E-cade members on them.)

2160
01:20:02,325 --> 01:20:03,465
So sweet!

2161
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:05,864
But what is Ronaldo doing here?

2162
01:20:05,865 --> 01:20:07,734
- I like stuff like this. - Because it's a souvenir.

2163
01:20:07,735 --> 01:20:09,065
- A souvenir? - I like it.

2164
01:20:09,775 --> 01:20:11,905
- While doing the camera detox, - Yes?

2165
01:20:12,005 --> 01:20:14,175
- we suddenly had to stop filming. - Yes.

2166
01:20:14,675 --> 01:20:16,174
Originally, we planned to put up souvenirs as prizes...

2167
01:20:16,175 --> 01:20:17,514
- and play games. - Right.

2168
01:20:17,515 --> 01:20:20,544
So we brought the souvenirs we didn't get to use back to Korea.

2169
01:20:20,545 --> 01:20:22,314
That's amazing. That must have been hard work.

2170
01:20:22,315 --> 01:20:23,954
- So many years have passed. - Amazing.

2171
01:20:23,955 --> 01:20:25,114
"So many years?"

2172
01:20:25,115 --> 01:20:26,824
- "Many years?" - It just feels like that.

2173
01:20:26,825 --> 01:20:28,784
- We'll play a simple game. - Okay.

2174
01:20:28,785 --> 01:20:29,924
It’s a 2-on-2 team match.

2175
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:30,925
- Okay. - Great

2176
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:33,495
- The winner of the team match... - Yes?

2177
01:20:33,965 --> 01:20:37,435
Gets to take as much as they want from what is here.

2178
01:20:37,865 --> 01:20:39,534
- Without any limitation? - Right.

2179
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:41,764
You can take as much as you want.

2180
01:20:41,765 --> 01:20:43,834
- Okay. - Then there'll be scraps left.

2181
01:20:43,835 --> 01:20:46,504
- Yes. - The remaining two will take...

2182
01:20:46,505 --> 01:20:48,265
- whatever is left. - And split them evenly?

2183
01:20:48,445 --> 01:20:52,074
(It's a winner-takes-all system.)

2184
01:20:52,075 --> 01:20:53,614
(Team selection)

2185
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:56,655
Palm face up or down.

2186
01:21:00,885 --> 01:21:01,885
Mimi.

2187
01:21:02,455 --> 01:21:05,154
- We're together. - We haven't seen this combination.

2188
01:21:05,155 --> 01:21:06,394
You haven't seen this combination.

2189
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:07,864
This is a very new combination.

2190
01:21:07,865 --> 01:21:10,295
We had this combination in Bali.

2191
01:21:10,635 --> 01:21:12,704
- That's right. - It's been such a long time.

2192
01:21:12,705 --> 01:21:13,834
- It's been a long time. - And...

2193
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:15,134
- Yes. - Please make your team names.

2194
01:21:15,135 --> 01:21:17,475
We'll go with Thank You for Recognizing Us.

2195
01:21:17,575 --> 01:21:19,604
- TYRU? - TYRU.

2196
01:21:19,605 --> 01:21:21,074
Shall we go with the full name, Thank You for Recognizing Us?

2197
01:21:21,075 --> 01:21:23,014
- Yes. - They are so fast.

2198
01:21:23,015 --> 01:21:24,015
Those two are too fast.

2199
01:21:24,016 --> 01:21:25,314
Our team name is... In 1, 2, 3.

2200
01:21:25,315 --> 01:21:27,835
- Thank You for Recognizing Us. - Thank You for Recognizing Us.

2201
01:21:28,785 --> 01:21:30,284
We'll take the polite route since we're from Korea.

2202
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:32,615
- Yu Jin, do you have a new song? - No.

2203
01:21:33,385 --> 01:21:35,684
- Your styles are a bit similar too. - What?

2204
01:21:35,685 --> 01:21:36,854
Your styles go well together.

2205
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:38,935
We're like the costume team for "Comedy Big League."

2206
01:21:39,565 --> 01:21:40,864
(This is not the dressing room of "Comedy Big League.")

2207
01:21:40,865 --> 01:21:42,794
- Eun Ji. - Like the traveling troupe.

2208
01:21:42,795 --> 01:21:44,034
Yes, it's like the comedian's room.

2209
01:21:44,035 --> 01:21:45,935
- Comedian's room. - You are colleagues.

2210
01:21:46,805 --> 01:21:47,805
What do we call ourselves?

2211
01:21:47,806 --> 01:21:48,834
("M Countdown" waiting room hasn't found a team name yet.)

2212
01:21:48,835 --> 01:21:51,574
Please, recommend us a name.

2213
01:21:51,575 --> 01:21:52,844
- A name? - Please.

2214
01:21:52,845 --> 01:21:55,004
- She's asking to recommend a name. - We don't have any ideas.

2215
01:21:55,005 --> 01:21:56,974
They can't use comedian's room.

2216
01:21:56,975 --> 01:21:58,214
- So they have no ideas. - We have nothing.

2217
01:21:58,215 --> 01:22:00,444
I'm the older one, but I'm not pulling my weight.

2218
01:22:00,445 --> 01:22:01,445
Oh, no.

2219
01:22:02,415 --> 01:22:04,254
- Give us ideas for a name. - Give us a name.

2220
01:22:04,255 --> 01:22:06,661
Find something you have in common. What’s your height difference?

2221
01:22:06,685 --> 01:22:08,354
- How tall are you? - A difference of 20cm?

2222
01:22:08,355 --> 01:22:09,795
In centimeters?

2223
01:22:10,955 --> 01:22:12,794
(She's a scary boxing girl.)

2224
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:14,024
How about 20cm for your team name?

2225
01:22:14,025 --> 01:22:16,334
- Oh, 20cm? - Isn't that a good name?

2226
01:22:16,335 --> 01:22:17,434
- Are you okay with that? - It's not 10cm, but 20cm.

2227
01:22:17,435 --> 01:22:18,864
- You're okay with it? - I like it.

2228
01:22:18,865 --> 01:22:20,764
- It's 20cm. - It's not 10cm, but 20cm.

2229
01:22:20,765 --> 01:22:22,204
Our team is... In 1, 2, 3.

2230
01:22:22,205 --> 01:22:23,835
- We are 20cm. - We are 20cm.

2231
01:22:25,705 --> 01:22:26,975
That's a cute name.

2232
01:22:27,845 --> 01:22:29,444
Aren't you asking our name again?

2233
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,274
- Okay. - We'll go again.

2234
01:22:31,275 --> 01:22:33,214
- They're picking another name. - I'm getting jealous.

2235
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:34,315
Again?

2236
01:22:34,415 --> 01:22:36,485
In 1, 2, 3. We are...

2237
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:37,914
- Team Comedy. - Team Comedy.

2238
01:22:37,915 --> 01:22:38,915
(Team Comedy)

2239
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:40,824
- We changed our name. - You changed it to Team Comedy?

2240
01:22:40,825 --> 01:22:42,185
(Game reveal)

2241
01:22:43,155 --> 01:22:44,694
- Can we open it? - Please lift the cloth.

2242
01:22:44,695 --> 01:22:46,125
- I'll help you. - What is this?

2243
01:22:46,225 --> 01:22:48,124
- It seems like yutnori. - It's a bit...

2244
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:49,935
- In 1, 2, 3. - It's well covered.

2245
01:22:50,495 --> 01:22:52,095
- It's curling. - It's curling.

2246
01:22:52,765 --> 01:22:54,434
(Curling)

2247
01:22:54,435 --> 01:22:56,174
- It's curling. - It's curling.

2248
01:22:56,175 --> 01:22:58,005
She has to try curling dressed like that?

2249
01:22:59,135 --> 01:23:00,344
(She's wearing an outfit 20,020,910km away from curling.)

2250
01:23:00,345 --> 01:23:01,345
I know.

2251
01:23:01,346 --> 01:23:02,874
You have to try curling dressed like that.

2252
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:03,974
(However...)

2253
01:23:03,975 --> 01:23:05,314
- Curling. - Curling.

2254
01:23:05,315 --> 01:23:06,785
This is not your ordinary curling.

2255
01:23:07,045 --> 01:23:08,544
I hope it's not Hunminjeongeum curling.

2256
01:23:08,545 --> 01:23:09,705
- I hope not. - It's similar.

2257
01:23:10,255 --> 01:23:11,415
- It is? - It's similar?

2258
01:23:11,515 --> 01:23:12,924
(You Are)

2259
01:23:12,925 --> 01:23:14,784
(An Open Book)

2260
01:23:14,785 --> 01:23:16,454
We did that in Lisbon.

2261
01:23:16,455 --> 01:23:18,124
It's You Are an Open Book Curling.

2262
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:21,094
(You Are an Open Book, Curling)

2263
01:23:21,095 --> 01:23:22,375
Let's take Yu Jin as an example.

2264
01:23:22,725 --> 01:23:26,504
You think Yu Jin will say this word while playing the game.

2265
01:23:26,505 --> 01:23:29,335
Or she will 100 percent act like this.

2266
01:23:29,775 --> 01:23:32,205
(Players try to predict the other team’s habits.)

2267
01:23:32,535 --> 01:23:34,874
For example, this team writes down one each.

2268
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:35,875
(The opposing team writes it down.)

2269
01:23:35,876 --> 01:23:37,944
- Just one each. - Banned words and banned actions.

2270
01:23:37,945 --> 01:23:39,314
One banned word and one banned action.

2271
01:23:39,315 --> 01:23:40,315
That's right.

2272
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:44,455
(Banned word, Banned action)

2273
01:23:44,915 --> 01:23:48,525
If you say the banned word or do the action, we take out a stone.

2274
01:23:50,095 --> 01:23:52,525
(If you say a banned word or do a banned action, )

2275
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:57,395
(the other team removes any stone they want.)

2276
01:23:57,665 --> 01:23:59,804
If you have scores as well,

2277
01:23:59,805 --> 01:24:01,535
you will lose all of them.

2278
01:24:02,435 --> 01:24:03,435
- Gosh. - So...

2279
01:24:03,436 --> 01:24:05,904
(A 15-second preview)

2280
01:24:05,905 --> 01:24:07,974
(Doing a banned action)

2281
01:24:07,975 --> 01:24:09,045
- Team 20cm! - Look!

2282
01:24:09,505 --> 01:24:10,544
Fail!

2283
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:11,974
(A 15-second preview)

2284
01:24:11,975 --> 01:24:13,744
Mimi!

2285
01:24:13,745 --> 01:24:15,784
(A 15-second preview)

2286
01:24:15,785 --> 01:24:16,814
Mimi!

2287
01:24:16,815 --> 01:24:19,354
(A 15-second preview)

2288
01:24:19,355 --> 01:24:20,455
They have zero points now?

2289
01:24:20,725 --> 01:24:23,295
- Get 7 points 1st, and you win. - Yes, 7 points.

2290
01:24:23,855 --> 01:24:25,554
So no one is planning on going home today?

2291
01:24:25,555 --> 01:24:26,594
(Get 7 points)

2292
01:24:26,595 --> 01:24:27,994
I just remembered what happened before.

2293
01:24:27,995 --> 01:24:29,465
Don't you remember the yutnori?

2294
01:24:29,835 --> 01:24:32,634
- So we're going to... - Three hours!

2295
01:24:32,635 --> 01:24:34,941
(They start deciding each other's banned words and actions.)

2296
01:24:34,965 --> 01:24:36,134
- Please pass it on to them. - Thank you.

2297
01:24:36,135 --> 01:24:38,305
Give the paper and pen to the other team.

2298
01:24:38,475 --> 01:24:40,405
We'll give you five minutes to decide.

2299
01:24:40,605 --> 01:24:41,874
(The two teams go their separate ways.)

2300
01:24:41,875 --> 01:24:43,275
Someone's coming.

2301
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:46,584
Young Ji shouts and exclaims a lot.

2302
01:24:46,585 --> 01:24:48,145
- Like this. - That's good.

2303
01:24:48,445 --> 01:24:49,585
- That's a good one. - Or...

2304
01:24:50,155 --> 01:24:51,684
How about "sister?"

2305
01:24:51,685 --> 01:24:53,125
(How about sister?)

2306
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,955
- She does use that word a lot. - Right?

2307
01:24:55,155 --> 01:24:56,625
Young Ji even calls me sister.

2308
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:00,925
(Young Ji's banned word is "sister.")

2309
01:25:01,195 --> 01:25:03,565
- What about Eun Ji? - What should we ban for Eun Ji?

2310
01:25:04,935 --> 01:25:07,165
- "Guys?" - "Guys," or "Give me a second."

2311
01:25:08,135 --> 01:25:10,304
I think "Give me a second" is good.

2312
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:11,904
There's that, and there's, "Wait."

2313
01:25:11,905 --> 01:25:12,975
"Wait?"

2314
01:25:13,145 --> 01:25:15,245
- She says that a lot. - Let's go with that.

2315
01:25:15,345 --> 01:25:18,045
(Eun Ji's banned word is "wait.")

2316
01:25:19,685 --> 01:25:22,021
- Eun Ji puts her hands together. - Write it so that we can read it.

2317
01:25:22,045 --> 01:25:23,915
- She does this often. - She really does.

2318
01:25:24,255 --> 01:25:27,924
(She puts her hands together during games.)

2319
01:25:27,925 --> 01:25:30,624
(She puts her hands together while preparing for games.)

2320
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,624
(She puts her hands together when she's nervous.)

2321
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:35,224
(It's the last move for...)

2322
01:25:35,225 --> 01:25:36,694
(the "Thank You for Recognizing Us" pose.)

2323
01:25:36,695 --> 01:25:38,695
- Putting her hands together. - Hands together.

2324
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,635
Young Ji sticks her tongue out often.

2325
01:25:44,035 --> 01:25:46,234
(We've seen that a thousand times.)

2326
01:25:46,235 --> 01:25:51,274
(She sticks her tongue out when she's dancing.)

2327
01:25:51,275 --> 01:25:54,184
(She sticks her tongue out when listening to missions.)

2328
01:25:54,185 --> 01:25:57,414
(She sticks her tongue out when she fails a mission.)

2329
01:25:57,415 --> 01:26:00,355
(She stuck her tongue out 10 minutes ago.)

2330
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,855
She tends to do that when she's cornered.

2331
01:26:03,555 --> 01:26:05,095
That's good. Write that down.

2332
01:26:05,325 --> 01:26:06,564
(Young Ji's banned action is...)

2333
01:26:06,565 --> 01:26:07,594
Sticking her tongue out.

2334
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:09,294
(sticking her tongue out.)

2335
01:26:09,295 --> 01:26:11,064
(Eun Ji can't say "Wait" or put her hands together.)

2336
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:12,834
(Young Ji can't say "Sister" or stick her tongue out.)

2337
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:15,234
Let's think. What are some actions we can ban?

2338
01:26:15,235 --> 01:26:17,005
- Actions? - Yu Jin does this a lot.

2339
01:26:18,835 --> 01:26:19,905
She does this.

2340
01:26:20,805 --> 01:26:23,314
(In Season 1)

2341
01:26:23,315 --> 01:26:25,674
(In Season 2)

2342
01:26:25,675 --> 01:26:29,615
(In Season 3)

2343
01:26:30,455 --> 01:26:31,515
And she does this too.

2344
01:26:32,455 --> 01:26:33,485
Right?

2345
01:26:34,325 --> 01:26:36,254
(She does it when she can't have Korean food.)

2346
01:26:36,255 --> 01:26:40,164
(She does it when she loses rock-paper-scissors.)

2347
01:26:40,165 --> 01:26:43,534
(She did it a minute ago.)

2348
01:26:43,535 --> 01:26:49,734
(Yu Jin's two habits are putting her hands in her hair...)

2349
01:26:49,735 --> 01:26:52,575
(and biting her hands.)

2350
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:55,144
- If you think about those two, - Yes?

2351
01:26:55,145 --> 01:26:56,905
- it'll get frustrating for Yu Jin. - Right.

2352
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:58,485
So she'll go, "Sister," and do this.

2353
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:00,545
I think you're right.

2354
01:27:01,045 --> 01:27:04,014
Yu Jin says "Sister" when she's frustrated...

2355
01:27:04,015 --> 01:27:07,524
and says it even when she's happy, like this.

2356
01:27:07,525 --> 01:27:10,024
So I think we should go with "Sister" for Yu Jin.

2357
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:11,494
- Definitely. - "Sister."

2358
01:27:11,495 --> 01:27:12,595
And with Mimi...

2359
01:27:13,365 --> 01:27:15,125
- I have one for Mimi. - What is it?

2360
01:27:15,425 --> 01:27:16,535
"I'm sorry."

2361
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:19,734
- Apologizing. - Eun Ji, but how about...

2362
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:20,864
- something shorter... - Did you do Mimi just now?

2363
01:27:20,865 --> 01:27:23,235
I say this because Mimi apologizes constantly.

2364
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:25,674
- It's "Sister" for Yu Jin. - Right, that's settled.

2365
01:27:25,675 --> 01:27:27,074
Let's settle on an action too.

2366
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,435
Yu Jin's actions... I think what you did with your hands...

2367
01:27:29,505 --> 01:27:31,344
(Highly confidential)

2368
01:27:31,345 --> 01:27:32,444
She messes with her hair.

2369
01:27:32,445 --> 01:27:34,291
But since Yu Jin's had hair and makeup done today,

2370
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:35,955
I don't think she'll do that to her hair.

2371
01:27:35,985 --> 01:27:37,105
- I have a feeling. - Right!

2372
01:27:37,455 --> 01:27:39,015
Young Ji, before you arrived today,

2373
01:27:39,185 --> 01:27:40,854
do you know how Yu Jin laughed?

2374
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:42,755
- How? - She covered her mouth and laughed.

2375
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:44,624
- I wanted to say something. - What is it?

2376
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:46,024
(Her idol self 10 minutes ago)

2377
01:27:46,025 --> 01:27:47,094
Why are you laughing like that?

2378
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,724
- What? - Since when did you...

2379
01:27:48,725 --> 01:27:50,234
- start covering your mouth? - She's so...

2380
01:27:50,235 --> 01:27:51,394
- What's going on? - She's acting shy.

2381
01:27:51,395 --> 01:27:52,735
I've never seen you do that.

2382
01:27:53,265 --> 01:27:54,534
How about covering her mouth and laughing?

2383
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:55,834
I don't think she'll do that.

2384
01:27:55,835 --> 01:27:58,274
- No, she kept doing that today. - Should I trust you?

2385
01:27:58,275 --> 01:27:59,805
- Can I? - Yes, trust me.

2386
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:02,295
- Covering her mouth... - Covering her mouth and laughing.

2387
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:03,515
For Mimi...

2388
01:28:04,745 --> 01:28:06,814
- I think "Sorry" is the way to go. - You think so?

2389
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:07,984
Only write "Sorry" down.

2390
01:28:07,985 --> 01:28:09,684
- "Sorry." - Right.

2391
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:11,645
I think the staff will be too busy catching them!

2392
01:28:11,785 --> 01:28:13,461
- About Mimi's banned word... - They really will be!

2393
01:28:13,485 --> 01:28:16,055
That was fast. I guess you didn't put much thought into it!

2394
01:28:16,555 --> 01:28:18,255
We didn't need to!

2395
01:28:18,925 --> 01:28:21,095
You're in the palm of our hands!

2396
01:28:22,025 --> 01:28:23,735
- Wait! - What's taking you so long?

2397
01:28:24,235 --> 01:28:26,064
- Eun Ji. - Stop bothering us!

2398
01:28:26,065 --> 01:28:27,805
- Hurry up, you two! - I got it.

2399
01:28:28,605 --> 01:28:29,605
What is it?

2400
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:31,675
Mimi touches her accessories a lot.

2401
01:28:32,305 --> 01:28:33,345
- Right! - Let's do that!

2402
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:35,404
- That's the one. - Touching her bracelets.

2403
01:28:35,405 --> 01:28:36,814
- Her bracelets. - Eun Ji...

2404
01:28:36,815 --> 01:28:39,144
(In Korea)

2405
01:28:39,145 --> 01:28:42,114
(In Abu Dhabi)

2406
01:28:42,115 --> 01:28:44,814
(In Lisbon)

2407
01:28:44,815 --> 01:28:47,484
(In Albufeira)

2408
01:28:47,485 --> 01:28:50,125
Touching her bracelets.

2409
01:28:50,555 --> 01:28:52,325
- She does it all the time. - I know.

2410
01:28:52,825 --> 01:28:53,864
Honestly,

2411
01:28:53,865 --> 01:28:55,695
she does it even during meals.

2412
01:28:56,225 --> 01:28:58,334
Great. Eun Ji, we've won.

2413
01:28:58,335 --> 01:28:59,494
(Mimi can't say "Sorry" or touch her bracelets.)

2414
01:28:59,495 --> 01:29:00,734
(Yu Jin can't say "Sister" or cover her mouth and laugh.)

2415
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:01,964
(Putting hands together, "Wait," Sticking tongue out, "Sister")

2416
01:29:01,965 --> 01:29:03,411
(Touching bracelets, "Sorry," Covering mouth, "Sister")

2417
01:29:03,435 --> 01:29:04,504
Shall we get started?

2418
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:05,505
- Yes. - I think I did...

2419
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:06,645
- Yes! - Okay.

2420
01:29:07,305 --> 01:29:08,944
It won't be something like thrusting my hips, right?

2421
01:29:08,945 --> 01:29:11,145
Why, do you plan to do that a lot?

2422
01:29:11,975 --> 01:29:13,284
Fail!

2423
01:29:13,285 --> 01:29:15,845
(Keeping her habits in check)

2424
01:29:16,045 --> 01:29:17,414
- You can do whatever you want now. - I don't think...

2425
01:29:17,415 --> 01:29:18,784
- it's thrusting your hips. - Right?

2426
01:29:18,785 --> 01:29:19,884
But the staff...

2427
01:29:19,885 --> 01:29:21,524
- will be checking anyway, right? - Of course.

2428
01:29:21,525 --> 01:29:23,154
- Whenever we hear or see you, - You'll call us out right away?

2429
01:29:23,155 --> 01:29:24,655
- "Fail!" - Fail!

2430
01:29:24,825 --> 01:29:27,225
We'll mark each of you to see what you say and do.

2431
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:28,694
And as soon as we see something,

2432
01:29:28,695 --> 01:29:30,094
- we'll say, "Fail." - We should act differently.

2433
01:29:30,095 --> 01:29:32,664
This only affects you when the stone is on the sheet.

2434
01:29:32,665 --> 01:29:34,405
- Okay. - So a stone has to be there.

2435
01:29:34,465 --> 01:29:35,564
Who should go first? Should we do rock-paper-scissors?

2436
01:29:35,565 --> 01:29:36,634
- Sure. - Rock...

2437
01:29:36,635 --> 01:29:37,674
- Pick one person. - Rock-paper-scissors?

2438
01:29:37,675 --> 01:29:38,675
- Fine, let's go. - Okay.

2439
01:29:38,676 --> 01:29:40,775
- Rock... - She lost her touch these days.

2440
01:29:41,045 --> 01:29:43,244
I think you confused Yu Jin with yourself.

2441
01:29:43,245 --> 01:29:44,575
- Really? - Let's go!

2442
01:29:44,675 --> 01:29:45,675
Five, six, seven, eight.

2443
01:29:45,676 --> 01:29:46,996
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Who won?

2444
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:48,484
- What? - We won!

2445
01:29:48,485 --> 01:29:49,584
- How could this happen? - It's okay.

2446
01:29:49,585 --> 01:29:50,984
- We can go 1st. - Team Comedy can go 1st.

2447
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:52,314
- Okay. - Was it Team Comedy?

2448
01:29:52,315 --> 01:29:54,125
We can see ourselves in the mirror.

2449
01:29:54,525 --> 01:29:55,755
We look ridiculous.

2450
01:29:56,355 --> 01:29:57,795
We're going to do curling like this.

2451
01:29:58,055 --> 01:30:00,195
Don't we look like a troupe?

2452
01:30:00,525 --> 01:30:02,625
One that stopped by a gas station for corn dogs.

2453
01:30:05,065 --> 01:30:06,705
Let's just relax and try it.

2454
01:30:06,905 --> 01:30:08,035
Eun Ji will go first.

2455
01:30:08,605 --> 01:30:09,834
I can just slide it through, right?

2456
01:30:09,835 --> 01:30:11,135
- Right. - We're starting.

2457
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:13,004
You got this!

2458
01:30:13,005 --> 01:30:14,675
Lee Eun Ji!

2459
01:30:15,275 --> 01:30:16,275
Eun Ji!

2460
01:30:17,175 --> 01:30:18,345
Was that a whistle?

2461
01:30:18,975 --> 01:30:20,515
Eun Ji, your bottoms are so shiny.

2462
01:30:21,485 --> 01:30:22,485
Okay.

2463
01:30:22,486 --> 01:30:23,714
(It was too short.)

2464
01:30:23,715 --> 01:30:24,814
- Sorry. - It's fine.

2465
01:30:24,815 --> 01:30:27,155
Team Comedy, you'll be watched starting now.

2466
01:30:27,825 --> 01:30:29,025
- I'm nervous. - Are you okay?

2467
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:31,594
- Did you put your arm around me? - I did.

2468
01:30:31,595 --> 01:30:32,725
I'll go!

2469
01:30:33,525 --> 01:30:34,865
Don't let your guard down.

2470
01:30:37,335 --> 01:30:39,165
- Goodness. - We can't even get started.

2471
01:30:39,835 --> 01:30:41,135
It feels different.

2472
01:30:41,665 --> 01:30:43,574
- I'll show you. - Or you could hit my stone...

2473
01:30:43,575 --> 01:30:45,111
- and push it farther. - Right, I'll show you.

2474
01:30:45,135 --> 01:30:46,875
(It's Young Ji's turn.)

2475
01:30:49,845 --> 01:30:51,514
- It's still short. - No, we're getting there.

2476
01:30:51,515 --> 01:30:53,114
- It's not bad. - It's okay.

2477
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:54,144
- It's fine. - That's blocking.

2478
01:30:54,145 --> 01:30:55,714
Yu Jin, go!

2479
01:30:55,715 --> 01:30:57,054
- Go! - You shouldn't dance!

2480
01:30:57,055 --> 01:30:58,415
- Why not? - Whatever.

2481
01:30:58,985 --> 01:31:00,955
Mimi and Yu Jin,

2482
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:02,655
fail!

2483
01:31:03,185 --> 01:31:04,994
(Touching her bracelets)

2484
01:31:04,995 --> 01:31:06,524
We'll take a stone away from your team.

2485
01:31:06,525 --> 01:31:08,065
- What? - Mimi, what did you do?

2486
01:31:08,525 --> 01:31:09,594
Fail!

2487
01:31:09,595 --> 01:31:13,705
(Team Comedy noticed it right away.)

2488
01:31:13,905 --> 01:31:15,634
- The other team can take it out. - I don't know...

2489
01:31:15,635 --> 01:31:17,374
Eun Ji and Young Ji, go ahead.

2490
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:19,295
- What are you doing to our stone? - You're out!

2491
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:21,205
(Kicking)

2492
01:31:21,845 --> 01:31:23,744
- That's just cruel. - What was it?

2493
01:31:23,745 --> 01:31:25,514
(They don't even know who it was.)

2494
01:31:25,515 --> 01:31:27,045
So do we go again?

2495
01:31:27,585 --> 01:31:29,044
Do we go again, or...

2496
01:31:29,045 --> 01:31:30,754
What happens if there's no stone on the sheet?

2497
01:31:30,755 --> 01:31:32,384
- You can go again with another one. - Okay.

2498
01:31:32,385 --> 01:31:33,854
Gosh, I was just about to twerk,

2499
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:35,461
- and I stopped myself. - Right. Don't do it.

2500
01:31:35,485 --> 01:31:37,285
- Do the opposite of what you'd do. - Got it.

2501
01:31:37,355 --> 01:31:39,495
(It's Yu Jin's turn.)

2502
01:31:42,565 --> 01:31:43,934
It doesn't go as far as we'd hoped.

2503
01:31:43,935 --> 01:31:46,094
We have to push it harder than expected.

2504
01:31:46,095 --> 01:31:47,815
- We should really go for it. - Lee Eun Ji.

2505
01:31:53,575 --> 01:31:55,845
(Sticking her tongue out)

2506
01:31:56,675 --> 01:31:57,745
Fail.

2507
01:31:58,675 --> 01:32:00,644
- Who was it? - It was Eun Ji and Young Ji's team,

2508
01:32:00,645 --> 01:32:02,414
- Team Comedy, fail. - I got it.

2509
01:32:02,415 --> 01:32:03,455
I got it now.

2510
01:32:03,655 --> 01:32:07,685
(We failed just now?)

2511
01:32:07,925 --> 01:32:09,225
I don't think I can cough.

2512
01:32:09,585 --> 01:32:12,555
I doubt they picked something related to health.

2513
01:32:12,955 --> 01:32:15,041
- We're not that mean. - I'm sure they can allow that.

2514
01:32:15,065 --> 01:32:16,294
You should be able to cough.

2515
01:32:16,295 --> 01:32:17,634
- Let's take that one out. - Yes.

2516
01:32:17,635 --> 01:32:19,916
- Did you throw one, Eun Ji? - We're taking this one out.

2517
01:32:20,435 --> 01:32:21,534
Check it out!

2518
01:32:21,535 --> 01:32:23,535
(Team Comedy's stone is taken out.)

2519
01:32:23,735 --> 01:32:25,874
- Yu Jin, you went last, right? - Didn't you spread your legs?

2520
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:26,974
- Is that stone out? - Yes, we took it out.

2521
01:32:26,975 --> 01:32:30,815
(Her posture right before she got called out)

2522
01:32:31,215 --> 01:32:32,415
Should I try that again?

2523
01:32:33,615 --> 01:32:34,714
I'll try it.

2524
01:32:34,715 --> 01:32:37,054
(Spreading wide)

2525
01:32:37,055 --> 01:32:38,154
(Coughing)

2526
01:32:38,155 --> 01:32:39,155
(Coughing again)

2527
01:32:39,156 --> 01:32:40,184
Eun Ji, this isn't it.

2528
01:32:40,185 --> 01:32:41,325
But not that one.

2529
01:32:41,925 --> 01:32:44,394
(Spreading her legs again)

2530
01:32:44,395 --> 01:32:46,194
I don't think this is it.

2531
01:32:46,195 --> 01:32:47,364
(Clinical trial failed)

2532
01:32:47,365 --> 01:32:48,824
If it's not spreading your legs,

2533
01:32:48,825 --> 01:32:50,594
I think it's biting your lips.

2534
01:32:50,595 --> 01:32:52,794
Eun Ji, you should do what you did then too.

2535
01:32:52,795 --> 01:32:53,835
(Do what you just did.)

2536
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,734
(They're going to reenact the scene.)

2537
01:32:56,735 --> 01:33:00,945
(A minute ago)

2538
01:33:01,505 --> 01:33:03,444
(The 2nd clinical trial)

2539
01:33:03,445 --> 01:33:04,515
Over here...

2540
01:33:04,975 --> 01:33:06,885
(Chuckling)

2541
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:11,255
We're trying to find our banned words and actions.

2542
01:33:11,355 --> 01:33:13,315
We're recreating the moment.

2543
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:15,384
What could be ours?

2544
01:33:15,385 --> 01:33:16,724
- What is it? - I don't know.

2545
01:33:16,725 --> 01:33:18,355
I said, "What are you doing?"

2546
01:33:18,755 --> 01:33:21,125
(Glancing)

2547
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:23,464
Okay, shall we continue?

2548
01:33:23,465 --> 01:33:24,865
- Who's next? - It's my turn.

2549
01:33:27,005 --> 01:33:28,065
Look.

2550
01:33:32,075 --> 01:33:33,805
(In scoring position)

2551
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,004
Look, sister.

2552
01:33:36,005 --> 01:33:37,774
(Look, sister.)

2553
01:33:37,775 --> 01:33:39,015
Team Comedy, fail.

2554
01:33:39,845 --> 01:33:41,585
Team Comedy, you failed.

2555
01:33:41,815 --> 01:33:43,455
(Baffled)

2556
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:45,584
What did you do?

2557
01:33:45,585 --> 01:33:46,784
- What about you, Eun Ji? - I did nothing!

2558
01:33:46,785 --> 01:33:48,054
Come on, Eun Ji!

2559
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:50,325
- I didn't do anything! - Yes, take that one out!

2560
01:33:50,355 --> 01:33:52,195
(Was it this?)

2561
01:33:53,095 --> 01:33:54,095
Let's go!

2562
01:33:54,096 --> 01:33:57,194
- I really didn't do anything. - You guys can go.

2563
01:33:57,195 --> 01:33:58,741
- It's your turn. - It's Team Comedy's turn.

2564
01:33:58,765 --> 01:34:00,834
What was it? I have no idea.

2565
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:02,535
(It's Young Ji's turn.)

2566
01:34:02,965 --> 01:34:05,105
- I think we did well. - We picked a good one.

2567
01:34:06,175 --> 01:34:08,604
Mimi and Yu Jin, fail!

2568
01:34:08,605 --> 01:34:09,904
(Touching her bracelets)

2569
01:34:09,905 --> 01:34:12,475
- Young Ji, wait. - Get the stone out.

2570
01:34:13,685 --> 01:34:16,014
Young Ji, wait. I'll get the stone out.

2571
01:34:16,015 --> 01:34:18,254
("Wait")

2572
01:34:18,255 --> 01:34:19,415
Team Comedy, fail.

2573
01:34:19,485 --> 01:34:20,555
What?

2574
01:34:20,755 --> 01:34:21,755
Team Comedy, fail.

2575
01:34:21,955 --> 01:34:22,985
What?

2576
01:34:23,355 --> 01:34:25,854
- What is happening? - The yellow one is out too.

2577
01:34:25,855 --> 01:34:27,455
- What is it, Eun Ji? - What's going on?

2578
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:29,264
Eun Ji, do what you just did.

2579
01:34:29,265 --> 01:34:30,465
What did you do?

2580
01:34:30,595 --> 01:34:32,034
- I just walked. - Don't walk, Eun Ji!

2581
01:34:32,035 --> 01:34:33,935
Don't walk. Why would you walk?

2582
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:35,435
You should've run!

2583
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:38,634
Should I take this one out?

2584
01:34:38,635 --> 01:34:40,544
- Yes, please. - Take Mimi and Yu Jin's too.

2585
01:34:40,545 --> 01:34:41,644
Yes, we took them all out.

2586
01:34:41,645 --> 01:34:43,144
- There's nothing here. - Everything is out.

2587
01:34:43,145 --> 01:34:45,474
This one stone could decide...

2588
01:34:45,475 --> 01:34:46,884
the winning team.

2589
01:34:46,885 --> 01:34:47,945
Really?

2590
01:34:48,745 --> 01:34:50,285
How did this all happen?

2591
01:34:51,215 --> 01:34:53,314
- Reach for that part. - Okay.

2592
01:34:53,315 --> 01:34:55,025
(It's Young Ji's turn.)

2593
01:34:57,695 --> 01:34:59,024
It was too short.

2594
01:34:59,025 --> 01:35:00,264
- You can do this, Yu Jin. - Let's just do nothing.

2595
01:35:00,265 --> 01:35:01,364
- Yu Jin, your turn. - We should keep our distance.

2596
01:35:01,365 --> 01:35:02,465
You got this, Yu Jin.

2597
01:35:08,805 --> 01:35:11,704
(Sticking her tongue out)

2598
01:35:11,705 --> 01:35:12,775
Fail!

2599
01:35:13,845 --> 01:35:16,405
(Team Comedy's stone is taken out.)

2600
01:35:17,015 --> 01:35:18,815
- We'll take that stone out. - Then...

2601
01:35:18,915 --> 01:35:20,614
- I can just... - All you have to do is get it in.

2602
01:35:20,615 --> 01:35:22,735
(Team 20cm will win if they just get their stone in!)

2603
01:35:24,815 --> 01:35:26,085
- No! - It didn't go in!

2604
01:35:26,485 --> 01:35:28,124
(Both teams did not score.)

2605
01:35:28,125 --> 01:35:29,224
Zero points for both teams.

2606
01:35:29,225 --> 01:35:31,465
- Zero points in Round One. - The score is zero to zero.

2607
01:35:31,595 --> 01:35:32,894
Let's start the next round.

2608
01:35:32,895 --> 01:35:35,294
- Why is this so hard, Eun Ji? - I know, right?

2609
01:35:35,295 --> 01:35:37,294
- I think we have to push harder. - Right?

2610
01:35:37,295 --> 01:35:38,734
- Like this. - We need to put more into it.

2611
01:35:38,735 --> 01:35:40,704
I feel so awkward right now.

2612
01:35:40,705 --> 01:35:41,834
- What's our banned word? - What's mine?

2613
01:35:41,835 --> 01:35:43,634
- Do you have any guesses? - I'm sorry,

2614
01:35:43,635 --> 01:35:45,705
but I think we'll finish next year at this rate.

2615
01:35:45,775 --> 01:35:47,104
- This will go on forever. - It'll take a while.

2616
01:35:47,105 --> 01:35:49,004
Suddenly it'll be ten years later.

2617
01:35:49,005 --> 01:35:54,685
We'll have gray hair and be still playing this game.

2618
01:35:55,615 --> 01:35:56,845
- Okay. - All right.

2619
01:35:57,055 --> 01:35:58,715
It is my turn now.

2620
01:35:59,155 --> 01:36:00,555
Warriors.

2621
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:02,225
Next round!

2622
01:36:02,925 --> 01:36:04,325
- I mean... - Do you do that a lot?

2623
01:36:05,255 --> 01:36:07,325
(It's Eun Ji's turn.)

2624
01:36:07,665 --> 01:36:09,225
Remember what you're doing now, Eun Ji.

2625
01:36:09,895 --> 01:36:12,395
- Nice! - My gosh!

2626
01:36:12,435 --> 01:36:14,665
- Nice! - My gosh!

2627
01:36:14,865 --> 01:36:16,975
- Nice! - My gosh!

2628
01:36:17,205 --> 01:36:19,004
- How did you do it? - Nice!

2629
01:36:19,005 --> 01:36:21,104
(Giggling)

2630
01:36:21,105 --> 01:36:22,575
You're not doing anything.

2631
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:25,245
(Even Feisty is silent.)

2632
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:26,275
Who's next?

2633
01:36:27,885 --> 01:36:29,115
It's Yu Jin's turn.

2634
01:36:29,485 --> 01:36:30,855
- You did well. - Yu Jin!

2635
01:36:39,695 --> 01:36:41,825
(Oops.)

2636
01:36:45,535 --> 01:36:47,816
You guys don't know what to do with yourselves right now.

2637
01:36:48,035 --> 01:36:50,205
She was going to stick her tongue out, and...

2638
01:36:51,605 --> 01:36:53,375
(It's Young Ji's turn.)

2639
01:36:54,145 --> 01:36:56,244
- Okay. - Are you nervous?

2640
01:36:56,245 --> 01:36:57,874
Yu Jin, you have to talk.

2641
01:36:57,875 --> 01:37:00,344
- We're shooting a show right now. - Yes, of course.

2642
01:37:00,345 --> 01:37:01,714
Why isn't Young Ji saying anything?

2643
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:03,014
(Exclaiming)

2644
01:37:03,015 --> 01:37:04,814
(Her mouth is sealed shut.)

2645
01:37:04,815 --> 01:37:06,054
- Good luck. - Knock that stone out.

2646
01:37:06,055 --> 01:37:07,415
- Knock it out. - I'll go, sister.

2647
01:37:07,455 --> 01:37:08,625
Fail!

2648
01:37:09,255 --> 01:37:10,525
- Team Comedy... - Fail.

2649
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:11,695
- Fail! - Fail!

2650
01:37:11,895 --> 01:37:13,794
(Scoffing)

2651
01:37:13,795 --> 01:37:15,765
But they don't have a stone anyway.

2652
01:37:16,025 --> 01:37:18,195
(Team Comedy doesn't have any stones on the sheet.)

2653
01:37:18,395 --> 01:37:20,195
I was just about to go. What should I do?

2654
01:37:20,505 --> 01:37:21,864
Can I still throw it?

2655
01:37:21,865 --> 01:37:23,035
Sure, go ahead.

2656
01:37:24,405 --> 01:37:25,475
Sister Young Seok?

2657
01:37:25,635 --> 01:37:26,905
(Sister Young Seok is silent.)

2658
01:37:30,515 --> 01:37:31,615
Why are you so bad?

2659
01:37:31,915 --> 01:37:33,015
Why are you so bad?

2660
01:37:33,245 --> 01:37:34,285
I'm sorry, sister.

2661
01:37:34,385 --> 01:37:35,915
- Fail! - This is it!

2662
01:37:36,485 --> 01:37:38,715
(They figured out Young Ji's banned word.)

2663
01:37:39,115 --> 01:37:41,485
(Team Comedy's stone is taken out.)

2664
01:37:42,025 --> 01:37:45,025
But Young Ji won't be able to stop saying it anyway.

2665
01:37:45,925 --> 01:37:48,224
You got me there.

2666
01:37:48,225 --> 01:37:50,165
(It's Mimi's turn.)

2667
01:37:50,835 --> 01:37:51,965
You got this, sister!

2668
01:37:52,535 --> 01:37:53,905
- Nice. - Fail!

2669
01:37:54,265 --> 01:37:56,165
Yu Jin and Mimi also failed.

2670
01:37:56,865 --> 01:37:59,205
(Team 20cm's stone is taken out.)

2671
01:37:59,535 --> 01:38:01,174
- I think it's "You got this." - That one.

2672
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:03,005
- Eun Ji. - Thank you.

2673
01:38:03,345 --> 01:38:04,474
Leonardo.

2674
01:38:04,475 --> 01:38:06,015
(Laughing)

2675
01:38:06,615 --> 01:38:09,585
(Laughing back)

2676
01:38:10,215 --> 01:38:12,384
Young Ji is trying...

2677
01:38:12,385 --> 01:38:13,685
Eun... Leonardo.

2678
01:38:13,925 --> 01:38:15,185
Leonardo?

2679
01:38:15,525 --> 01:38:16,624
I got it.

2680
01:38:16,625 --> 01:38:18,125
I'll show you, Kate Winslet.

2681
01:38:19,995 --> 01:38:22,295
(The no "sister" strategy)

2682
01:38:23,765 --> 01:38:25,864
- That was good. - Nice!

2683
01:38:25,865 --> 01:38:26,865
Leonardo!

2684
01:38:26,866 --> 01:38:28,735
- Nice! - Leonardo!

2685
01:38:28,865 --> 01:38:30,135
Thank you, Kate Winslet.

2686
01:38:31,605 --> 01:38:35,004
(Sticking her tongue out)

2687
01:38:35,005 --> 01:38:36,874
- They're suddenly really good. - Fail.

2688
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:37,944
(Team Comedy failed.)

2689
01:38:37,945 --> 01:38:39,575
- Who? - Team Comedy.

2690
01:38:39,945 --> 01:38:40,945
Why?

2691
01:38:42,045 --> 01:38:43,544
- Eun Ji, what's wrong with you? - Don't get angry.

2692
01:38:43,545 --> 01:38:45,755
- What could it be? - Yes!

2693
01:38:46,955 --> 01:38:48,454
(Team Comedy's stone is taken out.)

2694
01:38:48,455 --> 01:38:49,485
Let's go.

2695
01:38:50,255 --> 01:38:51,354
Let's be really formal.

2696
01:38:51,355 --> 01:38:52,894
You got it, Kate Winslet.

2697
01:38:52,895 --> 01:38:54,524
- I'll do well. - Good luck.

2698
01:38:54,525 --> 01:38:55,724
- You got this. - Nice!

2699
01:38:55,725 --> 01:38:56,824
Thank you!

2700
01:38:56,825 --> 01:38:58,594
- Nice. - No!

2701
01:38:58,595 --> 01:38:59,764
- That was close. - So close!

2702
01:38:59,765 --> 01:39:01,334
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

2703
01:39:01,335 --> 01:39:03,735
Then can they win if this stone stays here?

2704
01:39:03,935 --> 01:39:05,804
- Yes, the stone is in the sheet. - Then they'll win...

2705
01:39:05,805 --> 01:39:07,304
- unless we get this in? - That's right.

2706
01:39:07,305 --> 01:39:09,645
Then this is our last chance?

2707
01:39:10,545 --> 01:39:12,914
(Touching her bracelets)

2708
01:39:12,915 --> 01:39:14,045
Mimi failed!

2709
01:39:14,885 --> 01:39:16,444
Mimi failed? Then can we take this out?

2710
01:39:16,445 --> 01:39:19,785
- Yes, take it out. - Wait a minute.

2711
01:39:20,015 --> 01:39:21,901
- I think it's not talking. - Take it out, Leonardo.

2712
01:39:21,925 --> 01:39:24,131
- I was just standing still. - You have to do well, Young Ji.

2713
01:39:24,155 --> 01:39:27,055
(Team 20cm's stone is taken out.)

2714
01:39:27,425 --> 01:39:29,224
I think we did a great job...

2715
01:39:29,225 --> 01:39:31,035
- picking Mimi's action. - Yes, you did.

2716
01:39:31,865 --> 01:39:32,995
Hey, Young Ji!

2717
01:39:34,505 --> 01:39:38,175
- Hey, Young Ji. - Let's go!

2718
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:39,535
(It's out.)

2719
01:39:41,505 --> 01:39:43,604
- Gosh! - You're stupid

2720
01:39:43,605 --> 01:39:44,645
(Provoking)

2721
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:47,485
- But we figured it out. - Yes, we know.

2722
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:49,544
- Get out of my way! - We figured it out.

2723
01:39:49,545 --> 01:39:52,615
(If Mimi gets the stone in, they win a point.)

2724
01:39:54,355 --> 01:39:55,355
Go!

2725
01:39:56,755 --> 01:39:58,125
She's good.

2726
01:39:59,455 --> 01:40:01,024
- She's good. - She is.

2727
01:40:01,025 --> 01:40:02,964
- Kim Mi Kwan is quite good. - She's got it.

2728
01:40:02,965 --> 01:40:04,294
- Team 20cm. - Team 20cm...

2729
01:40:04,295 --> 01:40:06,795
- is ahead by 1 point. - Team 20cm!

2730
01:40:07,065 --> 01:40:09,364
(Celebration)

2731
01:40:09,365 --> 01:40:10,974
Look, they're dancing.

2732
01:40:10,975 --> 01:40:12,734
(If they fail now, they're back to 0 points.)

2733
01:40:12,735 --> 01:40:14,945
- It's okay. It's over. - It's fine.

2734
01:40:15,545 --> 01:40:16,704
Sister, did you dance?

2735
01:40:16,705 --> 01:40:19,215
- I was just doing this. - Is it really dancing for me?

2736
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:21,444
Mimi and Yu Jin, fail!

2737
01:40:21,445 --> 01:40:22,515
("Sister")

2738
01:40:22,615 --> 01:40:23,914
Is their point taken away?

2739
01:40:23,915 --> 01:40:25,315
- Zero points. - Nice!

2740
01:40:26,055 --> 01:40:27,854
- Nice. - Gosh.

2741
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:29,625
- Gosh. - You were right?

2742
01:40:29,885 --> 01:40:32,995
- I think we got it. - This game will take forever.

2743
01:40:33,095 --> 01:40:35,094
- I can dance now, right? - This won't end.

2744
01:40:35,095 --> 01:40:37,334
It's okay now, right?

2745
01:40:37,335 --> 01:40:38,671
(Bracelet Mim thinks their banned action is dancing.)

2746
01:40:38,695 --> 01:40:40,964
You got this!

2747
01:40:40,965 --> 01:40:42,164
- Windbreaker. - Let's go!

2748
01:40:42,165 --> 01:40:43,364
- Let it all out. - You got this, Young Ji.

2749
01:40:43,365 --> 01:40:44,404
(Sister An thinks her banned word is "You got this.")

2750
01:40:44,405 --> 01:40:45,504
- Thanks. - We got this!

2751
01:40:45,505 --> 01:40:46,985
- We lost all our points. - Let's go.

2752
01:40:47,575 --> 01:40:48,744
This game is...

2753
01:40:48,745 --> 01:40:50,044
- This will... - Mimi, it's so...

2754
01:40:50,045 --> 01:40:51,474
end at 10pm today.

2755
01:40:51,475 --> 01:40:53,314
I think you overestimated us.

2756
01:40:53,315 --> 01:40:55,235
I told you, we'll be doing this ten years later.

2757
01:40:57,615 --> 01:40:59,314
- That was a bit weak. - It's not bad, Eun Ji.

2758
01:40:59,315 --> 01:41:00,784
- It's not bad. - It fell short.

2759
01:41:00,785 --> 01:41:02,924
It's blocking, and made it in as well.

2760
01:41:02,925 --> 01:41:04,825
- It wasn't bad at all. - Thank you.

2761
01:41:04,955 --> 01:41:06,724
- You two are really calm now. - Right.

2762
01:41:06,725 --> 01:41:08,464
- We're... - Go!

2763
01:41:08,465 --> 01:41:09,824
Let's go.

2764
01:41:09,825 --> 01:41:11,735
Go!

2765
01:41:13,165 --> 01:41:15,065
- Gosh! - That was amazing.

2766
01:41:17,205 --> 01:41:18,775
- Gosh! - That was amazing.

2767
01:41:19,405 --> 01:41:20,604
I can still win this, Eun Ji.

2768
01:41:20,605 --> 01:41:21,744
Thanks, Young Ji.

2769
01:41:21,745 --> 01:41:24,145
I think your reaction can be bigger than that.

2770
01:41:24,945 --> 01:41:27,114
- She's holding it in. - Yu Jin, that was great.

2771
01:41:27,115 --> 01:41:28,115
What is this?

2772
01:41:28,715 --> 01:41:30,544
Hold it in. That was fantastic.

2773
01:41:30,545 --> 01:41:32,185
- Great. - I'm holding it in.

2774
01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:35,654
You're not talking that much, sister.

2775
01:41:35,655 --> 01:41:37,255
I don't know what I can say.

2776
01:41:37,525 --> 01:41:38,825
- Young Ji... - Failed!

2777
01:41:39,555 --> 01:41:40,594
Team 20cm failed.

2778
01:41:40,595 --> 01:41:42,795
- Take it out, Kim Myeong Kwan. - We'll take one out.

2779
01:41:43,225 --> 01:41:44,334
Did you just call me Kim Myeong Kwan?

2780
01:41:44,335 --> 01:41:45,655
(Team 20cm's stone is taken out.)

2781
01:41:45,935 --> 01:41:47,835
- Kim Myeong Kwan? - Is it touching your hair?

2782
01:41:48,535 --> 01:41:49,895
- What? - Did you touch your hair?

2783
01:41:49,965 --> 01:41:51,005
(Me?)

2784
01:41:51,275 --> 01:41:52,605
(Yes, you!)

2785
01:41:53,005 --> 01:41:54,345
I can't dance, and...

2786
01:41:55,005 --> 01:41:56,605
(I think you're right.)

2787
01:41:57,345 --> 01:41:59,114
- Really... - Goodness.

2788
01:41:59,115 --> 01:42:01,385
(Team 20cm's guess is completely off.)

2789
01:42:01,945 --> 01:42:03,815
Focus and put it right where you want it.

2790
01:42:04,685 --> 01:42:07,425
- That was perfect. - Gosh.

2791
01:42:07,685 --> 01:42:09,555
That was so smooth. Well done.

2792
01:42:09,755 --> 01:42:11,524
You did great, Young Ji.

2793
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:12,854
I think Young Ji is too quiet.

2794
01:42:12,855 --> 01:42:13,925
Thank you, brother.

2795
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:17,264
(Sticking her tongue out)

2796
01:42:17,265 --> 01:42:19,735
- Failed! - Team Comedy failed.

2797
01:42:20,295 --> 01:42:21,334
Team Comedy failed.

2798
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:24,705
I can't say "Sister," "Brother," or anything like that?

2799
01:42:26,035 --> 01:42:27,875
What is this? What am I supposed to do?

2800
01:42:28,645 --> 01:42:30,844
(Team Comedy's stone is taken out.)

2801
01:42:30,845 --> 01:42:32,615
- Just use names only. - Senpai!

2802
01:42:32,945 --> 01:42:33,985
- Senpai. - "Senpai?"

2803
01:42:35,245 --> 01:42:37,455
- That was great. - Great job, Mimi!

2804
01:42:38,155 --> 01:42:42,455
(Eun Ji goes next.)

2805
01:42:43,785 --> 01:42:45,154
Both teams are doing well.

2806
01:42:45,155 --> 01:42:47,025
- You're neck-and-neck. - We really are.

2807
01:42:47,055 --> 01:42:48,065
This is too...

2808
01:42:48,725 --> 01:42:51,164
Should I hit the other stone or just get mine in?

2809
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:52,464
Hitting it is also good.

2810
01:42:52,465 --> 01:42:53,865
How about you shake your bottom?

2811
01:42:55,235 --> 01:42:56,265
I'll hold it in.

2812
01:42:58,405 --> 01:43:00,504
(Sticking her tongue out)

2813
01:43:00,505 --> 01:43:02,104
- Let's go. - Failed!

2814
01:43:02,105 --> 01:43:03,744
(Team Comedy failed.)

2815
01:43:03,745 --> 01:43:05,674
- Eun Ji, it's my tongue. - Team Comedy, you failed.

2816
01:43:05,675 --> 01:43:07,844
- It's my tongue, Eun Ji. - I don't think I need to hit it!

2817
01:43:07,845 --> 01:43:09,845
I keep saying "Sister" and sticking my tongue out.

2818
01:43:09,915 --> 01:43:11,855
(Eun Ji plays along.)

2819
01:43:12,085 --> 01:43:13,855
(Chuckling)

2820
01:43:14,185 --> 01:43:16,724
(Team Comedy is showing us a cobra show.)

2821
01:43:16,725 --> 01:43:17,725
Look, sister.

2822
01:43:19,695 --> 01:43:21,965
I will win everything now.

2823
01:43:23,195 --> 01:43:24,565
(Wiggling her tongue)

2824
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:25,895
Sister.

2825
01:43:26,695 --> 01:43:27,704
Sister, look.

2826
01:43:27,705 --> 01:43:29,064
(Wiggling)

2827
01:43:29,065 --> 01:43:30,234
(Yu Jin covers her mouth.)

2828
01:43:30,235 --> 01:43:31,275
Yu Jin, fail!

2829
01:43:32,305 --> 01:43:33,375
Sister, look!

2830
01:43:33,735 --> 01:43:35,581
- We got it. - Please take the red stone out too.

2831
01:43:35,605 --> 01:43:39,075
(Both team's stones are taken out.)

2832
01:43:39,645 --> 01:43:40,645
Let's go!

2833
01:43:40,915 --> 01:43:43,145
- Go! - Let's go!

2834
01:43:43,845 --> 01:43:45,454
You need to push really hard.

2835
01:43:45,455 --> 01:43:47,585
- Goodness! - Yes!

2836
01:43:48,385 --> 01:43:49,754
She just won right away.

2837
01:43:49,755 --> 01:43:51,124
(The Larva is back.)

2838
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:52,194
That was amazing!

2839
01:43:52,195 --> 01:43:53,924
- We're going to have a stone now. - That was great.

2840
01:43:53,925 --> 01:43:56,665
- Be careful, Young Ji. - I'll put my tongue in.

2841
01:43:57,365 --> 01:43:58,565
In.

2842
01:43:59,835 --> 01:44:00,965
(Rubbing)

2843
01:44:02,235 --> 01:44:03,564
Team 20cm, you failed.

2844
01:44:03,565 --> 01:44:05,734
(Touching her bracelets)

2845
01:44:05,735 --> 01:44:08,404
- Team 20cm, you failed. - It wasn't us this time.

2846
01:44:08,405 --> 01:44:10,605
(Team 20cm's stone is taken out.)

2847
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:12,345
Let's begin.

2848
01:44:13,875 --> 01:44:14,885
Touching my bracelets.

2849
01:44:16,685 --> 01:44:18,715
It's this one. It's touching my bracelets, right?

2850
01:44:18,815 --> 01:44:20,684
- It's touching my bracelets, right? - What?

2851
01:44:20,685 --> 01:44:23,255
- It's my action, right? - Keep going.

2852
01:44:24,055 --> 01:44:25,455
Young Ji will throw the stone.

2853
01:44:25,555 --> 01:44:27,255
The tongue stays in.

2854
01:44:28,595 --> 01:44:29,925
(Two eyes go up.)

2855
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:32,834
Young Ji.

2856
01:44:32,835 --> 01:44:33,835
She's good.

2857
01:44:34,035 --> 01:44:35,035
(Out)

2858
01:44:35,505 --> 01:44:36,634
(It was so close.)

2859
01:44:36,635 --> 01:44:37,934
(Wiggling)

2860
01:44:37,935 --> 01:44:39,074
It's okay, Young Ji.

2861
01:44:39,075 --> 01:44:40,534
- It's okay. You did well. - I'll go next.

2862
01:44:40,535 --> 01:44:42,304
What's the use of knowing? She can't put the stone inside.

2863
01:44:42,305 --> 01:44:44,814
You'll win a point if you put the stone inside.

2864
01:44:44,815 --> 01:44:46,874
It's too bad. The last one was close, right?

2865
01:44:46,875 --> 01:44:49,184
- Yes. - Yes. You did well.

2866
01:44:49,185 --> 01:44:50,545
- All right. - We won.

2867
01:44:51,115 --> 01:44:52,814
(Team 20cm wins 1 point.)

2868
01:44:52,815 --> 01:44:54,384
It's 1 to 0. Team 20cm...

2869
01:44:54,385 --> 01:44:56,425
- won this round. - Well done.

2870
01:44:56,825 --> 01:44:59,454
- Let's do this. - All right.

2871
01:44:59,455 --> 01:45:01,295
I can't put my guard down.

2872
01:45:01,495 --> 01:45:02,794
(Swaying)

2873
01:45:02,795 --> 01:45:03,965
- Like ChatGPT. - Yes.

2874
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:06,164
You guys need to keep talking.

2875
01:45:06,165 --> 01:45:07,534
We're the only ones who are talking.

2876
01:45:07,535 --> 01:45:09,004
Okay, sister.

2877
01:45:09,005 --> 01:45:11,034
- Okay, sister. - We're talking a lot.

2878
01:45:11,035 --> 01:45:12,574
- Seriously. - Team 20cm, fail.

2879
01:45:12,575 --> 01:45:14,304
("Sister")

2880
01:45:14,305 --> 01:45:16,244
- Zero points. - You have zero points.

2881
01:45:16,245 --> 01:45:17,685
(Team Comedy: 0 versus Team 20cm: 0)

2882
01:45:17,915 --> 01:45:19,615
(Mocking)

2883
01:45:21,885 --> 01:45:23,345
(Wiggling)

2884
01:45:26,955 --> 01:45:28,725
Let's play to five points.

2885
01:45:29,085 --> 01:45:31,071
- Seven points will be hard. - You can make it two points.

2886
01:45:31,095 --> 01:45:32,154
Seriously. I'm not lying.

2887
01:45:32,155 --> 01:45:33,624
You'll play to four points.

2888
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:35,064
- Four points sound great. - I love it.

2889
01:45:35,065 --> 01:45:37,124
(The rule is changed so that they'll play to 4 points.)

2890
01:45:37,125 --> 01:45:38,134
- Young Ji, good luck. - Okay.

2891
01:45:38,135 --> 01:45:39,135
- Watch your tongue. - It wasn't...

2892
01:45:39,136 --> 01:45:40,665
Young Ji, watch your tongue.

2893
01:45:42,505 --> 01:45:45,204
(Sticking her tongue out)

2894
01:45:45,205 --> 01:45:47,604
- What is it? - What's wrong?

2895
01:45:47,605 --> 01:45:49,274
- Do I need to cut off my tongue? - Fail.

2896
01:45:49,275 --> 01:45:50,874
- What? What did you do? - Fail.

2897
01:45:50,875 --> 01:45:52,344
I stick it out like a lizard.

2898
01:45:52,345 --> 01:45:53,415
What did you do?

2899
01:45:55,315 --> 01:45:57,815
Yu Jin, why are you so stiff?

2900
01:45:58,185 --> 01:46:00,085
I have no idea what my banned action is.

2901
01:46:00,485 --> 01:46:01,784
- It's so hard. - So she stopped altogether.

2902
01:46:01,785 --> 01:46:03,231
It's so hard. I have no idea what my word and action are.

2903
01:46:03,255 --> 01:46:05,495
- Sister, yours... - What?

2904
01:46:06,225 --> 01:46:07,295
I have no idea.

2905
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:09,195
Fail.

2906
01:46:09,865 --> 01:46:11,465
Team Comedy, fail.

2907
01:46:12,235 --> 01:46:14,235
I guess she stuck her tongue out.

2908
01:46:16,665 --> 01:46:19,175
Aren't you practically a frog?

2909
01:46:19,375 --> 01:46:21,074
(Encore)

2910
01:46:21,075 --> 01:46:23,675
Aren't you practically a frog? A croaking frog.

2911
01:46:24,345 --> 01:46:25,814
I bet they really wanted to do it.

2912
01:46:25,815 --> 01:46:26,844
(The current situation)

2913
01:46:26,845 --> 01:46:28,445
- Here I go. - Go ahead.

2914
01:46:28,685 --> 01:46:29,715
She's good.

2915
01:46:32,255 --> 01:46:36,825
- Okay. - My goodness.

2916
01:46:36,885 --> 01:46:38,924
- Two points. - Did they win two points already?

2917
01:46:38,925 --> 01:46:40,194
- Two points? - If they win one more point...

2918
01:46:40,195 --> 01:46:41,925
Team 20cm won 2 points.

2919
01:46:42,165 --> 01:46:44,164
- Right. They won 2 points. - We won 2 points.

2920
01:46:44,165 --> 01:46:45,165
If they win one more point...

2921
01:46:45,166 --> 01:46:46,535
We just need to do it twice more.

2922
01:46:47,905 --> 01:46:50,504
(They take caution as much as they can.)

2923
01:46:50,505 --> 01:46:51,775
- We love it. - The problem is,

2924
01:46:52,035 --> 01:46:53,734
neither of them know...

2925
01:46:53,735 --> 01:46:55,375
what their banned words and actions are.

2926
01:46:57,205 --> 01:46:58,775
(Swaying)

2927
01:47:00,985 --> 01:47:03,014
It isn't about my hips.

2928
01:47:03,015 --> 01:47:04,284
It isn't about your hips.

2929
01:47:04,285 --> 01:47:06,114
Is it sweeping the hair back?

2930
01:47:06,115 --> 01:47:08,024
- Give me strength, Ashley. - It'll go back to zero points.

2931
01:47:08,025 --> 01:47:09,725
- Let's go. - Give me strength, Ashley.

2932
01:47:09,955 --> 01:47:11,324
Let's go, Ashley.

2933
01:47:11,325 --> 01:47:12,524
(It's Eun Ji's turn.)

2934
01:47:12,525 --> 01:47:13,525
Let's go, VIPS.

2935
01:47:17,165 --> 01:47:18,534
(Landing)

2936
01:47:18,535 --> 01:47:20,464
- Didn't I do well? - Are you a professional?

2937
01:47:20,465 --> 01:47:21,734
- I think I'm a professional. - You're so good.

2938
01:47:21,735 --> 01:47:23,064
- Thank you. - You're so good.

2939
01:47:23,065 --> 01:47:24,805
- All right. - How are you so good at it?

2940
01:47:25,175 --> 01:47:26,204
How am I so bad at it?

2941
01:47:26,205 --> 01:47:27,404
(Stiff)

2942
01:47:27,405 --> 01:47:28,765
Are you okay? Are you a mannequin?

2943
01:47:28,845 --> 01:47:30,575
- I'm okay. - Doesn't your body ache?

2944
01:47:30,675 --> 01:47:31,714
I'm good.

2945
01:47:31,715 --> 01:47:33,444
- I'm okay. - Doesn't your body ache?

2946
01:47:33,445 --> 01:47:34,445
I'm good.

2947
01:47:37,115 --> 01:47:39,585
(She got the hang of it.)

2948
01:47:40,155 --> 01:47:41,784
- You're good. - Thank you.

2949
01:47:41,785 --> 01:47:43,454
- You became a professional curler. - She's so good.

2950
01:47:43,455 --> 01:47:44,654
I became a professional curler.

2951
01:47:44,655 --> 01:47:45,901
Why are you doing this with your hands?

2952
01:47:45,925 --> 01:47:47,094
Just in case.

2953
01:47:47,095 --> 01:47:48,795
Why did everyone become a Lego figure?

2954
01:47:50,065 --> 01:47:52,065
You're a person. You aren't a frog.

2955
01:47:52,435 --> 01:47:53,964
You're a person. You aren't a frog.

2956
01:47:53,965 --> 01:47:56,135
- Don't show the white of your eyes. - Ribbit.

2957
01:47:57,235 --> 01:48:00,234
Ribbit!

2958
01:48:00,235 --> 01:48:01,404
That's good.

2959
01:48:01,405 --> 01:48:02,675
- Nice. - My goodness.

2960
01:48:03,445 --> 01:48:04,815
Look at Director Sun Woo.

2961
01:48:06,045 --> 01:48:08,715
- You did well. - Director Sun Woo lost weight.

2962
01:48:09,345 --> 01:48:10,445
I'll use a new technique.

2963
01:48:10,945 --> 01:48:12,814
I'll take out a stone diagonally.

2964
01:48:12,815 --> 01:48:13,815
Good.

2965
01:48:13,816 --> 01:48:16,185
It'll be funny if she fails.

2966
01:48:17,085 --> 01:48:19,595
There you go!

2967
01:48:20,295 --> 01:48:22,164
There you go!

2968
01:48:22,165 --> 01:48:24,965
- Nice. - Just get it in the circle.

2969
01:48:25,465 --> 01:48:26,564
Well done.

2970
01:48:26,565 --> 01:48:28,764
Show us a celebration. It was a cool shot.

2971
01:48:28,765 --> 01:48:29,834
(Simple)

2972
01:48:29,835 --> 01:48:30,864
It's quite sedentary.

2973
01:48:30,865 --> 01:48:32,574
You should make three poses at the very least.

2974
01:48:32,575 --> 01:48:34,344
- One, two, three. - Well done.

2975
01:48:34,345 --> 01:48:36,544
- She showed three poses. - Thank you.

2976
01:48:36,545 --> 01:48:37,545
Let's change up the atmosphere.

2977
01:48:37,546 --> 01:48:39,174
Director Sun Woo, give me strength.

2978
01:48:39,175 --> 01:48:41,444
- Let's go. - Here I go, Namkoong Young Ji.

2979
01:48:41,445 --> 01:48:42,445
You're really good. You're good.

2980
01:48:42,446 --> 01:48:45,055
- You're already good. - Let's go.

2981
01:48:46,185 --> 01:48:48,384
- Thank you. - Not bad.

2982
01:48:48,385 --> 01:48:50,024
- Not bad. I'm hopeful. - Thank you.

2983
01:48:50,025 --> 01:48:51,254
I should've thrown it a bit harder.

2984
01:48:51,255 --> 01:48:52,935
- Well... - The red stone is still closer.

2985
01:48:53,455 --> 01:48:54,864
Why is it so confusing?

2986
01:48:54,865 --> 01:48:56,264
- I'll do it this way. - Go ahead.

2987
01:48:56,265 --> 01:48:57,364
(Mimi's turn)

2988
01:48:57,365 --> 01:48:59,395
- Let's go. - Will she use this strategy?

2989
01:49:02,565 --> 01:49:04,004
- Thank you. - Our stone went in.

2990
01:49:04,005 --> 01:49:06,034
- Two points. - We won one more point.

2991
01:49:06,035 --> 01:49:07,334
- If you keep it this way... - Two points. We won two points.

2992
01:49:07,335 --> 01:49:08,544
If you keep it this way, the game will end.

2993
01:49:08,545 --> 01:49:10,205
We need to take it out no matter what.

2994
01:49:10,675 --> 01:49:12,121
Young Ji, we need to take it out no matter what.

2995
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:14,144
- Take out the two stones. - Do you believe in me or not?

2996
01:49:14,145 --> 01:49:15,844
- Are you worried about me? - I believe in you.

2997
01:49:15,845 --> 01:49:17,005
- Here I go. - You can do it.

2998
01:49:17,545 --> 01:49:19,185
You can do anything you set your mind to.

2999
01:49:19,255 --> 01:49:21,985
- I'm a human being. - Show us what you can do.

3000
01:49:26,455 --> 01:49:28,595
(She takes out two stones.)

3001
01:49:29,195 --> 01:49:30,864
(It's a legendary achievement.)

3002
01:49:30,865 --> 01:49:32,634
You did so well!

3003
01:49:32,635 --> 01:49:35,505
- Lee Young Ji! - Young Ji, you did so well.

3004
01:49:35,605 --> 01:49:37,404
- My goodness. - It was insane.

3005
01:49:37,405 --> 01:49:39,175
Watch your tongue. You're a human being.

3006
01:49:39,275 --> 01:49:41,174
You're a human being. Watch your tongue.

3007
01:49:41,175 --> 01:49:42,545
You're a human being.

3008
01:49:42,805 --> 01:49:44,344
You did so well, Young Ji.

3009
01:49:44,345 --> 01:49:46,014
- You're a human being. - It was the best.

3010
01:49:46,015 --> 01:49:48,845
- Let's keep it the way it is. - Let's keep it the way it is.

3011
01:49:48,945 --> 01:49:51,715
- Yu Jin, let's go. - Here's my plan.

3012
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:53,954
- Listen. - I'll hit one stone...

3013
01:49:53,955 --> 01:49:55,785
and make it take out the other stone.

3014
01:49:56,525 --> 01:49:57,525
If life went according to plans,

3015
01:49:57,526 --> 01:49:59,046
I would've earned 100 billion dollars.

3016
01:49:59,425 --> 01:50:01,055
(It's a wise saying.)

3017
01:50:01,395 --> 01:50:02,564
"If life went according to plans..."

3018
01:50:02,565 --> 01:50:04,125
Let's go.

3019
01:50:07,335 --> 01:50:09,175
- We'll need to make a judgment. - A judgment.

3020
01:50:09,405 --> 01:50:11,774
- We won. - We won.

3021
01:50:11,775 --> 01:50:14,745
(The yellow stone is closer.)

3022
01:50:15,045 --> 01:50:16,804
It's okay. It's only one point.

3023
01:50:16,805 --> 01:50:18,374
- We have a chance of winning. - Then...

3024
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:19,444
Team Comedy won, right?

3025
01:50:19,445 --> 01:50:21,044
- One point. - Team Comedy won one point.

3026
01:50:21,045 --> 01:50:22,314
- We have a chance of winning. - The score is 2 to 1..

3027
01:50:22,315 --> 01:50:23,315
- You did... - Seriously.

3028
01:50:24,415 --> 01:50:26,984
You did so well. The last shot made a great scene.

3029
01:50:26,985 --> 01:50:28,884
- When we're winning... - Failed.

3030
01:50:28,885 --> 01:50:31,454
- Failed. - Team Comedy, fail.

3031
01:50:31,455 --> 01:50:33,171
- A great scene? - You're back to zero points.

3032
01:50:33,195 --> 01:50:36,265
(Team Comedy: 0 versus Team 20cm: 2)

3033
01:50:36,565 --> 01:50:39,364
(Nice.)

3034
01:50:39,365 --> 01:50:40,794
I didn't even sing a musical number.

3035
01:50:40,795 --> 01:50:42,741
Did you stick your tongue out a little, Young Ji?

3036
01:50:42,765 --> 01:50:43,765
(She feels victimized.)

3037
01:50:43,766 --> 01:50:45,105
Young Ji, try to remember.

3038
01:50:45,875 --> 01:50:48,044
- Just tell me. - It really wasn't me.

3039
01:50:48,045 --> 01:50:50,045
- Perhaps you did a little. - It really wasn't me.

3040
01:50:52,775 --> 01:50:54,544
- What was wrong with our words? - What?

3041
01:50:54,545 --> 01:50:56,484
- "Thank You for Recognizing Us." - You did this.

3042
01:50:56,485 --> 01:50:58,014
You said, "The last shot made a great scene."

3043
01:50:58,015 --> 01:50:59,015
"The last shot made a great scene."

3044
01:50:59,016 --> 01:51:00,514
I don't say wise sayings often.

3045
01:51:00,515 --> 01:51:01,754
You say wise sayings often.

3046
01:51:01,755 --> 01:51:03,184
Team Comedy has zero points.

3047
01:51:03,185 --> 01:51:04,654
- Yes. - Take it easy.

3048
01:51:04,655 --> 01:51:06,624
- Thank goodness. - Team Comedy can rest easy,

3049
01:51:06,625 --> 01:51:08,595
- but Team 20cm... - What?

3050
01:51:09,565 --> 01:51:11,534
(Rubbing)

3051
01:51:11,535 --> 01:51:12,535
Failed!

3052
01:51:12,536 --> 01:51:14,064
(Touching her bracelets)

3053
01:51:14,065 --> 01:51:15,834
Sister!

3054
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:16,835
Failed!

3055
01:51:18,205 --> 01:51:21,845
Sister!

3056
01:51:22,005 --> 01:51:23,244
Sister.

3057
01:51:23,245 --> 01:51:25,475
(The production crew sighs.)

3058
01:51:25,675 --> 01:51:26,835
Are they back to zero points?

3059
01:51:27,275 --> 01:51:28,915
- Sister! - I'm sorry, but...

3060
01:51:29,485 --> 01:51:32,314
I was just telling them to rest easy.

3061
01:51:32,315 --> 01:51:33,814
They're so loyal.

3062
01:51:33,815 --> 01:51:35,584
(Dying of humiliation)

3063
01:51:35,585 --> 01:51:39,695
- Sister! - Yu Jin, I'm sorry!

3064
01:51:41,095 --> 01:51:43,625
- It won't end today. - She did it without reservation.

3065
01:51:44,535 --> 01:51:46,364
- Wait. - This drives me crazy.

3066
01:51:46,365 --> 01:51:48,765
This reminds me of Finland.

3067
01:51:49,565 --> 01:51:52,704
All of us have an idea of what our banned words and actions are.

3068
01:51:52,705 --> 01:51:53,705
I totally have an idea.

3069
01:51:53,706 --> 01:51:56,044
- I don't know. - How annoying.

3070
01:51:56,045 --> 01:51:58,545
- I don't know. - Let's finish it quickly.

3071
01:51:58,645 --> 01:51:59,815
I don't know what they are.

3072
01:52:00,515 --> 01:52:01,744
I know one.

3073
01:52:01,745 --> 01:52:03,284
- What are mine? - I just need to do this.

3074
01:52:03,285 --> 01:52:04,584
- I think... - I should stop being flippant.

3075
01:52:04,585 --> 01:52:05,745
My action involves the hands.

3076
01:52:06,015 --> 01:52:07,514
- Your action? - Yes.

3077
01:52:07,515 --> 01:52:10,324
- I did this earlier. - Why don't you give us a hint?

3078
01:52:10,325 --> 01:52:12,694
- Shall we give each other one hint? - Do you need it?

3079
01:52:12,695 --> 01:52:14,994
Eun Ji needs it.

3080
01:52:14,995 --> 01:52:16,164
(I need it.)

3081
01:52:16,165 --> 01:52:18,264
Tell me if it involves the upper body, lower body,

3082
01:52:18,265 --> 01:52:19,995
- or entire body. - Your banned action?

3083
01:52:21,265 --> 01:52:22,985
- Up or down. - It involves the upper body.

3084
01:52:23,405 --> 01:52:24,435
Give Eun Ji a hint.

3085
01:52:24,805 --> 01:52:26,805
(Kicking)

3086
01:52:27,535 --> 01:52:30,104
(Yu Jin kicks as her lower body is free.)

3087
01:52:30,105 --> 01:52:32,445
- I shouldn't do this. - Hers involves the upper body.

3088
01:52:33,115 --> 01:52:34,615
It's about the hands.

3089
01:52:36,285 --> 01:52:39,284
(She responds with the Dog Leg Dance.)

3090
01:52:39,285 --> 01:52:41,454
(Lower body isolation)

3091
01:52:41,455 --> 01:52:42,784
Great.

3092
01:52:42,785 --> 01:52:44,425
(Next round)

3093
01:52:45,825 --> 01:52:47,725
- Mi Kwan, are you ready? - I'm ready.

3094
01:52:48,225 --> 01:52:49,625
Don't hold the stone too high.

3095
01:52:50,965 --> 01:52:53,365
You don't know what'll happen if it's above your upper body.

3096
01:52:53,895 --> 01:52:54,965
You can do it.

3097
01:52:55,805 --> 01:52:57,645
It involves either dancing or the accessories.

3098
01:53:01,375 --> 01:53:03,004
I think it involves the accessories.

3099
01:53:03,005 --> 01:53:04,504
(She celebrates with her lower body.)

3100
01:53:04,505 --> 01:53:05,974
Let's begin.

3101
01:53:05,975 --> 01:53:07,475
- She's good. - Hold on.

3102
01:53:08,445 --> 01:53:10,444
- A hint put you at ease, right? - It put me at ease.

3103
01:53:10,445 --> 01:53:12,414
Eun Ji, behave as you have so far.

3104
01:53:12,415 --> 01:53:13,654
Okay, Young Ji.

3105
01:53:13,655 --> 01:53:14,755
(It's Mimi's turn.)

3106
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:19,824
- She's good. - She's strong.

3107
01:53:19,825 --> 01:53:20,855
- Good. - She's good.

3108
01:53:21,125 --> 01:53:22,164
Thank you.

3109
01:53:22,165 --> 01:53:23,324
(Bracelet Mim is good at sports.)

3110
01:53:23,325 --> 01:53:24,394
- She's good. - She's strong.

3111
01:53:24,395 --> 01:53:25,435
- Good. - She's good.

3112
01:53:25,665 --> 01:53:27,065
- Thank you. - Good.

3113
01:53:27,635 --> 01:53:28,705
Well done.

3114
01:53:29,265 --> 01:53:34,104
- You got it. - You got it.

3115
01:53:34,105 --> 01:53:35,105
(She thinks her banned word is "You got it.")
Young Ji, let's go.

3116
01:53:36,106 --> 01:53:39,015
(I see that it isn't my banned word.)

3117
01:53:40,175 --> 01:53:41,515
I'll throw it lightly.

3118
01:53:41,715 --> 01:53:42,715
- Then... - Lightly.

3119
01:53:43,315 --> 01:53:45,285
Even that sister froze.

3120
01:53:45,615 --> 01:53:47,684
- The three of them... - You got it.

3121
01:53:47,685 --> 01:53:49,054
- I'll throw it lightly. - Okay.

3122
01:53:49,055 --> 01:53:50,985
- Failed! - Team Comedy, failed!

3123
01:53:51,185 --> 01:53:52,424
- Team Comedy, failed! - Yes.

3124
01:53:52,425 --> 01:53:53,705
What? Did I stick my tongue out?

3125
01:53:55,265 --> 01:53:56,725
(I see.)

3126
01:53:57,465 --> 01:53:59,065
"Even that sister froze."

3127
01:54:00,165 --> 01:54:02,035
Take it off. My goodness.

3128
01:54:03,235 --> 01:54:05,974
(Team Comedy members became connected.)

3129
01:54:05,975 --> 01:54:08,245
We can't use our hands.

3130
01:54:10,505 --> 01:54:12,175
I can't use my hands either.

3131
01:54:13,375 --> 01:54:15,144
(The wild disco ball)

3132
01:54:15,145 --> 01:54:16,344
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

3133
01:54:16,345 --> 01:54:18,315
I can't use my hands either, sister.

3134
01:54:18,485 --> 01:54:19,684
Team 20cm, failed.

3135
01:54:19,685 --> 01:54:21,115
- What? - Team 20cm, failed.

3136
01:54:21,355 --> 01:54:22,355
Why?

3137
01:54:22,685 --> 01:54:24,054
- Why? - Mimi, please save us.

3138
01:54:24,055 --> 01:54:25,094
Hold on.

3139
01:54:25,095 --> 01:54:27,054
(A chaotic situation)

3140
01:54:27,055 --> 01:54:28,764
Please save us.

3141
01:54:28,765 --> 01:54:30,695
Please save us. This is like the Venus flytrap.

3142
01:54:31,465 --> 01:54:32,995
(They get separated.)

3143
01:54:33,895 --> 01:54:35,065
- What? - I'm exhausted.

3144
01:54:35,305 --> 01:54:37,405
I'll curse all of you guys.

3145
01:54:37,865 --> 01:54:39,975
Did you tell us to dress for a party for this?

3146
01:54:42,045 --> 01:54:43,444
I'm so exhausted.

3147
01:54:43,445 --> 01:54:45,844
Didn't we practice more than the national athletes?

3148
01:54:45,845 --> 01:54:48,184
- Let's make it 3 to 0. - Let's make it 3 to 0.

3149
01:54:48,185 --> 01:54:49,844
- Three points. - Even two points is enough.

3150
01:54:49,845 --> 01:54:51,214
- Three points. - Three to zero.

3151
01:54:51,215 --> 01:54:52,784
- Are you okay with 3 to 0? - Good.

3152
01:54:52,785 --> 01:54:53,955
- Let's go. - Please.

3153
01:54:54,215 --> 01:54:55,754
(It's Young Ji's turn.)

3154
01:54:55,755 --> 01:54:56,785
That's a good idea.

3155
01:54:57,585 --> 01:54:58,654
It's okay.

3156
01:54:58,655 --> 01:55:00,495
You did so well

3157
01:55:01,255 --> 01:55:02,724
(A lower body celebration)

3158
01:55:02,725 --> 01:55:03,765
Yu Jin.

3159
01:55:05,035 --> 01:55:07,295
(The human disco ball)

3160
01:55:07,595 --> 01:55:08,935
You did so well

3161
01:55:10,465 --> 01:55:13,005
(Laughing)

3162
01:55:13,235 --> 01:55:16,805
(Still excited)

3163
01:55:17,645 --> 01:55:20,315
(Showing off in front of her sisters)

3164
01:55:20,915 --> 01:55:21,915
(Cheering)

3165
01:55:24,185 --> 01:55:26,714
(A unique lower-body dance)

3166
01:55:26,715 --> 01:55:27,784
I'm so exhausted.

3167
01:55:27,785 --> 01:55:29,325
(She covers her tongue.)

3168
01:55:29,785 --> 01:55:31,224
I'm so exhausted.

3169
01:55:31,225 --> 01:55:33,294
Hold on. That means we can dance.

3170
01:55:33,295 --> 01:55:35,264
- I'm so exhausted. - Just don't move your upper body.

3171
01:55:35,265 --> 01:55:37,094
- Right? - You can still dance diligently.

3172
01:55:37,095 --> 01:55:38,235
We can move the legs.

3173
01:55:40,135 --> 01:55:41,615
- Perfect. - Mi Kwan, it's your turn.

3174
01:55:41,735 --> 01:55:43,364
- No, it isn't. I did it. - Mi Kwan, it's your turn.

3175
01:55:43,365 --> 01:55:45,004
- What? - Mi Kwan, it's your turn.

3176
01:55:45,005 --> 01:55:46,104
(It's her turn, indeed.)

3177
01:55:46,105 --> 01:55:47,404
It's because you danced.

3178
01:55:47,405 --> 01:55:48,544
- You're exhausted. - You're confused.

3179
01:55:48,545 --> 01:55:49,774
Mimi, please sweep my hair back.

3180
01:55:49,775 --> 01:55:51,244
- Don't be ambitious. - I won't be ambitious.

3181
01:55:51,245 --> 01:55:53,674
- I'll throw it in a relaxed way. - Yes, throw it in a relaxed way.

3182
01:55:53,675 --> 01:55:56,185
Okay. In a relaxed way...

3183
01:55:56,885 --> 01:55:58,485
- Shoot. - You're really good.

3184
01:55:59,785 --> 01:56:01,884
- It's unbelievable. - Young Ji, I did so well.

3185
01:56:01,885 --> 01:56:03,324
- Mimi, good luck. - Young Ji.

3186
01:56:03,325 --> 01:56:05,425
- You're really good. - Here goes Mimi.

3187
01:56:06,055 --> 01:56:07,295
Here goes Mimi.

3188
01:56:08,765 --> 01:56:10,425
Mimi!

3189
01:56:11,695 --> 01:56:13,335
Mimi!

3190
01:56:13,495 --> 01:56:14,865
(Mimi!)

3191
01:56:15,065 --> 01:56:17,035
Hey!

3192
01:56:18,405 --> 01:56:19,834
- Look over there. - You believe in your man, right?

3193
01:56:19,835 --> 01:56:21,644
Young Ji, the two stones are together.

3194
01:56:21,645 --> 01:56:23,244
- Do you believe in your man or not? - I do.

3195
01:56:23,245 --> 01:56:24,404
I'm sorry.

3196
01:56:24,405 --> 01:56:25,415
(Biting)

3197
01:56:26,215 --> 01:56:27,344
(She seals her tongue.)

3198
01:56:27,345 --> 01:56:28,544
She sealed her tongue.

3199
01:56:28,545 --> 01:56:29,585
(She seals her tongue.)

3200
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:39,825
(She took out 2 stones with 1 shot.)

3201
01:56:41,225 --> 01:56:43,365
(The disco ball gets to work.)

3202
01:56:44,165 --> 01:56:46,895
(This club is open year-round.)

3203
01:56:47,535 --> 01:56:48,704
(Feisty Frog can't say a thing.)

3204
01:56:48,705 --> 01:56:51,304
- You can do it, Yu Jin. - You did so well.

3205
01:56:51,305 --> 01:56:53,934
Continue to cover your mouth like that.

3206
01:56:53,935 --> 01:56:55,075
You can do it, Yu Jin.

3207
01:56:56,675 --> 01:56:58,104
You can do it.

3208
01:56:58,105 --> 01:56:59,775
(Yu Jin's turn)

3209
01:57:02,945 --> 01:57:04,345
It's a clean win.

3210
01:57:05,115 --> 01:57:06,314
With a score of 1 to 0,

3211
01:57:06,315 --> 01:57:07,654
- Team 20cm is leading. - Okay.

3212
01:57:07,655 --> 01:57:08,655
They're really good.

3213
01:57:08,656 --> 01:57:10,456
- The score is 1 to 0. - They're really good.

3214
01:57:10,625 --> 01:57:12,394
We'll end the game quickly.

3215
01:57:12,395 --> 01:57:14,965
Team 20cm, let's do well and end the game.

3216
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:17,525
(Just as Mimi said, )

3217
01:57:18,365 --> 01:57:20,434
(Team 20cm did well.)

3218
01:57:20,435 --> 01:57:22,634
- There you go! - They're really good.

3219
01:57:22,635 --> 01:57:24,234
All right. Two points.

3220
01:57:24,235 --> 01:57:25,475
(They won 2 points.)

3221
01:57:25,705 --> 01:57:26,974
The score is 3 to 0.

3222
01:57:26,975 --> 01:57:28,305
- The match is over. - It's over.

3223
01:57:28,745 --> 01:57:30,704
(After a long and tedious game)

3224
01:57:30,705 --> 01:57:33,274
- Mimi! - Team 20cm won.

3225
01:57:33,275 --> 01:57:34,755
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

3226
01:57:34,985 --> 01:57:36,615
- Mimi, I'm sweating. - Congratulations.

3227
01:57:36,785 --> 01:57:38,254
- Congratulations. - Pull them up as much as you want.

3228
01:57:38,255 --> 01:57:40,114
I'm sorry, but please look at the rivaling team.

3229
01:57:40,115 --> 01:57:41,584
- All right. Attention. - Congratulations.

3230
01:57:41,585 --> 01:57:42,655
Bow.

3231
01:57:42,985 --> 01:57:44,024
Thank you.

3232
01:57:44,025 --> 01:57:45,394
- It was a good match. - You know,

3233
01:57:45,395 --> 01:57:46,494
we wrote, "Sorry..."

3234
01:57:46,495 --> 01:57:48,694
because we expected her to say, "I'm sorry."

3235
01:57:48,695 --> 01:57:50,464
- "Sorry." - She wasn't sorry once.

3236
01:57:50,465 --> 01:57:51,694
She didn't say it this time.

3237
01:57:51,695 --> 01:57:52,964
- Mimi was the ace today. - Yes.

3238
01:57:52,965 --> 01:57:54,234
- She was very good. - Mimi's banned word was...

3239
01:57:54,235 --> 01:57:55,304
- "Sorry." - Okay.

3240
01:57:55,305 --> 01:57:56,364
Mimi's banned action was...

3241
01:57:56,365 --> 01:57:58,334
chosen by me. It was touching her bracelets.

3242
01:57:58,335 --> 01:57:59,634
- Touching her bracelets. - You touched your bracelets...

3243
01:57:59,635 --> 01:58:01,004
- many times. - It was smart.

3244
01:58:01,005 --> 01:58:02,005
- Nice. - What were mine?

3245
01:58:02,006 --> 01:58:03,644
Yu Jin's banned word was "sister."

3246
01:58:03,645 --> 01:58:04,891
- And the other one was... - That's right.

3247
01:58:04,915 --> 01:58:06,274
- covering her mouth and laughing. - Oh, no.

3248
01:58:06,275 --> 01:58:07,275
That's right.

3249
01:58:07,276 --> 01:58:08,684
Covering the mouth and laughing?

3250
01:58:08,685 --> 01:58:11,115
- I had no reason to do this. - She moved like this.

3251
01:58:11,315 --> 01:58:13,254
- You said "Sister" many times. - Tell us about ours.

3252
01:58:13,255 --> 01:58:14,514
Tell me what mine are. I'm so curious.

3253
01:58:14,515 --> 01:58:16,424
- As for Young Ji... - I guessed them correctly, right?

3254
01:58:16,425 --> 01:58:18,124
"Sister" and sticking the tongue out.

3255
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:20,524
- Sticking the tongue out. - Sticking the tongue out.

3256
01:58:20,525 --> 01:58:22,285
- As for Eun Ji... - I'm curious about hers.

3257
01:58:22,595 --> 01:58:24,494
The banned word was "Wait."

3258
01:58:24,495 --> 01:58:25,934
- Yes. - I see.

3259
01:58:25,935 --> 01:58:27,164
- "Wait." - After all...

3260
01:58:27,165 --> 01:58:28,304
- The banned action was... - The banned action was...

3261
01:58:28,305 --> 01:58:29,465
(The banned action)

3262
01:58:30,005 --> 01:58:31,751
- Putting the hands together. - Putting the hands together.

3263
01:58:31,775 --> 01:58:33,775
That explains what happened.

3264
01:58:34,205 --> 01:58:36,274
- You do this often. - I do this often.

3265
01:58:36,275 --> 01:58:38,204
- Young Ji guessed correctly. - We must know each other well...

3266
01:58:38,205 --> 01:58:40,015
- since this went on for a while. - I know.

3267
01:58:42,915 --> 01:58:45,084
(Team 20cm will pick the souvenirs 1st.)

3268
01:58:45,085 --> 01:58:46,584
- The winning team... - That's right.

3269
01:58:46,585 --> 01:58:48,525
Will take all the souvenirs they want.

3270
01:58:48,755 --> 01:58:50,054
The losing team...

3271
01:58:50,055 --> 01:58:51,694
- will take what remains. - Let's take a seat.

3272
01:58:51,695 --> 01:58:55,064
Which ones shall I take?

3273
01:58:55,065 --> 01:58:57,295
- Mimi. - Hurry up and choose.

3274
01:58:57,565 --> 01:58:59,865
- The egg tart souvenir. - This one. Let's take it.

3275
01:59:00,295 --> 01:59:03,035
- The cup. - Is it a cup?

3276
01:59:03,765 --> 01:59:05,675
(Yu Jin wants to tease the older members.)

3277
01:59:05,935 --> 01:59:08,235
Cups should be in pairs.

3278
01:59:08,275 --> 01:59:11,075
Let me take one. I need it.

3279
01:59:11,475 --> 01:59:13,375
If we leave one behind, you guys will fight.

3280
01:59:13,675 --> 01:59:15,844
- It's better to take both. - For goodness' sake.

3281
01:59:15,845 --> 01:59:17,684
- Let's leave this for Young Ji. - That's right.

3282
01:59:17,685 --> 01:59:19,555
- No! - That's right. Leave it for me.

3283
01:59:19,715 --> 01:59:21,214
When would we use that?

3284
01:59:21,215 --> 01:59:22,854
I want to wear it and walk around at night.

3285
01:59:22,855 --> 01:59:23,855
Why?

3286
01:59:24,225 --> 01:59:25,395
What's this?

3287
01:59:25,725 --> 01:59:28,364
- That's hand sanitizer. - It's what Eun Ji wants.

3288
01:59:28,365 --> 01:59:30,085
Hand sanitizer? That's nice. Let's take it.

3289
01:59:30,495 --> 01:59:31,525
No.

3290
01:59:31,995 --> 01:59:33,464
- Isn't it toothpaste? - It's toothpaste.

3291
01:59:33,465 --> 01:59:34,534
- Is it a toothpaste? - Yes.

3292
01:59:34,535 --> 01:59:36,455
It's the toothpaste Eun Ji really wanted to buy.

3293
01:59:36,505 --> 01:59:37,735
Let's take the toothpaste.

3294
01:59:38,235 --> 01:59:40,535
- It's a toothpaste. - Hey, don't take everything.

3295
01:59:41,005 --> 01:59:43,775
- Is there something you truly want? - Something I truly want?

3296
01:59:43,905 --> 01:59:44,975
I want the toothpaste.

3297
01:59:45,145 --> 01:59:46,174
- The toothpaste? - Yes, Eun Ji wants the toothpaste.

3298
01:59:46,175 --> 01:59:47,944
- The toothpaste and cup. Mimi... - This one?

3299
01:59:47,945 --> 01:59:49,045
Yes. The toothpaste.

3300
01:59:49,185 --> 01:59:51,085
(Come into my bag.)

3301
01:59:51,485 --> 01:59:53,384
(It's fun to tease Eun Ji.)

3302
01:59:53,385 --> 01:59:54,885
They're evil.

3303
01:59:55,285 --> 01:59:56,984
Take everything. Gosh, it's nice.

3304
01:59:56,985 --> 01:59:58,665
(Yu Jin and Mimi take 2 toothpastes each.)

3305
01:59:59,225 --> 02:00:00,855
- It goes under the cup. - Yes.

3306
02:00:01,025 --> 02:00:02,825
- Mimi, it's a coaster. - We need a coaster.

3307
02:00:03,065 --> 02:00:04,765
- Isn't it cute? - Yes, it's cute.

3308
02:00:04,965 --> 02:00:07,264
- They'll give it to us. - They'll give it to us.

3309
02:00:07,265 --> 02:00:09,425
- They'll give it to us. - Let's see who can catch it!

3310
02:00:09,565 --> 02:00:11,464
(It's humiliating.)

3311
02:00:11,465 --> 02:00:12,865
Is she possessed by an evil spirit?

3312
02:00:13,935 --> 02:00:15,405
What? It's a postcard.

3313
02:00:15,945 --> 02:00:17,305
I like postcards.

3314
02:00:17,905 --> 02:00:19,645
I don't think there are more items to take.

3315
02:00:19,875 --> 02:00:21,644
- I'm satisfied. - I took enough souvenirs.

3316
02:00:21,645 --> 02:00:22,845
Not bad.

3317
02:00:22,985 --> 02:00:25,984
I'll take Mimi and Yu Jin's tiles.

3318
02:00:25,985 --> 02:00:27,155
I'll take this one first.

3319
02:00:27,285 --> 02:00:29,255
- Will it be okay? - Totally. Take it.

3320
02:00:29,425 --> 02:00:30,825
- May I take two? - Yes.

3321
02:00:31,225 --> 02:00:33,145
Eun Ji, why did you want to buy this toothpaste?

3322
02:00:33,295 --> 02:00:35,124
- Do you want to take it? - I collect toothpastes.

3323
02:00:35,125 --> 02:00:36,224
- You just do that. - Yes.

3324
02:00:36,225 --> 02:00:38,065
- Won't you take it? - Eun Ji, it's a present.

3325
02:00:38,265 --> 02:00:39,394
There you go. It's sweet.

3326
02:00:39,395 --> 02:00:40,664
- Thank you. - Eun Ji, how about this?

3327
02:00:40,665 --> 02:00:41,694
- What's this? - Young Ji, you too.

3328
02:00:41,695 --> 02:00:43,105
Thank you. What's this?

3329
02:00:43,665 --> 02:00:45,235
The sardine soap is so nice.

3330
02:00:45,405 --> 02:00:46,881
- Really? - Young Ji, take the sardine soap.

3331
02:00:46,905 --> 02:00:48,985
Girls, let me tell you why the sardine soap is nice.

3332
02:00:49,105 --> 02:00:51,774
It eliminates all odors from the hands.

3333
02:00:51,775 --> 02:00:53,775
It's really good for eliminating any odors.

3334
02:00:54,015 --> 02:00:55,944
So people who cook fish...

3335
02:00:55,945 --> 02:00:57,185
use the sardine soap.

3336
02:00:57,415 --> 02:00:58,654
- It smells good. - How do you know so well?

3337
02:00:58,655 --> 02:00:59,915
- She's right. - Yes.

3338
02:01:00,085 --> 02:01:01,954
(She isn't a door-to-door saleswoman.)

3339
02:01:01,955 --> 02:01:03,124
It smells really good.

3340
02:01:03,125 --> 02:01:04,324
- It'll eliminate odors well. - It's excellent...

3341
02:01:04,325 --> 02:01:05,524
for removing oil.

3342
02:01:05,525 --> 02:01:07,054
- Then I should take 1. - Take 1.

3343
02:01:07,055 --> 02:01:08,254
That's right. Did you take one?

3344
02:01:08,255 --> 02:01:09,535
- Yes, I did. - There were four.

3345
02:01:09,595 --> 02:01:10,824
(Young Ji takes the tiles with the E-cade members.)

3346
02:01:10,825 --> 02:01:12,764
May I take all the tiles with the members?

3347
02:01:12,765 --> 02:01:14,734
- Sure. Don't lose them. - Keep them safe.

3348
02:01:14,735 --> 02:01:15,735
Don't break them.

3349
02:01:15,736 --> 02:01:17,605
How could no one take it?

3350
02:01:18,035 --> 02:01:20,074
- Their faces are on the tiles. - We can't be separated.

3351
02:01:20,075 --> 02:01:21,075
Okay.

3352
02:01:21,076 --> 02:01:22,874
Don't you want to take this one?

3353
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:24,004
- Young Ji. - It's cute.

3354
02:01:24,005 --> 02:01:25,544
(The Torong tiles with their names)

3355
02:01:25,545 --> 02:01:26,714
Let's take it.

3356
02:01:26,715 --> 02:01:28,214
- Yes. Let's take 1 each. - Take 1.

3357
02:01:28,215 --> 02:01:29,684
Can we take a hat each?

3358
02:01:29,685 --> 02:01:30,685
- All four of us. - Okay.

3359
02:01:30,686 --> 02:01:31,815
Pick one.

3360
02:01:32,115 --> 02:01:33,555
- A green one. - A navy one.

3361
02:01:33,985 --> 02:01:36,255
Okay. I'm done taking the souvenirs.

3362
02:01:36,525 --> 02:01:37,554
- Yes. - Are you guys done?

3363
02:01:37,555 --> 02:01:38,595
- Yes. - Yes.

3364
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:40,524
- Good. Let's eat together. - Good.

3365
02:01:40,525 --> 02:01:41,594
- Good. - I love the idea.

3366
02:01:41,595 --> 02:01:42,924
I want to eat and party with everyone.

3367
02:01:42,925 --> 02:01:44,265
Is there Buldak ramyeon?

3368
02:01:44,625 --> 02:01:46,465
Do you want me to cook Buldak ramyeon, Yu Jin?

3369
02:01:46,965 --> 02:01:48,164
Writer Jae Yeong will cook it.

3370
02:01:48,165 --> 02:01:49,965
- Writer Jae Yeong. - Gosh, Writer Jae Yeong.

3371
02:01:50,335 --> 02:01:52,074
(Writer Jae Yeong...)

3372
02:01:52,075 --> 02:01:53,934
(Disappointed)

3373
02:01:53,935 --> 02:01:55,404
Are you that excited about eating...

3374
02:01:55,405 --> 02:01:56,765
Writer Jae Yeong's Buldak ramyeon?

3375
02:01:56,845 --> 02:01:58,975
We'll eat Writer Jae Yeong's Buldak ramyeon!

3376
02:01:59,115 --> 02:02:01,035
(They move to eat the spicy stir-fried ramyeon.)

3377
02:02:01,415 --> 02:02:03,985
(He uses the same recipe to cook the spicy stir-fried ramyeon.)

3378
02:02:04,645 --> 02:02:06,884
- I'm jealous of Writer Jae Yeong. - I'll try it at home.

3379
02:02:06,885 --> 02:02:08,885
I found this blog post when I looked up my name.

3380
02:02:08,925 --> 02:02:10,184
This person wanted to use Writer Jae Yeong's recipe,

3381
02:02:10,185 --> 02:02:12,124
- but she didn't have an onion. - Okay.

3382
02:02:12,125 --> 02:02:14,565
"It's disappointing, but I'll need to use Young Ji's recipe."

3383
02:02:15,525 --> 02:02:16,924
I'm serious. I even have proof.

3384
02:02:16,925 --> 02:02:18,564
I felt so victimized that I took a screenshot.

3385
02:02:18,565 --> 02:02:20,294
- Seriously. - It made you competitive.

3386
02:02:20,295 --> 02:02:21,295
Seriously.

3387
02:02:21,296 --> 02:02:22,404
- It's the same recipe. - It's the same recipe.

3388
02:02:22,405 --> 02:02:24,035
- Oh, my. - It's the same recipe.

3389
02:02:24,665 --> 02:02:25,874
(It looks more appetizing than the last time.)

3390
02:02:25,875 --> 02:02:27,474
It got an upgrade.

3391
02:02:27,475 --> 02:02:29,674
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you, Writer Jae Yeong.

3392
02:02:29,675 --> 02:02:30,774
- Enjoy it. - Thank you, Writer Jae Yeong.

3393
02:02:30,775 --> 02:02:31,891
- It looks so tasty. - Take a photo.

3394
02:02:31,915 --> 02:02:33,395
(Yu Jin takes a photo before eating.)

3395
02:02:33,645 --> 02:02:35,785
- My Buldak ramyeon... - Young Ji, are you okay?

3396
02:02:36,245 --> 02:02:37,944
(Dejected)

3397
02:02:37,945 --> 02:02:40,254
If you don't like it, we won't eat it.

3398
02:02:40,255 --> 02:02:41,354
- No. - Okay, Young Ji.

3399
02:02:41,355 --> 02:02:42,654
- If you don't like it... - Young Ji, I won't even look at it.

3400
02:02:42,655 --> 02:02:44,584
Enjoy it. I wanted to eat it too.

3401
02:02:44,585 --> 02:02:45,655
(Laughing)

3402
02:02:46,655 --> 02:02:48,171
- It looks so tasty. - It looks so tasty.

3403
02:02:48,195 --> 02:02:50,465
- It's the consistency I like. - There's some soup.

3404
02:02:50,765 --> 02:02:52,465
- It's the consistency I like. - Let's go.

3405
02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:54,464
Many people want to try making it.

3406
02:02:54,465 --> 02:02:56,064
Onion in the dish is tasty.

3407
02:02:56,065 --> 02:02:57,134
(Impressed)

3408
02:02:57,135 --> 02:02:58,364
- It's tasty. - Let's go.

3409
02:02:58,365 --> 02:03:00,474
- How do you do it? - She's good.

3410
02:03:00,475 --> 02:03:01,904
She's the best at judging the taste.

3411
02:03:01,905 --> 02:03:03,475
- That's right. - I was so surprised.

3412
02:03:05,075 --> 02:03:06,214
- It's so tasty. - It's tasty, right?

3413
02:03:06,215 --> 02:03:07,215
(It's so tasty.)

3414
02:03:07,575 --> 02:03:09,385
The egg in the dish tastes so good.

3415
02:03:09,485 --> 02:03:11,384
- It's creamier. - Hey.

3416
02:03:11,385 --> 02:03:12,615
It's creamier.

3417
02:03:12,955 --> 02:03:14,915
It becomes tastier as it cooks slowly.

3418
02:03:17,055 --> 02:03:19,725
(It's the taste that doesn't disappoint.)

3419
02:03:20,525 --> 02:03:22,565
- Young Ji is next to you, Eun Ji. - It's so tasty.

3420
02:03:23,165 --> 02:03:25,264
(Young Ji takes a bite as well.)

3421
02:03:25,265 --> 02:03:26,495
It's so tasty.

3422
02:03:27,195 --> 02:03:28,865
- I like that it's mild. - Seriously.

3423
02:03:29,705 --> 02:03:31,004
(Everyone enjoys the meal.)

3424
02:03:31,005 --> 02:03:32,574
- It's tasty. - It's so tasty, right?

3425
02:03:32,575 --> 02:03:34,175
- Listen. - Do you want to have a match?

3426
02:03:34,335 --> 02:03:35,404
Producer Na,

3427
02:03:35,405 --> 02:03:36,974
- we should do this. - It's science.

3428
02:03:36,975 --> 02:03:38,914
The four of us talked...

3429
02:03:38,915 --> 02:03:40,214
- to Producer Hyun Yong about it. - Yes.

3430
02:03:40,215 --> 02:03:41,674
We can open a restaurant and make...

3431
02:03:41,675 --> 02:03:42,715
the 175cm tteokbokki.

3432
02:03:42,815 --> 02:03:44,985
(Here's what they mean by Space Rice Cake Shop.)

3433
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:46,701
- Listen. - Do you want to have a match?

3434
02:03:46,889 --> 02:03:49,129
- Producer Na, we should do this. - It's science.

3435
02:03:49,429 --> 02:03:51,388
The four of us talked...

3436
02:03:51,389 --> 02:03:52,598
- to Producer Hyun Yong about it. - Yes.

3437
02:03:52,599 --> 02:03:55,159
We can open a restaurant and make the 175cm tteokbokki.

3438
02:03:55,229 --> 02:03:57,269
(Here's what they mean by Space Rice Cake Shop.)

3439
02:03:57,769 --> 02:03:59,939
(Back in Earth Arcade 2)

3440
02:04:00,539 --> 02:04:02,609
(the E-caders failed the escape room.)

3441
02:04:05,109 --> 02:04:07,809
(Since you failed the last bonus stage, )

3442
02:04:08,039 --> 02:04:11,249
(you have to work part-time at the Space Rice Cake Shop.)

3443
02:04:11,609 --> 02:04:13,749
(In Lisbon)

3444
02:04:14,049 --> 02:04:16,989
If we were to do it, selling tteokbokki is what suits us.

3445
02:04:17,219 --> 02:04:18,548
- With rice cake. - Right.

3446
02:04:18,549 --> 02:04:19,589
A Korean snack bar.

3447
02:04:19,859 --> 02:04:22,028
(We'll sell 175cm tteokbokki with garaetteok.)

3448
02:04:22,029 --> 02:04:24,488
That sounds fun. Let me do it.

3449
02:04:24,489 --> 02:04:26,059
When are we going to do it?

3450
02:04:26,199 --> 02:04:27,228
(They've been talking about...)

3451
02:04:27,229 --> 02:04:28,675
(the Space Rice Cake Shop for a while.)

3452
02:04:28,699 --> 02:04:31,168
You said you'd make us work at Torong's Tteok Mill.

3453
02:04:31,169 --> 02:04:32,369
Why haven't you?

3454
02:04:32,699 --> 02:04:33,699
That's a bit...

3455
02:04:33,700 --> 02:04:34,998
(During the pre-meeting, Brother Yeong Seok had been hesitant.)

3456
02:04:34,999 --> 02:04:36,608
They have so much they can make spin-off shows about.

3457
02:04:36,609 --> 02:04:37,968
Should I go ask Ye Seul to join us upstairs?

3458
02:04:37,969 --> 02:04:39,109
- Yes. - Yes.

3459
02:04:40,039 --> 02:04:42,208
(A moment later)

3460
02:04:42,209 --> 02:04:44,108
- Ye Seul's here. - Hey, why did you bring...

3461
02:04:44,109 --> 02:04:46,349
This is a crisis. Ye Seul is filming all this.

3462
02:04:46,519 --> 02:04:47,519
(Kim Ye Seul, a 4th-generation producer)

3463
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:49,065
(She produced the Earth Arcade spin-off, Vroom Vroom.)

3464
02:04:49,089 --> 02:04:50,548
The thing is,

3465
02:04:50,549 --> 02:04:52,059
we have an amazing idea.

3466
02:04:52,189 --> 02:04:54,218
There's something we sincerely want to do,

3467
02:04:54,219 --> 02:04:55,688
and we were told that...

3468
02:04:55,689 --> 02:04:57,958
you're the only one who can bring that idea to life.

3469
02:04:57,959 --> 02:04:59,858
So we have Torong.

3470
02:04:59,859 --> 02:05:01,819
The way you're setting up the camera is so funny.

3471
02:05:01,929 --> 02:05:04,445
I know we have Torong, but we want to work at a tteokbokki place.

3472
02:05:04,469 --> 02:05:05,568
Since Torong makes rice cakes,

3473
02:05:05,569 --> 02:05:06,569
we can get garaetteok from him.

3474
02:05:06,570 --> 02:05:08,168
My height happens to be 175cm.

3475
02:05:08,169 --> 02:05:10,838
So we'll curl up a 175cm tteokbokki into a poop shape,

3476
02:05:10,839 --> 02:05:12,738
- and Yu Jin will cut it... - Hello.

3477
02:05:12,739 --> 02:05:14,308
- as she serves the customers. - If they come?

3478
02:05:14,309 --> 02:05:17,448
Eun Ji will perform "Rebecca," "Kinky Boots," "Mamma Mia..."

3479
02:05:17,449 --> 02:05:19,218
- What else? - "Seopyeonjae."

3480
02:05:19,219 --> 02:05:21,078
Yes, "Seopyeonjae." She'll perform them all.

3481
02:05:21,079 --> 02:05:22,748
And if there is demand,

3482
02:05:22,749 --> 02:05:24,288
she can reenact "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

3483
02:05:24,289 --> 02:05:26,219
She can play five roles by herself.

3484
02:05:26,559 --> 02:05:28,258
- It will be like a dinner show. - Who will serve...

3485
02:05:28,259 --> 02:05:29,928
I'll be in charge of the shaved ice and other desserts.

3486
02:05:29,929 --> 02:05:31,028
What do you think of our idea?

3487
02:05:31,029 --> 02:05:32,158
When can we make this happen?

3488
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:34,228
- Quickly. Let's set a date. - Tell them.

3489
02:05:34,229 --> 02:05:35,898
- When can you make it happen? - Do this for us.

3490
02:05:35,899 --> 02:05:37,028
Make a promise to them.

3491
02:05:37,029 --> 02:05:38,568
It's just that you are all so busy.

3492
02:05:38,569 --> 02:05:40,238
- We're not busy. - Don't blame us.

3493
02:05:40,239 --> 02:05:41,239
I'm not busy at all.

3494
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:42,915
- Promise us. - Ye Seul, promise on our behalf.

3495
02:05:42,939 --> 02:05:45,778
(Promise us)

3496
02:05:45,779 --> 02:05:47,819
(We plan on keeping our promise with the E-caders.)

3497
02:05:48,139 --> 02:05:49,278
(I'm waiting for you, my part-timers.)

3498
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:51,849
Slow down. Not yet.

3499
02:05:52,149 --> 02:05:53,718
This isn't yeot. That's it.

3500
02:05:53,719 --> 02:05:55,588
Do it over here, and use your hand to...

3501
02:05:55,589 --> 02:05:57,289
(It isn't over yet.)

3502
02:05:58,189 --> 02:06:01,189
(Back in Albufeira)

3503
02:06:02,019 --> 02:06:04,859
(The reason the E-caders visited Albufeira...)

3504
02:06:05,699 --> 02:06:08,729
(was to check out the Benagil Cave.)

3505
02:06:09,069 --> 02:06:11,569
(We weren't going to film because of the camera detox, )

3506
02:06:12,799 --> 02:06:15,539
(but this was too good not to film, so we only turned them on here.)

3507
02:06:16,209 --> 02:06:18,139
(Please enjoy this season's finale with us.)

3508
02:06:19,009 --> 02:06:21,009
(Earth Arcade boat club)

3509
02:06:23,909 --> 02:06:25,519
("Nonstop" by OH MY GIRL)

3510
02:06:27,919 --> 02:06:30,888
(They're consistently loud on their way to see a cave.)

3511
02:06:30,889 --> 02:06:31,918
How much?

3512
02:06:31,919 --> 02:06:35,189
(My heart fluttered a little)

3513
02:06:35,629 --> 02:06:39,259
(Lost in the song)

3514
02:06:39,629 --> 02:06:41,575
(They begin the next song with their hearts fluttering.)

3515
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:43,028
("After LIKE" by IVE)

3516
02:06:43,029 --> 02:06:44,069
Let's go!

3517
02:06:48,069 --> 02:06:51,669
(They fully immersed in singing, even on a boat to the Benagil Cave.)

3518
02:06:51,869 --> 02:06:53,009
Put your hands up!

3519
02:06:53,109 --> 02:06:55,549
("Caution" by Tashannie)

3520
02:06:55,809 --> 02:06:58,508
(In the other boat, the staff are immersed in the song with them.)

3521
02:06:58,509 --> 02:07:03,249
(Why are you shaking him up, trying to steal him away from me)

3522
02:07:03,489 --> 02:07:06,588
- Is it only now that you need him? - Is it only now that you need him?

3523
02:07:06,589 --> 02:07:08,088
- Hands up! - Let's go, Lee Young Ji!

3524
02:07:08,089 --> 02:07:13,829
(Time to watch Young Ji rap)

3525
02:07:14,899 --> 02:07:17,568
(Her head got exposed.)

3526
02:07:17,569 --> 02:07:18,899
(Young Ji's hat is safe.)

3527
02:07:19,269 --> 02:07:20,299
The cave.

3528
02:07:20,539 --> 02:07:21,568
That's the cave?

3529
02:07:21,569 --> 02:07:23,508
(They are nearing the cave.)

3530
02:07:23,509 --> 02:07:26,308
We'll soon be arriving at the Benagil Cave.

3531
02:07:26,309 --> 02:07:27,378
Okay.

3532
02:07:27,379 --> 02:07:30,478
Since we came all the way here, we should listen to "Snow Flower."

3533
02:07:30,479 --> 02:07:31,479
- Sounds good. - What did you say?

3534
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:33,749
- He said "Snow Flower." - "Snow Flower."

3535
02:07:34,279 --> 02:07:37,149
("Snow Flower" by Park Hyo Shin)

3536
02:07:39,219 --> 02:07:44,729
(The caves are spread out along the coast.)

3537
02:07:46,099 --> 02:07:48,659
(As they follow the long line of caves...)

3538
02:07:50,329 --> 02:07:51,799
Over there! On our right!

3539
02:07:51,999 --> 02:07:53,068
- Hello. - Where?

3540
02:07:53,069 --> 02:07:54,398
This is the Benagil Cave.

3541
02:07:54,399 --> 02:07:55,509
- I see. - I see.

3542
02:07:58,009 --> 02:07:59,608
(The world's most beautiful cave)

3543
02:07:59,609 --> 02:08:00,778
- What an insane view. - Let's go inside.

3544
02:08:00,779 --> 02:08:03,208
- It's the most beautiful cave. - If we...

3545
02:08:03,209 --> 02:08:06,318
Normally, we can go inside and ride to the beach,

3546
02:08:06,319 --> 02:08:08,519
but we can't today because of the waves.

3547
02:08:09,189 --> 02:08:13,959
(If you enter the cave on days with low waves, )

3548
02:08:14,819 --> 02:08:20,699
(you are greeted by the cave's secret, the blue sky.)

3549
02:08:22,299 --> 02:08:26,599
(It looks like this from the bottom.)

3550
02:08:28,339 --> 02:08:36,279
(The sky is reflected in the sea, and the sea is as blue as the sky.)

3551
02:08:36,609 --> 02:08:38,108
We can't see the beach today.

3552
02:08:38,109 --> 02:08:39,618
- It's underwater. - Because the waves are strong,

3553
02:08:39,619 --> 02:08:40,848
- Right. - so the beach isn't visible.

3554
02:08:40,849 --> 02:08:42,018
- Gosh. - I wish we could see it.

3555
02:08:42,019 --> 02:08:43,488
Gosh.

3556
02:08:43,489 --> 02:08:44,849
We'll just pretend we went inside.

3557
02:08:46,559 --> 02:08:47,988
There's a hole in the cave.

3558
02:08:47,989 --> 02:08:49,728
There's a hole in the roof of the cave.

3559
02:08:49,729 --> 02:08:50,829
I see.

3560
02:08:50,959 --> 02:08:53,199
- Gosh. - This is amazing.

3561
02:08:53,899 --> 02:08:56,599
(At the top, you get to see the emerald beach...)

3562
02:08:56,899 --> 02:09:00,568
(and from the bottom, you can look at the sky above.)

3563
02:09:00,569 --> 02:09:02,508
- Gosh. - This is amazing.

3564
02:09:02,509 --> 02:09:09,709
(Until we meet again, Benagil Cave)

3565
02:09:10,049 --> 02:09:12,209
Smile. In 1, 2, 3.

3566
02:09:15,179 --> 02:09:17,749
Look over there, Yu Jin. That's even more amazing to me.

3567
02:09:17,949 --> 02:09:19,618
Doesn't that look like the edge of the earth?

3568
02:09:19,619 --> 02:09:21,718
- Yes, the horizon. - Like the edge of the earth.

3569
02:09:21,719 --> 02:09:23,529
That's definitely "Event Horizon."

3570
02:09:23,789 --> 02:09:27,899
- Over the event horizon - That's the event horizon.

3571
02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:29,429
It's beautiful.

3572
02:09:31,499 --> 02:09:33,639
It's so bright that I could go blind.

3573
02:09:39,179 --> 02:09:41,109
- It's so beautiful. - It is.

3574
02:09:41,979 --> 02:09:45,778
(Their glorious 12-day journey has come to an end.)

3575
02:09:45,779 --> 02:09:47,419
- Gosh, this is so nice. - Let's go.

3576
02:09:48,249 --> 02:09:53,059
(They began under the blazing sun of Abu Dhabi.)

3577
02:09:54,419 --> 02:09:59,729
(They made memories together by the red hills of Lisbon...)

3578
02:10:01,199 --> 02:10:08,139
(and over the waves of Albufeira.)

3579
02:10:09,869 --> 02:10:15,139
(They couldn't help but laugh while walking through unfamiliar cities.)

3580
02:10:16,249 --> 02:10:20,479
(And being together made watching an old drama more fun.)

3581
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:22,248
- Cassandra. - Cassandra.

3582
02:10:22,249 --> 02:10:30,859
(As they spent more and more time together, )

3583
02:10:32,359 --> 02:10:34,498
(the way they tilt their heads, )

3584
02:10:34,499 --> 02:10:37,398
(their laughter, )

3585
02:10:37,399 --> 02:10:42,139
(and their footsteps began to resemble each other's.)

3586
02:10:52,279 --> 02:10:54,518
- It's so pretty. - It's beautiful.

3587
02:10:54,519 --> 02:10:56,948
(Having already been familiar with each other before, )

3588
02:10:56,949 --> 02:10:59,518
(we've grown even more at ease around each other.)

3589
02:10:59,519 --> 02:11:01,219
Let's take a group picture.

3590
02:11:01,919 --> 02:11:04,888
(But this isn't the end for us.)

3591
02:11:04,889 --> 02:11:07,429
(A new chapter is right around the corner.)

3592
02:11:07,759 --> 02:11:09,768
Let's shout "E-cade" together. In 1, 2, 3.

3593
02:11:09,769 --> 02:11:12,298
- E-cade! - E-cade!

3594
02:11:12,299 --> 02:11:13,368
(The adventures of the E-caders will continue!)

3595
02:11:13,369 --> 02:11:14,568
- What is this? - What is this?

3596
02:11:14,569 --> 02:11:15,668
- This is so nice. - Where are we?

3597
02:11:15,669 --> 02:11:17,268
- What is this? - Let's shout "Akh."

3598
02:11:17,269 --> 02:11:18,409
On three. 1, 2, 3.

3599
02:11:18,439 --> 02:11:19,439
- Akh! - Akh!

3600
02:11:21,839 --> 02:11:22,879
Bye!

3601
02:11:24,849 --> 02:11:26,018
In 1, 2, 3.

3602
02:11:26,019 --> 02:11:27,149
- Akh! - Akh!

3603
02:11:28,779 --> 02:11:30,449
In 1, 2, 3.

3604
02:11:30,589 --> 02:11:31,619
- Akh! - Akh!

3605
02:11:31,949 --> 02:11:34,189
And then I'll walk past the camera like this. Follow me.

3606
02:11:36,659 --> 02:11:37,888
- What are we filming? - You'll see.

3607
02:11:37,889 --> 02:11:40,170
It'll be a work of art when everything is compiled later.

3608
02:11:40,229 --> 02:11:41,899
- All together. - Like this?

3609
02:11:41,999 --> 02:11:44,498
- Do this. And shake your heads. - Do this.

3610
02:11:44,499 --> 02:11:46,568
And then cut. And we do another one again.

3611
02:11:46,569 --> 02:11:47,938
- Okay. - I'll sit down.

3612
02:11:47,939 --> 02:11:49,439
That's why we went undercover.

3613
02:11:52,009 --> 02:11:54,308
Go where? Let's take a picture together.

3614
02:11:54,309 --> 02:11:55,639
- Honey. - Gosh.

3615
02:11:56,479 --> 02:11:57,848
- You look like you're... - Gosh, you look adorable.

3616
02:11:57,849 --> 02:11:59,008
You look like a baby.

3617
02:11:59,009 --> 02:12:01,279
- Your skin is... - Are we going into the water?

3618
02:12:02,889 --> 02:12:04,219
I love this.

3619
02:12:05,089 --> 02:12:06,289
I suddenly feel so grateful.

3620
02:12:06,589 --> 02:12:09,019
- We should feel grateful. - I feel so reverent.

3621
02:12:09,289 --> 02:12:11,559
Earth Arcade, I love you!

3622
02:12:13,859 --> 02:12:15,459
Here's to 20 years of Earth Arcade!

3623
02:12:16,569 --> 02:12:18,728
Until Brother Yeong Seok is 60 years old. Let's go!

3624
02:12:18,729 --> 02:12:21,038
- Let's go! - Let's go!

3625
02:12:21,039 --> 02:12:22,838
Yeong Seok's 60th birthday party. Let's go!

3626
02:12:22,839 --> 02:12:24,539
- Yes! - Thank you.

3627
02:12:25,139 --> 02:12:26,939
Until his 100th birthday party!

3628
02:12:27,779 --> 02:12:30,409
(Earth Arcade 3)

3629
02:12:33,379 --> 02:12:36,318
(Thank you for everything, Director.)

3630
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:39,219
(I'm scared.)

3631
02:12:42,289 --> 02:12:45,159
(A wanderer's love)

3632
02:12:51,129 --> 02:12:54,098
(Which one of them is Eun Ji?)

3633
02:12:54,099 --> 02:12:57,039
(Eun Ji Tonton versus Warrior Geon Jun)

3634
02:12:59,979 --> 02:13:03,009
(Yeong Seok will always be like a father to E-cade.)

3635
02:13:14,959 --> 02:13:17,928
(Laughing)

3636
02:13:17,929 --> 02:13:20,799
(Gonggi is too difficult.)

3637
02:13:23,829 --> 02:13:27,869
(We love you, Earth Arcade!)
