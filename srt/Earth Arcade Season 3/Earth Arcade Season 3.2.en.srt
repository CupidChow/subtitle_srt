1
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:11,847
(Earth Arcade 3)

2
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:13,247
(Previously)

3
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,076
(This time, Torong ran with the corporate card.)

4
00:00:15,077 --> 00:00:16,576
(How dare you touch the corporate card?)

5
00:00:16,577 --> 00:00:18,916
(The daring rabbit ran to Abu Dhabi.)

6
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,116
(Thankfully!)

7
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:21,656
(An ally from the Abu Dhabi Branch...)

8
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:25,087
(is chasing after Torong!)

9
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:26,986
(The name is...)

10
00:00:26,987 --> 00:00:28,456
(Agent F.)

11
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:29,826
(Agent F?)

12
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:32,296
(Agent F's entrance in the world of Earth Arcade?)

13
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:36,496
(Rendezvous with Agent F...)

14
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:38,666
(and apprehend Torong!)

15
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,266
(A collaborative espionage work by the E-cade members and Agent F)

16
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:41,606
(To avoid Torong's eyes,)

17
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:43,137
(the warriors turned into secret agents.)

18
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,346
(Code name: Lee Yong Su)

19
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:47,306
(Code name: Kim Mi Kwan)

20
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:49,247
(Code name: An Yu Myung)

21
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,016
(Code name: Lee Young Chul)

22
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,016
(The agents acquired the Jade Emperor Phone.)

23
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:54,456
(Hurry up and check the expenditures.)

24
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:56,686
(They check the card transactions made by Torong.)

25
00:00:56,687 --> 00:00:59,027
- Where did he spend 30 dollars? - If it's 30 dollars...

26
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:02,027
(He's into desserts these days!)

27
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:04,626
(A rabbit always leaves behind a trace!)

28
00:01:04,627 --> 00:01:07,427
(Following the traces of the desserts Torong ate,)

29
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:11,907
(the 4 secret agents left for Abu Dhabi.)

30
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:15,006
- We're on our way to eat brunch. - Okay.

31
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:16,336
There are a few reasons why we're going there.

32
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:17,406
First, we have...

33
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:19,706
- Torong's card transactions. - Right.

34
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:21,147
The first transaction was made at this place.

35
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,677
Where was it? Eun Ji.

36
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:26,387
(After stealing Jade Emperor's corporate card,)

37
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,857
(Torong arrived in Abu Dhabi and made the first purchase.)

38
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:32,356
Shurfa Bay.

39
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:34,187
Shurfa Bay. How much did he use?

40
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:36,056
He used 110 dirhams.

41
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:37,726
- That's a lot. - He used about 50 dollars.

42
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:38,727
Fifty to sixty dollars.

43
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:40,266
What did he eat to use 50 dollars?

44
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,267
Seriously.

45
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,797
(What's the restaurant Torong visited?)

46
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:44,867
(The department store of global flavors)

47
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:49,536
(A parade of dishes and ingredients)

48
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:51,946
(Abu Dhabi)

49
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:54,047
(The agents' first destination)

50
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,277
(As the city is next to the sea,)

51
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,817
(you get a view of the blue beach.)

52
00:01:59,347 --> 00:02:00,987
(The royals of Abu Dhabi often throws a party here.)

53
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:04,727
(A popular rooftop cafe that serves the Middle Eastern brunch)

54
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:08,327
(Welcome to Shurfa Bay.)

55
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:10,056
(My goodness)

56
00:02:10,057 --> 00:02:11,296
- It's pretty. - I love it.

57
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,326
It's so nice.

58
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:14,796
- The weather is perfect. - It isn't hot at all.

59
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:16,197
It'll be nice to eat outside.

60
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:17,467
It definitely has...

61
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:19,566
a nice view.

62
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:20,837
I like it.

63
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:21,976
(My goodness)

64
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:23,006
It's the real deal.

65
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:24,446
(The view makes them exclaim.)

66
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:26,377
- It's the real deal. - Yes.

67
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:28,547
- From the very first game... - It's so nice.

68
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:30,516
So amazing. So fancy.

69
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,647
- So this is the place... - Yes.

70
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,757
where Torong spent 50 dollars.

71
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:37,756
Royals actually come here to party...

72
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,056
- and eat brunch. - I'm not surprised.

73
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:41,796
We came here early and borrowed the second floor.

74
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:43,297
(They borrowed the entire 2nd floor for the agents.)

75
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:45,767
- The food is here. - The food is here.

76
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:47,466
Hey.

77
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,636
- Hey. - Thank you.

78
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:51,037
(The royal set is here.)

79
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,936
We keep getting more food.

80
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:54,007
Why is there so much food?

81
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:55,876
I want to eat that.

82
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:56,877
(My goodness)

83
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:58,377
- The fritter looks tasty. - Greek yogurt.

84
00:02:58,777 --> 00:02:59,946
(Crowded)

85
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,876
- Yogurt bowl. - Gonggal bread.

86
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,816
- It's what Mimi likes. - Pizza.

87
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:04,986
(The table gets filled endlessly.)

88
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:06,916
- Cheese. - Cheese.

89
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,057
It looks so tasty.

90
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:09,917
(Cheering)

91
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:11,326
It's like the bread bowl pasta.

92
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:12,827
(There are brunch menus they're familiar with...)

93
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:18,397
(as well as the Middle Eastern menus they're unfamiliar with.)

94
00:03:19,597 --> 00:03:21,397
It's a very famous dessert.

95
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:22,896
- Really? - It's a famous dessert.

96
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:23,937
Really?

97
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,236
- Oh, my gosh. - We have to eat it.

98
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:28,076
- Mimi, it's yours. - Is that pistachio? What is it?

99
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:29,177
I think it's pistachio.

100
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:32,007
(An unfamiliar dessert with pistachio sprinkled on the top)

101
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:33,677
Is it kadayif?

102
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,077
I heard that it was a very famous dessert.

103
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:38,587
This is the brunch set for the royals.

104
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,346
Producer Park Hyun Yong who made a field investigation...

105
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:42,616
will give the perfect explanation.

106
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,286
- Let's go. Good luck. - Let's go.

107
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:45,386
(Producer Park Hyun Yong, the AI of explanation)

108
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:47,526
- I'll begin with the rightmost one. - Okay.

109
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,926
The bread is called Arabic bread.

110
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:50,996
- Gonggal bread. - Arabic bread.

111
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,626
It's similar to naan.

112
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:54,297
- It sounds delicious. - It's bound to be tasty.

113
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,737
I love naan.

114
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:57,566
Have you heard of hummus?

115
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:59,607
- I love hummus. - Hummus.

116
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:00,766
Chickpea.

117
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:01,836
- Chickpea? - That's right.

118
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:03,176
- You grind chickpeas. - Hummus?

119
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,206
- In front of the granola yogurt... - Here.

120
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:05,207
is hummus.

121
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,846
- I love hummus. - Same here.

122
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,017
("Hummus" means "Chickpea.")

123
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,316
(It's a Middle Eastern dip with a clean and nutty taste...)

124
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,846
(that's made with chickpeas.)

125
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:13,916
And in front of the fruits...

126
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:16,056
Have you heard of shakshouka?

127
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:17,886
- Shakshouka. - I love it.

128
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:19,686
- Shakshouka. - Eggs in hell is a tasty dish.

129
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:21,356
- That's right. - You know the dish.

130
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:23,396
Shakshouka is the original version of eggs in hell.

131
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,696
- I love it. - It's a Middle Eastern dish.

132
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,697
- Eun Ji. - I love it.

133
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,196
- Brilliant. - It's a mix of eggs and tomatoes.

134
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:28,736
It's a mix of eggs and tomatoes.

135
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:30,197
(It's perfect with the savory Arabic bread.)

136
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,837
What looks like pizza is zaatar flatbread.

137
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,077
- Zaatar flatbread. - Zaatar flatbread.

138
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:38,506
The bread you see in the back is the egg cheese bread.

139
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:40,277
- Egg cheese bread. - It looks tasty.

140
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:43,577
It looks tasty. It's bound to be tasty.

141
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:46,246
Is that brass?

142
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:48,257
In the brass container is...

143
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,657
a dish called ful that's made by boiling beans and olive oil.

144
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:53,256
It's a Middle Eastern stew.

145
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:54,996
- There's some soup. - It sounds tasty.

146
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:56,357
- Really? - It smells like cheonggukjang.

147
00:04:57,127 --> 00:04:59,126
(It's a dish with clean and fresh flavors...)

148
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:01,236
(that's like ground soybean stew without doenjang.)

149
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:02,536
Producer Park, please speed up the explanation...

150
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:04,266
- by 0.25 or 1.25 times. - Please hurry up.

151
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:06,537
- The names are difficult. - Hurry up.

152
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,976
(Speeding up by 1.25 times)

153
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:12,477
Next to it are croissant sandwiches.

154
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:14,876
Pasta cheese ball.

155
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:16,217
- It's the rightmost one. - It looks delicious.

156
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:17,646
Mixed grill.

157
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:19,486
- Mixed grill. - You can see meat over here.

158
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,786
- Meat. - There's a cheese platter.

159
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:22,816
- Yes. - It looks delicious.

160
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:24,316
What's in the middle is...

161
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:26,286
- kibbeh hamis. - It looks delicious.

162
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:28,797
It's a popular Middle Eastern snack that's made with meat.

163
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:31,497
(It tastes amazing with the refreshing tahini sauce.)

164
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:34,766
(Kibbeh hamis)

165
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,166
- I love it. - It's a traditional chicken dish...

166
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,237
- called tawook. - Tawook?

167
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,667
(Cock-a-doodle-doo)

168
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:43,436
- The reactions are getting weaker. - I want to hurry up and eat them.

169
00:05:43,437 --> 00:05:45,247
I'm sorry, but the reactions aren't...

170
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:47,676
- how they used to be. - Hurry up.

171
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:49,376
(They've been hungry for 12 hours.)

172
00:05:49,377 --> 00:05:51,046
In the middle is...

173
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:53,517
- the dessert Torong probably ate. - This one?

174
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,157
(The representative dessert of the Middle East)

175
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:59,627
(The thin and long kadayif is made from the flour batter.)

176
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:03,257
(It gets baked with mozzarella on the top.)

177
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,526
It's a Middle Eastern dessert...

178
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:06,867
that's made by baking kadayif and cheese in butter.

179
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:08,336
- It sounds delicious. - It's kunafa.

180
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:10,037
- Kunafa. - Cheese kunafa.

181
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,837
(The dessert captain shouts out the slogan.)

182
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:15,337
This must be what Torong ate here.

183
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:19,777
(I enjoyed the treat.)

184
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:23,947
(There's total of 18 Middle Eastern brunch menus.)

185
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:27,247
(It's what the royals of Abu Dhabi enjoy.)

186
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,687
(The fancy royal set)

187
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,056
This is a royal meal.

188
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:34,897
Please act like royals.

189
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:36,357
Yes?

190
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:38,296
- Yes? - Recently,

191
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,196
a prince had a birthday party here.

192
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:42,367
- Happy birthday. - I remember.

193
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,767
- I was at the party. - Whose party?

194
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,006
- The prince's party. - You got here today.

195
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:47,266
- No. - Who are you?

196
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:48,736
I'm Eun Ji Tonton.

197
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:50,206
- Are you Tonton? - Yes.

198
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:51,746
With the best brunch menus in front of you,

199
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:53,276
you'll play simple games.

200
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:54,406
You'll be too full...

201
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:55,547
- if you eat all of them. - We won't be full.

202
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:57,576
You can't eat all of them, so you'll play simple games...

203
00:06:57,577 --> 00:06:59,247
and lose one dish at a time.

204
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:00,447
- Okay. - Must we lose them?

205
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:02,686
If you succeed in it at once, you won't lose a single dish.

206
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:03,916
- Will we be able to eat everything? - Of course.

207
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,086
Okay. We can do it.

208
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:06,286
- Let's shout "E-cade." - Okay.

209
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:07,426
- Let's go. - One, two, three.

210
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,656
- E-cade! - E-cade!

211
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:09,857
The first game is...

212
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:11,827
a new one.

213
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:14,527
(They haven't had a new game in a while.)

214
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:16,466
- A new game. - It's the initial quiz.

215
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:18,536
- The initial quiz. - The initial quiz.

216
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:19,706
- Are you sure it's new? - We're familiar with it.

217
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,036
- The initial quiz. - You played it often, right?

218
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:22,336
- You played it often, right? - How is that new?

219
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:24,006
- We're familiar with it. - All of you know the game.

220
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:25,146
All of you know the game.

221
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:26,446
We usually give you the initials...

222
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,816
and you say a fitting word, right?

223
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:31,016
- Yes. - We'll give you a category.

224
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,017
Okay.

225
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:34,016
(Category initial quiz)

226
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:35,616
It's harder.

227
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:38,126
Let's say I go, "The category is food."

228
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:40,226
If you have siot, siot, and kieuk, you can say, "Shakshouka.'

229
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,596
- Shakshouka. - It goes like that.

230
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:42,796
- You know how it goes. - Yes.

231
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,057
- Understood? - Okay.

232
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,166
- Let's try it once. - Okay.

233
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,327
Oh, my gosh.

234
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:49,866
Why did the game become harder?

235
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,737
- I'm nervous. - Category?

236
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:53,807
Yang Hee Eun, please help me.

237
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:57,776
- I'm nervous. - First comes...

238
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,807
- the category. - The category.

239
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,776
- Snack. - The category is snack.

240
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:03,876
- Okay. - Snack.

241
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:05,216
(It's the specialty of the dessert monster.)

242
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:06,316
Let's begin.

243
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:07,587
- Young Ji will go first. - Okay.

244
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:08,656
Let's begin.

245
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:09,657
(Ssang jieut, giyeok)

246
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:10,716
One, two, three.

247
00:08:10,717 --> 00:08:11,827
- Jjanggu. - Correct.

248
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,226
(They averted the first crisis.)

249
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,157
You remained calm and did well.

250
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:16,996
- One, two, three. - Couque D'asse.

251
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,026
Correct.

252
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:19,197
- Well done. - It was a good one.

253
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:20,866
- One, two, three. - Sabrang?

254
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:21,966
- Incorrect. - What's that?

255
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,297
- One, two, three. - Sabrang?

256
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,567
(Furious)

257
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,367
- Incorrect. - Eun Ji.

258
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,076
How could you get it wrong?

259
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:30,476
- What's that? - Shrimp Crackers.

260
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,577
- Shrimp Crackers. - Eun Ji.

261
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:34,246
- "Sabrang?" - Hold on a second.

262
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,117
- Something isn't right. - That's...

263
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,147
- There isn't bieup whatsoever. - Seriously.

264
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:40,647
Besides, don't you like Shrimp Crackers?

265
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,086
I don't eat it often.

266
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,287
(She doesn't know much about snacks.)

267
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:44,686
We can't keep this up.

268
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:46,856
- It was the first round. - I'm disappointed in you.

269
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:48,556
- Shall we let you off? - It was the first round.

270
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:49,596
- It's okay. - Thank you.

271
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,026
- Please apologize. - I'm sorry.

272
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:52,366
- All right. - My goodness.

273
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:53,566
- I'm disappointed. - I'm sorry.

274
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,166
- Right now... - Do we need to take out a dish?

275
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,196
Yes.

276
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:57,436
- Then... - Let's take out the fruits.

277
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,136
- Let's do that. Okay. - Hold on a second.

278
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:00,667
- I personally think it should be... - Okay.

279
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:02,576
- the croissant egg sandwiches. - Me too.

280
00:09:02,577 --> 00:09:05,107
- You can eat them in Korea. - That's right.

281
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:07,347
- That's right. - Hold on.

282
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:09,176
The strongest candidates are...

283
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:11,047
the fruit platter and the croissant egg sandwiches.

284
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,047
- I really want the fruits. - You want the fruits.

285
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,517
Let's take out the croissant sandwiches.

286
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,257
- They'll be refreshing. - Croissant sandwiches? Wait.

287
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:17,817
But they're egg sandwiches.

288
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,226
- What about it? - They're tasty and fluffy.

289
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,157
- Do you want them? - Not really.

290
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:23,356
We'll take out the egg sandwiches.

291
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:24,797
(She follows the popular opinion.)

292
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,867
- The egg sandwiches? - Okay.

293
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:29,297
(They decide to take out the egg sandwiches.)

294
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,136
- Let's do our absolute best. - I'll eat them.

295
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,037
(The egg sandwiches go to Producer Na.)

296
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,976
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

297
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:36,176
- E-cade! - E-cade!

298
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:37,476
- Hold on a second. - If you make a mistake...

299
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,507
Let's see how they taste.

300
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:40,706
- What? - Why...

301
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:42,077
- are you eating them? - Will you eat the dishes we lose?

302
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:45,187
Once you lose the dishes, they don't belong to anyone.

303
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:46,747
Why did you become so cheeky?

304
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,487
I just wanted to taste them.

305
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,017
(The dish gets confiscated.)

306
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:51,586
Producer Na.

307
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:53,427
Since when was E-cade...

308
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,257
so unfair?

309
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:58,027
Since when did you eat while we played games?

310
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,567
Seriously.

311
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:02,497
- Just make up the snacks. - Okay.

312
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:04,536
The snack category is over.

313
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,666
Is it over?

314
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,637
Here comes the second category.

315
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,177
The snack category might come back.

316
00:10:09,637 --> 00:10:11,176
This one will be hard.

317
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,176
- Our spirits are down right now. - This one will be hard.

318
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,047
- I'm not feeling victorious. - Don't intimidate us like that.

319
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:16,546
- I'll show you the category. - Okay.

320
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:17,977
It's big this time.

321
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:20,146
- Winter. - Winter.

322
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:21,216
- Winter? - Okay.

323
00:10:21,217 --> 00:10:22,217
- Winter? - It's a success...

324
00:10:22,218 --> 00:10:23,887
- if your answer is related. - Okay.

325
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:25,626
It's my turn, right?

326
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:26,656
(Siot, Kieuk)

327
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:27,986
- One, two, three. - Ski.

328
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:29,157
Correct.

329
00:10:29,757 --> 00:10:30,826
(Kieuk, rieul, siot, mieum, siot)

330
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:32,166
- One, two, three. - Christmas.

331
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,366
- Correct. - You're so smart.

332
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:34,566
- Girls, what am I going to do? - You're the brain.

333
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,637
- You got this. - What am I going to do?

334
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:37,536
(Giyeok, digeut, rieul)

335
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,866
- One, two, three. - Icicle.

336
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,067
- Eun Ji. - Correct.

337
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:41,576
(She succeeds in making up for herself.)

338
00:10:41,577 --> 00:10:43,537
- Eun Ji, you're too kind. - Seriously.

339
00:10:43,807 --> 00:10:45,006
- One, two, three. - Snowman.

340
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:46,046
- Correct. - Eun Ji.

341
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:47,107
It's my turn again.

342
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,946
- One, two, three. - Gogogomo?

343
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:50,017
Wrong.

344
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:51,476
- Gogogomo? - Wrong.

345
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:52,687
(Gogogomo?)

346
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:54,746
- Eun Ji. - What's the answer?

347
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:57,116
- Roasted sweet potato. - Roasted sweet potato.

348
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:59,327
It's understandable. I got confused too.

349
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:01,057
- It was a difficult one. - Gosh.

350
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:04,796
Gogogomo. Aunt.

351
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,626
- Great-great-great aunt, right? - Aunt.

352
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:07,627
- That's "Gogogomo." - Yes.

353
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:09,596
Great-great-great aunt is...

354
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:10,737
- "Gogogomo." - Since it's winter...

355
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,166
- Gogogomo. - A very great aunt.

356
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,166
- Yes. A big aunt. - A big aunt.

357
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,807
Eun Ji, let's take out the fruit platter this time.

358
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:17,737
(No.)

359
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,947
- How about the cheese platter? - Let's take it out.

360
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:21,546
I won't eat it.

361
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,017
(The cheese platter is out.)

362
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:24,176
Let's shout "E-cade."

363
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:25,446
- We need to win. Set, go. - Set, go.

364
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:26,887
- E-cade! - E-cade!

365
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,486
Eun Ji, I have a tip.

366
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:30,886
It's easier if you empty your head.

367
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:31,956
- Is it better to do that? - Without any willpower,

368
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,427
go with what you see.

369
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,126
- Okay. - Go with what you see.

370
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,196
- Like "Gogogomo." - Go with what you see.

371
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,827
- Let's see the category. - Here it comes.

372
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,466
- It's summer. - Okay.

373
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,066
- Summer. - It's okay...

374
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,266
- as long as it's related to summer. - Okay.

375
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:44,267
Okay.

376
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:45,806
- It needs to be related to summer. - Kim Mi Hyun.

377
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:47,436
- Kim Mi Hyun is related to summer. - Kim Mi Hyun is related to summer.

378
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:48,437
(The summer idol, Kim Mi Hyun)

379
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:50,836
One, two, three.

380
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:51,847
Mongolia.

381
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:53,606
- It's perfect. - You go to Mongolia in the summer.

382
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:54,807
- You go there in the summer. - You go to Mongolia in the summer.

383
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:56,876
- It's perfect. - You go to Mongolia in the summer.

384
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:58,286
- You go there in the summer. - It's perfect.

385
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,187
- You go to Mongolia in the summer. - Seriously.

386
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:01,657
- I'm serious. - Summer is the time to visit.

387
00:12:01,717 --> 00:12:02,756
Seriously.

388
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:04,057
You go to Mongolia in the summer.

389
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,687
- Summer is the time to visit. - You really do that.

390
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,927
Seriously. Even the bird agrees.

391
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:10,156
- Even the bird agrees. - Who?

392
00:12:10,157 --> 00:12:11,157
That bird.

393
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:12,827
- You go to Mongolia in the summer. - It's true.

394
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:15,036
Summer. Listen.

395
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:16,066
If you type in "Mongolia,"

396
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,196
you'll get "Summer..."

397
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:18,307
- as a related keyword. - Seriously.

398
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,207
(If you type in "Mongolia,")

399
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,507
(you don't get "Summer" as a related keyword.)

400
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:23,677
Producer.

401
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:25,546
When you think of Mongolia, do you think of winter,

402
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:27,146
autumn, or spring?

403
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,747
- I think of winter. - You think of summer.

404
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:30,147
Summer is the season that suits Mongolia.

405
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,986
Why winter? Not many people visit Mongolia...

406
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:33,816
in winter since it's off-season.

407
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:35,717
- It's warm in Mongolia. - Let's move on.

408
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:37,156
(They quickly wrap up the issue.)

409
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,886
Let's move on. That'll be the right thing to do.

410
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:40,927
Are you from the Game Committee or something?

411
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:42,096
I'll accept your answer...

412
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:43,856
- since there's summer in Mongolia. - There's summer in Mongolia.

413
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:45,397
- Okay. Let's move on. - Thank you.

414
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,126
- It's related. - Thank you.

415
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:49,537
- Well done. - I looked at the latter initials.

416
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:50,836
You'll definitely get them wrong.

417
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,306
- Okay. Let's go. - Let's resume.

418
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:53,736
What do you think is the original answer?

419
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:54,737
Mango.

420
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,606
- Mango. That's one. - Mango.

421
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,006
- Mango is a summer fruit. - What's the original answer?

422
00:12:58,007 --> 00:12:59,046
- Mosquito is a possible answer. - Catfish.

423
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,146
- Mosquito. Catfish. - Mango works too.

424
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,176
- Mango is a summer fruit. - Mosquito.

425
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:02,376
- It's a summer fruit. - That's how it goes.

426
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:04,117
- Yu Jin will go right away. - An Yu Jin.

427
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:05,416
- Yu Jin. - You'll go right away.

428
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,116
- Yu Jin. - Yu Jin, are you ready?

429
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:08,287
- Yes. - Let's begin.

430
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:10,617
- One, two, three. - Sweat.

431
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,227
- Correct. - I thought of "Poop."

432
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:13,726
- Sweat. - Correct.

433
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,356
I thought of "Poop."

434
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:16,396
(She's An Genius.)

435
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:19,326
- I thought of "Poop." - Yu Jin, I'm sorry.

436
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:20,597
My answer was "Poop."

437
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,537
(Up next is Mi Hyun, the woman whose palms turned sweaty.)

438
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:25,107
All right.

439
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:26,407
- One, two, three. - What?

440
00:13:26,408 --> 00:13:27,437
(Siot, bieup)

441
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:32,477
(She shouts out a swear word.)

442
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:35,647
(Which summer-related word has the initials of siot and bieup?)

443
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:37,876
- Wrong. - Watermelon.

444
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:40,147
Mi Hyun.

445
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:41,686
- You did it on purpose, right? - You did it on purpose.

446
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,816
- Mi Hyun. - Seriously.

447
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:44,056
You wanted to create a situation like the three parties, right?

448
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,087
- The three parties. - No.

449
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:46,756
- That was what you wanted, right? - No.

450
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:47,926
- The three parties. - No.

451
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,097
- That was what you wanted, right? - No.

452
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:51,357
You don't even swear on a regular basis.

453
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:53,797
(Shocked)

454
00:13:54,227 --> 00:13:55,666
- It won't get aired, right? - All right.

455
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,466
Yes, it will. It'll get aired.

456
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:58,467
The pronunciation was too...

457
00:13:58,468 --> 00:13:59,806
It was...

458
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:01,807
- quite refreshing. - Yes.

459
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,737
(It was as refreshing as watermelon.)

460
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:05,747
- Let's take out the pizza. - Why?

461
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,246
- Let's take out the pizza. - The one in the back.

462
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,446
(They have another debate on which dish to take out.)

463
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,047
How about the balls? We should take them out.

464
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:12,716
- What are those balls? - I'm curious about the taste.

465
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:13,746
- We haven't had the dish. - This one?

466
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:15,186
Why are you touching it?

467
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,457
- What are you doing? - Hold on.

468
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,526
(What happened...)

469
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:22,097
(just now?)

470
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:24,257
(Producer Na's second barbarity)

471
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:27,267
(He puts the food in his mouth.)

472
00:14:27,497 --> 00:14:29,897
- What are you doing? - Hold on.

473
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:32,966
What are you doing? We were going to eat it!

474
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:35,137
- We could've eaten it! - Hold on.

475
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:37,207
You said you'd take it out.

476
00:14:37,437 --> 00:14:38,906
(Weren't you going to take it out?)

477
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:40,076
- Hey. - We could've eaten it!

478
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:41,476
There's pistachio inside.

479
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:43,117
- What was that? - No?

480
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:44,577
He touched it with his hands.

481
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:46,486
Young Ji, shouldn't he leave the show?

482
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:47,846
I'm sorry,

483
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:49,516
- but what was that? - He should leave the show.

484
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:51,586
- Producer Na. - You said you'd take it out.

485
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:54,257
- You said you'd take it out. - Are you starved these days?

486
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:56,356
Producer Park always steal our ramyeon.

487
00:14:56,357 --> 00:14:57,826
He stole our steak one time.

488
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:58,827
That's right.

489
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,466
- You said you'd take it out. - No.

490
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,966
- We were thinking. - We never said that.

491
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,366
- That's right. - We were talking about the taste.

492
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,137
We were talking about the taste. It's time for VAR. VCR.

493
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:07,666
(According to VAR, they never said that they'd take it out.)

494
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,836
It's a taste I haven't had before.

495
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:10,706
- That's right. I want to try it. - Fried balls.

496
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:12,176
It's tasty.

497
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,446
It isn't sweet like a donut.

498
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,546
- It's savory. - I want to try the dish.

499
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,016
- It's tasty. - How about the pasta cheese ball?

500
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,716
- The pasta cheese ball. - Let's take it out.

501
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:19,846
We'll take out the pasta cheese ball.

502
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:21,447
(The pasta cheese ball is out.)

503
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:23,186
Hold on a second.

504
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,916
So are we just going to excuse Producer Na...

505
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,157
- for eating the food? - Personally speaking...

506
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:28,287
Personally speaking, I can't excuse such behavior.

507
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:30,156
To be honest...

508
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:31,726
They said they'd take it out.

509
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:33,566
- Listen. - Even if we did,

510
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,966
it shouldn't have gone straight to your mouth.

511
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,097
Let's do this then.

512
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,466
Consider it...

513
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:41,037
when we want a one-way ticket.

514
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:43,377
You ate so suddenly.

515
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,806
- Why did you eat it? - It was so sudden.

516
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:46,047
Producer Na.

517
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:47,907
You can give us a laptop.

518
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:49,777
- What? - Give us a laptop.

519
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,517
(Laughing)

520
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:54,017
A laptop for a single ball.

521
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,387
Later on...

522
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:59,656
Later on, I'll give back one dish of your choice.

523
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:00,686
- Okay. - All right.

524
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:02,027
- Okay. - Let's agree on that.

525
00:16:02,257 --> 00:16:04,396
But make sure this never happens again.

526
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,066
- I'm sorry. - Please be careful.

527
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,427
(He sincerely apologizes.)

528
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:09,166
- Okay. - Give us the category.

529
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,297
- Apparently, it's tasty. - Here comes the category.

530
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:14,136
- Animal. - Not bad.

531
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:15,506
- It's a good one. - We can't get it wrong.

532
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,736
We can't get it wrong when it's an animal.

533
00:16:16,737 --> 00:16:17,737
(The category of Round 4: Animal)

534
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:19,046
We can't get it wrong when it's an animal.

535
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,246
Let's just hope that we don't get an armadillo.

536
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,407
(Which questions will they get this time?)

537
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:23,176
(Siot, jieut)

538
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:24,376
- One, two, three. - Lion.

539
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:25,617
- Correct. - That was easy.

540
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:27,017
One, two, three.

541
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:28,268
We can't get it wrong when it's an animal.

542
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:29,597
Let's just hope that we don't get an armadillo.

543
00:16:29,598 --> 00:16:30,668

- One, two, three. - Cute.

547
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:38,477
- I had the same thought. - Wrong.

548
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:39,748
- Cute. - I had the same thought.

549
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:41,178
(I had the same thought.)

550
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:43,418
(Cute)

551
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:45,047
(I had the same thought.)

552
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:46,087
Wrong.

553
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,718
What's the answer? Cat.

554
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:49,288
- Cat. - Hold on.

555
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:51,057
Hold on. Objection.

556
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:52,127
- Objection. - Animal.

557
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:53,757
What comes to mind when you see a dog?

558
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:54,788
- It's cute. - It's cute.

559
00:16:55,058 --> 00:16:56,157
When you see an animal,

560
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,257
- You're right. - it's cute.

561
00:16:57,258 --> 00:16:58,827
- You're right. You have a point. - It's related.

562
00:16:58,828 --> 00:16:59,967
You have a point.

563
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:01,027
- It's related. - She has a point.

564
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:02,437
Her answer really is related.

565
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,668
- Cute. - It should be an animal name.

566
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,737
- You never said that. - You never said that.

567
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:08,238
You told us to give a related word from the initials.

568
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:10,377
- It just says "Animal." - It just says "Animal."

569
00:17:10,378 --> 00:17:11,538
- You told us to do that. - Yes.

570
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:13,377
We'll give an animal name from now on.

571
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:14,478
You have a point.

572
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:16,377
(Adding supportive remarks)

573
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:17,648
You have a point.

574
00:17:17,848 --> 00:17:20,517
- Let's say you're lost in Africa. - Okay.

575
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:21,787
- Okay. - You meet a hungry lion.

576
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:23,217
The lion approaches you.

577
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,218
- Cute. - Cute.

578
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,988
(Cuteness for survival)

579
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:30,157
A lion's fangs are so cute.

580
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:31,897
- The dental plaque is cute. - Cute.

581
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:33,297
Its fur is cute.

582
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:34,898
- A lion's dental plaque is cute. - It's cute.

583
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:36,998
- Cute. - I think Yu Jin has a point.

584
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,768
- Right? That's what I think. - An animal makes you think that.

585
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:42,478
- Then forget that I ate a piece. - Okay.

586
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,938
Then say "Correct" with enthusiasm.

587
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:47,008
(Hesitant)

588
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,247
- Correct. - Correct.

589
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:49,248
- Okay. - "Cute" is correct.
- Nice. - By the way...

590
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:51,817
(Satisfied)

591
00:17:51,818 --> 00:17:52,848
- Nice. - By the way...

592
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:55,788
By the way, since when did we fight all the time?

593
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:58,687
I suddenly had that thought.

594
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,488
I don't know when it started, but I want to beat you guys.

595
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,257
I want to beat you guys.

596
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:03,398
- Since when... - Mi Hyun.

597
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:05,357
- Keep up with your pace. - This is driving me crazy.

598
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:06,568
- I'm so bad at this game. - Be confident.

599
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,668
- It's Mimi's turn. - Okay.

600
00:18:08,368 --> 00:18:09,398
The category is animal.

601
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:11,667
- One, two, three. - Chipmunk.

602
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,268
- Correct. - Hey.

603
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:15,007
My answer was "Bellflower root."

604
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:17,407
- Hey. - My goodness, you did so well.

605
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:18,777
- Well done. - I did well, right?

606
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:20,307
- Girls, I haven't gone yet. - That was incredible.

607
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,747
- One, two, three. - Tiger.

608
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:23,347
- Correct. - I love tigers.

609
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:25,077
- One, two, three. - Arang?

610
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:26,818
- Wrong. - Duck?

611
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:29,658
- What's that? - Duck?

612
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:31,558
- Duck? - I see. Duck.

613
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:33,888
Duck? Is it duck?

614
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:35,288
Is a duck an animal?

615
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:38,458
Excuse me?

616
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:40,298
- Come on. - Duck.
(Hold on a second.)

617
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:43,098
(She has no idea.)

618
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:46,168
- Is a duck an animal? - What else would it be?

619
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:48,237
Tell us what a duck is.

620
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:49,238
(The younger member is shocked once more.)

621
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,037
Wouldn't there be an animal called Arang?

622
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,807
- No. - My friend's name is A Rang.

623
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:54,878
She becomes a dog when she's wasted.

624
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:58,448
My friend's name is Cho A Rang.

625
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:00,248
(The Turkish sausage and eggs are out.)

626
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:01,987
The one who is good at this game should come here.

627
00:19:01,988 --> 00:19:03,288
- This spot is more intense. - Hold on.

628
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:05,518
I can do well. Believe in me.

629
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:06,728
This spot is more intense.

630
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:08,187
- Is Mimi number one? - Yes.

631
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,958
- It'll be better. - That spot is...

632
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:12,768
- The category. - I'll reveal the category first.

633
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:14,868
- Chinese food. Nice. - Chinese food.

634
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:16,638
- We'll get basi. - Hello.

635
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:18,397
- Chinese food. - Good.

636
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:19,738
- Let's go. - Let's begin.

637
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,538
Mimi will go first.

638
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:24,707
(Ssang giyeok, pieup, giyeol)

639
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,977
- One, two, three. - Kkanpunggi.

640
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:26,978
- Correct. - Nice.

641
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:28,507
- Go slowly. Well done. - One, two, three.

642
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:29,817
- Mala xiang guo. - Correct.

643
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:30,877
Well done.

644
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,178
- One, two, three. - Japchae rice.

645
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:33,948
- Correct. - You did a great job.

646
00:19:34,388 --> 00:19:35,757
- One, two, three. - Jjajangmyeon.

647
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:36,758
Correct.

648
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,058
(They pass the halfway point for the first time in a while.)

649
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:41,588
- One, two, three. - Kimono?

650
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:43,928
- Wrong. - My goodness.

651
00:19:44,898 --> 00:19:48,267
- I'm sorry. - Fried dumpling.

652
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:49,268
I'm so sorry.

653
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:50,598
"Kimono?"

654
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:53,107
- I'm so sorry. It was funny. - The initials were wrong too.

655
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,467
The initials were giyeok, mieum, and digeut.

656
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:55,677
- It was funny. - What?

657
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:57,507
I'm really sorry,

658
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:58,837
but digeut looks like mieum...

659
00:19:58,838 --> 00:19:59,907
because of the sun.

660
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,247
That's right.

661
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:02,547
- Take that into consideration. - That's right.

662
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:03,917
- That's right. - There's the sunlight issue.

663
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:06,188
Then I'll say "Wrong" with a hint of disappointment.

664
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:09,918
Wrong.

665
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:11,857
- Must you play... - What was that?

666
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:13,858
Hold on. Must you play dirty like that?

667
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,757
- I was just disappointed. - Let's take off our tops...

668
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:17,158
and have a fistfight.

669
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:20,167
(His cheekiness makes them shudder.)

670
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:21,267
Please let me off this once. I'm sorry.

671
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:22,738
- Why did he become so cheeky? - I'm sorry.

672
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:23,867
We understand. Let's give each other a hug.

673
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,337
- Seriously. - Let's give each other a hug.

674
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:26,467
- We understand. - Okay.

675
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:28,568
(The zaatar flatbread is out.)

676
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,107
We still have the hummus and shakshouka.

677
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:32,477
- Yes. - It's okay. We can do this.

678
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:34,078
But we really need to eat now.

679
00:20:34,748 --> 00:20:36,247
It became deflated, right?

680
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:39,147
That's right. It became deflated.

681
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:41,388
(Tawook became deflated.)

682
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:44,017
Mimi has an advantage with the next category.

683
00:20:44,018 --> 00:20:45,018
- Dessert? - Ice cream?

684
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:46,027
- Ice cream. - Okay.

685
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:47,087
I don't know much about it.

686
00:20:47,088 --> 00:20:48,927
- Eun Ji, just get one right. - You can do it.

687
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:50,457
- Dessert. - Shall we begin?

688
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,558
- You know more than me. - Mimi will go first.

689
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,368
You can do it.

690
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:55,667
- One, two, three. - B B Big.

691
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:56,668
Correct.

692
00:20:57,938 --> 00:20:59,167
- One, two, three. - Nougat Bar.

693
00:20:59,168 --> 00:21:00,908
- Correct. - You can do it.

694
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:02,908
- One, two, three. - Snow Ice Milk Shake.

695
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,008
Correct.

696
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:05,947
(She gets a difficult one again.)

697
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:07,477
Well done.

698
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:08,478
- All right. - Well done.

699
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,878
- Girls. - Eun Ji.

700
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:13,917
- One, two, three. - What should I do?

701
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:16,217
- Wrong. - What's that?

702
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:17,857
- "What should I do?" - What is it? What should I do?

703
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,228
- What should I do? - Udanka?

704
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:20,428
What's the answer?

705
00:21:20,728 --> 00:21:21,728
(Ieung, digeut, kieuk)

706
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:23,227
(Viewers, take a guess.)

707
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,027
- Udanka? - What's the answer?

708
00:21:25,028 --> 00:21:26,028
- Odolka? - What is it?

709
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,368
- What should I do? - Eoldongka?

710
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:30,068
Eoldotcom?

711
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:31,898
I know! World Cup.

712
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:34,768
- World Cone. - World Cone.

713
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:36,778
World Cup is a bit old.

714
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:39,307
- It's World Cone. - World Cone.

715
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:40,308
(A sincere apology)

716
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:41,908
(Ful medames is out.)

717
00:21:42,248 --> 00:21:44,278
Eun Ji, we don't have much food left.

718
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:45,378
- Eun Ji. - Seriously.

719
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:46,917
- It isn't too bad. - You have enough food.

720
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:48,248
How did we lose so much food?

721
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:50,388
Eun Ji, open your eyes wide.

722
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,357
Empty your mind. Sports.

723
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:53,387
- Okay. Nice. - Okay.

724
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:54,388
- Sports. - Shall we go in this direction?

725
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:55,528
- Go in this direction. - Okay.

726
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:57,158
- Let's begin. - Don't get excited.

727
00:21:58,598 --> 00:21:59,697
- One, two, three. - Soccer.

728
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:01,498
- Correct. - I'll put my mind at ease.

729
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:02,967
- One, two, three. - Volleyball.

730
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:03,968
Correct.

731
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,437
- One, two, three. - Basketball.

732
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:08,567
- Correct. - It's too easy. Hold on. I...

733
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:09,807
- One, two, three. - Baseball.

734
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:10,808
Correct.

735
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:13,308
- One, two, three. - Clap.

736
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:14,578
Wrong.

737
00:22:15,478 --> 00:22:17,278
Why? "Clap" is related to sports.

738
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:18,948
You clap for sports.

739
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:20,418
Clapping is a sport.

740
00:22:20,748 --> 00:22:22,458
Seriously. Clapping is a sport.

741
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:26,188
- Don't you know this exercise? - Listen.

742
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,887
Raise your hand if you think clapping is a sport.

743
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:29,897
- Me. - Seriously.

744
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:31,258
- Honestly... - It makes sense.

745
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,267
- I'm sorry, but... - Seriously.

746
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,368
Which part of the body does clapping improve?

747
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:37,467
- It improves circulation. - Circulation.

748
00:22:37,468 --> 00:22:38,768
It opens up your diaphragm.

749
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:41,468
It makes your cochlea move. I'm serious.

750
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:43,737
When you go to a mineral spring, middle-aged men do this.

751
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,538
- That's right. - A mineral spring.

752
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:47,377
- They clap. - That's right.

753
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:48,477
They do that.

754
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:51,178
In that case, I'll count it as correct.

755
00:22:51,978 --> 00:22:54,018
What's the original answer?

756
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:56,157
- It's "Clap." - It's "Clap."

757
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:57,158
- That's the original answer. - Right?

758
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:59,157
- "Clap" is the original answer. - Yes.

759
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:00,857
- It's "Clap." - That's the correct answer.

760
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:02,457
- Let's resume. Young Ji is up. - Get ready.

761
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:03,458
(They'll resume with Young Ji.)
Young Ji is up.

762
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:07,197
- One, two, three. - You evade it like this.

763
00:23:07,198 --> 00:23:08,198
Wrong!

764
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:10,598
(Ready to cover for her)

765
00:23:11,198 --> 00:23:13,337
(The second crisis came too soon.)

766
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,307
It could be a sport to evade the ball.

767
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:17,108
In dodgeball, you evade the ball.

768
00:23:17,478 --> 00:23:18,777
You evade it like this.

769
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:19,778
- You evade it like this. - Evasion.

770
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:20,878
Think about it.

771
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:22,077
- That's right. - Please demonstrate...

772
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:23,817
- what kind of sport it is. - What? Watch.

773
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:25,077
Is it dodgeball? What is it, Young Ji?

774
00:23:25,078 --> 00:23:26,087
- Is it dodgeball? - It's dodgeball.

775
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:27,448
- Let's go. - Dodgeball.

776
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:29,257
- Here comes the ball. - Evasion.

777
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:30,258
There you go.

778
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:32,287
(Evasion)

779
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:34,257
And... No, receive the ball.

780
00:23:34,258 --> 00:23:36,098
(Preparing for evasion)

781
00:23:36,758 --> 00:23:38,598
- Evasion. - There you go. See?

782
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:39,768
- This is... - Throw it.

783
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:42,097
Evasion.

784
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:44,367
- Yes. It totally is a sport. - It's a sport.

785
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:46,167
- Evasion is a sport. - Start over.

786
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:47,267
- Seriously. - Totally.

787
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:48,268
Let her try again.

788
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:50,278
(Laughing)

789
00:23:50,478 --> 00:23:53,248
(The E-cade demonstrated the evasion sport with desperation.)

790
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:54,548
If Young Ji gets it right...

791
00:23:54,648 --> 00:23:56,677
- Young Ji needs to get it right. - Okay.

792
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:59,078
- All right. - It's a makeup test. Let's begin.

793
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:02,218
(It all depends on Young Ji!)

794
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:04,288
- A makeup test. - Wait. Let me channel Yang Hee Eun.

795
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:06,457
(She needs Yang Hee Eun's energy.)

796
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,458
Here comes a makeup test.

797
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:09,628
- One, two, three. - Wrestling.

798
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,598
You did an amazing job, my baby.

799
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:16,367
- You did an amazing job. - You evaded it.

800
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:17,598
- You evaded it. - Well done.

801
00:24:17,698 --> 00:24:19,067
- I evaded it. - You evaded it.

802
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:20,568
- I evaded it. - It's an evasion in the end.

803
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:23,437
Mimi. Kim Mi Hyun.

804
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:24,477
- Kim Mi Hyun. - Please.

805
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:25,837
- Please. - We're in your care.

806
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:26,848
I'll get ready to eat.

807
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:30,247
- In that case... - Please.

808
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:31,248
(They put a lot of thought into the last question.)

809
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:34,288
(I need to succeed in this in order to eat!)

810
00:24:34,948 --> 00:24:36,588
- It's the last one. - Let's go.

811
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,218
- One, two, three. - Swimming.

812
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,228
(Screaming)

813
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:45,528
She recently began swimming.

814
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:46,898
Seriously.

815
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:49,197
(She succeeded in evading a crisis through swimming.)

816
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,837
- E-cade! - Clap.

817
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:52,237
- E-cade! - E-cade!

818
00:24:52,238 --> 00:24:53,667
- E-cade! - Evade and clap!

819
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:56,337
- Evade and clap! - Evade and clap!

820
00:24:56,338 --> 00:24:57,377
Show us the evasion sport again.

821
00:24:57,378 --> 00:24:59,138
We'll do it as a ceremony.

822
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:01,277
- Three times in a row. - Three times in a row.

823
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:02,577
- I'll go first. - Okay.

824
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:04,018
- One, two, three. - Evasion.

825
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:06,088
- One, two, three. - Evasion.

826
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:07,748
- One, two, three. - Evasion.

827
00:25:07,848 --> 00:25:09,357
Okay. It was perfect.

828
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:11,017
(The triple evasion ceremony ends.)

829
00:25:11,018 --> 00:25:12,018
All right.

830
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:14,788
Do you have any other answer that isn't "Evasion?"

831
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:17,428
Golf. That's insane.

832
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:19,427
- How about "Clap?" - How about "Clap?"

833
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:20,498
Bobsleigh?

834
00:25:20,698 --> 00:25:22,167
- Boxing. - Boxing.

835
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:23,268
(Original answer: Boxing)

836
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:25,698
(Thus, the remaining dishes from the royal set)

837
00:25:28,468 --> 00:25:31,038
(A total of 10 dishes survives.)

838
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:32,378
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

839
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:34,678
- Greek yogurt. - All right.

840
00:25:35,108 --> 00:25:36,118
It stretches out.

841
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:39,177
The expert, Mimi should take the first bite.

842
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:40,188
Okay.

843
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:43,117
- It's honey. Young Ji, pour it. - Okay.

844
00:25:43,118 --> 00:25:45,758
(They pour a generous amount of syrup.)

845
00:25:45,888 --> 00:25:47,058
This is incredible.

846
00:25:47,158 --> 00:25:48,357
- Why? Do you get a good feeling? - It's quite full inside.

847
00:25:48,358 --> 00:25:49,927
- Mimi. - Look inside.

848
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:50,928
All right.

849
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:53,928
Thank you for the food. I'll begin eating.

850
00:25:55,198 --> 00:25:56,198
How is it?

851
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,197
(My goodness)

852
00:25:59,198 --> 00:26:00,207
Is it tasty?

853
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,407
(It tastes great.)

854
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:02,637
What's this?

855
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:04,007
You eat it with coffee.

856
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:05,808
(It suits the taste of the sweets enthusiast.)

857
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:08,548
(It's no wonder Torong ate it.)

858
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:10,018
Shall we open the top?

859
00:26:10,478 --> 00:26:11,547
Let's open it.

860
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:12,947
(Tawook is a dish that's a combination...)

861
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:14,418
(of the cream sauce and grilled chicken.)

862
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:18,057
Middle Eastern food is nice.

863
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:19,088
It's so tasty. Eun Ji.

864
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,627
- Eat it like this. - It tastes like both curry...

865
00:26:20,628 --> 00:26:21,628
- and cream. - Yes.

866
00:26:22,158 --> 00:26:23,728
(Eun Ji takes a bite of tawook as well.)

867
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:26,398
(My goodness)

868
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:29,267
It's creamy and savory.

869
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:31,738
It's well-cooked. It's tender.

870
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:35,138
It's the real deal.

871
00:26:36,938 --> 00:26:39,478
(It's tasty in a straightforward way.)

872
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:42,148
Mimi.

873
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:43,878
That one?

874
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:47,448
(Mimi takes a bite of tawook.)

875
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,248
(Impressed)

876
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:52,657
(The taste makes her clap.)

877
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:54,527
- It's nice. - Is the bread tasty?

878
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:56,298
- Seriously. - Young Ji.

879
00:26:57,358 --> 00:26:58,358
Young Ji.

880
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,367
(Her mouth shows how much she likes the food.)

881
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:00,727
It's a taste you can't evade.

882
00:27:00,728 --> 00:27:02,268
(It's a taste you can't evade.)

883
00:27:02,628 --> 00:27:04,638
This one is our absolute favorite.

884
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:06,467
- Tawook. - Tawook?

885
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:07,808
(The E-cade members' favorite, tawook)

886
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:11,538
(She eats Arabic bread and shakshouka together.)

887
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:14,607
- Shakshouka is tasty. - Eun Ji.

888
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:16,348
- Eun Ji, it's amazing. - Yes.

889
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,277
- It's different from hummus... - Eun Ji.

890
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:19,648
- I had in Korea. - This one is really tasty too.

891
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,888
I should try it.

892
00:27:24,858 --> 00:27:27,688
(The dance that comes out when something is tasty)

893
00:27:28,058 --> 00:27:29,727
I think we'll play the games well today.

894
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:31,257
We're off to a good start. It rained.

895
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:32,298
The initial quiz was hard.

896
00:27:32,428 --> 00:27:34,398
- Me too. Wasn't it so hard? - But you were good at it.

897
00:27:34,698 --> 00:27:36,167
Mimi, what are you doing?

898
00:27:36,168 --> 00:27:37,998
I'm buying an e-SIM.

899
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,107
You can buy those...

900
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:42,267
- through an app? - Yes.

901
00:27:42,268 --> 00:27:44,007
- You know how we used to use cards? - Yes.

902
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:46,547
You choose the country you're traveling to, like this.

903
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:47,548
Yes.

904
00:27:47,908 --> 00:27:49,978
- Then you select how many days. - Gosh.

905
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:51,747
And you click "purchase."

906
00:27:51,748 --> 00:27:53,017
- That's so simple. - Amazing, right?

907
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:54,917
- And then... - Yes.

908
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:57,117
(Cellular)

909
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:58,218
(Cellular settings)

910
00:27:58,458 --> 00:27:59,587
- you click this. - Okay.

911
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:00,657
Is this it?

912
00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:02,587
If you scan the QR code, it will work right away.

913
00:28:02,588 --> 00:28:03,627
(Scan the QR code)

914
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:05,427
(Activate eSIM)

915
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:06,668
This is it. Click "continue."

916
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:08,028
It's complete.

917
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:09,838
Try accessing Safari.

918
00:28:09,998 --> 00:28:11,567
- Got it. - Okay.

919
00:28:11,568 --> 00:28:12,568
Does it work?

920
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,908
- It's loading really fast. - Gosh, it's fast.

921
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:18,507
This is so convenient.

922
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,348
We'll be able to go anywhere with this.

923
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:23,047
(Thanks to eSIM, they're ready to travel.)

924
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:24,048
All done.

925
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:25,478
(On the move)

926
00:28:25,718 --> 00:28:27,687
- Did you all enjoy brunch? - Yes.

927
00:28:27,688 --> 00:28:30,357
- I'm full. - Why are we here,

928
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:31,417
Agent Young Ji?

929
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,228
A rabbit...

930
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:34,828
stole the corporate card...

931
00:28:34,928 --> 00:28:36,528
to live happily ever after with the laptop.

932
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:38,257
- Right. - The information is...

933
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,168
- very fragmented. - Right? It's fragmented.

934
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:43,337
- It's not connected. - No.

935
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:44,937
We're here to catch Torong.

936
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:47,407
But like I told you, our strength lies in...

937
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:50,238
our collaboration with Agent F, the branch manager of...

938
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:52,807
the Jade Emperor's Abu Dhabi branch.

939
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:54,308
When can we meet Agent F?

940
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:56,447
- I want to meet Agent F. - We're on our way to meet Agent F.

941
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,478
- Sounds good. - Right now?

942
00:28:57,578 --> 00:28:59,218
- Right now? - Agent F...

943
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,347
runs an accommodation and training center...

944
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:02,418
Really?

945
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:04,417
for spies in the middle of the desert.

946
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:05,858
Goodness. A training center?

947
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:08,627
It's full of top-notch facilities.

948
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:09,658
- Goodness. - Gosh.

949
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:11,397
- Abu Dhabi is... - I have a question.

950
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:13,498
I know that our training must be Random Play Dance.

951
00:29:13,698 --> 00:29:14,997
Is the training center...

952
00:29:14,998 --> 00:29:16,597
well-equipped for Random Play Dance?

953
00:29:16,598 --> 00:29:18,437
Do spies do Random Play Dance?

954
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:19,537
Right. It's important.

955
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:21,237
- We have to train for it. - We don't have other capabilities.

956
00:29:21,238 --> 00:29:22,337
- Good speakers. - We're conducting...

957
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:23,707
various training programs for you.

958
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,377
Vocabulary training,

959
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:26,507
Yes, the initial quiz.

960
00:29:26,508 --> 00:29:27,877
- dance training, - Yes.

961
00:29:27,878 --> 00:29:29,077
and music training. Things like that.

962
00:29:29,078 --> 00:29:30,317
All of those are...

963
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:31,417
- for waking up our brains. - Right.

964
00:29:31,418 --> 00:29:32,647
- Both left and right sides. - Right.

965
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:34,218
- Before we... - All those training programs...

966
00:29:34,418 --> 00:29:36,088
will be available at one place.

967
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:38,558
It comes with the finest swimming pool and dining too.

968
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,757
- Many things are prepared for you. - Akh.

969
00:29:40,758 --> 00:29:41,758
Akh.

970
00:29:43,498 --> 00:29:47,698
(Covertly located in the endless desert...)

971
00:29:53,108 --> 00:29:54,807
(is the Abu Dhabi branch...)

972
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:56,538
(of the agent training center.)

973
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:58,678
(Courage training)

974
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:00,978
(Camouflage training)

975
00:30:01,678 --> 00:30:05,218
(Underwater training)

976
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:09,658
(The main building and annex are both equipped for various training.)

977
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,728
(The state-of-the-art training center will soon be revealed.)

978
00:30:13,988 --> 00:30:15,557
Can we make song requests right now?

979
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:16,598
Yes.

980
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,398
Song requests.

981
00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:20,868
It's time for song requests. What do you want?

982
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,427
- aespa. - aespa?

983
00:30:22,428 --> 00:30:23,997
(First song: "Whiplash" by aespa)

984
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:25,537
- Beat drop with a... - Big flash.

985
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:26,538
- Focus and... - Think fast.

986
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:28,838
(This has suddenly become a music television program.)

987
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:31,978
(The two older members are now getting into it.)

988
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:35,678
(Meanwhile, Feisty's vocals are already warmed up.)

989
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:37,678
- Whiplash - Whiplash

990
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:39,548
- Whiplash - Whiplash

991
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:41,417
(Mimicking the electronic sound with their mouths is nothing for them.)

992
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:42,418
(Mimicking the electronic sound)

993
00:30:42,648 --> 00:30:43,887
(Second song: "Supernova" by aespa)

994
00:30:43,888 --> 00:30:45,288
(They moved on to the next song.)

995
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:47,227
(Making sounds)

996
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:48,558
(It's as if they were an a cappella group.)

997
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:50,598
(Making sounds)

998
00:30:50,998 --> 00:30:52,657
- Bring the light of a dying star - Bring the light of a dying star

999
00:30:52,658 --> 00:30:55,328
(Look at my universe I've created)

1000
00:30:55,628 --> 00:30:57,368
- Supernova - Supernova

1001
00:30:57,838 --> 00:30:59,237
(They filmed in Seoul, got on a 10-hour flight,)

1002
00:30:59,238 --> 00:31:00,937
(and played games, and they're still full of energy.)

1003
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:03,107
(Amazing)

1004
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:04,778
Su Gyeong, we're taking song requests.

1005
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:06,678
(Su Gyeong is speechless.)

1006
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,707
What? You want me to sing an Aimyon song?

1007
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:15,187
(Saying random Japanese words to a melody)

1008
00:31:15,188 --> 00:31:16,758
Did you just say "tsukidashi?"

1009
00:31:17,388 --> 00:31:18,557
She said "tsukidashi."

1010
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:19,688
(Eun Ji must have been craving sushi.)

1011
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,957
"Within Ten Minutes."

1012
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:23,397
(Third song: "Within 10 Minutes" by Kim Yon Ja)

1013
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:26,697
(They're even playing the song to sing along.)

1014
00:31:26,698 --> 00:31:28,728
All right. Today, E-cade is bringing to you live,

1015
00:31:29,128 --> 00:31:30,238
"Within 10 Minutes."

1016
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,238
(They're all wiggling their bodies to the song in joy.)

1017
00:31:34,508 --> 00:31:35,937
(All right, I'll trust you)

1018
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,637
(Eun Ji is hitting the high note.)

1019
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:40,978
(If you love only me)

1020
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:44,318
(Feisty sings out the lyrics first,)

1021
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:47,048
(and Eun Ja sings right after with an extra nasally voice.)

1022
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:49,187
(They're covering various songs of different genres...)

1023
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:50,718
(with their unbelievable chemistry.)

1024
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:52,187
Since I host a radio program,

1025
00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:54,758
I talk a lot for about four hours each day.

1026
00:31:55,088 --> 00:31:56,528
My throat has never hurt this much.

1027
00:31:58,198 --> 00:31:59,968
This time I want...

1028
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:01,628
(Just dance.)

1029
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:04,598
(The younger members are training the eldest to be strong.)

1030
00:32:05,068 --> 00:32:07,437
The next song will be a Bruno Mars song.

1031
00:32:07,438 --> 00:32:08,438
Nice.

1032
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:11,907
Young Ji doesn't plan on letting us go to sleep.

1033
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:12,978
Of course not.

1034
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:17,148
(Fourth song: "Too Good to Say Goodbye" by Bruno Mars)

1035
00:32:17,618 --> 00:32:20,588
(Yu Jin starts singing her heart out to her favorite song.)

1036
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:22,917
- Ain't nobody gonna love me - Ain't nobody gonna love me

1037
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:26,258
- Like the way you do - Like the way you do

1038
00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:30,927
- Find a love like mine - Find a love like mine

1039
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:32,698
(You)

1040
00:32:32,898 --> 00:32:35,768
(Fifth song: "Die With A Smile" by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars)

1041
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:38,098
(Their emotions are heightened.)

1042
00:32:38,568 --> 00:32:41,908
(They're so excited that it sounds like they're chanting, not singing.)

1043
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:45,007
(Sixth song: "That's What I Like" by Bruno Mars)

1044
00:32:45,008 --> 00:32:46,947
- I got a condo in Manhattan - I got a condo in Manhattan

1045
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:48,647
- Baby girl, what's happening? - Baby girl, what's happening?

1046
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:49,648
(Eun Ji's ad-lib)

1047
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:52,018
(The eldest is doing her best to throw in ad-libs,)

1048
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:55,617
(while the sleepy youngest is humming along to the song.)

1049
00:32:55,618 --> 00:32:56,788
What's the next song?

1050
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:58,018
(Seventh song: "24K Magic" by Bruno Mars)

1051
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,288
(Yu Jin's eyes are closing.)

1052
00:33:01,358 --> 00:33:06,098
(Eun Ji is getting exhausted too.)

1053
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:08,227
Eun Ji is looking out the window.

1054
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:09,228
(Young Ji cuts Yeong Seok off.)

1055
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:13,238
(Please let me get some rest.)

1056
00:33:13,438 --> 00:33:15,307
(Nodding along)

1057
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:16,308
Eun Ji!

1058
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:17,878
(Unenthusiastically clapping along)

1059
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:19,578
Eun Ji! Shake it!

1060
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:22,208
(Mechanically shaking her shoulders)

1061
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:24,717
(Shouting in agony)

1062
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:27,888
Will Eun Ji be able to stop her body from shaking along to this song?

1063
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:32,218
- Morning feeling like - Morning feeling like

1064
00:33:32,258 --> 00:33:34,187
(Eighth song: "Tik Tok" by Kesha)

1065
00:33:34,188 --> 00:33:35,888
(We can't say no to Kesha.)

1066
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:37,597
(I'm talking pedicure on our)

1067
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,758
(Toes!)

1068
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:40,768
(Trying on all our clothes!)

1069
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,868
(Eun Ji's response to Y2K is like reflex.)

1070
00:33:44,168 --> 00:33:45,938
Do you want to get some sleep?

1071
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:47,438
Sing us a lullaby.

1072
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:49,438
- Yes, sing us a lullaby. - I'll sing a lullaby for you.

1073
00:33:50,138 --> 00:33:52,378
(Mama)

1074
00:33:52,578 --> 00:33:54,848
(Why is she suddenly singing "Bohemian Rhapsody?")

1075
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:56,717
How is "Mama, just killed a man..."

1076
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:57,848
a lullaby?

1077
00:33:58,278 --> 00:33:59,848
Woo Jung, what song would you like to hear?

1078
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:01,747
(The Writer King is silent.)

1079
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,788
She's asleep.

1080
00:34:02,988 --> 00:34:04,057
Is Woo Jung asleep?

1081
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:05,958
Woo Jung would rather walk to the accommodation.

1082
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:08,587
(Let me off this bus.)

1083
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,727
Woo Jung would rather walk.

1084
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:10,997
Woo Jung, are you really sleeping?

1085
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:12,127
Then, for Woo Jung, let's sing...

1086
00:34:12,128 --> 00:34:13,767
Sing "Don't Worry" from the drama, "Reply 1988!"

1087
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:15,728
I'll sing it for you.

1088
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:18,968
(She begins singing the theme song of "Black Rubber Shoes.")

1089
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:20,908
No. "Don't Worry" from "Reply 1988."

1090
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:22,367
- "Don't Worry." - "Don't Worry."

1091
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:26,337
(Don't worry.)

1092
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:27,447
You really didn't watch it, did you?

1093
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:28,478
My dear

1094
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,678
(The other members help her out.)

1095
00:34:33,748 --> 00:34:35,917
(With their warmhearted assistance,)

1096
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,288
(Young Ji navigates her way through the song.)

1097
00:34:38,818 --> 00:34:41,587
(Let all of your...)

1098
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:44,697
(painful memories go)

1099
00:34:44,698 --> 00:34:45,728
That was pretty close.

1100
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:47,628
That was pretty close, Young Ji.

1101
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:52,038
(Keep walking toward what's next)

1102
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:54,837
(A future-oriented promise)

1103
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:55,868
Thank you.

1104
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:58,408
(She's not done.)

1105
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:00,947
(My dear)

1106
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:02,477
(Let me make you laugh)

1107
00:35:02,478 --> 00:35:03,718
(Gosh)

1108
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:05,878
(She's making up a song on the spot.)

1109
00:35:06,378 --> 00:35:08,418
(But why does it sound familiar?)

1110
00:35:08,718 --> 00:35:10,187
(Stay a while before you leave)

1111
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:11,318
What is this song?

1112
00:35:12,788 --> 00:35:13,788
It's Jannabi.

1113
00:35:13,789 --> 00:35:15,187
- It's Jannabi's song that goes... - Isn't that a Jannabi song?

1114
00:35:15,188 --> 00:35:17,758
- "My mind is easy to read." - My mind is easy to read

1115
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:22,768
(You can read it through as well)

1116
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:25,498
(Don't worry)

1117
00:35:25,938 --> 00:35:28,068
(At this point, mixing up songs is a talent of hers.)

1118
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:32,978
(Don't Worry For Lovers Who Hesitate)

1119
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:34,948
All of your singing sounded like an end-of-year album.

1120
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:37,778
In about three minutes,

1121
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:39,918
- Are we arriving? - we'll be arriving.

1122
00:35:41,388 --> 00:35:46,018
(The scenery changed during the two hours of vocal training.)

1123
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:47,528
- Gosh, this is amazing. - Gosh.

1124
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:49,558
This is actually insane.

1125
00:35:50,558 --> 00:35:54,128
(This is their first time seeing the desert in person.)

1126
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:56,467
- Slay. - Slay.

1127
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:57,938
You can see it better from this side.

1128
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:01,368
This is insane.

1129
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:03,167
- This is cool. - Amazing.

1130
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:05,707
You'll be getting off at the main gate over there.

1131
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,207
- What? - The agent training center...

1132
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,917
- prepared a car for you. - What?

1133
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:10,918
Really?

1134
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,117
They prepared a car for us?

1135
00:36:12,118 --> 00:36:13,788
We're not being locked away, right?

1136
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:15,088
What's going on?

1137
00:36:15,348 --> 00:36:16,587
This is literally a remote place.

1138
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:17,817
We're here.

1139
00:36:17,818 --> 00:36:18,918
- All right. - Let's go.

1140
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:21,557
- This is really the desert. - The weather's amazing.

1141
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:22,658
The weather's great.

1142
00:36:22,758 --> 00:36:24,527
- Is that our car? - It's so cool.

1143
00:36:24,528 --> 00:36:26,867
- That must be our car. Gosh. - Those cars are so fun.

1144
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:28,427
- Hello. - I've never been in that before.

1145
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:29,468
Marhaba!

1146
00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:32,298
Look up at the sky. Let's say, "E-cade." One, two, three.

1147
00:36:32,368 --> 00:36:34,908
- E-cade! - E-cade!

1148
00:36:35,408 --> 00:36:36,807
- Goodness. - What is that?

1149
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:38,077
- What is that? - This is so cool.

1150
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:39,207
Eun Ji, what is that?

1151
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,077
- That's a helipad. - A helipad.

1152
00:36:41,078 --> 00:36:42,347
I want to ride a helicopter.

1153
00:36:42,348 --> 00:36:44,977
Since we have to train as agents,

1154
00:36:44,978 --> 00:36:46,717
- they're equipped with a helipad. - That's so cool.

1155
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:48,387
- Four-wheel drive. - That's the ATV training facility.

1156
00:36:48,388 --> 00:36:50,017
- That's amazing. - I want to ride it.

1157
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:51,757
- This is amazing. - It's an actual training facility.

1158
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:53,627
Right. We have to train there.

1159
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,227
- Look at that. - That's an actual target.

1160
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:56,427
- We have to hit that target. - Where?

1161
00:36:56,428 --> 00:36:57,628
On our left.

1162
00:36:57,828 --> 00:36:59,458
- You're right. - This is insane.

1163
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,867
- This place is so cool. - There's even a zip-line.

1164
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:02,868
- A zip-line? - A zip-line?

1165
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:04,498
- I want to go ziplining. - I love ziplining.

1166
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:07,608
It's going to be fun.

1167
00:37:08,238 --> 00:37:10,207
- It's like "Mission: Impossible." - Right.

1168
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,907
It really feels like we're here on a mission.

1169
00:37:11,908 --> 00:37:14,178
- I love it. - There's an oasis on your right.

1170
00:37:14,378 --> 00:37:15,647
- An oasis. - Gosh.

1171
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,817
- An oasis in the desert. - Let's take a picture.

1172
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,277
- This really is the desert. - Right.

1173
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,047
I feel like I'm looking at a fake one.

1174
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:21,448
This is an actual desert.

1175
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:23,558
- Gosh, this is great. - Let's go.

1176
00:37:23,988 --> 00:37:25,018
Nice.

1177
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:30,097
Let's go!

1178
00:37:30,098 --> 00:37:31,957
- Let's go! - Yes!

1179
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,027
(Let's ride across the desert.)

1180
00:37:33,028 --> 00:37:34,297
- Step on it! - If it weren't for E-cade,

1181
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:35,298
we wouldn't have the opportunity to visit this place.

1182
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:36,737
- This place is amazing. - Right. I love it here.

1183
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:38,398
I love it here.

1184
00:37:38,498 --> 00:37:40,867
We have arrived at the agent training center.

1185
00:37:40,868 --> 00:37:42,008
- Okay. - Is this it?

1186
00:37:42,768 --> 00:37:45,638
(That means Agent F is here!)

1187
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:48,877
Is there a specific method we have to follow to meet Agent F?

1188
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:50,777
We'll explain the method to you inside.

1189
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:51,878
- Okay. - Okay.

1190
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:53,948
- Real guys. - Where are you?

1191
00:37:54,618 --> 00:37:56,047
- What is this place? - Okay.

1192
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:57,187
Gosh, this place is so pretty.

1193
00:37:57,188 --> 00:37:58,617
- It's like we're in a movie. - Akh.

1194
00:37:58,618 --> 00:37:59,758
It really is akh.

1195
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:03,157
(As soon as they walk in,)

1196
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,528
(the magnificence of the building is overwhelming.)

1197
00:38:05,598 --> 00:38:06,697
- Akh. - Gosh.

1198
00:38:06,698 --> 00:38:08,798
- Amazing. What is this place? - Gosh. Young Ji.

1199
00:38:08,898 --> 00:38:10,838
- I feel like we're in a mafia film. - Gosh.

1200
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:12,298
- What? - Gosh.

1201
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:17,208
(A sitting room where they can host guests)

1202
00:38:18,038 --> 00:38:20,408
(Of course, it's luxurious.)

1203
00:38:21,948 --> 00:38:25,118
(They have to walk further inside to enter this second space.)

1204
00:38:26,278 --> 00:38:28,318
(A room to strategize how they will apprehend Torong)

1205
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:30,557
Gosh, guys!

1206
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,987
- We get to stare into fire! - Guys!

1207
00:38:32,988 --> 00:38:34,557
- Do we really get to stay here? - We get to stare into fire!

1208
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:36,558
I love staring into fire.

1209
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:39,057
(In the main building is...)

1210
00:38:39,058 --> 00:38:40,668
(a swimming pool surrounded by the desert.)

1211
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:44,738
(And the highlight of this swimming pool...)

1212
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,838
(is the mysterious brazier.)

1213
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:53,108
(On top of it is a magic lamp.)

1214
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:56,247
(The lamp's secret will soon be revealed.)

1215
00:38:56,248 --> 00:38:59,247
- That's Aladdin's lamp. - That's Aladdin's lamp.

1216
00:38:59,248 --> 00:39:00,417
Goodness.

1217
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:02,817
This building gives off a spy-movie vibe, doesn't it?

1218
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:04,917
- Yes, like the resorts... - Gosh, you're right.

1219
00:39:04,918 --> 00:39:06,057
I want to live here.

1220
00:39:06,058 --> 00:39:08,627
- The water is real. - In "Charlie's Angels,"

1221
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:10,497
they covertly live in a place like this.

1222
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:12,027
- Right. "Charlie's Angels." - Yes.

1223
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:13,727
- The angels. - They live somewhere like this.

1224
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:16,297
- "Charlie's Angels." - If this is Agent F's house,

1225
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:17,667
- where are we staying? - Where's our accommodation?

1226
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:19,697
You will be staying somewhere that's equally as good.

1227
00:39:19,698 --> 00:39:20,938
- Don't worry. - Great.

1228
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:22,037
All right.

1229
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:23,608
This is where you'll be training.

1230
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,007
Agent F has to meet up with us right now, right?

1231
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:28,047
Do we have to get ready to...

1232
00:39:28,048 --> 00:39:29,107
There's a way for you to call Agent F.

1233
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:30,117
- There's a specific method? - That could never be real.

1234
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,217
You're lying.

1235
00:39:31,218 --> 00:39:32,547
- Stop lying. - Never...

1236
00:39:32,548 --> 00:39:33,587
- Don't lie to us. - That could never be real.

1237
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:34,717
- say never. - What is it?

1238
00:39:34,718 --> 00:39:36,387
Will Agent F really appear if we rub the lamp?

1239
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:38,218
As you rub the lamp, you have to say...

1240
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:41,027
- As-salamu alaykum. - "As-salamu alaykum."

1241
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:42,457
- As-salamu alaykum. - All of you together.

1242
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,057
- Sawadika. - Sawadika.

1243
00:39:44,058 --> 00:39:45,897
(Agent F has quite a classic taste.)

1244
00:39:45,898 --> 00:39:47,728
- We have to rub it like this. - As-salamu alaykum.

1245
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:49,328
One, two, three.

1246
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,268
- As-salamu alaykum. - As-salamu alaykum.

1247
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:56,037
- As-salamu alaykum. - As-salamu alaykum.

1248
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:58,137
I'm sorry, but Agent F is taking time to appear.

1249
00:39:58,138 --> 00:40:00,748
Agent F will come out this way.

1250
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:03,408
(Agent F will emerge from this door.)

1251
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:05,347
- As-salamu alaykum. - Agent F.

1252
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:07,188
(Finally)

1253
00:40:07,348 --> 00:40:09,718
As-salamu alaykum. What?

1254
00:40:10,418 --> 00:40:11,488
Agent F is here.

1255
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:19,028
Are you Agent F?

1256
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,228
What? Agent F isn't human.

1257
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:24,738
As-salamu alaykum. What?

1258
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,567
As-salamu alaykum. What?

1259
00:40:28,307 --> 00:40:29,337
Agent F is here.

1260
00:40:35,535 --> 00:40:36,945
Are you Agent F?

1261
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:40,045
What? Agent F isn't human.

1262
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:42,574
As-salamu alaykum. What?

1263
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:45,084
Are you Agent F?

1264
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:46,745
(Toddling around)

1265
00:40:47,785 --> 00:40:49,415
- What? - I see.

1266
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:51,385
Are you Agent F?

1267
00:40:51,685 --> 00:40:52,855
What's going on?

1268
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,025
(Codename: Agent F)

1269
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:58,725
(Species: Blue dragon)

1270
00:41:00,365 --> 00:41:04,565
(The secret agent sent by the Jade Emperor)

1271
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:08,434
(The shape of Agent F's body is optimal for surveillance.)

1272
00:41:08,435 --> 00:41:13,005
(Agent F can see higher.)

1273
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:14,814
- Agent F isn't human. - Agent F has...

1274
00:41:14,815 --> 00:41:16,244
a window on his body.

1275
00:41:16,245 --> 00:41:18,745
Isn't this too grotesque?

1276
00:41:19,045 --> 00:41:20,854
- Be careful. - Goodness.

1277
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:22,615
- Watch the steps. - Be careful.

1278
00:41:23,255 --> 00:41:25,485
(They just met, but his looks are causing them concern.)

1279
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:27,855
Hello. Are you F?

1280
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:30,155
- As-salamu alaykum. - As-salamu alaykum.

1281
00:41:30,765 --> 00:41:32,165
Why don't you have a seat?

1282
00:41:32,295 --> 00:41:34,565
Agent F? Are you Agent F?

1283
00:41:34,865 --> 00:41:36,134
- You are? - "I'm..."

1284
00:41:36,135 --> 00:41:37,664
- "I'm Agent F." - As-salamu alaykum.

1285
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:39,404
- He's interpreting for us. - "It's nice to meet you."

1286
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:40,804
He's interpreting for us. Hello.

1287
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:43,605
Is this where you live?

1288
00:41:43,775 --> 00:41:45,945
This is the Abu Dhabi branch.

1289
00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:48,744
- I manage the place. - I see.

1290
00:41:48,745 --> 00:41:49,915
(Gesturing that he manages the place.)

1291
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:51,214
I think he's moving along to your words.

1292
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:54,184
Excuse me, but why are you called Agent F?

1293
00:41:54,185 --> 00:41:57,425
"My codename is Agent F..."

1294
00:41:57,685 --> 00:42:01,224
"because my real name is Fe-dragon."

1295
00:42:01,225 --> 00:42:02,624
- Fe-dragon? - Fe-dragon.

1296
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,024
Like G-DRAGON?

1297
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:06,924
Do any of you know which chemical element...

1298
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:09,064
- "Fe" is a symbol of? - Iron!

1299
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:10,465
- Iron as in "Cheol?" Cheol-dragon? - Isn't it iron?

1300
00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:12,605
Yes, my real name is...

1301
00:42:12,665 --> 00:42:14,405
- Cheol Yong? - Cheol Yong.

1302
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:17,105
- I see. - So that's why you're F-dragon.

1303
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:18,605
Goodbye.

1304
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:20,375
Thank you.

1305
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:23,075
He'll be very helpful in catching Torong.

1306
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:25,815
- Nice to meet you, Cheol Yong. - Can you see, though?

1307
00:42:26,515 --> 00:42:28,685
"All right. I'll do that."

1308
00:42:29,415 --> 00:42:32,584
- As-salamu alaykum. - As-salamu alaykum.

1309
00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:33,724
- Come back. - "Pay no attention to me."

1310
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:35,054
- As-salamu alaykum. - He's like that because...

1311
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,625
Cheol Yong is actually...

1312
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:39,264
shy around new people.

1313
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,765
- He's an introvert. - I see.

1314
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:42,564
- His MBTI starts with an I. - He's shy around strangers.

1315
00:42:42,565 --> 00:42:44,765
- He must be introverted. - Yes, he's an introvert.

1316
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:47,775
- I hope you keep that in mind. - Got it.

1317
00:42:49,475 --> 00:42:53,775
(You may not be interested,)

1318
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:57,715
(but let me tell you about my job.)

1319
00:42:57,985 --> 00:42:59,844
- Why are you making him do this? - Abracadabra.

1320
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:02,715
(My main job is to keep the agents fed.)

1321
00:43:03,155 --> 00:43:04,454
- Who is he underneath? - What is this?

1322
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:06,485
(Right! I'm quite polite.)

1323
00:43:07,695 --> 00:43:10,465
(I'm helping the staff with production costs.)

1324
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:16,495
(Feel free to call me anytime.)

1325
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:20,035
(F is a dragon from the country of courteous people in the East.)

1326
00:43:21,305 --> 00:43:25,875
(Sometimes, I even prepare special meals for the agents.)

1327
00:43:26,345 --> 00:43:28,715
(Snap out of it!)

1328
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:29,775
- Is that okay? - The deity of kimchi!

1329
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:35,455
(My work environment is challenging for an introverted dragon like me.)

1330
00:43:36,855 --> 00:43:39,585
(They're so scary.)

1331
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:41,524
Cheol Yong is very shy.

1332
00:43:41,525 --> 00:43:43,155
- Don't gang up on him like that. - He's so cute.

1333
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:47,665
(Still, I think I got this. Right?)

1334
00:43:48,435 --> 00:43:50,905
(After all, we're all new at something.)

1335
00:43:52,405 --> 00:43:58,105
(Until the day I become an experienced agent,)

1336
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:05,815
(you'll be seeing different sides of me in action. Stay tuned!)

1337
00:44:05,985 --> 00:44:07,784
Let's go take a look at where you'll be staying.

1338
00:44:07,785 --> 00:44:09,284
- Okay. - This place is insane.

1339
00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:10,755
- It really is. - It's amazing.

1340
00:44:12,225 --> 00:44:14,425
- I love the vibe here. - This isn't bad.

1341
00:44:14,795 --> 00:44:17,024
This is where you'll be staying.

1342
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:18,525
I'm really looking forward to this.

1343
00:44:19,665 --> 00:44:20,665
Let's see.

1344
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:22,064
(2 seconds before check-in)

1345
00:44:22,065 --> 00:44:23,535
(1 second before check-in)

1346
00:44:23,835 --> 00:44:26,034
- Gosh. - It's the same.

1347
00:44:26,035 --> 00:44:27,204
Gosh, there's a lot of food.

1348
00:44:27,205 --> 00:44:28,635
This is insane.

1349
00:44:31,175 --> 00:44:36,145
(Introducing the E-cade oasis)

1350
00:44:36,745 --> 00:44:39,045
- Gosh, that's Torong. - It's Torong.

1351
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:40,754
- That's so cute. - That's cute.

1352
00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:42,555
Is it a new merch?

1353
00:44:43,285 --> 00:44:46,385
(A must for the E-cade members)

1354
00:44:47,225 --> 00:44:49,295
(The swimming pool)

1355
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,424
(Just like the one in the main building,)

1356
00:44:51,425 --> 00:44:52,525
(this one is surrounded by the desert too.)

1357
00:44:53,395 --> 00:44:54,695
(Welcome)

1358
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:56,534
- I love this. - That's so cute.

1359
00:44:56,535 --> 00:44:57,535
- This place is great. - Eun Ji,

1360
00:44:57,536 --> 00:44:59,404
- I love it here. - Hey, is this avocado-shaped?

1361
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,805
This is unbelievable.

1362
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:05,005
(The bed is as huge as the desert.)

1363
00:45:06,275 --> 00:45:07,874
(They also have a view of the desert.)

1364
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,214
- This way. On my right. - This way? On your right?

1365
00:45:10,215 --> 00:45:11,844
Both rooms look the same.

1366
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:12,915
Gosh.

1367
00:45:13,185 --> 00:45:16,055
(There's another bedroom across the living room.)

1368
00:45:16,385 --> 00:45:17,685
(This room has a large couch,)

1369
00:45:18,725 --> 00:45:21,755
(which is gives them a front-row seat to the desert.)

1370
00:45:21,855 --> 00:45:24,264
- Gosh, this room is great. - This is amazing.

1371
00:45:24,265 --> 00:45:25,994
Eun Ji, we made it.

1372
00:45:25,995 --> 00:45:27,964
I love it here. I can't believe this is happening.

1373
00:45:27,965 --> 00:45:30,194
Producer Na, thank you.

1374
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:31,664
- Gosh. - Thank you.

1375
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:33,334
(It's time to relax at their fabulous house.)

1376
00:45:33,335 --> 00:45:34,935
- Gosh. - This is really amazing.

1377
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,144
Mimi, are you going to unpack?

1378
00:45:38,145 --> 00:45:39,204
Yes, I'm going to start unpacking.

1379
00:45:39,205 --> 00:45:40,514
- Let's do it together. - Sure.

1380
00:45:40,515 --> 00:45:42,115
(Young Ji and Mimi are roommates.)

1381
00:45:42,175 --> 00:45:44,245
Gosh, how is this real?

1382
00:45:44,485 --> 00:45:46,085
- This is amazing. - I can't believe this, either.

1383
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,014
And as we're talking,

1384
00:45:48,015 --> 00:45:50,184
if we look outside the window, the view is unrealistic.

1385
00:45:50,185 --> 00:45:51,784
It's like I'm staring at a painting.

1386
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:53,925
(The swimming pool surrounded by the desert is an emerald green.)

1387
00:45:54,155 --> 00:45:55,694
- Swim caps? - Yes, we have two designs.

1388
00:45:55,695 --> 00:45:57,154
- I want to see. - They're really cute.

1389
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:58,665
- They're really cute. - Show us.

1390
00:45:59,595 --> 00:46:00,734
Are these swim goggles?

1391
00:46:00,735 --> 00:46:01,835
(Laughing out loud)

1392
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:04,005
These are amazing. I love them.

1393
00:46:05,535 --> 00:46:08,275
(One is shaped like a carrot, the other is shaped like Torong.)

1394
00:46:08,535 --> 00:46:12,975
(These are perfect disguises for the Earth Warriors.)

1395
00:46:13,075 --> 00:46:14,075
- What are those? - These are amazing.

1396
00:46:14,076 --> 00:46:15,475
- Swim caps. - A Torong-shaped swim cap.

1397
00:46:16,115 --> 00:46:17,544
(Young Ji put the swim cap on backwards.)

1398
00:46:17,545 --> 00:46:18,814
You put it on backwards.

1399
00:46:18,815 --> 00:46:20,344
- You put it on backwards. - How do I look?

1400
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:21,755
- Backwards? - Mimi, let me see.

1401
00:46:22,515 --> 00:46:23,555
What do you think?

1402
00:46:24,155 --> 00:46:25,325
- Yu Jin. - They're swim caps.

1403
00:46:25,385 --> 00:46:26,625
- Right. - They're over here.

1404
00:46:27,425 --> 00:46:28,624
How do I put this on?

1405
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,425
You guys did a great job with these.

1406
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:32,194
- Here. - It's cute in an annoying way.

1407
00:46:32,195 --> 00:46:33,264
- It's cute but annoying. - It's amazing.

1408
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:34,665
We must all wear one.

1409
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:38,335
(It's time for underwater training!)

1410
00:46:38,535 --> 00:46:42,075
(A warm-up is a must before you swim!)

1411
00:46:43,835 --> 00:46:45,845
(But we didn't specify how we're going to warm up.)

1412
00:46:51,015 --> 00:46:52,015
Good!

1413
00:46:52,585 --> 00:46:53,585
Let's go!

1414
00:46:57,485 --> 00:46:58,584
(Eun Ji enters the water first.)

1415
00:46:58,585 --> 00:46:59,824
- It's so cool. - Hey!

1416
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:01,825
It's so cool.

1417
00:47:02,525 --> 00:47:04,695
You look like a seal. You look so happy.

1418
00:47:05,065 --> 00:47:06,194
A happy seal.

1419
00:47:06,195 --> 00:47:08,135
(She feels comfortable as if she was in her home.)

1420
00:47:08,235 --> 00:47:10,935
(Struggling)

1421
00:47:11,505 --> 00:47:12,634
I think it's fine.

1422
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:14,375
(Caught Torong is the best Torong.)

1423
00:47:14,735 --> 00:47:19,775
(A seal that is happy to be in water)

1424
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:21,945
(Mimi joins her next.)

1425
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:24,485
Eun Ji, see that side. It's so nice.

1426
00:47:25,085 --> 00:47:26,744
(She's such a good swimmer.)

1427
00:47:26,745 --> 00:47:28,215
That's how the cap gets.

1428
00:47:28,815 --> 00:47:30,354
Doesn't she really look like a rabbit?

1429
00:47:30,355 --> 00:47:31,825
- Yes. - She looks like a rabbit.

1430
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:33,025
I'm so happy.

1431
00:47:35,025 --> 00:47:39,695
(While the older members swim about as they like,)

1432
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:42,965
(the younger members are enjoying themselves on land.)

1433
00:47:43,335 --> 00:47:46,835
(They start a Random Play Dance training themselves.)

1434
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:51,875
(Searching for an igloo in the middle of desert)

1435
00:47:55,045 --> 00:47:58,315
(A provocative carrot sticks out its chin.)

1436
00:48:01,285 --> 00:48:03,384
(I don't know the exact choreography.)

1437
00:48:03,385 --> 00:48:05,525
(But I'll just spin my arms as much as I like.)

1438
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:09,295
(Young Ji's fingers point somewhere.)

1439
00:48:10,595 --> 00:48:12,995
(They're attracted to each other like fate.)

1440
00:48:13,565 --> 00:48:14,964
(Focus, Eun Ji.)

1441
00:48:14,965 --> 00:48:16,935
(She suddenly starts conducting.)

1442
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:24,205
What's wrong with my body?

1443
00:48:24,775 --> 00:48:27,144
(A happy seal, Lee Eun Ji, conductor, Lee Young Ji)

1444
00:48:27,145 --> 00:48:29,114
(Spin.)

1445
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,815
(Faster.)

1446
00:48:32,985 --> 00:48:34,354
(Laughing)

1447
00:48:34,355 --> 00:48:35,655
Let's do it again.

1448
00:48:37,685 --> 00:48:40,754
My body. What's wrong with my body?

1449
00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:42,525
- Again. - I don't get it!

1450
00:48:45,795 --> 00:48:48,535
(Working in a perfect pair without needing to say anything)

1451
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:51,705
(Come here.)

1452
00:48:52,165 --> 00:48:54,204
(Almost getting sucked in)

1453
00:48:54,205 --> 00:48:55,734
(Stop there...)

1454
00:48:55,735 --> 00:48:58,105
(and spin fast.)

1455
00:48:58,545 --> 00:49:01,275
(Entertaining)

1456
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:04,745
I'm so exhausted.

1457
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:06,984
- Eun Ji. This will be fun to film. - Was that okay?

1458
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,554
Yes. You're a seal I raised with my curse.

1459
00:49:08,555 --> 00:49:09,955
- Okay. - That's the title.

1460
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,824
(And that started...)

1461
00:49:11,825 --> 00:49:13,925
(Conductor Young Ji and happy seals)

1462
00:49:14,695 --> 00:49:15,854
("Armageddon")

1463
00:49:15,855 --> 00:49:17,294
(Sung by aespa, conducted by Young Ji,)

1464
00:49:17,295 --> 00:49:18,594
(seal by Lee Eun Ji)

1465
00:49:18,595 --> 00:49:21,765
Hello, everyone. Welcome to our show.

1466
00:49:22,665 --> 00:49:24,565
I am Lee Young Ji, the conductor.

1467
00:49:25,705 --> 00:49:28,735
Thank you for coming to my "Happy Seal" show.

1468
00:49:29,105 --> 00:49:32,445
I'd like to introduce Lee Eun Ji, the seal.

1469
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:35,475
(Seal noise)

1470
00:49:39,545 --> 00:49:41,114
(Consecutive spins are nothing now.)

1471
00:49:41,115 --> 00:49:42,115
What's wrong?

1472
00:49:42,555 --> 00:49:45,924
My body is moving against my will!

1473
00:49:45,925 --> 00:49:46,925
Wait!

1474
00:49:46,926 --> 00:49:48,595
(The highlight is approaching.)

1475
00:49:52,425 --> 00:49:54,795
(They succeed at once with perfect partnership.)

1476
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:56,965
Was that good?

1477
00:49:57,705 --> 00:49:59,104
- Seal Eun Ji, are you okay? - It's fun.

1478
00:49:59,105 --> 00:50:01,235
- Would you like a glass of water? - Yes, I'd like that.

1479
00:50:02,075 --> 00:50:03,974
- It's fun. - It's not bad, is it?

1480
00:50:03,975 --> 00:50:05,005
It's so fun.

1481
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:07,915
(Watching the video they just took)

1482
00:50:08,115 --> 00:50:10,415
(While everyone is laughing...)

1483
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:14,254
- Can you do something harder? - My goodness.

1484
00:50:14,255 --> 00:50:15,655
Like what?

1485
00:50:16,215 --> 00:50:18,755
(Like this.)

1486
00:50:19,685 --> 00:50:20,795
- We'll do it one more time. - Okay.

1487
00:50:21,095 --> 00:50:22,095
- Right now? - Yes.

1488
00:50:22,325 --> 00:50:23,854
Hold on. Right now?

1489
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:24,964
Are you feeling okay?

1490
00:50:24,965 --> 00:50:26,594
- What about tomorrow? - Okay, let's do it tomorrow.

1491
00:50:26,595 --> 00:50:28,635
Yes. Film it tomorrow.

1492
00:50:29,165 --> 00:50:31,135
- "Film it tomorrow." - Tomorrow is our filming day.

1493
00:50:31,805 --> 00:50:32,805
(Armageddon)

1494
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:36,275
She's doing a trial run.

1495
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,675
She works really hard, I tell you.

1496
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:40,074
We're all dressed funnily.

1497
00:50:40,075 --> 00:50:42,245
I wish there was another seal.

1498
00:50:43,575 --> 00:50:46,014
(Mimi and Yu Jin join as seals too.)

1499
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:47,285
Okay, that's great.

1500
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:48,954
- Okay. Going by the order, - What should we do?

1501
00:50:48,955 --> 00:50:51,355
Eun Ji is Seal Number One.

1502
00:50:51,655 --> 00:50:53,454
- Seal Number Two is Mimi. - Okay.

1503
00:50:53,455 --> 00:50:54,455
Number Three is Yu Jin.

1504
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:55,654
You greet with a honk.

1505
00:50:55,655 --> 00:50:56,724
- Honk. - Honk.

1506
00:50:56,725 --> 00:50:58,694
Look. Your hands shouldn't touch.

1507
00:50:58,695 --> 00:51:00,624
- Just bounce them off like this. - She's so detailed in her teaching.

1508
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:01,634
Where's the center?

1509
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:02,664
- What's the formation? - Here. So...

1510
00:51:02,665 --> 00:51:04,905
- I'll greet the audience like this. - Okay.

1511
00:51:05,235 --> 00:51:07,004
When I turn to you, start honking.

1512
00:51:07,005 --> 00:51:08,735
Honk.

1513
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,675
- Honk. - This is really funny.

1514
00:51:10,775 --> 00:51:13,505
Come to me one by one.

1515
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,815
- Make sure you spin this way. - Spin.

1516
00:51:15,915 --> 00:51:16,975
Nice. Great.

1517
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:20,514
- It's "I'ma get it done." - I'ma get it done.

1518
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:24,625
(The wet rehearsal continues.)

1519
00:51:24,855 --> 00:51:26,285
- Let's film until here. - Okay.

1520
00:51:26,555 --> 00:51:28,254
How are you doing, seals?

1521
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:30,094
- Good. - The seals' well-being comes first.

1522
00:51:30,095 --> 00:51:31,095
We're fine.

1523
00:51:31,096 --> 00:51:34,095
"The seals' well-being comes first."

1524
00:51:36,035 --> 00:51:37,494
(Challenge order)

1525
00:51:37,495 --> 00:51:38,534
(1. The conductor bows.)

1526
00:51:38,535 --> 00:51:39,704
(2. Seals bow. 3. A conducting performance.)

1527
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:41,004
We should stand further back.

1528
00:51:41,005 --> 00:51:44,074
(2. Seals bow. 3. A conducting performance.)

1529
00:51:44,075 --> 00:51:45,445
(Steps 2 and 3 are skipped.)

1530
00:51:45,745 --> 00:51:48,015
- Young Ji! - Why?

1531
00:51:48,115 --> 00:51:49,215
We didn't get to honk.

1532
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,514
She didn't give us time to do it.

1533
00:51:50,515 --> 00:51:51,644
- Young Ji. - When do we honk?

1534
00:51:51,645 --> 00:51:52,645
- We need to restart. - When?

1535
00:51:52,646 --> 00:51:53,785
Not yet.

1536
00:51:54,145 --> 00:51:56,084
She's hogging the camera all to herself.

1537
00:51:56,085 --> 00:51:57,254
What is this?

1538
00:51:57,255 --> 00:51:59,954
- Let's quit being seals. - Honk.

1539
00:51:59,955 --> 00:52:00,994
- Let's quit. - If you keep doing this...

1540
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:02,354
- If you keep doing this, - I won't do it.

1541
00:52:02,355 --> 00:52:03,855
- we'll quit. - I won't do it.

1542
00:52:04,055 --> 00:52:06,324
Listen. I was supposed to play from a later part.

1543
00:52:06,325 --> 00:52:08,064
Must we take your mistakes into consideration?

1544
00:52:08,065 --> 00:52:10,795
Exactly. We seals have rights too.

1545
00:52:10,905 --> 00:52:12,534
- We have seal-rights. - Seal-rights.

1546
00:52:12,535 --> 00:52:13,535
- Honk. - Honk.

1547
00:52:13,536 --> 00:52:14,734
I apologize, honk.

1548
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:16,135
(The 1st take ended even before it began.)

1549
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:19,375
(Serious)

1550
00:52:19,645 --> 00:52:20,805
Are they doing it?

1551
00:52:22,045 --> 00:52:24,745
Hello. Welcome to Happy Time Seal show.

1552
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,215
Here are my seals.

1553
00:52:26,216 --> 00:52:27,284
(Challenge order)

1554
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:28,355
(1. The conductor bows. 2. Seals bow.)

1555
00:52:28,785 --> 00:52:30,014
(Conductor Young Ji livens up the atmosphere.)

1556
00:52:30,015 --> 00:52:31,025
Nice.

1557
00:52:32,755 --> 00:52:33,755
Last one!
(All there's left is the highlight!)

1558
00:52:34,895 --> 00:52:35,895
Here it comes!

1559
00:52:35,896 --> 00:52:37,424
(Speaking gibberish)

1560
00:52:37,425 --> 00:52:38,465
I'ma get.

1561
00:52:43,665 --> 00:52:45,035
(Perfect synchronization)

1562
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:46,965
(Touched)

1563
00:52:47,705 --> 00:52:51,205
(The seals dive without her conducting first.)

1564
00:52:51,745 --> 00:52:55,245
What is this? What are you doing?

1565
00:52:57,515 --> 00:52:59,484
Why do you keep laughing?

1566
00:52:59,485 --> 00:53:00,684
- I... - You can't laugh.

1567
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:02,715
- We're all... - It's such a sight to see.

1568
00:53:03,185 --> 00:53:05,324
- It... - It's a spectacle.

1569
00:53:05,325 --> 00:53:06,754
Only those who conducted can relate.

1570
00:53:06,755 --> 00:53:07,794
This...

1571
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:09,224
So stop laughing and do it properly.

1572
00:53:09,225 --> 00:53:11,094
Okay. Instead, Seal Number Three?

1573
00:53:11,095 --> 00:53:12,095
Get in character.

1574
00:53:12,165 --> 00:53:13,924
You're not as seal-like as Seal Number One.

1575
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:15,035
You look like a human.

1576
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,295
Go in and have five pieces of brownie.

1577
00:53:17,965 --> 00:53:19,304
That's how you become a true seal.

1578
00:53:19,305 --> 00:53:20,665
You are a true seal now.

1579
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:23,034
- Are you guys feeling okay? - Yes.

1580
00:53:23,035 --> 00:53:24,035
Let's try one more time.

1581
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:25,704
(Check the final video in their top shapes...)

1582
00:53:25,705 --> 00:53:27,004
(on Channel Fullmoon.)

1583
00:53:27,005 --> 00:53:28,015
Are we starting from the greeting?

1584
00:53:28,345 --> 00:53:31,315
(After the water training)

1585
00:53:32,215 --> 00:53:33,285
- Yu Jin. - Yes?

1586
00:53:33,985 --> 00:53:35,515
Which cosmetics did you bring?

1587
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,955
- I brought a lot. - I want to see them.

1588
00:53:39,185 --> 00:53:40,655
(She's too lazy to get up.)

1589
00:53:40,755 --> 00:53:43,455
(Young Ji goes to find it herself.)

1590
00:53:43,495 --> 00:53:44,495
I have a feeling this is it.

1591
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:46,325
It isn't.

1592
00:53:46,365 --> 00:53:49,135
- It's the pink pouch. - No.

1593
00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:50,965
I'll find it for you.
(In the end, Yu Jin gets up.)

1594
00:53:52,405 --> 00:53:54,005
Let's have a look, no, let's DIY ourselves.

1595
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:56,405
(They start a "Get Ready With Me.")

1596
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,004
- Hello. - Hello.

1597
00:53:59,005 --> 00:54:00,645
We are Glasses Dumpling and Opanchu.

1598
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:03,675
(Opanchu: An unfortunate rabbit. It has charming, teary eyes.)

1599
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,115
(Glasses Dumpling: A dumpling wearing glasses.)

1600
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,744
(It has thick eyebrows and blank face.)

1601
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:07,815
Get ready with...

1602
00:54:10,055 --> 00:54:11,155
Step one.

1603
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:13,484
The glasses complete Glasses Dumpling,

1604
00:54:13,485 --> 00:54:14,525
so I choose my glasses first.

1605
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:18,025
(Surprised)

1606
00:54:18,765 --> 00:54:19,894
(She sees Young Ji.)

1607
00:54:19,895 --> 00:54:22,035
You really look like Film Critic Lee Dong Jin with that.

1608
00:54:22,135 --> 00:54:23,395
(She removes the Dong Jin-like glasses.)

1609
00:54:23,495 --> 00:54:26,805
(Young Ji tries on other glasses.)

1610
00:54:29,605 --> 00:54:31,544
Glasses Dumpling makeup is complete.

1611
00:54:31,545 --> 00:54:32,545
No.

1612
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,475
Is that all for you?

1613
00:54:34,715 --> 00:54:36,345
- I'm done. - No.

1614
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,745
This is how the makeup for Earth Arcade is done.

1615
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:43,985
Everyone will be shocked and aghast when they see it later on the show.

1616
00:54:44,285 --> 00:54:45,754
(Meanwhile, Yu Jin puts on a lot of makeup for the show.)

1617
00:54:45,755 --> 00:54:47,285
You have very smooth skin.

1618
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:49,924
I practiced a bit.

1619
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:51,295
I can see that.

1620
00:54:51,925 --> 00:54:54,495
(Yu Jin's makeup skills have improved a lot.)

1621
00:54:54,835 --> 00:54:55,865
(Glancing)

1622
00:54:57,265 --> 00:54:58,265
You're good at doing makeup.

1623
00:54:58,266 --> 00:54:59,305
(A chic attitude is a plus.)

1624
00:54:59,405 --> 00:55:00,835
(Staring)

1625
00:55:01,775 --> 00:55:03,005
She's acting pretty.

1626
00:55:03,705 --> 00:55:05,404
(Emphasizing her cheeks)

1627
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:06,405
It's a bit pink.

1628
00:55:07,845 --> 00:55:10,415
- You applied it, right? - Yes.

1629
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:12,445
There is a bit of difference.

1630
00:55:13,045 --> 00:55:15,055
Your makeup is great. Yours is great too.

1631
00:55:15,155 --> 00:55:17,114
I think you can put on more eyeshadows.

1632
00:55:17,115 --> 00:55:18,325
(No-makeup artist Young Ji gives others feedback on makeup.)

1633
00:55:18,455 --> 00:55:21,725
(She's ready.)

1634
00:55:22,425 --> 00:55:24,625
(The agents successfully finished their water training.)

1635
00:55:25,265 --> 00:55:27,465
(The reason they're at the Abu Dhabi branch...)

1636
00:55:28,465 --> 00:55:31,665
(deep in a desert two hours away from Abu Dhabi...)

1637
00:55:32,405 --> 00:55:34,735
(and very secluded and quiet)

1638
00:55:35,405 --> 00:55:37,774
(Agent lodging)

1639
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:39,875
(Right next to it is the headquarters.)

1640
00:55:40,745 --> 00:55:43,315
(It offers special training just for the agents.)

1641
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:46,285
(The staff members come to the headquarters one after another.)

1642
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:52,085
(Agent F is busy preparing something.)

1643
00:55:53,355 --> 00:55:55,194
(The agents' special training...)

1644
00:55:55,195 --> 00:55:58,225
(that can be done only in this spacious and quiet area)

1645
00:55:59,995 --> 00:56:04,634
(A fun music training is coming soon.)

1646
00:56:04,635 --> 00:56:06,305
(Training starts.)

1647
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,735
We're going to the headquarters.

1648
00:56:09,135 --> 00:56:10,475
- Akh. - Akh.

1649
00:56:10,935 --> 00:56:13,375
(One minute on foot)

1650
00:56:13,945 --> 00:56:17,984
- Akh. - Akh.

1651
00:56:17,985 --> 00:56:19,744
- Akh. - It must be a music game.

1652
00:56:19,745 --> 00:56:21,215
(It's my song!)

1653
00:56:26,185 --> 00:56:29,295
(The agents dance like the fish in water.)

1654
00:56:29,395 --> 00:56:30,395
(She is the only Y2K among the members.)

1655
00:56:30,396 --> 00:56:31,565
You don't know the dance.

1656
00:56:31,765 --> 00:56:33,295
(You caught me.)

1657
00:56:33,465 --> 00:56:34,595
I haven't learned it yet.

1658
00:56:36,135 --> 00:56:40,105
(Eun Ji, dancing is all about confidence.)

1659
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:41,635
Let's go.

1660
00:56:43,505 --> 00:56:45,274
(1. The original)

1661
00:56:45,275 --> 00:56:46,904
(2. The knockoff)

1662
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:48,174
(3. Aerobics)

1663
00:56:48,175 --> 00:56:49,375
You must smile.

1664
00:56:50,275 --> 00:56:52,115
(4. A happy seal)

1665
00:56:52,645 --> 00:56:54,585
(A satisfactory lesson outcome)

1666
00:56:55,485 --> 00:56:58,325
(With the dance teacher's dolphin-like singing,)

1667
00:56:58,755 --> 00:56:59,884
(she becomes the ending fairy.)

1668
00:56:59,885 --> 00:57:00,885
- Let's go. - Okay.

1669
00:57:00,886 --> 00:57:02,895
- Hello. - Hello.

1670
00:57:02,896 --> 00:57:04,094
- Nice to meet you. - It's time to eat.

1671
00:57:04,095 --> 00:57:05,624
I heard you did water adaptation training just now.

1672
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:07,264
- Yes. - We did water training, yes.

1673
00:57:07,265 --> 00:57:09,235
- Was it intense? - Yes, it was intense.

1674
00:57:09,535 --> 00:57:10,734
I'm so hungry.

1675
00:57:10,735 --> 00:57:11,804
I'm hungry.

1676
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:13,464
- I'm very hungry. - I'm hungry.

1677
00:57:13,465 --> 00:57:15,204
- Since you used up a lot of energy, - Yes.

1678
00:57:15,205 --> 00:57:16,334
it's time to eat.

1679
00:57:16,335 --> 00:57:17,404
- Yes. - Let's eat.

1680
00:57:17,405 --> 00:57:19,804
But as agents, you shouldn't eat easily.

1681
00:57:19,805 --> 00:57:20,844
- We'll play a game. - Through a fierce competition...

1682
00:57:20,845 --> 00:57:21,874
for survival...

1683
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,074
It's a competition for survival?

1684
00:57:23,075 --> 00:57:25,814
Only the winners get to eat.

1685
00:57:25,815 --> 00:57:27,184
Only the winners.

1686
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:28,484
Divide yourselves into two teams.

1687
00:57:28,485 --> 00:57:29,885
Do you want room against room?

1688
00:57:30,115 --> 00:57:31,324
Room against room?

1689
00:57:31,325 --> 00:57:32,554
Wait. It depends on the menu.

1690
00:57:32,555 --> 00:57:33,824
- That's the important part. - That's right.

1691
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,994
We had Middle Eastern brunch just now.

1692
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:37,025
- Yes. - Yes.

1693
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:38,694
- Today, - It must be something spicy.

1694
00:57:38,695 --> 00:57:40,225
it will be Middle Eastern dinner.

1695
00:57:41,495 --> 00:57:42,694
It will be a full meal.

1696
00:57:42,695 --> 00:57:44,134
- A full meal. - I have a question.

1697
00:57:44,135 --> 00:57:45,934
- Go ahead. - Is it spicy?

1698
00:57:45,935 --> 00:57:47,434
- Agent Yu Jin. Spicy? - Yes.

1699
00:57:47,435 --> 00:57:48,535
There are...

1700
00:57:48,935 --> 00:57:50,005
spicy dishes.

1701
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,544
- This is bad. - I was craving spicy food.

1702
00:57:51,545 --> 00:57:53,274
She has no interest in spicy food.

1703
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:55,415
After Dishes 1 to 7,

1704
00:57:55,645 --> 00:57:57,815
- there are Desserts 8 to 10. - There are?

1705
00:57:58,315 --> 00:57:59,644
Okay. Are you happy with desserts?

1706
00:57:59,645 --> 00:58:00,984
You won't work hard just for Rounds 8 to 10, right?

1707
00:58:00,985 --> 00:58:01,985
- No. - Okay.

1708
00:58:01,986 --> 00:58:03,515
I should work hard from the start.

1709
00:58:04,055 --> 00:58:06,684
You said it was a full meal. Will it be a course meal, then?

1710
00:58:06,685 --> 00:58:09,094
If you eat everything, it'll be a perfect meal.

1711
00:58:09,095 --> 00:58:10,125
I'm hungry.

1712
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:12,794
(Since they have various spices,)

1713
00:58:12,795 --> 00:58:15,035
(they have many dishes full of flavors.)

1714
00:58:16,465 --> 00:58:21,835
(They'll get to taste authentic Middle Eastern cuisine here.)

1715
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:24,335
(Middle Eastern salad to whet their appetite)

1716
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:26,445
(A light and good starter)

1717
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,445
(The main dish)

1718
00:58:29,775 --> 00:58:31,915
(Carbohydrates one cannot miss out on)

1719
00:58:32,345 --> 00:58:34,445
(And curry to have it with)

1720
00:58:36,015 --> 00:58:39,385
(Desserts for sweet tooth too)

1721
00:58:40,025 --> 00:58:41,084
(How will authentic Middle Eastern food...)

1722
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:42,195
(taste like in the desert?)

1723
00:58:42,525 --> 00:58:43,924
Do you need to shuffle the team?

1724
00:58:43,925 --> 00:58:45,564
- Are you okay with teaming with me? - I'd love that.

1725
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:47,324
- Okay. I'm happy with it too. - I'm worried you might not like it.

1726
00:58:47,325 --> 00:58:48,495
Then Mimi and Young Ji.

1727
00:58:48,635 --> 00:58:49,664
- And Yu Jin... - Mimi and Young Ji.

1728
00:58:49,665 --> 00:58:51,264
Yu Jin and Eun Ji. I love this.

1729
00:58:51,265 --> 00:58:52,565
Those who snore and those who don't.

1730
00:58:53,565 --> 00:58:54,565
Mimi doesn't snore.

1731
00:58:54,566 --> 00:58:56,135
- I don't snore. - Exactly. But I do.

1732
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:57,975
Mimi grinds her teeth.

1733
00:58:58,575 --> 00:58:59,704
She doesn't snore.

1734
00:58:59,705 --> 00:59:01,104
- You... - Loudies and Quieties.

1735
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:02,115
- Okay. Quieties. - Quieties.

1736
00:59:02,345 --> 00:59:04,444
Loudies, say your cheer.

1737
00:59:04,445 --> 00:59:06,544
Let's make this sound. One, two, three.

1738
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:07,684
Are we making that sound again?

1739
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:09,554
Or since you grind your teeth, do this.

1740
00:59:09,555 --> 00:59:10,784
- I'll do this. - Okay.

1741
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:11,855
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1742
00:59:12,025 --> 00:59:13,625
- Loudies. - Loudies.

1743
00:59:14,795 --> 00:59:16,625
- That's... - That's too shoddy.

1744
00:59:17,195 --> 00:59:18,524
We didn't have time to come up with one.

1745
00:59:18,525 --> 00:59:19,624
- Shall we try again? - What should we do?

1746
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:20,625
Then...

1747
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:22,934
(It is being upgraded to an unidentifiable performance art.)

1748
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:24,394
- Wait. - See ours.

1749
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:25,564
- Okay. - Two, three.

1750
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:26,635
Loudies, no.

1751
00:59:27,165 --> 00:59:28,275
Quieties, yes.

1752
00:59:29,535 --> 00:59:31,474
(Team Quieties)

1753
00:59:31,475 --> 00:59:32,604
That's cute.

1754
00:59:32,605 --> 00:59:34,005
- Isn't it good? - I like that.

1755
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:35,775
- Here we go. - Thank you.

1756
00:59:36,075 --> 00:59:37,144
Start.

1757
00:59:37,145 --> 00:59:38,184
(Grinding teeth)

1758
00:59:38,185 --> 00:59:39,515
- Loudies. - Loudies.

1759
00:59:40,485 --> 00:59:41,485
(This is not Zombie Game.)
Not bad, right?

1760
00:59:42,486 --> 00:59:44,154
(Team Loudies)

1761
00:59:44,155 --> 00:59:45,624
- Today's game... - It's music.

1762
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:46,654
- is music quiz. - It's so obvious.

1763
00:59:46,655 --> 00:59:48,224
- Music quiz. - Music quiz.

1764
00:59:48,225 --> 00:59:49,225
I love it.

1765
00:59:49,226 --> 00:59:51,055
(Music quiz)

1766
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:53,525
(Listen to a song from the respective year.)

1767
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:55,765
(Guess the title of the song and the singer.)

1768
00:59:56,195 --> 00:59:58,664
(When everyone in the team answers correctly, they get food.)

1769
00:59:58,665 --> 01:00:00,004
Shall we start lightly...

1770
01:00:00,005 --> 01:00:01,504
by having a look at the first food?

1771
01:00:01,505 --> 01:00:02,505
- Yes. - I'd like that.

1772
01:00:02,506 --> 01:00:03,805
Please come out.

1773
01:00:04,005 --> 01:00:05,045
What?

1774
01:00:05,445 --> 01:00:06,575
- It's F. - F.

1775
01:00:06,705 --> 01:00:09,115
Why are you making him work part-time now?

1776
01:00:09,615 --> 01:00:10,615
I mean...

1777
01:00:10,616 --> 01:00:11,644
(Agent F, in charge of Abu Dhabi branch, watching Torong)

1778
01:00:11,645 --> 01:00:13,185
He is in charge of nutrition too.

1779
01:00:14,385 --> 01:00:15,955
- F. - F.

1780
01:00:16,215 --> 01:00:17,314
- Oh, dear. - What's this?

1781
01:00:17,315 --> 01:00:20,625
He helps you with your training, that's why.

1782
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:23,454
(But he doesn't help with the filming.)

1783
01:00:23,455 --> 01:00:24,925
You're always with us.

1784
01:00:25,725 --> 01:00:26,964
Your nutrition...

1785
01:00:26,965 --> 01:00:28,234
(An agent never shows one's back.)

1786
01:00:28,235 --> 01:00:29,935
He is in charge of your nutrition too.

1787
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,464
It's fattoush.

1788
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:32,535
- Fattoush. - Fattoush.

1789
01:00:32,665 --> 01:00:35,305
It's salad frequently enjoyed in Middle East.

1790
01:00:36,005 --> 01:00:38,105
(The dish is influenced by Greece, Turkey and so on.)

1791
01:00:39,045 --> 01:00:42,645
(Fresh salad with sour sauce)

1792
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:45,545
(Fattoush)

1793
01:00:45,785 --> 01:00:47,785
Do you see the bread-like thing sprinkled on it?

1794
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:48,815
- Yes. - Yes.

1795
01:00:48,816 --> 01:00:50,085
It's pita bread.

1796
01:00:50,315 --> 01:00:52,625
They grilled it to make it crispy.

1797
01:00:52,955 --> 01:00:54,794
- Why don't we take it easy? - Sure.

1798
01:00:54,795 --> 01:00:56,824
- Just relax and play. - Just to check our skills.

1799
01:00:56,825 --> 01:00:58,125
We'll manage it ourselves.

1800
01:00:58,265 --> 01:00:59,764
(Provoking)

1801
01:00:59,765 --> 01:01:01,365
(Booing)

1802
01:01:01,935 --> 01:01:03,235
- What was that? - What was that?

1803
01:01:03,395 --> 01:01:04,834
- It's a compliment. - It's nice.

1804
01:01:04,835 --> 01:01:06,005
It's the power of positivity.

1805
01:01:06,335 --> 01:01:08,004
(Round 1, fattoush)

1806
01:01:08,005 --> 01:01:09,175
Who wants to draw?

1807
01:01:09,235 --> 01:01:11,305
- This... - For this,

1808
01:01:11,545 --> 01:01:14,674
the eldest should go first. Minister Lee Yong Su should...

1809
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:16,474
- Minister Yong Su. - Commissioner General will draw.

1810
01:01:16,475 --> 01:01:18,044
- Commissioner General Lee Yong Su. - Commissioner General.

1811
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:20,415
- Akh. - Akh.

1812
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:22,784
Any particular year you'd like?

1813
01:01:22,785 --> 01:01:24,585
- I want 2025. - I want old songs.

1814
01:01:25,025 --> 01:01:26,424
- Here I go. - Which year?

1815
01:01:26,425 --> 01:01:27,824
(What's the year for Round One?)

1816
01:01:27,825 --> 01:01:29,325
- One, two, three. - I have a feeling it's old.

1817
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:32,064
(Round 1, 2021 to 2025)

1818
01:01:32,065 --> 01:01:34,625
It's from 2021 to 2025.

1819
01:01:34,965 --> 01:01:36,394
- That's amazing. - That's your prime time.

1820
01:01:36,395 --> 01:01:38,665
- I really don't know. - That's your prime time.

1821
01:01:39,005 --> 01:01:40,334
Shall I guess right away?

1822
01:01:40,335 --> 01:01:42,274
Or should I wait until you answer first?

1823
01:01:42,275 --> 01:01:44,175
Since it's salad, you can go first.

1824
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,145
- Let's go. - Here you go.

1825
01:01:46,405 --> 01:01:47,405
What's that?

1826
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:54,615
(Listen to the song and guess the singer and the title.)

1827
01:01:55,485 --> 01:01:56,885
- Quieties. - Loudies.

1828
01:01:56,985 --> 01:01:58,554
- Quieties. I said it first. - Quieties...

1829
01:01:58,555 --> 01:01:59,954
called first.

1830
01:01:59,955 --> 01:02:01,354
Already?

1831
01:02:01,355 --> 01:02:02,695
- One, two, three. - Wait.

1832
01:02:02,855 --> 01:02:04,424
(Singing)

1833
01:02:04,425 --> 01:02:05,494
- Wrong! - Loudies!

1834
01:02:05,495 --> 01:02:06,965
- Loudies! - Loudies.

1835
01:02:07,025 --> 01:02:08,335
"Love 119" by RIIZE.

1836
01:02:08,765 --> 01:02:09,765
Correct.

1837
01:02:10,065 --> 01:02:12,034
(Stolen my heart, that girl's a killer)

1838
01:02:12,035 --> 01:02:13,465
(Intimidating her opponents)

1839
01:02:13,865 --> 01:02:15,105
You're going out again.

1840
01:02:17,505 --> 01:02:19,905
(She simply starts waving her hands.)

1841
01:02:20,305 --> 01:02:21,674
(She keeps going backward.)

1842
01:02:21,675 --> 01:02:23,214
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

1843
01:02:23,215 --> 01:02:25,045
(She makes full use of the space.)

1844
01:02:26,245 --> 01:02:28,915
(She never gets tired from dancing.)

1845
01:02:29,155 --> 01:02:30,254
It's "Emergency Room."

1846
01:02:30,255 --> 01:02:32,784
It's a remake of "Emergency Room."

1847
01:02:32,785 --> 01:02:34,485
- I got it. - You could get it when...

1848
01:02:34,785 --> 01:02:36,355
You were too hasty.

1849
01:02:37,355 --> 01:02:39,125
- I let you have it. - Thank you.

1850
01:02:39,295 --> 01:02:40,525
Young Ji got it.

1851
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:43,895
(Second song)

1852
01:02:44,665 --> 01:02:48,005
(Listen to the song and guess the singer and the title.)

1853
01:02:49,405 --> 01:02:51,005
- Quieties. - Quieties.

1854
01:02:51,545 --> 01:02:53,305
- One, two, three. - "MANIAC" by VIVIZ.

1855
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:55,445
Correct.

1856
01:02:55,975 --> 01:02:57,974
- This love is maniac - This love is maniac

1857
01:02:57,975 --> 01:02:59,014
Play the song.

1858
01:02:59,015 --> 01:03:00,615
(It's time to perform, girls.)

1859
01:03:01,085 --> 01:03:03,815
(Their positions are well-organized after the year-end performance.)

1860
01:03:05,855 --> 01:03:06,985
(Earth Arcade is maniac in a positive way.)

1861
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,454
- You don't know the dance. - Is it correct?

1862
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:09,994
(Not wasting a moment to provoke her)

1863
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:12,325
- Shouldn't they play that part? - I know from that part.

1864
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:14,395
- It's coming. - Just do the hip dance.

1865
01:03:14,795 --> 01:03:16,565
(Get ready for the chorus.)

1866
01:03:17,095 --> 01:03:19,465
(They heat up the engine with the rhythm.)

1867
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:22,304
(Provocative attraction)

1868
01:03:22,305 --> 01:03:23,335
You guys are good.

1869
01:03:25,045 --> 01:03:28,675
(Instinctive synchronized dance)

1870
01:03:30,115 --> 01:03:31,715
Okay, I'm stepping out first!

1871
01:03:31,785 --> 01:03:32,785
Let's go.

1872
01:03:33,285 --> 01:03:35,155
- Okay. - You're amazing.

1873
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:37,354
She's a radio personality now.

1874
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,854
- You're right. - She does radio.

1875
01:03:38,855 --> 01:03:42,225
I came across a lot of new songs as a radio personality.

1876
01:03:42,695 --> 01:03:44,425
(She is just envious.)

1877
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,625
(Loudies 1, Quieties 1)

1878
01:03:46,825 --> 01:03:48,064
- Just call for it. - Next.

1879
01:03:48,065 --> 01:03:49,065
Here you go.

1880
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:50,795
(Third song)

1881
01:03:53,235 --> 01:03:54,235
Loudies.

1882
01:03:54,236 --> 01:03:55,275
- What? - What?

1883
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,474
(Mimi guesses it just from the whistle?)

1884
01:03:58,475 --> 01:03:59,475
- One, two, three. - You don't know.

1885
01:03:59,476 --> 01:04:00,575
She just called for it.

1886
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:02,114
- Wrong. - What...

1887
01:04:02,115 --> 01:04:03,315
You just called for it.

1888
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:05,514
I have the chance now, right?

1889
01:04:05,515 --> 01:04:07,014
- What song is this? - Yes, for the next 10 seconds.

1890
01:04:07,015 --> 01:04:08,144
Yu Jin has the chance to answer.

1891
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:10,115
Ten, nine, eight,

1892
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:11,985
seven, six,

1893
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:13,955
- Quieties! - five. Quieties.

1894
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:15,625
- Three, two, one. - "S-Class" by Stray Kids.

1895
01:04:16,395 --> 01:04:17,425
Correct!

1896
01:04:18,695 --> 01:04:20,195
(It's okay, Mimi.)

1897
01:04:20,865 --> 01:04:22,865
(Celebrating the answer)

1898
01:04:23,165 --> 01:04:24,565
(Comforting themselves)

1899
01:04:25,005 --> 01:04:26,664
That's right. You know it!

1900
01:04:26,665 --> 01:04:27,665
- Yes, Mimi. - You know.

1901
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:28,874
- You know the song. - You know.

1902
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:29,905
(Everyone is confused to see her dancing pretty accurately.)

1903
01:04:30,735 --> 01:04:32,404
(Powerful movements from someone who supposedly doesn't know it)

1904
01:04:32,405 --> 01:04:34,175
- You knew. - You know it.

1905
01:04:34,675 --> 01:04:36,945
It's even more infuriating to see her dance after she got it wrong.

1906
01:04:38,515 --> 01:04:41,415
- You know the song perfectly well. - You know it perfectly well.

1907
01:04:41,485 --> 01:04:42,514
I only know the chorus.

1908
01:04:42,515 --> 01:04:43,854
(Mimi only knows the chorus.)

1909
01:04:43,855 --> 01:04:46,084
It's fine, Mimi. I was late.

1910
01:04:46,085 --> 01:04:47,954
- The intro... - He mentioned Seoul in the lyrics.

1911
01:04:47,955 --> 01:04:49,555
- So "S-Class." - I was late.

1912
01:04:49,695 --> 01:04:51,294
With that, Quieties...

1913
01:04:51,295 --> 01:04:52,594
- takes the salad. - Thank you.

1914
01:04:52,595 --> 01:04:54,224
Take a bite to manage your blood sugar.

1915
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:55,235
Okay.

1916
01:04:55,335 --> 01:04:56,694
It's okay. I don't need to eat it.

1917
01:04:56,695 --> 01:04:57,935
The bell pepper looks good.

1918
01:04:58,335 --> 01:05:00,134
It's Mediterranean, so there's cucumber inside.

1919
01:05:00,135 --> 01:05:01,305
How does it taste?

1920
01:05:01,675 --> 01:05:03,775
- The salad is a bit sour. - Sour.

1921
01:05:03,935 --> 01:05:05,074
The bread is good.

1922
01:05:05,075 --> 01:05:06,345
- It's crunchy. - That...

1923
01:05:07,005 --> 01:05:08,874
I think Eun Ji will like it.

1924
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:11,315
(Eating cucumber and pita bread at the same time)

1925
01:05:11,615 --> 01:05:14,484
It tastes even better because of grilled pita bread.

1926
01:05:14,485 --> 01:05:16,054
They taste good together.

1927
01:05:16,055 --> 01:05:17,655
This is the kick.

1928
01:05:18,725 --> 01:05:22,094
The sauce is nice. Olive oil,

1929
01:05:22,095 --> 01:05:24,295
- Oriental. - salt, pepper, and so on.

1930
01:05:24,525 --> 01:05:26,024
I see.

1931
01:05:26,025 --> 01:05:27,525
Okay, I'm not interested. Next.

1932
01:05:28,895 --> 01:05:30,135
I feel the same way.

1933
01:05:30,735 --> 01:05:32,235
- Here comes the second dish. - Hello.

1934
01:05:32,365 --> 01:05:33,534
- Hello. - This is it.

1935
01:05:33,535 --> 01:05:35,004
- Mimi, this looks good. - We must eat this.

1936
01:05:35,005 --> 01:05:36,074
Let's eat this.

1937
01:05:36,075 --> 01:05:38,744
Let's choose the right year for this.

1938
01:05:38,745 --> 01:05:39,745
(Let's choose the right year for this.)

1939
01:05:39,746 --> 01:05:42,245
The second dish is chicken shawarma.

1940
01:05:42,675 --> 01:05:44,544
It's thinly-cut and grilled marinated chicken...

1941
01:05:44,545 --> 01:05:46,915
wrapped in bread like tortilla.

1942
01:05:47,415 --> 01:05:48,515
It's a chicken wrap.

1943
01:05:49,185 --> 01:05:50,355
Chicken wrap.

1944
01:05:51,285 --> 01:05:53,655
(Full of thinly-sliced chicken with the sauce soaked in)

1945
01:05:54,585 --> 01:05:57,095
(It goes very well with sour yogurt sauce.)

1946
01:05:57,725 --> 01:06:00,465
(Chicken shawarma)

1947
01:06:00,595 --> 01:06:01,625
It looks good.

1948
01:06:02,495 --> 01:06:04,465
We must eat this, Mimi. We must.

1949
01:06:05,305 --> 01:06:07,234
(Round 2, chicken shawarma)

1950
01:06:07,235 --> 01:06:10,804
For this round, can Agent Mi Hyun...

1951
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:12,404
- pick the year? - Yes.

1952
01:06:12,405 --> 01:06:14,144
- Of course. - Mi Hyun, if you will.

1953
01:06:14,145 --> 01:06:15,615
- Thank you. - Wait, your hand.

1954
01:06:17,675 --> 01:06:18,984
- What's that? - The Na'vi's greeting.

1955
01:06:18,985 --> 01:06:20,345
(Wishing luck in the Na'vi language)

1956
01:06:20,445 --> 01:06:21,754
- I'm nervous. - She used to be...

1957
01:06:21,755 --> 01:06:22,955
"ttorukkumaktto."

1958
01:06:24,015 --> 01:06:25,084
(Which year did she pick with the power of Na'vi?)

1959
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:26,684
Pay the Na'vi respect.

1960
01:06:26,685 --> 01:06:27,925
(Which year did she pick with the power of Na'vi?)

1961
01:06:28,425 --> 01:06:29,624
We're doomed.

1962
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:30,695
- It's okay. - What?

1963
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:32,265
What is it?

1964
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:33,595
I think it's the same.

1965
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:34,964
It's the same.

1966
01:06:34,965 --> 01:06:37,365
- One more time. - Let's get it.

1967
01:06:37,465 --> 01:06:39,605
I'm not sure about year 2021.

1968
01:06:40,305 --> 01:06:42,004
In Mimi's case, I think Young Ji could...

1969
01:06:42,005 --> 01:06:43,805
give her a hand signal at least.

1970
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,804
- Why? - Coaching her with signal is...

1971
01:06:45,805 --> 01:06:46,944
That's because... look.

1972
01:06:46,945 --> 01:06:50,144
You live everyday listening to...

1973
01:06:50,145 --> 01:06:51,945
all the latest songs.

1974
01:06:52,115 --> 01:06:54,585
But she's someone who lives for eating bread.

1975
01:06:54,815 --> 01:06:56,284
- True. - Actually,

1976
01:06:56,285 --> 01:06:57,854
she only does yoga and eats bread.

1977
01:06:57,855 --> 01:06:58,855
She does yoga, eats bread, and boxes.

1978
01:06:58,856 --> 01:07:00,254
You have to let me use hand signals.

1979
01:07:00,255 --> 01:07:01,454
- Okay. - You have to give me that.

1980
01:07:01,455 --> 01:07:03,824
- She's just old. - She won't get the signals anyway.

1981
01:07:03,825 --> 01:07:05,495
- But no making sounds. - I won't.

1982
01:07:05,565 --> 01:07:06,724
Okay. I'll use hand signals.

1983
01:07:06,725 --> 01:07:09,034
I can't wait to see how she'll pull off the hand signals.

1984
01:07:09,035 --> 01:07:10,694
Yu Jin can look at it too.

1985
01:07:10,695 --> 01:07:11,865
That's true.

1986
01:07:12,665 --> 01:07:15,505
(First song)

1987
01:07:16,205 --> 01:07:18,005
- Loudies. - Loudies!

1988
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:19,345
"Maestro" by SEVENTEEN.

1989
01:07:20,545 --> 01:07:21,574
Correct!

1990
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:22,915
("Maestro" by SEVENTEEN)

1991
01:07:23,245 --> 01:07:24,415
How can you know that?

1992
01:07:24,575 --> 01:07:26,485
That's truly quick.

1993
01:07:26,745 --> 01:07:29,055
(She heads to the stage as if it was her rightful place.)

1994
01:07:29,185 --> 01:07:31,185
Why are you going out there?

1995
01:07:31,555 --> 01:07:33,285
(She surrenders herself to the beat.)

1996
01:07:33,955 --> 01:07:35,354
You're doing so good.

1997
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:36,955
(She's showing her manic side.)

1998
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:41,265
(She channels the power of Agent F's lamp,)

1999
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,095
(to summon the Genie.)

2000
01:07:43,395 --> 01:07:46,405
(She moves to the maestro's command.)

2001
01:07:47,805 --> 01:07:49,475
(The music is cut off.)

2002
01:07:49,535 --> 01:07:51,235
Why didn't you play this part?

2003
01:07:51,305 --> 01:07:53,945
Wait a minute. You have to play this part.

2004
01:07:53,975 --> 01:07:56,315
Please play the killing part. I'm asking you sincerely.

2005
01:07:57,315 --> 01:07:59,515
(This is the highlight of the song.)

2006
01:08:02,155 --> 01:08:05,355
(The dance section that breaks down the beat into sharp moves)

2007
01:08:06,155 --> 01:08:08,555
(Known as the "killing part" for its possessed footwork)

2008
01:08:09,025 --> 01:08:10,095
Sorry. Let me try again.

2009
01:08:11,055 --> 01:08:12,124
Not this.

2010
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:13,125
(The staff got the wrong section again.)

2011
01:08:13,725 --> 01:08:16,265
(I protect my players.)

2012
01:08:16,395 --> 01:08:18,235
I can't go on if you keep doing this.

2013
01:08:18,665 --> 01:08:20,265
I have to go on a strike.

2014
01:08:21,065 --> 01:08:23,435
- I'm so sorry. - Sorry.

2015
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,305
This is the last time.

2016
01:08:25,345 --> 01:08:26,845
- The song is playing. - I mean it.

2017
01:08:26,975 --> 01:08:27,975
Let's do this.

2018
01:08:27,976 --> 01:08:29,575
(Keeping in sync with the maestro's direction)

2019
01:08:33,315 --> 01:08:34,745
(Going over the top)

2020
01:08:35,655 --> 01:08:37,615
(She trashes her arms and legs as if possessed.)

2021
01:08:37,815 --> 01:08:38,984
(It turns out she's a black magician.)

2022
01:08:38,985 --> 01:08:40,055
Keep going!

2023
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,055
(She finishes off her conducting.)

2024
01:08:43,555 --> 01:08:45,995
(She receives a shower of applause.)

2025
01:08:46,095 --> 01:08:48,064
I was just thinking, we're here to do a music quiz.

2026
01:08:48,065 --> 01:08:49,365
Why did you make us wear sneakers?

2027
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:52,565
(We had a feeling this might happen.)

2028
01:08:52,765 --> 01:08:55,404
- You would end up... - Worried we'd get hurt?

2029
01:08:55,405 --> 01:08:56,434
Okay.

2030
01:08:56,435 --> 01:08:57,504
Next.

2031
01:08:57,505 --> 01:08:58,845
(Second song)

2032
01:08:59,945 --> 01:09:03,615
(A sweet piano melody)

2033
01:09:03,975 --> 01:09:04,975
(You don't know?)

2034
01:09:04,976 --> 01:09:06,785
(I don't know.)

2035
01:09:07,485 --> 01:09:09,714
Qui... Quieties!

2036
01:09:09,715 --> 01:09:10,715
- Quieties. - Quieties!

2037
01:09:11,285 --> 01:09:12,955
- Eclipse. - Eclipse?

2038
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:14,155
"Sudden Shower."

2039
01:09:14,385 --> 01:09:15,395
Correct!

2040
01:09:16,095 --> 01:09:17,294
- Seon Jae! - Seon Jae.

2041
01:09:17,295 --> 01:09:19,365
- Seon Jae! - It's Seon Jae.

2042
01:09:19,695 --> 01:09:20,795
Seon Jae!

2043
01:09:21,965 --> 01:09:24,065
(Hearing her call, Seon Jae comes running.)

2044
01:09:24,695 --> 01:09:26,135
(Running off with Yu Jin on her back)

2045
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:27,835
(It's a reinterpretation of "Lovely Runner.")

2046
01:09:27,965 --> 01:09:29,104
Seon Jae!

2047
01:09:29,105 --> 01:09:30,105
(That's the only line she knows.)

2048
01:09:30,735 --> 01:09:32,505
Get on my back.

2049
01:09:32,975 --> 01:09:35,515
(Turns out, this one's Seon Jae too.)

2050
01:09:35,775 --> 01:09:36,944
Seon Jae!

2051
01:09:36,945 --> 01:09:39,315
(A chicken fight?)

2052
01:09:41,285 --> 01:09:42,755
I thought I'd never see you.

2053
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:44,654
Seon Jae.

2054
01:09:44,655 --> 01:09:46,255
(Has she reunited with Seon Jae?)

2055
01:09:46,655 --> 01:09:48,525
(Very exciting)

2056
01:09:49,155 --> 01:09:50,225
Seon Jae.

2057
01:09:53,025 --> 01:09:54,295
(Me?)

2058
01:09:54,395 --> 01:09:55,935
Do you recognize me?

2059
01:09:56,165 --> 01:09:57,735
(I'm not buying.)

2060
01:09:58,235 --> 01:10:00,105
(Kendrick Seon Jae)

2061
01:10:00,205 --> 01:10:01,464
- Kendrick's here. - She's like Kendrick.

2062
01:10:01,465 --> 01:10:02,705
(A somewhat hip ending)

2063
01:10:02,805 --> 01:10:04,534
- I know. - Have you seen "Lovely Runner?"

2064
01:10:04,535 --> 01:10:05,804
- Of course. - I haven't seen it.

2065
01:10:05,805 --> 01:10:06,805
- I haven't seen it either. - It's okay.
Seon Jae!

2066
01:10:07,806 --> 01:10:08,844
(She's about to wear out Seon Jae's name.)

2067
01:10:08,845 --> 01:10:10,715
Stop calling him. He's at home.

2068
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,085
Have you seen the drama, Mr. Na?

2069
01:10:12,215 --> 01:10:13,884
Me? I've only seen the clips.

2070
01:10:13,885 --> 01:10:15,385
I'm perfectly in character.

2071
01:10:15,485 --> 01:10:16,785
It's because nobody has seen the drama.

2072
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:18,825
None of us has seen it.

2073
01:10:19,425 --> 01:10:21,085
(If you've seen the whole drama, please let us know.)

2074
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:23,995
- Next song. - I'm depending on her completely.

2075
01:10:24,825 --> 01:10:25,895
Next song.

2076
01:10:26,495 --> 01:10:28,465
(Third song)

2077
01:10:31,165 --> 01:10:32,335
This is my song!

2078
01:10:33,235 --> 01:10:34,435
This is my song!

2079
01:10:34,565 --> 01:10:35,605
You have to get it right.

2080
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,875
(Young Ji's song?)

2081
01:10:36,935 --> 01:10:39,005
Loudies!

2082
01:10:39,105 --> 01:10:40,605
(She's sending out hand signals.)

2083
01:10:40,645 --> 01:10:41,744
In 3, 2, 1.

2084
01:10:41,745 --> 01:10:43,014
It's Young Ji's song.

2085
01:10:43,015 --> 01:10:45,175
- Young Ji is... - No... Look at me!

2086
01:10:45,385 --> 01:10:46,644
Look at me!

2087
01:10:46,645 --> 01:10:47,684
Young Ji...

2088
01:10:47,685 --> 01:10:49,085
(What is Young Ji trying to describe?)

2089
01:10:49,655 --> 01:10:51,385
(What are you doing, Young Ji?)

2090
01:10:51,655 --> 01:10:53,325
(Her gestures grow bigger out of frustration.)

2091
01:10:53,825 --> 01:10:54,884
(It's practically a clue for the whole group now.)

2092
01:10:54,885 --> 01:10:56,025
Quieties.

2093
01:10:56,225 --> 01:10:58,154
Quieties.

2094
01:10:58,155 --> 01:10:59,394
- Quieties. - Quieties.

2095
01:10:59,395 --> 01:11:00,795
- Young Tak's... - Young Tak's...

2096
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:02,834
- In 3, 2, 1. - "FORM."

2097
01:11:02,835 --> 01:11:04,064
("FORM" by Young Tak)

2098
01:11:04,065 --> 01:11:05,705
- "FORM." - Correct!

2099
01:11:06,705 --> 01:11:08,265
- "FORM." - Correct!

2100
01:11:08,805 --> 01:11:11,705
(She goes to the stage to perform her song.)

2101
01:11:12,075 --> 01:11:13,505
Why is that song...

2102
01:11:13,675 --> 01:11:14,775
- Crazy - Crazy

2103
01:11:19,085 --> 01:11:21,645
(A polished performance, as it was her own song)

2104
01:11:22,155 --> 01:11:24,115
(When Young Ji calls,)

2105
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:26,385
(Yu Jin answers.)

2106
01:11:26,585 --> 01:11:27,855
Why is this your song?

2107
01:11:27,885 --> 01:11:29,595
Listen.

2108
01:11:29,725 --> 01:11:31,294
I'm really curious.

2109
01:11:31,295 --> 01:11:32,864
- How is this your song? - Yes, why?

2110
01:11:32,865 --> 01:11:34,925
- Yes, why? - I have a clear standard.

2111
01:11:35,265 --> 01:11:36,765
In addition to "Amor Fati,"

2112
01:11:36,895 --> 01:11:38,935
I've memorized even the second verse of this song perfectly.

2113
01:11:39,035 --> 01:11:40,564
But how am I supposed to know that?

2114
01:11:40,565 --> 01:11:42,134
- Just saying. - You're the only one who knows.

2115
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:43,304
- But the important thing is... - I need to know.

2116
01:11:43,305 --> 01:11:45,104
the clue I gave you was accurate.

2117
01:11:45,105 --> 01:11:46,275
- What? - What did you do?

2118
01:11:46,345 --> 01:11:47,445
Young Tak!

2119
01:11:48,775 --> 01:11:50,315
(It's easy to catch when you watch it again.)

2120
01:11:50,475 --> 01:11:52,285
(Young Tak)

2121
01:11:52,385 --> 01:11:54,045
(It makes a lot of sense once you get it)

2122
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,454
(So that's what it was.)

2123
01:11:56,455 --> 01:11:58,254
- Do you get it? - Great clue.

2124
01:11:58,255 --> 01:11:59,884
- Amazing. - Young Tak.

2125
01:11:59,885 --> 01:12:01,385
If that's the case...

2126
01:12:01,455 --> 01:12:02,725
Do we eat again?

2127
01:12:02,895 --> 01:12:05,225
- Young Ji is going to starve. - It's okay.

2128
01:12:05,465 --> 01:12:08,365
Chicken shawarma also goes to Team Quieties.

2129
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,565
- It's pretty spicy. - It's spicy.

2130
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:11,964
It's like gochujang.

2131
01:12:11,965 --> 01:12:13,364
I really want to eat it.

2132
01:12:13,365 --> 01:12:15,165
(I really want to eat it.)

2133
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:18,204
(She takes a big bite.)

2134
01:12:18,205 --> 01:12:19,345
No, don't do that.

2135
01:12:19,675 --> 01:12:22,575
The more you chew it, the tastier it becomes. Right?

2136
01:12:22,945 --> 01:12:25,215
Smell it. You can smell the chicken.

2137
01:12:25,745 --> 01:12:26,745
Smell the chicken.

2138
01:12:26,746 --> 01:12:28,215
(They are allowed to smell it.)

2139
01:12:28,315 --> 01:12:29,515
It's the kind of smell that has to be delicious.

2140
01:12:29,785 --> 01:12:32,385
Once you dip it in chili sauce, it kind of tastes like...

2141
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:33,854
- gochujang bulgogi! - Gochujang bulgogi!

2142
01:12:33,855 --> 01:12:35,225
It's like gochujang bulgogi

2143
01:12:35,895 --> 01:12:37,855
(She wants to eat it so bad, she looks as if she was glaring.)

2144
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:40,465
(She dips it generously in yogurt sauce too.)

2145
01:12:43,565 --> 01:12:45,764
- Yu Jin, this tastes even better. - It does?

2146
01:12:45,765 --> 01:12:47,435
- The white one looks tasty. - Yes.

2147
01:12:48,265 --> 01:12:50,575
(The tangy yogurt sauce goes perfectly with it.)

2148
01:12:50,905 --> 01:12:52,745
We need to feed Young Ji something.

2149
01:12:53,145 --> 01:12:54,945
(Mimi can only think about getting Young Ji something to eat.)

2150
01:12:55,275 --> 01:12:57,445
Have some water. Oh, right. You haven't eaten anything.

2151
01:12:57,675 --> 01:13:00,085
Rinse your mouth. Oh, right. You have no taste to wash away.

2152
01:13:00,885 --> 01:13:02,855
(Looking pathetic)

2153
01:13:03,615 --> 01:13:05,785
(She can only smack her lips.)

2154
01:13:05,985 --> 01:13:07,855
Show us the next dish.

2155
01:13:09,225 --> 01:13:11,525
(I see you.)

2156
01:13:12,165 --> 01:13:13,494
It must be something spicy.

2157
01:13:13,495 --> 01:13:14,824
(The third dish is revealed.)

2158
01:13:14,825 --> 01:13:15,995
It's carbs.

2159
01:13:16,765 --> 01:13:18,095
But it looks tasty.

2160
01:13:18,535 --> 01:13:20,135
- It's carbs. - It looks very interesting.

2161
01:13:20,765 --> 01:13:22,404
This is a rice dish popular...

2162
01:13:22,405 --> 01:13:23,604
- in India and South Asia. - Rice?

2163
01:13:23,605 --> 01:13:25,744
- It's chicken biryani. - Chicken biryani?

2164
01:13:25,745 --> 01:13:26,945
- Biryani. - It will be good.

2165
01:13:27,745 --> 01:13:31,445
(It is a rice dish made by steaming or stir-frying it with spices.)

2166
01:13:32,385 --> 01:13:34,945
(It is enhanced with the toasty richness of nuts.)

2167
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:38,215
(This is a savory blend of flavorful chicken and rice.)

2168
01:13:39,085 --> 01:13:41,555
(Chicken Biryani)

2169
01:13:41,685 --> 01:13:43,295
(Chicken biryani for Round 3)

2170
01:13:43,825 --> 01:13:46,024
Please just let Mi Hyun pick one more time.

2171
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:48,225
- Just? - Just let her. As a colleague.

2172
01:13:48,825 --> 01:13:49,935
I ask of you.

2173
01:13:50,365 --> 01:13:53,035
Let Mi Hyun pick the 2000s.

2174
01:13:53,065 --> 01:13:54,334
- Okay. - Yes.

2175
01:13:54,335 --> 01:13:55,365
- Okay. - Go on.

2176
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:56,735
I'm hopeless at this.

2177
01:13:57,805 --> 01:13:59,875
Please let Mi Hyun pick the 2000s.

2178
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:03,814
(Will Mimi have better luck this time?)

2179
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:05,375
I'm going to look.

2180
01:14:05,515 --> 01:14:06,744
- Oh, no. - Let me see.

2181
01:14:06,745 --> 01:14:07,985
It's our destiny.

2182
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:10,484
- It's not too bad. - It starts from year 2016.

2183
01:14:10,485 --> 01:14:12,285
- It's good. - Year 2016.

2184
01:14:12,585 --> 01:14:15,084
Year 2016 was when you were going through hard times.

2185
01:14:15,085 --> 01:14:16,354
It's perfect.

2186
01:14:16,355 --> 01:14:18,855
But she didn't listen to music when she was having a hard time.

2187
01:14:18,895 --> 01:14:20,165
When did you ever listen to music?

2188
01:14:20,725 --> 01:14:23,395
(Let us say this again. Mimi is the average.)

2189
01:14:23,765 --> 01:14:26,535
Can't you just play the "Avatar" soundtrack?

2190
01:14:27,565 --> 01:14:29,605
(All that's left is the genre of her own kind.)

2191
01:14:29,905 --> 01:14:32,775
Mimi watches dramas and movies, more than she listens to music.

2192
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:33,905
Isn't that true?

2193
01:14:34,005 --> 01:14:35,575
- That's right. - Yes.

2194
01:14:37,315 --> 01:14:38,574
She's really out of it.

2195
01:14:38,575 --> 01:14:39,744
She's maxed out on her guilt.

2196
01:14:39,745 --> 01:14:41,384
- She's out of it, so bear with me. - Okay.

2197
01:14:41,385 --> 01:14:42,514
Don't shake up our flow.

2198
01:14:42,515 --> 01:14:45,155
But honestly, the others are solving it too fast.

2199
01:14:45,185 --> 01:14:47,855
I agree. We are... I mean, they have...

2200
01:14:47,955 --> 01:14:49,754
They have the internet wired into their prefrontal cortex

2201
01:14:49,755 --> 01:14:52,194
Come on, isn't that a basic thing for a secret agent?

2202
01:14:52,195 --> 01:14:53,995
Don't worry. You've never been secretive.

2203
01:14:54,425 --> 01:14:55,794
You're not secretive at all.

2204
01:14:55,795 --> 01:14:57,334
- Is that a good thing? - You put on bright red lipstick.

2205
01:14:57,335 --> 01:14:58,395
You're not secretive.

2206
01:14:59,105 --> 01:15:00,735
- Is that a good thing or bad? - It's a good thing.

2207
01:15:01,435 --> 01:15:03,035
(First song)

2208
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:05,905
- Loudies. - Quieties.

2209
01:15:05,975 --> 01:15:07,275
- She called it first. - Loudies.

2210
01:15:07,575 --> 01:15:08,604
- Loudies. - Quieties.

2211
01:15:08,605 --> 01:15:09,614
She called it first.

2212
01:15:09,615 --> 01:15:11,145
- She said it first. - She did.

2213
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,315
Three, two, one.

2214
01:15:13,515 --> 01:15:14,714
Three, two, one.

2215
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:15,915
- I don't know. - Wrong!

2216
01:15:16,785 --> 01:15:18,315
(They're partners in a painful fate.)

2217
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:20,024
- Wrong! - Quieties!

2218
01:15:20,025 --> 01:15:21,755
Is it "Journey to Atlantis" by LABOUM?

2219
01:15:22,725 --> 01:15:23,825
Correct!

2220
01:15:24,695 --> 01:15:25,725
I remember.

2221
01:15:28,765 --> 01:15:31,295
(She's a K-pop master who nailed it instantly.)

2222
01:15:32,535 --> 01:15:34,165
(She's adding imagination to her dancing.)

2223
01:15:34,665 --> 01:15:36,405
(Feeling proud of Yu Jin)

2224
01:15:36,805 --> 01:15:38,504
I worked with them before.

2225
01:15:38,505 --> 01:15:39,505
(It makes her feel more frustrated.)

2226
01:15:41,075 --> 01:15:43,415
(I didn't work with them, but I still know.)

2227
01:15:44,715 --> 01:15:46,715
(This backup dancer dances with her face.)

2228
01:15:47,685 --> 01:15:50,285
(I'm good, right?)

2229
01:15:51,455 --> 01:15:53,285
All right, that's enough. Come back in now.

2230
01:15:53,855 --> 01:15:55,384
- Food will get cold. - "Journey to Atlantis."

2231
01:15:55,385 --> 01:15:56,595
Food will get cold. Come back in.

2232
01:15:57,755 --> 01:16:00,865
(This is a breeze for a K-pop master.)

2233
01:16:01,025 --> 01:16:02,064
What am I going to do?

2234
01:16:02,065 --> 01:16:04,135
(The opponent is way too strong.)

2235
01:16:04,295 --> 01:16:05,434
- You can do it. - You can do it, Mimi.

2236
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:06,535
Really?

2237
01:16:06,665 --> 01:16:07,734
(Will Young Ji's cheering work?)

2238
01:16:07,735 --> 01:16:08,865
The next song.

2239
01:16:09,475 --> 01:16:12,375
(Second song)

2240
01:16:12,775 --> 01:16:13,805
Loudies.

2241
01:16:14,475 --> 01:16:15,674
(She just heard the lyrics, "Hey boy.")

2242
01:16:15,675 --> 01:16:16,715
Loudies.

2243
01:16:17,145 --> 01:16:19,585
I'm going to make it simple for you. "Yes or Yes" by TWICE.

2244
01:16:20,145 --> 01:16:21,145
Correct!

2245
01:16:21,146 --> 01:16:22,554
("Yes or Yes" by TWICE)

2246
01:16:22,555 --> 01:16:24,255
You're amazing.

2247
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,685
Two choices

2248
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:29,225
Yes or...

2249
01:16:29,525 --> 01:16:30,525
- Yes - Yes

2250
01:16:31,455 --> 01:16:32,924
(Turn up the energy!)

2251
01:16:32,925 --> 01:16:33,925
What are they doing?
(Singing)

2252
01:16:35,935 --> 01:16:37,365
(Basically, it's our kind of karaoke.)

2253
01:16:37,865 --> 01:16:40,835
(She's the one who's learned the choreo.)

2254
01:16:41,635 --> 01:16:43,905
(She's the one who's totally into herself.)

2255
01:16:44,675 --> 01:16:47,375
(She's the one who jumps straight into falsetto.)

2256
01:16:47,845 --> 01:16:50,075
(Just choose one)

2257
01:16:51,215 --> 01:16:52,215
- Yes! - Good!
(That was fun.)

2258
01:16:53,415 --> 01:16:55,485
(There's always the one who wants to be the ending fairy.)

2259
01:16:56,015 --> 01:16:58,515
(It's not easy to settle down.)

2260
01:16:58,755 --> 01:17:00,555
Yu Jin is in full-on hype mode right now.

2261
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:02,185
It's been a while, but this is really fun.

2262
01:17:02,925 --> 01:17:04,594
(Young Ji moves to a spot where her signal can been seen clearly.)

2263
01:17:04,595 --> 01:17:05,595
I'll be here.

2264
01:17:05,825 --> 01:17:06,825
That's perfect.

2265
01:17:06,826 --> 01:17:08,925
Yu Jin did that.

2266
01:17:09,135 --> 01:17:10,135
Okay, I see you.

2267
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:12,165
Is the score 1 to 1? Mimi versus Eun Ji.

2268
01:17:13,435 --> 01:17:15,035
Mimi, let's do this in a fun way.

2269
01:17:16,075 --> 01:17:17,404
Let's take it slowly.

2270
01:17:17,405 --> 01:17:20,445
(Who will be the winner of Round 3?)

2271
01:17:20,945 --> 01:17:22,575
(Third song)

2272
01:17:25,175 --> 01:17:27,085
(Glancing at Young Ji)

2273
01:17:27,485 --> 01:17:28,485
(I don't know this one.)

2274
01:17:29,355 --> 01:17:30,815
(Sending hand signal)

2275
01:17:31,315 --> 01:17:32,315
Wait.

2276
01:17:32,316 --> 01:17:33,755
(It's right on the tip of her tongue.)

2277
01:17:34,355 --> 01:17:36,595
(Eun Ji is not sure either.)

2278
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:37,924
(Total mayhem)

2279
01:17:37,925 --> 01:17:38,925
Loudies!

2280
01:17:39,725 --> 01:17:41,364
- Finally, Mimi. - Finally, it's Mimi!

2281
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:44,064
- SSAK3's... - SSAK3's...

2282
01:17:44,065 --> 01:17:45,065
"Summer."

2283
01:17:45,265 --> 01:17:47,104
"Summer" by SSAK3?

2284
01:17:47,105 --> 01:17:48,805
- Wrong! - No.

2285
01:17:50,075 --> 01:17:51,175
Quieties.

2286
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:53,705
- SSAK3's... - SSAK3's...

2287
01:17:54,105 --> 01:17:55,105
"Our Beach."

2288
01:17:55,345 --> 01:17:57,844
"Our Beach" is wrong!

2289
01:17:57,845 --> 01:18:00,915
- SSAK3's... - SSAK3's...

2290
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:02,385
"Summer Beach."

2291
01:18:03,915 --> 01:18:05,984
What is this? Yoga beach?

2292
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:06,985
(What is this yoga beach?)

2293
01:18:06,986 --> 01:18:08,085
Wrong! It's a wrong answer.

2294
01:18:08,185 --> 01:18:09,254
Let's listen a bit more, Mimi.

2295
01:18:09,255 --> 01:18:10,495
- A bit more. - Let's listen a bit more.

2296
01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:12,494
(They jump straight to the instrumental break.)

2297
01:18:12,495 --> 01:18:14,395
Hyo Ri is coming.

2298
01:18:16,165 --> 01:18:18,295
Quieties!

2299
01:18:18,965 --> 01:18:20,604
(She knows already?)

2300
01:18:20,605 --> 01:18:21,805
- SSAK3's... - SSAK3's...

2301
01:18:22,105 --> 01:18:23,875
"Beach Again."

2302
01:18:25,475 --> 01:18:26,475
Correct!

2303
01:18:26,476 --> 01:18:28,144
("Beach Again" by SSAK3)

2304
01:18:28,145 --> 01:18:29,145
Correct!

2305
01:18:29,146 --> 01:18:30,415
(Totally deflated)

2306
01:18:30,845 --> 01:18:32,545
(It's okay, Mimi.)

2307
01:18:33,515 --> 01:18:35,385
(With just two claps,)

2308
01:18:36,415 --> 01:18:38,985
(this level of choreo is a piece of cake.)

2309
01:18:41,385 --> 01:18:44,225
(Self-imposed hard training)

2310
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:47,494
(This is a classic choreo ending from back in the day.)

2311
01:18:47,495 --> 01:18:48,495
Thank you.

2312
01:18:50,265 --> 01:18:52,765
Did you give her the hand signal?

2313
01:18:53,165 --> 01:18:55,135
I gave a signal like this.

2314
01:18:57,405 --> 01:18:58,635
As in a clean sweep?

2315
01:18:59,405 --> 01:19:01,145
- I didn't get it. - You didn't?

2316
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:03,045
I thought you got it and felt proud.

2317
01:19:03,445 --> 01:19:04,675
You didn't get it. Sorry.

2318
01:19:05,045 --> 01:19:06,084
The food is here.

2319
01:19:06,085 --> 01:19:08,944
Team Quieties wins three games in a row.

2320
01:19:08,945 --> 01:19:10,355
(They try out chicken biryani.)

2321
01:19:12,315 --> 01:19:14,184
(Impressed)

2322
01:19:14,185 --> 01:19:15,624
Is there sauce underneath?

2323
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:16,825
- It looks like curry. - Looks good.

2324
01:19:16,925 --> 01:19:18,054
It smells of spices.

2325
01:19:18,055 --> 01:19:19,224
(Biryani is a Middle Eastern-style fried rice dish enjoyed by locals.)

2326
01:19:19,225 --> 01:19:20,824
You don't really anything too dense.

2327
01:19:20,825 --> 01:19:21,995
(I'm getting the feeling.)

2328
01:19:22,835 --> 01:19:24,995
(She takes a big spoonful.)

2329
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:26,865
- This is so good. - It is?

2330
01:19:26,965 --> 01:19:27,965
This is it.

2331
01:19:27,966 --> 01:19:29,375
(This is a taste enjoyed by young and old.)

2332
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:33,104
(She is burning up inside with envy.)

2333
01:19:33,105 --> 01:19:34,605
For real, this is the best!

2334
01:19:35,505 --> 01:19:37,315
Of all the food we tasted today, this is the best.

2335
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:40,285
- This is the best. - Mimi, don't look at them.

2336
01:19:40,715 --> 01:19:41,744
Don't even look in that direction.

2337
01:19:41,745 --> 01:19:43,314
- That's the good stuff. - Don't look at them.

2338
01:19:43,315 --> 01:19:45,014
- I know it. - I'm craving a soda.

2339
01:19:45,015 --> 01:19:46,024
- I want a soda. - Give them to us.

2340
01:19:46,025 --> 01:19:47,025
Then go back with confidence.

2341
01:19:49,495 --> 01:19:50,554
Thank you.

2342
01:19:50,555 --> 01:19:51,555
(Now, they are used to Cheol Yong's assistance.)

2343
01:19:51,556 --> 01:19:52,665
Thank you.

2344
01:19:52,765 --> 01:19:55,595
He's saying to enjoy your food and that you guys are the best.

2345
01:19:56,495 --> 01:19:58,535
(Enjoy the soda.)

2346
01:19:58,565 --> 01:19:59,735
Can we say akh?

2347
01:20:00,705 --> 01:20:02,505
- One, two, three, akh. - Akh.

2348
01:20:02,835 --> 01:20:03,835
Thank you.

2349
01:20:04,575 --> 01:20:06,345
What are you doing?

2350
01:20:06,575 --> 01:20:07,945
Can't we have this?

2351
01:20:08,045 --> 01:20:09,445
Are we not even allowed to have this?

2352
01:20:10,345 --> 01:20:12,475
Why have you become so evil?

2353
01:20:12,615 --> 01:20:14,885
- This is just too much. - You shouldn't be so mean.

2354
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:18,255
I thought it was the prize.

2355
01:20:19,985 --> 01:20:21,225
(They each take a sip peacefully.)

2356
01:20:24,355 --> 01:20:25,795
It feels super fresh.

2357
01:20:28,265 --> 01:20:30,765
It's so refreshing. It's sugar-free.

2358
01:20:30,865 --> 01:20:31,895
I like it.

2359
01:20:35,305 --> 01:20:36,874
I'm curious about one thing.

2360
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:38,074
Mimi, what's the year...

2361
01:20:38,075 --> 01:20:39,975
- you can deal with comfortably? - I think 2000s?

2362
01:20:40,405 --> 01:20:43,075
I think 2009 or 2005.

2363
01:20:43,675 --> 01:20:45,014
Would you give us one special treatment?

2364
01:20:45,015 --> 01:20:46,244
It depends on the next dish.

2365
01:20:46,245 --> 01:20:47,545
- Okay. - Check the next dish and decide.

2366
01:20:47,745 --> 01:20:50,385
- Let's look at the next dish. - Mimi, please.

2367
01:20:50,755 --> 01:20:52,085
Mimi, please.

2368
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:53,955
I want to have some carbs.

2369
01:20:54,255 --> 01:20:57,395
This dish should be familiar to you.

2370
01:20:57,995 --> 01:20:59,225
It's tandoori chicken pizza.

2371
01:21:00,165 --> 01:21:01,664
- Tandoori chicken pizza. - Tandoori chicken pizza.

2372
01:21:01,665 --> 01:21:02,795
I love tandoori chicken.

2373
01:21:03,335 --> 01:21:05,535
(There is tandoori chicken evenly coated in seasoning.)

2374
01:21:06,005 --> 01:21:08,265
(It's topped generously with vegetables and cheese.)

2375
01:21:09,535 --> 01:21:12,035
(Familiar flavors taste even better.)

2376
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:15,605
(Tandoori chicken pizza)

2377
01:21:15,805 --> 01:21:17,744
- This dish is included in... - The crew's pick.

2378
01:21:17,745 --> 01:21:19,175
the tops three picks of the production crew.

2379
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:20,815
- Mimi, I need this. - Okay.

2380
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,315
Which country are you from?

2381
01:21:22,815 --> 01:21:24,155
- I beg you. - Okay.

2382
01:21:24,485 --> 01:21:26,185
(Round 4 for tandoori chicken pizza)

2383
01:21:26,555 --> 01:21:28,624
- Which region? - Can't we do year 2009?

2384
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:29,995
You were born in 2003. I beg you.

2385
01:21:30,295 --> 01:21:31,624
We need to think about it.

2386
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,894
Please take your time and think about it. I trust you.

2387
01:21:33,895 --> 01:21:35,165
You're an intellectual.

2388
01:21:35,495 --> 01:21:38,934
Then, can you tell us when you think the Quieties...

2389
01:21:38,935 --> 01:21:41,004
look the prettiest?

2390
01:21:41,005 --> 01:21:42,775
You look pretty around the clock.

2391
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:45,104
There is no time when you are not pretty.

2392
01:21:45,105 --> 01:21:47,304
- You're always pretty. - I see.

2393
01:21:47,305 --> 01:21:48,875
Even your bad breath is pretty.

2394
01:21:49,675 --> 01:21:50,744
(This is a compliment with uncommon depth.)

2395
01:21:50,745 --> 01:21:51,745
They don't have bad breath.

2396
01:21:51,746 --> 01:21:53,645
- Even in the morning. - It's fragrant.

2397
01:21:54,015 --> 01:21:55,485
You look really young.

2398
01:21:56,615 --> 01:21:57,915
You look like a four-year-old.

2399
01:21:58,015 --> 01:21:59,154
I'm 34.

2400
01:21:59,155 --> 01:22:01,125
You're 4. Take out the 30 years.

2401
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:02,825
No, I'm 34 years old.

2402
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:04,855
Stick the 30 years in your purse.

2403
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:06,864
You're so young.

2404
01:22:06,865 --> 01:22:08,894
- Okay, then... - Thank you.

2405
01:22:08,895 --> 01:22:10,335
- Then... - Then, year 2009?

2406
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,765
We'll take a pick.

2407
01:22:14,235 --> 01:22:15,965
No, just joking.

2408
01:22:16,075 --> 01:22:17,474
- Thank you. - I see you.

2409
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:19,605
- I see you. - I'm truly grateful.

2410
01:22:19,705 --> 01:22:22,574
- Year 2009. - I'll choose a song...

2411
01:22:22,575 --> 01:22:24,315
- from year 2009 to 2011. - I don't really know this period.

2412
01:22:24,515 --> 01:22:26,345
- I'll give you the signal. - I'll try my best.

2413
01:22:27,015 --> 01:22:28,745
- Got it! Loudies! - Loudies.

2414
01:22:29,085 --> 01:22:30,315
"NU ABO" by f(x)?

2415
01:22:30,415 --> 01:22:32,155
- "Nu..." - "ABO."

2416
01:22:32,855 --> 01:22:33,954
- Correct! - Good job.

2417
01:22:33,955 --> 01:22:34,955
Go for it.

2418
01:22:35,385 --> 01:22:37,255
(Mystery)

2419
01:22:37,925 --> 01:22:40,065
(I don't know how I got the right answer.)

2420
01:22:42,895 --> 01:22:44,965
(Knockoff Krystal crashes in.)

2421
01:22:45,465 --> 01:22:47,235
(Come here.)

2422
01:22:47,635 --> 01:22:48,964
(Song features a move where members lift their tops and show their abs.)

2423
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:50,275
(Krystal's abs became a hot topic as a result.)

2424
01:22:50,935 --> 01:22:53,075
(Playing push-and-pull with knockoff Krystal)

2425
01:22:53,275 --> 01:22:54,275
Let's do this!

2426
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:59,985
(Loudies see hope with Young Ji's shining play.)

2427
01:23:00,815 --> 01:23:02,885
(And the next song is...)

2428
01:23:03,015 --> 01:23:04,755
Eun Ji. Quieties.

2429
01:23:06,015 --> 01:23:08,225
- "Y" by Free Style. - Correct!

2430
01:23:09,455 --> 01:23:11,394
- Don't get nervous! - Really?

2431
01:23:11,395 --> 01:23:12,424
Don't get nervous.

2432
01:23:12,425 --> 01:23:14,125
You can do it. You already know the answer.

2433
01:23:14,225 --> 01:23:16,194
- I do? - What should I do, Mimi?

2434
01:23:16,195 --> 01:23:18,465
(Unfortunately, her opponent is Yu Jin again.)

2435
01:23:18,665 --> 01:23:20,604
- Quieties! - Quieties!

2436
01:23:20,605 --> 01:23:22,235
It's " U R Man" by SS501.

2437
01:23:23,605 --> 01:23:25,635
- Correct! - She got the answer?

2438
01:23:27,145 --> 01:23:29,205
(Today, they lost again.)

2439
01:23:31,275 --> 01:23:33,685
(The Quieties won all 4 rounds.)

2440
01:23:34,085 --> 01:23:36,315
(The Loudies didn't even win one round.)

2441
01:23:37,085 --> 01:23:39,655
(We have to go hungry again.)

2442
01:23:40,085 --> 01:23:42,625
(Same song, totally different vibe)

2443
01:23:43,095 --> 01:23:45,355
(Losing 4 times in a row makes it even more painful.)

2444
01:23:47,125 --> 01:23:49,495
(Young Ji's been infected with the misery too.)

2445
01:23:49,595 --> 01:23:51,495
I have to feed Young Ji something.

2446
01:23:51,865 --> 01:23:54,265
What's wrong, Young Ji? What's the matter?

2447
01:23:54,365 --> 01:23:56,304
What's wrong with you, Young Ji?

2448
01:23:56,305 --> 01:23:58,335
No, I'm fine.

2449
01:23:58,535 --> 01:24:00,775
- She's such a nice person. - It's all right.

2450
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:02,605
They are having a feast.

2451
01:24:03,575 --> 01:24:04,575
I know.

2452
01:24:04,576 --> 01:24:06,015
- They must be full. - They don't want to eat anymore.

2453
01:24:06,115 --> 01:24:07,615
Look, she's just going to go through the motions now.

2454
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:10,685
- Let's do this. - This is not just any pizza.

2455
01:24:10,785 --> 01:24:12,015
It's tandoori pizza.

2456
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,085
(She has a peak autopilot expression.)

2457
01:24:14,255 --> 01:24:15,955
I'm so full now.

2458
01:24:16,855 --> 01:24:18,155
I'm just a little full.

2459
01:24:18,295 --> 01:24:21,465
- I mean... - It's straight out of a stone oven.

2460
01:24:22,065 --> 01:24:23,264
She's being a DJ now.

2461
01:24:23,265 --> 01:24:24,464
It's straight out from a stone oven.

2462
01:24:24,465 --> 01:24:25,495
It has the smell of being baked in a stone oven?

2463
01:24:27,005 --> 01:24:29,304
(She opens her mouth wide open, but only nibbles at the end.)

2464
01:24:29,305 --> 01:24:31,374
- She's eating. - I think she's acting.

2465
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:32,375
She's acting.

2466
01:24:32,635 --> 01:24:34,445
(This is it.)

2467
01:24:34,675 --> 01:24:37,045
I think the cheese is amazing in this country.

2468
01:24:37,715 --> 01:24:38,715
It's really good.

2469
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:40,284
There was a lot of cheese before.

2470
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:41,345
- During lunch. - That's right.

2471
01:24:41,715 --> 01:24:43,414
Just pick the year like before. There's not much difference.

2472
01:24:43,415 --> 01:24:44,615
- There's not much difference. - I agree.

2473
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,454
- There isn't much difference. - Sorry about that.

2474
01:24:46,455 --> 01:24:48,254
I'm sorry.

2475
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:50,024
- I... Eun Ji, you pick. - Okay.

2476
01:24:50,025 --> 01:24:51,795
(Picking the year of the song for Round 5)

2477
01:24:51,995 --> 01:24:53,924
Mimi, we have to keep calm.

2478
01:24:53,925 --> 01:24:54,965
- Okay. - Yes.

2479
01:24:57,435 --> 01:24:59,434
- It's okay. - There are too many of these.

2480
01:24:59,435 --> 01:25:01,505
- It's the same as before. - You picked that year again.

2481
01:25:01,605 --> 01:25:02,605
It came back.
- Don't worry. - We can do this.

2482
01:25:03,606 --> 01:25:04,804
- Just trust me. - We can do this.

2483
01:25:04,805 --> 01:25:06,375
- You picked that year again. - It came back.

2484
01:25:06,945 --> 01:25:09,145
(The fifth dish enters.)

2485
01:25:09,275 --> 01:25:10,814
- It's protein. - It's steak.

2486
01:25:10,815 --> 01:25:11,974
It's a fish called hamour.

2487
01:25:11,975 --> 01:25:13,645
- Hamour. The name is pretty. - Yes.

2488
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:15,444
This is a local fish dish.

2489
01:25:15,445 --> 01:25:16,485
It's hamour.

2490
01:25:16,585 --> 01:25:19,185
(Hamour is a representative fish of UAE.)

2491
01:25:19,785 --> 01:25:22,685
(It is loved for its chewy texture.)

2492
01:25:23,025 --> 01:25:25,895
(Grilled hamour)

2493
01:25:26,055 --> 01:25:28,224
- Hamour. - It's really squishy-squishy.

2494
01:25:28,225 --> 01:25:29,635
- I know. - Squishy-squishy?

2495
01:25:30,635 --> 01:25:32,634
- You mean nice and thick? - Right.

2496
01:25:32,635 --> 01:25:34,365
(Grilled hamour for Round 5)

2497
01:25:34,465 --> 01:25:35,635
I'm giving you the next song.

2498
01:25:36,065 --> 01:25:38,435
(First song)

2499
01:25:39,335 --> 01:25:40,344
- Loudies! - Quieties.

2500
01:25:40,345 --> 01:25:41,544
Young Ji was quicker.

2501
01:25:41,545 --> 01:25:43,444
- NMIXX. - The answer is...

2502
01:25:43,445 --> 01:25:44,475
- NMIXX's... - "DASH."

2503
01:25:44,845 --> 01:25:46,545
- Quieties! - No, that's not it.

2504
01:25:47,015 --> 01:25:48,644
Quieties!

2505
01:25:48,645 --> 01:25:52,314
It's "See That?" by NMIXX.

2506
01:25:52,315 --> 01:25:54,254
- Correct! - Yes!

2507
01:25:54,255 --> 01:25:56,455
It shook me a bit.

2508
01:25:56,755 --> 01:25:57,755
I'm sorry.

2509
01:25:57,756 --> 01:25:59,095
(Patting on the back)

2510
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:01,365
(Eun Ji, am I good or what?)

2511
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:03,895
(Giving 5 stars to Yu Jin's skills)

2512
01:26:04,335 --> 01:26:06,535
(She's the top tier of music quizzes.)

2513
01:26:06,635 --> 01:26:09,235
(We go further up)

2514
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:11,735
(She's really talented.)

2515
01:26:12,205 --> 01:26:14,075
(This one is really talented too.)

2516
01:26:17,945 --> 01:26:21,084
The way I see it, Young Ji is the president of Asian culture.

2517
01:26:21,085 --> 01:26:24,255
And Yu Jin has become the president of K-pop.

2518
01:26:25,085 --> 01:26:26,085
- She knows everything. - Go to the next one.

2519
01:26:26,725 --> 01:26:29,424
- Mimi, wear this. - It's the next one.

2520
01:26:29,425 --> 01:26:30,495
- Yang Hee Eun's glasses. - Okay.

2521
01:26:31,255 --> 01:26:32,255
(Totemism)

2522
01:26:32,256 --> 01:26:33,265
It'll give you strength.

2523
01:26:33,325 --> 01:26:36,125
Mimi, you have such a good diction.

2524
01:26:36,195 --> 01:26:38,095
I really like that girl, Mimi.

2525
01:26:38,795 --> 01:26:41,335
Mimi is such a cool person.

2526
01:26:41,705 --> 01:26:43,704
Thank you, ma'am.

2527
01:26:43,705 --> 01:26:45,704
- Don't worry. - My gosh.

2528
01:26:45,705 --> 01:26:47,205
What is she doing over there?

2529
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:48,745
(Mocking An)

2530
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:49,815
She's mocking you.

2531
01:26:49,915 --> 01:26:51,515
She turned evil.

2532
01:26:52,075 --> 01:26:53,484
- I'm just excited. - Next song.

2533
01:26:53,485 --> 01:26:54,485
(Second song)

2534
01:26:54,486 --> 01:26:55,615
You got this!

2535
01:26:57,615 --> 01:26:58,615
What?

2536
01:26:58,616 --> 01:27:00,124
Loudies.

2537
01:27:00,125 --> 01:27:01,885
ZEROBASEONE's "Bob Bob."

2538
01:27:02,085 --> 01:27:03,094
Your answer?

2539
01:27:03,095 --> 01:27:04,455
ZEROBASEONE's "Pop Pop."

2540
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:06,465
- Wrong! - It's wrong?

2541
01:27:07,565 --> 01:27:08,595
I'm right.

2542
01:27:09,165 --> 01:27:10,195
Pop, pop?

2543
01:27:10,495 --> 01:27:12,895
(The melody has a "pop" to it.)

2544
01:27:13,465 --> 01:27:15,534
(Ms. Yang remains motionless.)

2545
01:27:15,535 --> 01:27:17,475
- Is ZEROBASEONE correct? - Yes, it's definitely them.

2546
01:27:18,535 --> 01:27:19,875
Quieties.

2547
01:27:20,175 --> 01:27:21,275
Quieties?

2548
01:27:21,745 --> 01:27:24,115
ZEROBASEONE's "Bubble Pop?"

2549
01:27:25,475 --> 01:27:26,484
Wrong!

2550
01:27:26,485 --> 01:27:27,814
- Bubble pop! - Loudies.

2551
01:27:27,815 --> 01:27:28,884
Wrong!

2552
01:27:28,885 --> 01:27:30,254
- Loudies. - Loudies?

2553
01:27:30,255 --> 01:27:31,714
- ZEROBASEONE's... - ZEROBASEONE's?

2554
01:27:31,715 --> 01:27:32,785
"Love Pop."

2555
01:27:34,655 --> 01:27:35,655
Wrong!

2556
01:27:35,685 --> 01:27:37,454
(Exclaiming)

2557
01:27:37,455 --> 01:27:38,455
(So close)

2558
01:27:38,655 --> 01:27:40,265
You had so much fun with that just now.

2559
01:27:41,295 --> 01:27:43,195
The lyrics might have a hint.

2560
01:27:43,595 --> 01:27:44,695
(Listening)

2561
01:27:45,095 --> 01:27:47,004
(Feel it clearly)

2562
01:27:47,005 --> 01:27:48,905
(Feel it, you can feel it)

2563
01:27:49,365 --> 01:27:50,535
Young Ji, did you get it?

2564
01:27:51,875 --> 01:27:54,275
(The guesser is lost in her dance.)

2565
01:27:55,605 --> 01:27:56,615
Do you know?

2566
01:27:56,845 --> 01:27:58,414
(No.)

2567
01:27:58,415 --> 01:27:59,445
Loudies.

2568
01:28:00,815 --> 01:28:01,815
Loudies.

2569
01:28:01,816 --> 01:28:02,985
(Mimi!)

2570
01:28:03,185 --> 01:28:05,815
Ms. Yang's glasses!

2571
01:28:06,215 --> 01:28:07,285
"Feeling POP?"

2572
01:28:08,055 --> 01:28:10,324
(Shouting)

2573
01:28:10,325 --> 01:28:11,424
You're so close!

2574
01:28:11,425 --> 01:28:12,594
Wrong!

2575
01:28:12,595 --> 01:28:13,924
Mimi, I think the glasses are working.

2576
01:28:13,925 --> 01:28:14,925
(Laughing)

2577
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:16,895
(Putting them on again and focusing)

2578
01:28:17,735 --> 01:28:19,295
- Quieties. - Quieties?

2579
01:28:20,305 --> 01:28:21,365
"Feel Pop?"

2580
01:28:23,135 --> 01:28:24,505
You're right there!

2581
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:26,544
What, what is it?

2582
01:28:26,545 --> 01:28:28,505
- You're 98 percent there! - 98?

2583
01:28:28,705 --> 01:28:29,705
Wrong!

2584
01:28:30,415 --> 01:28:32,775
(The song they are 98 percent close to is...)

2585
01:28:33,545 --> 01:28:37,055
(a song with a refreshing melody and popping energy.)

2586
01:28:38,055 --> 01:28:41,124
(ZEROBASEONE's "Feel the POP")

2587
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:42,125
Wrong!

2588
01:28:42,126 --> 01:28:44,494
(Feisty)

2589
01:28:44,495 --> 01:28:46,155
- Loudies. - Loudies?

2590
01:28:46,255 --> 01:28:47,365
"I feel POP."

2591
01:28:49,065 --> 01:28:50,095
Wrong!

2592
01:28:50,465 --> 01:28:51,565
You're further away from the correct answer.

2593
01:28:52,495 --> 01:28:53,704
(Disheartening results)

2594
01:28:53,705 --> 01:28:54,735
We're further away from the correct answer.

2595
01:28:54,935 --> 01:28:58,005
There is a word between feel and pop.

2596
01:28:58,875 --> 01:28:59,875
Loudies...

2597
01:29:01,305 --> 01:29:02,305
(Embarrassed)

2598
01:29:02,306 --> 01:29:03,845
Loudies.

2599
01:29:04,115 --> 01:29:05,245
"Feel POP POP?"

2600
01:29:05,515 --> 01:29:06,645
Wrong.

2601
01:29:07,345 --> 01:29:09,984
They're suggesting we feel a particular pop.

2602
01:29:09,985 --> 01:29:11,014
The one pop!

2603
01:29:11,015 --> 01:29:12,314
- Feel a particular... - One!

2604
01:29:12,315 --> 01:29:13,654
Feel a particular...

2605
01:29:13,655 --> 01:29:15,925
(It came to us.)

2606
01:29:16,355 --> 01:29:17,454
- Should I? - Go for it.

2607
01:29:17,455 --> 01:29:18,654
Loudies.

2608
01:29:18,655 --> 01:29:19,825
"Feel that POP."

2609
01:29:20,225 --> 01:29:21,425
(Eyes widening)

2610
01:29:21,925 --> 01:29:22,925
Wrong!

2611
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:24,594
(Chuckling)

2612
01:29:24,595 --> 01:29:25,735
I thought the same thing.

2613
01:29:26,465 --> 01:29:28,105
- Quieties! - Quieties!

2614
01:29:28,765 --> 01:29:30,135
(Guys, that's not it!)

2615
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:32,235
"Feel it POP."

2616
01:29:34,005 --> 01:29:35,305
Eun Ji!

2617
01:29:35,505 --> 01:29:36,875
Come on, Eun Ji!

2618
01:29:37,015 --> 01:29:38,015
One pop!
(What is it, then?)

2619
01:29:39,175 --> 01:29:41,285
This, this!

2620
01:29:41,685 --> 01:29:43,114
- Roudies! - Loudies.

2621
01:29:43,115 --> 01:29:44,855
"Feel this POP."

2622
01:29:45,285 --> 01:29:46,555
(Expectedly the wrong answer)

2623
01:29:47,155 --> 01:29:48,225
Wrong!

2624
01:29:48,685 --> 01:29:50,024
Wait, I...

2625
01:29:50,025 --> 01:29:53,565
I gave up on English in middle school.

2626
01:29:53,765 --> 01:29:57,534
I only learned up to the infinitives.

2627
01:29:57,535 --> 01:29:59,935
Feel that pop over there!

2628
01:30:00,105 --> 01:30:01,134
Eun Ji!

2629
01:30:01,135 --> 01:30:02,265
(It's "the!")

2630
01:30:02,465 --> 01:30:04,005
This is more confusing to me.

2631
01:30:04,475 --> 01:30:05,775
(In what year do you learn this?)

2632
01:30:05,975 --> 01:30:07,675
What word do you use when it's a particular one?

2633
01:30:08,645 --> 01:30:09,775
Just one.

2634
01:30:10,845 --> 01:30:12,274
When there's just one?

2635
01:30:12,275 --> 01:30:13,585
What?

2636
01:30:13,815 --> 01:30:14,884
When there's just one?

2637
01:30:14,885 --> 01:30:16,785
Quieties. "Feel one POP?"

2638
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:19,485
(Devastated)

2639
01:30:19,655 --> 01:30:21,325
I don't know English!

2640
01:30:21,555 --> 01:30:23,324
It came to her! Put the glasses on.

2641
01:30:23,325 --> 01:30:24,794
- Glasses on! - Put them on!

2642
01:30:24,795 --> 01:30:26,394
- Loudies. - Loudies?

2643
01:30:26,395 --> 01:30:27,795
"Feel is POP."

2644
01:30:29,065 --> 01:30:30,995
- Wrong. - You said there was just one.

2645
01:30:31,265 --> 01:30:32,965
This is so embarrassing.

2646
01:30:33,265 --> 01:30:34,965
I can't do this.

2647
01:30:35,265 --> 01:30:37,334
Can we keep getting this wrong?

2648
01:30:37,335 --> 01:30:38,674
I'm so embarrassed!

2649
01:30:38,675 --> 01:30:41,304
Okay, you feel pop. But it's not this pop or that pop.

2650
01:30:41,305 --> 01:30:43,545
- Feel this particular pop! - One pop!

2651
01:30:44,475 --> 01:30:46,615
Feel this particular pop!

2652
01:30:47,245 --> 01:30:48,315
Loudies.

2653
01:30:48,815 --> 01:30:49,915
"Feel the POP."

2654
01:30:51,115 --> 01:30:52,115
Correct!

2655
01:30:52,885 --> 01:30:53,985
This is so humiliating.

2656
01:30:56,155 --> 01:30:58,395
(Her body is defying her emotions.)

2657
01:30:59,795 --> 01:31:01,225
I'm so sorry, ZEROBASEONE!

2658
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:02,865
We're really sorry.

2659
01:31:03,095 --> 01:31:04,794
I should've studied English harder.

2660
01:31:04,795 --> 01:31:07,204
I gave up on English after the infinitives.

2661
01:31:07,205 --> 01:31:08,205
But Mimi.

2662
01:31:08,206 --> 01:31:10,404
"The" is way before the infinitives.

2663
01:31:10,405 --> 01:31:11,475
I wouldn't know.

2664
01:31:11,875 --> 01:31:13,805
- I think the glasses are working. - Yes.

2665
01:31:14,445 --> 01:31:15,544
(How are they working?)

2666
01:31:15,545 --> 01:31:16,714
Two people passed.

2667
01:31:16,715 --> 01:31:17,944
- It's one-on-one. - One-on-one.

2668
01:31:17,945 --> 01:31:18,945
Gosh.

2669
01:31:18,946 --> 01:31:20,445
- We can still win. - I've seen this before.

2670
01:31:20,545 --> 01:31:22,244
Ms. Yang is giving us strength.

2671
01:31:22,245 --> 01:31:24,155
(How would Round 5 end?)

2672
01:31:24,685 --> 01:31:26,255
(Third song)

2673
01:31:26,655 --> 01:31:29,385
(The song starts with the sound of a projector.)

2674
01:31:30,295 --> 01:31:31,725
- Mimi! - Loudies.

2675
01:31:31,925 --> 01:31:33,154
You definitely know this.

2676
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:34,665
- But I don't remember the title... - Your answer?

2677
01:31:34,925 --> 01:31:35,964
- I can't remember the song title. - Three, two, one!

2678
01:31:35,965 --> 01:31:38,165
I know it's a song of Red Velvet.

2679
01:31:38,335 --> 01:31:39,734
(Singing)

2680
01:31:39,735 --> 01:31:40,804
I know that.

2681
01:31:40,805 --> 01:31:41,864
Three, two, one!

2682
01:31:41,865 --> 01:31:43,204
- What's the title? - Wrong!

2683
01:31:43,205 --> 01:31:44,535
(That's the point of this game.)

2684
01:31:45,035 --> 01:31:47,175
(In Season Two, Mimi dressed up herself...)

2685
01:31:47,975 --> 01:31:50,245
(and spread the flower blossoms singing this song.)

2686
01:31:52,075 --> 01:31:56,315
(Red Velvet's "Feel My Rhythm")

2687
01:31:56,785 --> 01:31:58,414
(She doesn't remember any of that.)

2688
01:31:58,415 --> 01:31:59,954
Quieties!

2689
01:31:59,955 --> 01:32:01,655
- Quieties! - Quieties.

2690
01:32:02,385 --> 01:32:04,455
- Red Velvet's... - Red Velvet.

2691
01:32:04,655 --> 01:32:07,065
- "Feel the Rhythm." - Feel the?

2692
01:32:07,365 --> 01:32:08,524
"Feel the Rhythm."

2693
01:32:08,525 --> 01:32:11,265
(When it took her so long to think of "the" before...)

2694
01:32:11,665 --> 01:32:13,564
(She knows how to use the word now.)

2695
01:32:13,565 --> 01:32:14,934
Wrong!

2696
01:32:14,935 --> 01:32:16,435
It's not it?

2697
01:32:16,535 --> 01:32:18,405
(Mimi, it's "my.")

2698
01:32:18,635 --> 01:32:20,175
(Feisty is hinting with her whole body.)

2699
01:32:20,445 --> 01:32:21,874
Loudies!

2700
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:22,905
- Loudies. - Loudies?

2701
01:32:23,345 --> 01:32:24,575
"Feel my Rhythm."

2702
01:32:24,845 --> 01:32:26,575
- Red Velvet's? - Red Belbet's...

2703
01:32:27,115 --> 01:32:29,585
Red Velvet's "Feel My Rhythm."

2704
01:32:30,755 --> 01:32:33,015
Correct!

2705
01:32:33,785 --> 01:32:35,354
Let's spread the flowers!

2706
01:32:35,355 --> 01:32:36,795
(Mimi got a question right for the first time in an hour.)

2707
01:32:37,325 --> 01:32:38,894
Mimi, come and spread the flowers!

2708
01:32:38,895 --> 01:32:40,895
Come and spread the flowers!

2709
01:32:41,595 --> 01:32:44,565
(I have to do my victory dance!)

2710
01:32:44,895 --> 01:32:46,634
(Happy)

2711
01:32:46,635 --> 01:32:47,665
Young Ji!

2712
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,505
(Young Ji, who's been through a lot, also comes on stage.)

2713
01:32:50,775 --> 01:32:52,775
(Young Ji, aren't you glad we won?)

2714
01:32:53,075 --> 01:32:55,105
(Mimi, was this song always so sad?)

2715
01:32:55,405 --> 01:32:56,474
(Look at Young Ji!)

2716
01:32:56,475 --> 01:32:57,714
Wait.

2717
01:32:57,715 --> 01:32:59,245
Why are you so unhappy?

2718
01:32:59,475 --> 01:33:01,115
(No, I'm happy.)

2719
01:33:01,285 --> 01:33:03,785
Young Ji doesn't like fish, that's why.

2720
01:33:05,115 --> 01:33:07,925
(The food they fought to win just happens to be fish!)

2721
01:33:08,255 --> 01:33:10,995
I've never seen Young Ji have fish.

2722
01:33:11,455 --> 01:33:13,494
So, "the," "my," "this," "that."

2723
01:33:13,495 --> 01:33:15,524
Is this the kind of stuff we have trouble with?

2724
01:33:15,525 --> 01:33:17,235
This is the Earth Arcade, right?

2725
01:33:17,895 --> 01:33:19,164
(They're having their first food,)

2726
01:33:19,165 --> 01:33:20,465
(although Young Ji doesn't like it.)

2727
01:33:20,935 --> 01:33:22,834
- It looks great. - It does.

2728
01:33:22,835 --> 01:33:24,035
I'm actually learning English right now.

2729
01:33:25,405 --> 01:33:26,405
You're learning English?
You should study harder.

2730
01:33:27,406 --> 01:33:28,545
How is it, Mimi?

2731
01:33:28,805 --> 01:33:29,874
It's fun, but...

2732
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:31,615
No, how's the food?

2733
01:33:32,115 --> 01:33:33,715
(Mimi!)

2734
01:33:33,945 --> 01:33:35,514
(Laughing)

2735
01:33:35,515 --> 01:33:37,555
Learning English is fun?

2736
01:33:37,655 --> 01:33:39,115
That's nice.

2737
01:33:39,215 --> 01:33:40,254
I'm so jealous!

2738
01:33:40,255 --> 01:33:41,454
You have such a talent for comedy.

2739
01:33:41,455 --> 01:33:42,555
What a talent.

2740
01:33:44,155 --> 01:33:45,195
How is it?

2741
01:33:45,455 --> 01:33:47,095
- Gosh. - It's hamour.

2742
01:33:47,325 --> 01:33:48,525
How is it, Mimi?

2743
01:33:49,265 --> 01:33:50,335
It's interesting.

2744
01:33:52,235 --> 01:33:54,065
It's bland and vague.

2745
01:33:55,705 --> 01:33:58,375
(I guess hamour is not our type!)

2746
01:33:58,635 --> 01:34:00,675
- Learning English is fun. - Should we see the next dish?

2747
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:02,445
The next dish is...

2748
01:34:02,645 --> 01:34:04,774
the exploration crew's favorite.

2749
01:34:04,775 --> 01:34:06,714
- The team's favorite. - That's great.

2750
01:34:06,715 --> 01:34:07,715
Show us, please.

2751
01:34:08,185 --> 01:34:09,784
It must be something spicy.

2752
01:34:09,785 --> 01:34:10,855
(The exploration crew's favorite dish enters.)

2753
01:34:11,655 --> 01:34:13,154
Look, naan, our favorite!

2754
01:34:13,155 --> 01:34:15,085
It's curry!

2755
01:34:15,155 --> 01:34:16,184
- It's curry. - Mimi.

2756
01:34:16,185 --> 01:34:18,395
- I love curry. - We have to get this.

2757
01:34:19,595 --> 01:34:22,195
(Based with fresh tomato sauce and paneer cheese,)

2758
01:34:22,795 --> 01:34:25,735
(it's Indian curry with vegetables mixed in harmony.)

2759
01:34:26,635 --> 01:34:29,635
(It goes perfectly with naan, the members' favorite.)

2760
01:34:30,675 --> 01:34:34,604
(Paneer masala curry)

2761
01:34:34,605 --> 01:34:36,544
The potatoes here are so good.

2762
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:37,974
And it looks warm.

2763
01:34:37,975 --> 01:34:39,175
- Is it warm? - It is.

2764
01:34:39,275 --> 01:34:41,184
- I really want to have this, Mimi. - Okay.

2765
01:34:41,185 --> 01:34:42,445
(Round 6)

2766
01:34:42,615 --> 01:34:44,615
It'll be so good to dip it in curry.

2767
01:34:44,915 --> 01:34:45,985
Mimi.

2768
01:34:46,255 --> 01:34:48,785
You know I love you.

2769
01:34:48,955 --> 01:34:50,524
Could I...

2770
01:34:50,525 --> 01:34:52,424
pick the years this one time?

2771
01:34:52,425 --> 01:34:53,425
Yes.

2772
01:34:53,426 --> 01:34:55,025
Sorry, that doesn't work.

2773
01:34:57,695 --> 01:34:59,495
(All that for nothing)

2774
01:34:59,665 --> 01:35:01,504
You didn't pick today, Young Ji?

2775
01:35:01,505 --> 01:35:03,135
- No. - If that's the case...

2776
01:35:03,575 --> 01:35:05,475
- Thank you. - Sorry, still no.

2777
01:35:05,635 --> 01:35:07,574
(Sad)

2778
01:35:07,575 --> 01:35:08,874
- You can pick. - Thank you!

2779
01:35:08,875 --> 01:35:09,875
Sure.

2780
01:35:09,876 --> 01:35:12,175
(Swallowing her pride)

2781
01:35:12,545 --> 01:35:14,745
- I hope you pick well. - I think she'll pick well.

2782
01:35:16,955 --> 01:35:17,985
What is it?

2783
01:35:18,585 --> 01:35:20,085
Why are you reading it secretly?

2784
01:35:20,185 --> 01:35:21,354
(We're all supposed to know.)

2785
01:35:21,355 --> 01:35:22,555
You look like someone at a wedding...

2786
01:35:23,525 --> 01:35:24,694
paying congratulatory money.

2787
01:35:24,695 --> 01:35:27,424
It's 2001 to 2005!

2788
01:35:27,425 --> 01:35:29,065
It's your period, Mimi! Maybe not...

2789
01:35:29,195 --> 01:35:30,365
- No, it is! - Great!

2790
01:35:30,565 --> 01:35:31,664
Show us!

2791
01:35:31,665 --> 01:35:33,165
It's 2001 to 2005.

2792
01:35:34,605 --> 01:35:37,605
But that team also has Lee Yong Su.

2793
01:35:37,775 --> 01:35:39,074
I know.

2794
01:35:39,075 --> 01:35:41,145
Hello, I'm Lee Eun Ji, born on January 16, 1992.

2795
01:35:41,275 --> 01:35:43,045
That's when I was in fourth grade in elementary school.

2796
01:35:43,205 --> 01:35:45,174
This is before Yu Jin started school, right?

2797
01:35:45,175 --> 01:35:46,814
Year 2001 is before I was born.

2798
01:35:46,815 --> 01:35:48,114
Yes, if it's 2005...

2799
01:35:48,115 --> 01:35:49,615
I also wasn't born then, Producer Na.

2800
01:35:50,315 --> 01:35:51,914
(Insulted)

2801
01:35:51,915 --> 01:35:53,785
I'm not ten years older than Yu Jin.

2802
01:35:54,285 --> 01:35:56,085
- I'm just saying. - Sorry.

2803
01:35:57,125 --> 01:35:58,554
I'm so glad I'm teamed with you, Mimi.

2804
01:35:58,555 --> 01:35:59,654
Out of everyone else.

2805
01:35:59,655 --> 01:36:00,795
- Shall we? - Okay.

2806
01:36:02,525 --> 01:36:05,234
(The song starts with sounds of traffic.)

2807
01:36:05,235 --> 01:36:06,435
- Do you know? - I do.

2808
01:36:07,035 --> 01:36:08,405
Quities.

2809
01:36:09,205 --> 01:36:10,604
- Did they play a video by accident? - Quities.

2810
01:36:10,605 --> 01:36:12,274
(She can answer just from the car noises!)

2811
01:36:12,275 --> 01:36:13,334
I really don't know.

2812
01:36:13,335 --> 01:36:14,474
Quieties.

2813
01:36:14,475 --> 01:36:15,645
- Quieties? - I know.

2814
01:36:15,805 --> 01:36:17,375
NRG's "Hit Song."

2815
01:36:17,915 --> 01:36:19,875
What is this? What's that song?

2816
01:36:19,975 --> 01:36:22,145
- That was so... Correct! - The song is so upbeat.

2817
01:36:22,785 --> 01:36:24,655
Eun Ji, that was amazing.

2818
01:36:25,485 --> 01:36:26,485
(Getting started)

2819
01:36:26,655 --> 01:36:28,425
(Let's go!)

2820
01:36:28,555 --> 01:36:30,524
(Yong Su leads the dance train.)

2821
01:36:30,525 --> 01:36:31,525
Let's go, Eun Ji!
(Everyone hops on.)

2822
01:36:32,526 --> 01:36:34,495
(Chanting)

2823
01:36:34,825 --> 01:36:37,095
(Smooth as if she was on skates)

2824
01:36:37,465 --> 01:36:40,365
(Yong Su is on fire.)

2825
01:36:40,605 --> 01:36:42,905
(Wrapping up together)

2826
01:36:43,235 --> 01:36:44,605
Lee Yong Su, everybody.

2827
01:36:45,105 --> 01:36:46,904
- That was amazing. - Eun Ji, you're so good at this.

2828
01:36:46,905 --> 01:36:47,905
I mean...

2829
01:36:47,906 --> 01:36:49,004
I thought you played a video.

2830
01:36:49,005 --> 01:36:50,074
How did you get it?

2831
01:36:50,075 --> 01:36:52,414
- Yong Su's amazing. - NRG's "Hit Song."

2832
01:36:52,415 --> 01:36:54,615
So it's songs like this? I don't know any.

2833
01:36:55,015 --> 01:36:56,514
Do you know, Mimi?

2834
01:36:56,515 --> 01:36:57,615
- Are you good? - No, I'm not.

2835
01:36:58,215 --> 01:36:59,614
I should study next time.

2836
01:36:59,615 --> 01:37:00,984
It's okay. Yu Jin doesn't know, either.

2837
01:37:00,985 --> 01:37:02,184
- I don't know. - We weren't born at this time.

2838
01:37:02,185 --> 01:37:03,185
(Second song)

2839
01:37:07,395 --> 01:37:08,395
Loudies.

2840
01:37:08,396 --> 01:37:09,565
- What? - Gosh!

2841
01:37:09,995 --> 01:37:11,034
What do I do?

2842
01:37:11,035 --> 01:37:12,934
Loudies, your answer. Three, two, one!

2843
01:37:12,935 --> 01:37:14,005
It's 7 Princess'...

2844
01:37:14,235 --> 01:37:15,905
- It's 7 Princess'? - "Love Song."

2845
01:37:16,105 --> 01:37:17,404
White snowflakes...

2846
01:37:17,405 --> 01:37:20,275
Correct!

2847
01:37:20,675 --> 01:37:22,775
(Mimi got two right answers in a row unbelievably.)

2848
01:37:23,245 --> 01:37:25,475
(Shocked)

2849
01:37:25,645 --> 01:37:28,345
(Princess vibe performance)

2850
01:37:28,585 --> 01:37:30,555
A day when snowflakes turn into smiles

2851
01:37:30,785 --> 01:37:34,055
(They're so happy they're almost flying.)

2852
01:37:34,555 --> 01:37:36,685
(A day when right answers turn into smiles)

2853
01:37:36,855 --> 01:37:38,355
(They're savoring this moment.)

2854
01:37:38,525 --> 01:37:40,195
(Each team's ceremony is different, just like their names.)

2855
01:37:40,325 --> 01:37:42,195
(Singing)

2856
01:37:43,365 --> 01:37:45,735
(Celebration)

2857
01:37:46,035 --> 01:37:47,704
(Mimi continues the good work from the previous round.)

2858
01:37:47,705 --> 01:37:49,935
Mimi! I can't do this.

2859
01:37:50,835 --> 01:37:52,104
- I can't... - It's okay.

2860
01:37:52,105 --> 01:37:53,705
You're great.

2861
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:55,045
Ms. Young Ji?

2862
01:37:55,475 --> 01:37:57,045
It looks like it's just the two of us.

2863
01:37:58,375 --> 01:37:59,514
Okay.

2864
01:37:59,515 --> 01:38:01,114
- This is the final round. - Yes.

2865
01:38:01,115 --> 01:38:02,115
(Third song)

2866
01:38:02,116 --> 01:38:03,215
Don't be overwhelmed.

2867
01:38:03,815 --> 01:38:04,955
You got this.

2868
01:38:05,185 --> 01:38:06,785
I don't think Yu Jin is overwhelmed.

2869
01:38:08,825 --> 01:38:09,855
Here we go.

2870
01:38:10,325 --> 01:38:13,395
(A mysterious ticking sound)

2871
01:38:20,765 --> 01:38:23,835
(Yong Su starts crying out of nowhere.)

2872
01:38:24,005 --> 01:38:26,775
(Astonished)

2873
01:38:27,175 --> 01:38:28,404
- What? - Are you...

2874
01:38:28,405 --> 01:38:32,175
(Yong Su seems to have a sad story...)

2875
01:38:32,415 --> 01:38:35,415
(while the ballad underdog still has no idea.)

2876
01:38:35,645 --> 01:38:36,884
Are you going to answer?

2877
01:38:36,885 --> 01:38:38,885
I can't think of the singer's name.

2878
01:38:39,085 --> 01:38:40,314
(So she knows the song title?)

2879
01:38:40,315 --> 01:38:42,154
- Would I know her? - Definitely.

2880
01:38:42,155 --> 01:38:44,624
Even if you don't know her personally, you would.

2881
01:38:44,625 --> 01:38:45,854
Is she still active?

2882
01:38:45,855 --> 01:38:48,365
She appears on TV shows.

2883
01:38:51,595 --> 01:38:53,465
(Mimi remembers.)

2884
01:38:54,135 --> 01:38:55,464
(Sparkle)

2885
01:38:55,465 --> 01:38:56,965
Mimi knows.

2886
01:38:59,175 --> 01:39:02,305
(Immersed)

2887
01:39:02,405 --> 01:39:04,314
- Do more with your hands. - Listen carefully.

2888
01:39:04,315 --> 01:39:05,415
(Hand signals)

2889
01:39:06,015 --> 01:39:08,345
(The song is close to its chorus.)

2890
01:39:12,985 --> 01:39:14,525
Don't... Goodness.

2891
01:39:15,885 --> 01:39:19,395
(Skillfully muting herself)

2892
01:39:19,725 --> 01:39:23,395
(Depressed)

2893
01:39:23,525 --> 01:39:25,064
Let me answer!

2894
01:39:25,065 --> 01:39:26,194
- Your answer? - Quieties...

2895
01:39:26,195 --> 01:39:27,565
Quieties.

2896
01:39:27,635 --> 01:39:28,865
Shinji's...

2897
01:39:30,165 --> 01:39:32,434
- Shinji's? - "December 32."

2898
01:39:32,435 --> 01:39:34,304
(Shinji's "December 32")

2899
01:39:34,305 --> 01:39:35,904
Wrong! Wrong for now.

2900
01:39:35,905 --> 01:39:37,244
(So close)

2901
01:39:37,245 --> 01:39:38,514
Wrong for now.

2902
01:39:38,515 --> 01:39:39,515
Let me answer!

2903
01:39:39,675 --> 01:39:41,115
Wait, is Young Ji going to...

2904
01:39:41,245 --> 01:39:42,245
(Yelling)

2905
01:39:42,246 --> 01:39:43,784
Interesting. Your answer?

2906
01:39:43,785 --> 01:39:44,785
Three, two, one!

2907
01:39:44,786 --> 01:39:46,485
- Byul's... - Byul's?

2908
01:39:46,985 --> 01:39:48,254
"December 32."

2909
01:39:48,255 --> 01:39:49,624
(Byul's "December 32")

2910
01:39:49,625 --> 01:39:50,655
Correct!

2911
01:39:51,395 --> 01:39:53,625
(Excited noises)

2912
01:39:53,865 --> 01:39:56,465
(She can't believe she got it right herself.)

2913
01:39:56,795 --> 01:39:57,864
(A dramatic reversal game)

2914
01:39:57,865 --> 01:40:00,065
Correct! You got it!

2915
01:40:00,505 --> 01:40:05,075
(The two tearfully remember their fasting days.)

2916
01:40:05,175 --> 01:40:06,635
I remember that meme,

2917
01:40:06,835 --> 01:40:09,174
- saying it's December 32. - Right.

2918
01:40:09,175 --> 01:40:11,915
People use that meme in the new year.

2919
01:40:13,375 --> 01:40:15,144
(The meme Yu Jin saw)

2920
01:40:15,145 --> 01:40:17,044
(People post this in December,)

2921
01:40:17,045 --> 01:40:18,555
(trying to ignore the fact that they're getting older.)

2922
01:40:18,715 --> 01:40:20,554
(Byul's "December 32")

2923
01:40:20,555 --> 01:40:22,384
(Their lover said they'll return before the New Year, but doesn't.)

2924
01:40:22,385 --> 01:40:23,895
(So the person tells themselves that it's December 32, not January 1.)

2925
01:40:24,355 --> 01:40:28,625
(Producer Na also likes this song.)

2926
01:40:29,325 --> 01:40:32,765
(Explosive improvisation)

2927
01:40:32,965 --> 01:40:34,734
- Enjoy, Young Ji. - Let's eat together.

2928
01:40:34,735 --> 01:40:37,205
(The Loudies are getting ready to eat.)

2929
01:40:37,875 --> 01:40:44,075
(Yu Jin is sad, just like the song.)

2930
01:40:44,745 --> 01:40:45,914
How did you know this?

2931
01:40:45,915 --> 01:40:47,885
Didn't you know because of the meme, too?

2932
01:40:47,945 --> 01:40:50,315
I don't! I knew after Mimi drew a star.

2933
01:40:51,685 --> 01:40:53,015
Wait a minute.

2934
01:40:53,315 --> 01:40:55,625
Did Mimi also do hand gestures?

2935
01:40:55,755 --> 01:40:56,855
- Wait. - What?

2936
01:40:57,595 --> 01:40:58,625
I mean...

2937
01:40:59,455 --> 01:41:01,395
this doesn't seem fair.

2938
01:41:01,865 --> 01:41:05,265
(While Yong Su was immersed in her song,)

2939
01:41:05,465 --> 01:41:07,205
Do more with your hands.

2940
01:41:07,465 --> 01:41:09,365
(Mimi drew a star on her hand.)

2941
01:41:09,635 --> 01:41:11,575
(That's how Young Ji knew the singer's name, "Byul.")

2942
01:41:12,005 --> 01:41:14,244
We let Young Ji give hints to Mimi,

2943
01:41:14,245 --> 01:41:15,574
- we were okay with that. - Right.

2944
01:41:15,575 --> 01:41:18,474
But Mimi gave Young Ji hints?

2945
01:41:18,475 --> 01:41:20,585
We had no idea.

2946
01:41:20,985 --> 01:41:22,185
Can I just say...

2947
01:41:22,485 --> 01:41:24,055
I don't have to eat. I'm just so happy we won.

2948
01:41:24,885 --> 01:41:26,915
Thank you so much.

2949
01:41:26,955 --> 01:41:28,284
Or should we do a rematch?

2950
01:41:28,285 --> 01:41:29,424
- A rematch? - Yes.

2951
01:41:29,425 --> 01:41:30,894
- Should we? - The two of us.

2952
01:41:30,895 --> 01:41:32,754
- One-on-one? - Sounds good!

2953
01:41:32,755 --> 01:41:34,224
No hand gestures.

2954
01:41:34,225 --> 01:41:35,824
No conscience. Wait, no.

2955
01:41:35,825 --> 01:41:36,994
I mean with conscience.

2956
01:41:36,995 --> 01:41:39,034
Play with conscience!

2957
01:41:39,035 --> 01:41:40,194
(Playing honestly this time)

2958
01:41:40,195 --> 01:41:41,905
(Young Ji and Yu Jin's rematch)

2959
01:41:42,365 --> 01:41:43,804
- Shall we? - They might get it right away.

2960
01:41:43,805 --> 01:41:45,235
They might know this song.

2961
01:41:49,075 --> 01:41:50,245
I know this one!

2962
01:41:51,115 --> 01:41:53,415
(Quietly using her facial muscles)

2963
01:41:53,745 --> 01:41:55,545
- Quieties. - Quieties!

2964
01:41:55,745 --> 01:41:57,384
- WAX's... - WAX's?

2965
01:41:57,385 --> 01:41:58,785
"Fix My Makeup!"

2966
01:41:59,715 --> 01:42:00,724
Correct!

2967
01:42:00,725 --> 01:42:03,155
(WAX's "Fix My Makeup")

2968
01:42:03,285 --> 01:42:04,394
(A song released before Young Ji or Yu Jin was born.)

2969
01:42:04,395 --> 01:42:05,494
(It ranked number 1 on the charts for 9 weeks,)

2970
01:42:05,495 --> 01:42:06,625
(and is still covered by many singers to this day.)

2971
01:42:06,895 --> 01:42:09,995
(The professional singer pours her heart out into singing,)

2972
01:42:10,325 --> 01:42:13,365
(while the professional comic fixes her makeup.)

2973
01:42:13,935 --> 01:42:18,605
(These two are even sadder because they lost what they had.)

2974
01:42:20,175 --> 01:42:25,315
(The vocal showdown is reaching its climax.)

2975
01:42:25,415 --> 01:42:28,414
Their eyes are empty. They have no idea.

2976
01:42:28,415 --> 01:42:29,485
(They dance with empty eyes.)

2977
01:42:29,645 --> 01:42:32,255
(Justice is restored.)

2978
01:42:32,285 --> 01:42:34,985
(Sung by Quieties, dance by Loudies)

2979
01:42:36,355 --> 01:42:38,625
- Gosh, how did you know? - That was great.

2980
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:40,924
I don't know the title or the singer.

2981
01:42:40,925 --> 01:42:42,024
- Really? - No.

2982
01:42:42,025 --> 01:42:44,035
- This is a famous song. - How did you know, Yu Jin?

2983
01:42:44,095 --> 01:42:45,764
I actually saw Taeyeon...

2984
01:42:45,765 --> 01:42:47,864
singing this song on "Begin Again."

2985
01:42:47,865 --> 01:42:49,504
- Goodness. - A cover version.

2986
01:42:49,505 --> 01:42:50,934
- That's how. - I had no clue.

2987
01:42:50,935 --> 01:42:52,134
Then...

2988
01:42:52,135 --> 01:42:53,334
should we eat this together?

2989
01:42:53,335 --> 01:42:55,505
(Should we eat this together?)

2990
01:42:55,545 --> 01:42:57,075
(No.)

2991
01:42:57,205 --> 01:42:59,974
I think it'll taste even better since we won it after a rematch.

2992
01:42:59,975 --> 01:43:01,185
It looks great!

2993
01:43:02,415 --> 01:43:05,085
(Trying to comfort herself with soda)

2994
01:43:05,185 --> 01:43:08,024
- Isn't that right, Yu Jin? - It looks delicious, Eun Ji!

2995
01:43:08,025 --> 01:43:09,025
The rematch...

2996
01:43:10,355 --> 01:43:12,395
The crew liked this menu the best, right?

2997
01:43:15,925 --> 01:43:18,365
(A bite of naan with curry on top)

2998
01:43:20,295 --> 01:43:22,004
(Touched)

2999
01:43:22,005 --> 01:43:23,134
This is it.

3000
01:43:23,135 --> 01:43:24,474
- It's amazing. - It's okay.

3001
01:43:24,475 --> 01:43:26,405
(Trying the meat)

3002
01:43:27,605 --> 01:43:29,344
- The meat is so tender. - So good.

3003
01:43:29,345 --> 01:43:30,575
How is this possible?

3004
01:43:30,715 --> 01:43:32,045
What does it taste like?

3005
01:43:32,675 --> 01:43:35,184
It's not the curry that we're familiar with.

3006
01:43:35,185 --> 01:43:36,844
The flavor is so rich,

3007
01:43:36,845 --> 01:43:39,014
and sweet and savory at the same time.

3008
01:43:39,015 --> 01:43:40,485
- It's so harmonious. - Sweet and savory.

3009
01:43:40,585 --> 01:43:42,084
I'm just going to take this naan...

3010
01:43:42,085 --> 01:43:44,494
and bring it with me to Korea like this.

3011
01:43:44,495 --> 01:43:45,554
(Hello, there. It's me.)

3012
01:43:45,555 --> 01:43:47,365
(Laughing)

3013
01:43:48,225 --> 01:43:51,165
This was the crew's favorite menu.

3014
01:43:51,295 --> 01:43:52,595
- Their favorite menu. - Gosh!

3015
01:43:52,835 --> 01:43:53,934
(Eating the leftover fish)

3016
01:43:53,935 --> 01:43:55,734
Before we move onto desserts...

3017
01:43:55,735 --> 01:43:57,164
- Maybe one last dish? - Great!

3018
01:43:57,165 --> 01:43:59,235
The last dish.

3019
01:43:59,405 --> 01:44:00,775
- Something spicy. - Bring it in.

3020
01:44:00,975 --> 01:44:03,574
- Goodness. - This is it!

3021
01:44:03,575 --> 01:44:04,974
It's barbecue.

3022
01:44:04,975 --> 01:44:07,015
- It's tandoori! - Tandoori!

3023
01:44:07,115 --> 01:44:09,615
Grilled chicken with fries. It's just chicken.

3024
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:11,654
(You know what they say.)

3025
01:44:11,655 --> 01:44:14,585
(It's harder to resist the food you already know.)

3026
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:19,625
(Chicken flavored with Middle Eastern spices,)

3027
01:44:19,955 --> 01:44:23,565
(along with garnish and french fries on the side)

3028
01:44:24,535 --> 01:44:26,395
(Grilled chicken with fries)

3029
01:44:26,765 --> 01:44:28,364
There's naan at the bottom, too.

3030
01:44:28,365 --> 01:44:29,534
It looks great.

3031
01:44:29,535 --> 01:44:32,304
I think the Quieties should pick this time.

3032
01:44:32,305 --> 01:44:33,374
- I'll pick. - Go, Yu Jin.

3033
01:44:33,375 --> 01:44:34,475
- Yu Jin. - This is your first time, right?

3034
01:44:34,505 --> 01:44:37,815
(Yu Jin is picking for the first time.)

3035
01:44:41,015 --> 01:44:43,615
It's the year of my K-pop debut.

3036
01:44:45,015 --> 01:44:46,854
It's 2006 to 2010.

3037
01:44:46,855 --> 01:44:48,185
(Round seven, 2006 to 2010)

3038
01:44:48,255 --> 01:44:51,295
- That's not bad, Mimi. - It's not bad.

3039
01:44:51,395 --> 01:44:53,554
Yu Jin, you debuted so long ago.

3040
01:44:53,555 --> 01:44:55,024
You debuted in 2010?

3041
01:44:55,025 --> 01:44:56,165
In 2009.

3042
01:44:56,525 --> 01:44:58,764
- In 2009? - How is that possible?

3043
01:44:58,765 --> 01:45:00,094
- Where did you debut? - IZ ONE?

3044
01:45:00,095 --> 01:45:01,335
In my living room.

3045
01:45:02,605 --> 01:45:04,634
Gosh, I almost fell for that.

3046
01:45:04,635 --> 01:45:05,804
You got me there.

3047
01:45:05,805 --> 01:45:06,934
When I first learned of K-pop,

3048
01:45:06,935 --> 01:45:08,074
- and when I got into it. - I see.

3049
01:45:08,075 --> 01:45:09,875
When you got into it.

3050
01:45:10,045 --> 01:45:11,745
I have a sister,

3051
01:45:11,875 --> 01:45:13,544
and she's four years older than me.

3052
01:45:13,545 --> 01:45:15,015
So she got into K-pop first,

3053
01:45:15,285 --> 01:45:16,945
and that's how I debuted.

3054
01:45:17,615 --> 01:45:19,485
My mom was always watching me.

3055
01:45:20,285 --> 01:45:22,225
She cheered you on.

3056
01:45:22,255 --> 01:45:24,325
How about you, Young Ji?

3057
01:45:24,395 --> 01:45:26,054
I listened to BigBang.

3058
01:45:26,055 --> 01:45:27,394
- The birth of K-pop! - Right.

3059
01:45:27,395 --> 01:45:29,525
Around 2013.

3060
01:45:29,665 --> 01:45:31,894
Not when they debuted, when I started listening to them.

3061
01:45:31,895 --> 01:45:33,764
- You listened to them later. - I did.

3062
01:45:33,765 --> 01:45:35,504
- I was late to join the party. - Young Ji listened to 2Pac first.

3063
01:45:35,505 --> 01:45:36,535
That's right.

3064
01:45:36,805 --> 01:45:38,135
(Singing)

3065
01:45:38,475 --> 01:45:39,475
(Rapping)

3066
01:45:39,975 --> 01:45:41,775
Snoop Dogg! Oh, this is Snoop Dogg's song.

3067
01:45:42,975 --> 01:45:44,244
(Feisty got the hip-hop legends mixed up.)

3068
01:45:44,245 --> 01:45:45,274
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

3069
01:45:45,275 --> 01:45:47,915
My deepest apologies.

3070
01:45:48,015 --> 01:45:50,484
When did you get into K-pop, Mimi?

3071
01:45:50,485 --> 01:45:51,755
For me...

3072
01:45:52,455 --> 01:45:53,655
it was KARA.

3073
01:45:54,385 --> 01:45:55,984
Year 2008. That fits the period.

3074
01:45:55,985 --> 01:45:57,894
I knew them with "Rock U,"

3075
01:45:57,895 --> 01:45:59,995
- and Super Junior, too. - Super Junior.

3076
01:46:00,395 --> 01:46:02,565
- And you, Eun Ji? - For me, it was in 1998...

3077
01:46:02,765 --> 01:46:03,965
with SECHSKIES.

3078
01:46:04,465 --> 01:46:05,964
You have a broad scope.

3079
01:46:05,965 --> 01:46:08,465
My older sister was born in 1987.

3080
01:46:09,165 --> 01:46:10,734
She was born then,

3081
01:46:10,735 --> 01:46:12,375
and we'd always record the shows.

3082
01:46:12,535 --> 01:46:14,974
So before our parents got home,

3083
01:46:14,975 --> 01:46:17,304
we'd watch SECHSKIES, H.O.T., S.E.S.,

3084
01:46:17,305 --> 01:46:19,014
M.I.L.K., and so on.

3085
01:46:19,015 --> 01:46:20,814
What's amazing about you is...

3086
01:46:20,815 --> 01:46:23,184
you're still into K-pop, even in 2025.

3087
01:46:23,185 --> 01:46:24,814
Right, from 1998 to 2025.

3088
01:46:24,815 --> 01:46:25,884
All the way to VIVIZ.

3089
01:46:25,885 --> 01:46:28,025
I'm actually the president of...

3090
01:46:28,355 --> 01:46:29,355
The president.

3091
01:46:29,356 --> 01:46:30,424
- The president of K-pop culture. - Seriously.

3092
01:46:30,425 --> 01:46:32,794
- You're the stela of K-pop. - The stela!

3093
01:46:32,795 --> 01:46:33,855
The stela of K-pop.

3094
01:46:34,525 --> 01:46:35,794
What's a stela?

3095
01:46:35,795 --> 01:46:37,164
A stone slab of K-pop.

3096
01:46:37,165 --> 01:46:38,634
A stela.

3097
01:46:38,635 --> 01:46:39,665
The king of K-pop.

3098
01:46:40,165 --> 01:46:41,165
Let's begin.

3099
01:46:41,166 --> 01:46:42,634
- What were we doing? - It's from 2006...

3100
01:46:42,635 --> 01:46:43,635
- to 2010. - Yes.

3101
01:46:43,636 --> 01:46:45,375
(First song)

3102
01:46:47,405 --> 01:46:49,445
- Q... - Mimi.

3103
01:46:49,805 --> 01:46:51,314
- Shall I go? - Go ahead.

3104
01:46:51,315 --> 01:46:52,445
- I'm not certain. - Loudies.

3105
01:46:52,545 --> 01:46:54,944
- What? They'll go first. - I said, "Loudies."

3106
01:46:54,945 --> 01:46:56,314
Go ahead. I'm not certain.

3107
01:46:56,315 --> 01:46:57,315
- Loudies. - What?

3108
01:46:57,316 --> 01:46:58,454
- They'll go first. - I said, "Loudies."

3109
01:46:58,455 --> 01:46:59,455
Loudies.

3110
01:46:59,655 --> 01:47:00,815
Davichi's...

3111
01:47:02,055 --> 01:47:03,085
I guess it's wrong.

3112
01:47:04,255 --> 01:47:05,754
(Mimi: Davichi's...)

3113
01:47:05,755 --> 01:47:07,695
(Squeezing his eyes shut)

3114
01:47:09,095 --> 01:47:10,264
Why? Keep going.

3115
01:47:10,265 --> 01:47:11,995
- Keep going. It doesn't matter. - I'm listening.

3116
01:47:12,095 --> 01:47:13,265
"Goodbye, My Love."

3117
01:47:13,595 --> 01:47:15,665
- Gosh, Mimi. - Wrong.

3118
01:47:16,465 --> 01:47:17,465
I'm familiar with it.

3119
01:47:17,935 --> 01:47:20,005
- Quieties. - Quieties.

3120
01:47:20,435 --> 01:47:21,674
(I'll put on makeup)

3121
01:47:21,675 --> 01:47:23,675
Davichi and See Ya's "Women's Generation."

3122
01:47:23,875 --> 01:47:25,775
Davichi and See Ya's "Women's Generation."

3123
01:47:26,475 --> 01:47:27,475
Wrong.

3124
01:47:27,476 --> 01:47:28,585
(Her eyes go wide.)

3125
01:47:28,685 --> 01:47:30,814
(It's incorrect, but she's excited.)

3126
01:47:30,815 --> 01:47:32,914
Why is she putting on so much makeup and fixing her hair so many times?

3127
01:47:32,915 --> 01:47:35,354
(The one who got into K-pop in 2008 comes forward with confidence.)

3128
01:47:35,355 --> 01:47:36,584
- Loudies. - Loudies.

3129
01:47:36,585 --> 01:47:37,955
Women's Generation's "Women's Generation."

3130
01:47:39,895 --> 01:47:40,995
Wrong.

3131
01:47:42,065 --> 01:47:43,795
- It's something like that. - Is that the song title?

3132
01:47:44,765 --> 01:47:47,565
(The song keeps playing as they feel uncertain.)

3133
01:47:48,065 --> 01:47:51,675
- Quieties. - Quieties.

3134
01:47:52,335 --> 01:47:54,845
Davichi and Gavy NJ's "Women's Generation."

3135
01:47:56,905 --> 01:47:59,215
- Wrong. - It must be close.

3136
01:47:59,615 --> 01:48:01,845
(Eun Ji's answer is close indeed.)

3137
01:48:01,945 --> 01:48:04,555
(This song was sung by various teams.)

3138
01:48:04,655 --> 01:48:08,154
(The song title is "Women's Generation.")

3139
01:48:08,155 --> 01:48:11,124
(Singer 1: See Ya)

3140
01:48:11,125 --> 01:48:12,694
(Singer 2: Davichi)

3141
01:48:12,695 --> 01:48:14,965
(Singer 3: Jiyeon of T-ARA)

3142
01:48:15,195 --> 01:48:16,965
(The project song was sung by three teams.)

3143
01:48:17,065 --> 01:48:19,395
(See Ya, Davichi, and T-ARA's "Women's Generation")

3144
01:48:19,495 --> 01:48:21,364
- Loudies. - Loudies.

3145
01:48:21,365 --> 01:48:24,275
Ga... Gavy NJ, See Ya,

3146
01:48:25,735 --> 01:48:27,134
- and Davichi's... - Go ahead.

3147
01:48:27,135 --> 01:48:30,104
Da Vinci, Gavy N See Ya, Na Yeong Seok...

3148
01:48:30,105 --> 01:48:31,475
Hold on. Start over. Who?

3149
01:48:31,575 --> 01:48:32,944
- Gavy NJ. - Okay.

3150
01:48:32,945 --> 01:48:34,515
Women's... No, that came out wrong.

3151
01:48:36,085 --> 01:48:37,085
Start over slowly.

3152
01:48:37,086 --> 01:48:38,284
- Gavy NJ, - Okay.

3153
01:48:38,285 --> 01:48:39,714
- Davichi, and See Ya. - Okay.

3154
01:48:39,715 --> 01:48:40,715
- "Women's Generation?" - "Women's Generation."

3155
01:48:40,716 --> 01:48:42,255
- Wrong. - It's okay, Mimi.

3156
01:48:42,555 --> 01:48:46,055
You guys know the song title.

3157
01:48:46,855 --> 01:48:47,864
What's this?

3158
01:48:47,865 --> 01:48:49,065
(They're unsure about the singers.)

3159
01:48:49,965 --> 01:48:50,965
(Breathing in)

3160
01:48:50,966 --> 01:48:52,394
(Breathing out)

3161
01:48:52,395 --> 01:48:53,565
(Glancing over)

3162
01:48:54,095 --> 01:48:56,034
- Loudies. - Loudies.

3163
01:48:56,035 --> 01:48:57,534
- Gardasil's "Women's Generation." - What?

3164
01:48:57,535 --> 01:48:59,074
- Gardasil? - Gardasil?

3165
01:48:59,075 --> 01:49:00,574
(Gardasil's "Women's Generation")

3166
01:49:00,575 --> 01:49:02,205
(What?)

3167
01:49:02,545 --> 01:49:04,515
Are you talking about the shot?

3168
01:49:04,845 --> 01:49:06,974
(An HPV vaccine, Gardasil)

3169
01:49:06,975 --> 01:49:09,014
- No. - Are you talking about the shot?

3170
01:49:09,015 --> 01:49:11,284
(Passing out)

3171
01:49:11,285 --> 01:49:12,985
- Are you talking about the shot? - No.

3172
01:49:13,685 --> 01:49:15,824
(Laughing)

3173
01:49:15,825 --> 01:49:17,585
(Is this "The Pieta?")

3174
01:49:17,695 --> 01:49:19,954
(Her talent is unrivaled.)

3175
01:49:19,955 --> 01:49:24,025
Hey, why did you say the word people see in a health center?

3176
01:49:25,095 --> 01:49:27,535
- All right. Quieties. - Wrong.

3177
01:49:27,635 --> 01:49:28,964
- Quieties. - Quieties.

3178
01:49:28,965 --> 01:49:30,665
T-ARA and Davichi's "Women's Generation."

3179
01:49:33,835 --> 01:49:34,944
Wrong.

3180
01:49:34,945 --> 01:49:37,145
- Loudies. - Loudies.

3181
01:49:37,245 --> 01:49:40,844
T-ARA... Did she say Davichi or See Ya?

3182
01:49:40,845 --> 01:49:42,814
- T-ARA and Davichi. - Gardasil.

3183
01:49:42,815 --> 01:49:43,885
- Gardasil. - T-ARA.

3184
01:49:44,455 --> 01:49:45,455
T-ARA.

3185
01:49:45,555 --> 01:49:46,715
- T-ARA, - T-ARA.

3186
01:49:46,915 --> 01:49:47,955
- See Ya, - See Ya.

3187
01:49:48,425 --> 01:49:49,885
- and Gavy NJ's... - Gavy NJ.

3188
01:49:49,985 --> 01:49:51,525
- "Women's Generation." - "Women's Generation."

3189
01:49:52,425 --> 01:49:53,425
Wrong.

3190
01:49:53,595 --> 01:49:55,395
I guess there aren't more people.

3191
01:49:56,125 --> 01:49:57,225
- Wrong. - Quieties.

3192
01:49:57,795 --> 01:49:59,795
See Ya, Davichi,

3193
01:49:59,895 --> 01:50:01,365
and T-ARA's "Women's Generation."

3194
01:50:01,735 --> 01:50:02,735
Correct.

3195
01:50:03,665 --> 01:50:05,275
(They finally got the correct answer.)

3196
01:50:05,405 --> 01:50:10,075
(Ms. Gardasil was checking the possibilities.)

3197
01:50:10,175 --> 01:50:11,544
(Upset)

3198
01:50:11,545 --> 01:50:13,345
It's okay. You had your Gardasil moment.

3199
01:50:13,445 --> 01:50:14,445
My goodness.

3200
01:50:14,545 --> 01:50:19,855
(Everything is good since we won!)

3201
01:50:22,125 --> 01:50:23,754
(T-ARA's "Bo Peep Bo Peep")

3202
01:50:23,755 --> 01:50:24,755
Okay.

3203
01:50:25,225 --> 01:50:27,994
(If you suppress pain, you're second class.)

3204
01:50:27,995 --> 01:50:28,995
This is the dance.

3205
01:50:29,695 --> 01:50:30,794
(If you smile in the face of pain, you're first class.)

3206
01:50:30,795 --> 01:50:31,865
You know it.

3207
01:50:33,195 --> 01:50:36,865
(The Na'vi members cheer up.)

3208
01:50:36,965 --> 01:50:38,304
(Laughing)

3209
01:50:38,305 --> 01:50:39,805
Gardasil!

3210
01:50:41,445 --> 01:50:44,874
Mimi, can you tell us how you got "Gardasil?"

3211
01:50:44,875 --> 01:50:46,515
- The first syllables. - "Ga" from Gavy NJ.

3212
01:50:46,615 --> 01:50:49,415
"Da" from Davichi. "See" from See Ya. Gadasee.

3213
01:50:50,745 --> 01:50:52,315
It's okay. You had your moment.

3214
01:50:52,585 --> 01:50:55,254
- It's an HPV vaccine. - It's an HPV vaccine.

3215
01:50:55,255 --> 01:50:56,284
- An HPV vaccine. - It's a nice vaccine.

3216
01:50:56,285 --> 01:50:58,054
- Everyone should get it. - It suits "Women's Generation."

3217
01:50:58,055 --> 01:50:59,955
- I see. It's a nice vaccine. - You're right.

3218
01:51:00,225 --> 01:51:01,424
- Who got the answer? - Who got the answer?

3219
01:51:01,425 --> 01:51:02,725
- Me. - Yu Jin did.

3220
01:51:04,095 --> 01:51:05,095
It was just one question.

3221
01:51:05,096 --> 01:51:06,634
- Yes. - Many questions remain.

3222
01:51:06,635 --> 01:51:07,635
I'm in tears.
- One question took so long. - Because of Gardasil...

3223
01:51:08,635 --> 01:51:09,635
I...

3224
01:51:09,636 --> 01:51:10,765
(Laughing out loud)

3225
01:51:12,475 --> 01:51:13,775
(She drops her food.)

3226
01:51:13,835 --> 01:51:15,504
Gardasil!

3227
01:51:15,505 --> 01:51:17,005
(Let's move on.)

3228
01:51:17,405 --> 01:51:19,014
Here comes the next song.

3229
01:51:19,015 --> 01:51:20,745
(Second song)

3230
01:51:22,915 --> 01:51:23,985
Quieties.

3231
01:51:24,785 --> 01:51:26,254
Super Junior's...

3232
01:51:26,255 --> 01:51:28,084
- Super Junior. Three, two, one. - 'Cause I can't stop number one

3233
01:51:28,085 --> 01:51:29,325
- That isn't it. - Wrong.

3234
01:51:29,525 --> 01:51:30,825
(Turning around)

3235
01:51:30,885 --> 01:51:33,225
(Flustered)

3236
01:51:33,555 --> 01:51:35,794
Hold on a second. What was that?

3237
01:51:35,795 --> 01:51:37,165
(What kind of a battle are you fighting by yourself?)

3238
01:51:39,195 --> 01:51:40,334
I remember the dance.

3239
01:51:40,335 --> 01:51:41,335
(Dancing)

3240
01:51:41,365 --> 01:51:45,175
(Mimi murmured, "'Cause I can't stop.")

3241
01:51:47,105 --> 01:51:51,045
(Young Ji also remembers "'Cause I can't stop.")

3242
01:51:51,375 --> 01:51:54,415
(She just stopped.)

3243
01:51:54,715 --> 01:51:57,615
(Remembering the movements of the original song)

3244
01:51:58,885 --> 01:51:59,885
Don't you know the song?

3245
01:52:00,315 --> 01:52:01,324
I really don't know it.

3246
01:52:01,325 --> 01:52:02,784
- Loudies. - Loudies.

3247
01:52:02,785 --> 01:52:04,695
- Super Junior's... - Super Junior.

3248
01:52:04,795 --> 01:52:06,825
- "Ten." - "Ten."

3249
01:52:08,025 --> 01:52:10,095
- Wrong. - Why "Ten?"

3250
01:52:10,365 --> 01:52:12,294
- I saw it somewhere. - I see.

3251
01:52:12,295 --> 01:52:13,335
(She said that she began listening to K-pop because of Super Junior.)

3252
01:52:14,705 --> 01:52:16,604
(The dance of the chorus)

3253
01:52:16,605 --> 01:52:18,975
I did this dance recently with Eunhyuk.

3254
01:52:20,205 --> 01:52:21,205
(I know!)

3255
01:52:21,206 --> 01:52:22,645
- Quieties. - Quieties.

3256
01:52:22,745 --> 01:52:25,475
Super Junior's "U."

3257
01:52:25,945 --> 01:52:27,944
- Correct. - "U."

3258
01:52:27,945 --> 01:52:29,145
(Super Junior's "U")

3259
01:52:29,515 --> 01:52:31,485
- Correct. - "U."

3260
01:52:31,785 --> 01:52:34,625
(Sprawled on the floor)

3261
01:52:34,925 --> 01:52:39,095
(They lose the last menu as well.)

3262
01:52:39,995 --> 01:52:42,525
It was "U." It was one word.

3263
01:52:42,625 --> 01:52:44,465
- You guys are good. - Your answer was one word too.

3264
01:52:45,495 --> 01:52:47,495
(Quieties win.)

3265
01:52:48,505 --> 01:52:50,735
Please excuse me. I need tissue paper.

3266
01:52:51,505 --> 01:52:52,635
It's because of Gardasil.

3267
01:52:54,645 --> 01:52:57,444
(It automatically makes her laugh.)

3268
01:52:57,445 --> 01:52:58,915
She's 34 years old.

3269
01:52:59,915 --> 01:53:02,285
Gardasil is her favorite joke of the day.

3270
01:53:02,615 --> 01:53:03,714
(The 34-year-old woman's favorite part)

3271
01:53:03,715 --> 01:53:05,255
Still, my favorite part is this.

3272
01:53:05,485 --> 01:53:07,854
"How is it?" "It's fun, but..."

3273
01:53:07,855 --> 01:53:09,155
- Is it still your favorite? - Yes.

3274
01:53:09,925 --> 01:53:13,054
(Let's watch it again since it's fun.)

3275
01:53:13,055 --> 01:53:14,895
- Gardasil. - The president of K-comedy.

3276
01:53:15,095 --> 01:53:16,095
That's you.

3277
01:53:16,965 --> 01:53:19,664
- Eun Ji, you take the K-culture. - Okay.

3278
01:53:19,665 --> 01:53:23,234
I'll do that. You're the president of K-comedy.

3279
01:53:23,235 --> 01:53:25,775
You're the president of K-comedy.

3280
01:53:25,975 --> 01:53:27,304
- That's right. KCP. - Seriously.

3281
01:53:27,305 --> 01:53:28,305
KCP sounds nice.

3282
01:53:29,005 --> 01:53:31,275
(In the following rounds)

3283
01:53:32,275 --> 01:53:36,015
(The music training isn't over yet.)

3284
01:53:36,345 --> 01:53:38,215
(Then there's the problem-solving training.)

3285
01:53:38,315 --> 01:53:39,515
(Why do you fail all the time?)

3286
01:53:39,615 --> 01:53:41,785
(I'm doing this with seriousness.)

3287
01:53:41,885 --> 01:53:44,555
(I'll have a 1-on-1 match against Kim Mi Hyun.)

3288
01:53:44,655 --> 01:53:47,695
(They turned strange!)

3289
01:53:49,166 --> 01:53:52,265
(In the middle of the desert, their cries echo.)

3290
01:53:52,266 --> 01:53:54,565
(A new game)

3291
01:53:54,566 --> 01:53:56,165
(To the command,)

3292
01:53:56,166 --> 01:53:58,506
(move your body.)

3293
01:53:58,606 --> 01:54:00,976
(It's a simple game.)

3294
01:54:01,076 --> 01:54:02,775
(I had a reality check.)

3295
01:54:02,776 --> 01:54:04,045
(As they go on,)

3296
01:54:04,046 --> 01:54:06,675
(the level of difficulty rises.)

3297
01:54:06,676 --> 01:54:07,676
(Apple!)

3298
01:54:07,677 --> 01:54:09,786
(Screaming)

3299
01:54:09,886 --> 01:54:11,855
(Can we make it an individual event?)

3300
01:54:11,856 --> 01:54:14,386
(A group event is hard, right?)

3301
01:54:14,456 --> 01:54:15,456
(Apple!)

3302
01:54:15,457 --> 01:54:18,555
(It's the same even if you do it alone.)

3303
01:54:18,556 --> 01:54:20,455
(Morning Mission of unprecedented difficulty)

3304
01:54:20,456 --> 01:54:21,926
(Digital Detox)

3305
01:54:22,026 --> 01:54:23,565
(Your phones...)

3306
01:54:23,566 --> 01:54:24,625
(will be confiscated.)

3307
01:54:24,626 --> 01:54:25,895
(Using your senses alone,)

3308
01:54:25,896 --> 01:54:28,505
(predict 8am.)

3309
01:54:28,506 --> 01:54:30,465
(If you fail to make the correct prediction)

3310
01:54:30,466 --> 01:54:31,875
(1 minute will add 1 hour...)

3311
01:54:31,876 --> 01:54:33,106
(to the time of the confiscation.)

3312
01:54:33,206 --> 01:54:35,106
(The bloody Morning Mission to get their phones back)

3313
01:54:35,206 --> 01:54:38,176
(They'll depend on shamanism and the sixth sense.)

3314
01:54:38,276 --> 01:54:39,345
(Do you believe in the deity of the clock?)

3315
01:54:39,346 --> 01:54:40,346
(Yes, I do!)

3316
01:54:40,347 --> 01:54:41,616
(- Do you? - Yes, I do!)

3317
01:54:42,046 --> 01:54:44,285
(Tal, tal, tal, tal, digital)

3318
01:54:44,286 --> 01:54:45,815
(It's coming, the spirit is coming.)

3319
01:54:45,816 --> 01:54:47,255
(Armpit hair)

3320
01:54:47,256 --> 01:54:48,855
(Those who believe in the deity of the clock)

3321
01:54:48,856 --> 01:54:50,526
(I believe in it! TikTok!)

3322
01:54:50,626 --> 01:54:51,626
(I'm set.)

3323
01:54:51,627 --> 01:54:53,126
(I have a unique method.)

3324
01:54:53,226 --> 01:54:55,066
(I'll use my unique calculation method.)

3325
01:54:55,166 --> 01:54:57,295
(Mimi and Yu Jin follow their own methods.)

3326
01:54:57,296 --> 01:54:58,536
(I think it's 8am now.)

3327
01:54:58,636 --> 01:54:59,695
(It isn't 8am yet.)

3328
01:54:59,696 --> 01:55:00,735
(I think it's about 7:30am.)

3329
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:02,505
(You foolish mortal!)

3330
01:55:02,506 --> 01:55:04,436
(The endless war of nerves to get the phone back)

3331
01:55:04,536 --> 01:55:07,436
(The unpredictable result of the Morning Mission...)

3332
01:55:07,536 --> 01:55:09,976
(will be revealed next week.)

3333
01:55:11,046 --> 01:55:12,546
Where'd you come from?

3334
01:55:12,846 --> 01:55:14,276
- Mississippi - Mississippi

3335
01:55:14,616 --> 01:55:15,816
And your parents?

3336
01:55:16,146 --> 01:55:17,946
- Very wealthy - Very wealthy

3337
01:55:18,156 --> 01:55:19,616
Where are they now?

3338
01:55:19,916 --> 01:55:21,355
- Six feet under - Six feet under

3339
01:55:21,356 --> 01:55:23,185
But she was granted one more start

3340
01:55:23,186 --> 01:55:24,896
The Convent of The Sacred Heart

3341
01:55:24,996 --> 01:55:26,426
When'd you get here?

3342
01:55:26,626 --> 01:55:28,366
- Year 1920 - Year 1920

3343
01:55:28,596 --> 01:55:30,026
How old were you?

3344
01:55:30,326 --> 01:55:31,836
- Don't remember - Don't remember

3345
01:55:31,966 --> 01:55:33,436
Then what happened?

3346
01:55:33,596 --> 01:55:34,905
I met Amos

3347
01:55:34,906 --> 01:55:36,435
And he stole my heart away

3348
01:55:36,436 --> 01:55:38,136
Convinced me to elope one day

3349
01:55:38,336 --> 01:55:39,535
- Oh, yes - Oh, yes

3350
01:55:39,536 --> 01:55:41,476
We both reached for

3351
01:55:41,606 --> 01:55:42,906
- My goodness. - The gun
