1
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:11,922
(Earth Arcade 3)

2
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:13,293
(Previously)

3
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:15,333
(Strawberry, banana, apple)

4
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:17,533
(Thanks to the smoothie master)

5
00:00:17,863 --> 00:00:19,002
(Wrong!)

6
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,462
(They bought a laptop with their own money!)

7
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:22,702
(Thus, they became one with the laptop.)

8
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:24,172
(We couldn't leave them be...)

9
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:25,372
(in the world of dopamine.)

10
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:26,842
(So we prepared a new Morning Mission.)

11
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:28,412
(Digital detox)

12
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:29,442
(This isn't a school trip.)

13
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:31,112
(I'm 23 years old.)

14
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:33,842
(Figure out when it's 8am by using your senses only.)

15
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:35,412
(As for the 3rd and 4th places, their phones will be confiscated...)

16
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:37,293
(for 1 additional hour per 1 deviating minute.)

17
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:39,383
("Lovers in Paris" highlights)

18
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:41,122
("That man is my lover.")

19
00:00:41,123 --> 00:00:42,523
(Why couldn't you say it?)

20
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:44,292
(I couldn't possibly do that.)

21
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:46,292
(They supply their own dopamine.)

22
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:47,322
(Young Ji: Where'd you come from?)

23
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:48,732
(The human dopamine went all out.)

24
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:49,962
(Mississippi)

25
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:51,862
(Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock)

26
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:54,372
(If you believe in me, you'll see the time.)

27
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:55,373
(Here comes the spirit.)

28
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:57,203
(She even channeled the spirit of clocks.)

29
00:00:58,073 --> 00:00:59,073
(The fate of their phones depended on...)

30
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,642
(when they said, "Good morning.")

31
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:04,173
(Mimi placed 1st.)

32
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:06,413
(Mimi's record: 7:45am, 17 minutes off)

33
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:07,683
(Yu Jin placed 2nd...)

34
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:09,789
(with the record of 7:35am and a difference of 25 minutes.)

35
00:01:09,813 --> 00:01:12,023
(Eun Ji placed 3rd by saying "Good morning" at 7:22am.)

36
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:14,822
(Her digital detox was extended by 38 more hours.)

37
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:16,693
(The spirit of clocks came in last.)

38
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:19,922
(70 hours!)

39
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:21,062
(Digital detox extension)

40
00:01:21,063 --> 00:01:22,369
(Eun Ji: 38 hours, Young Ji: 70 hours)

41
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:23,432
Please hold on.

42
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,203
- We'll return your phone. - Okay.

43
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:26,763
Thank you.

44
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:28,403
Here's your phone.

45
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:29,832
Thank you.

46
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,443
(The phones go back to the 1st and 2nd places.)

47
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:34,912
I'm jealous.

48
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:36,612
(The 3rd and 4th places, Eun Ji and Young Ji are jealous.)

49
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:37,742
Since you guys worked hard,

50
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:39,382
we'll return the laptop right away.

51
00:01:39,383 --> 00:01:41,712
- Thank you. - Thank you.

52
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:42,753
- All right. - Thank you.

53
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:45,653
(Someone enters the room.)

54
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:48,722
(Hesitant)

55
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:51,522
(Cheol Yong brought breakfast.)

56
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:53,593
(Careful)

57
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:55,192
(What?)

58
00:01:55,193 --> 00:01:57,393
- It's Cheol Yong. - Cheol Yong.

59
00:01:57,394 --> 00:01:58,803
Cheol Yong, did you bring porridge?

60
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:00,679
- What? It's kimchi. - Cheol Yong, it's you.

61
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,703
- Isn't it nice? - Come on in.

62
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,472
The spirit of kimchi.

63
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:04,573
Cheol Yong, thank you.

64
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:06,442
- Thank you. - You even open it for us?

65
00:02:06,443 --> 00:02:08,412
Cheol Yong, thank you. You work so hard.

66
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:09,742
Cheol Yong, thank you.

67
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,543
- You're working in the morning. - Thank you.

68
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:15,263
(The Korean-style vegetable porridge will warm their stomachs.)

69
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:18,523
(There's also kimchi, the perfect side dish.)

70
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,834
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the chopsticks.

71
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:24,962
- It's for digital detox. - Take the chopsticks.

72
00:02:24,963 --> 00:02:25,963
Come on.

73
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:28,592
(Impressed)

74
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:30,392
- It's tasty. - Is it because of digital detox?

75
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:31,403
It's tastier.

76
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:33,232
Let's eat it with kimchi.

77
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,262
(The one who loves sweets hurriedly takes a spoonful.)

78
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:35,333
It's tasty.

79
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:37,032
- You know... - Isn't this totally Korean?

80
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,272
- The chef is Indian. - Okay.

81
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,033
He's very much interested in Korean cuisine.

82
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:42,183
So he learned how to make Korean porridge.

83
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:44,183
- It's really tasty. - Kimchi is really tasty.

84
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:51,053
(The Korean food enthusiast, Yu Jin enjoys the taste of home.)

85
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:52,883
(Impressed)

86
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:56,623
We enjoyed digital detox properly, right? Seriously.

87
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:58,423
We opened a book.

88
00:02:58,863 --> 00:03:00,092
- That's right. - We played by ourselves.

89
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:01,693
Then we fell asleep since we were tired.

90
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,563
I praised a spirit.

91
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:09,303
It was much more stimulating than social media.

92
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:13,272
- It was much more stimulating. - It wasn't much of a detox.

93
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:15,013
- We got more dopamine. - Seriously.

94
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:16,742
She's taking selfies.

95
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:18,543
I'm jealous that she has a phone.

96
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:21,653
So that's what a phone looks like.

97
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:24,252
(I won't look at it.)

98
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,253
So that's a phone.

99
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:28,923
I can't believe it.

100
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:32,463
For 2 days and 22 hours,

101
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:35,363
- I'll live without a phone. - Isn't it your first time?

102
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,592
That's right.

103
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,702
- It's practically 3 days. - It's practically 3 days.

104
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:42,173
Young Ji, have you ever gone three days without a phone?

105
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,202
You were born in the year of the soccer competition.

106
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,373
I haven't done that since middle school.

107
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:48,412
I'll have the spicy one.

108
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,442
- It's totally cheesy. - Yes. Totally cheesy.

109
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:52,043
(They eat tteokbokki for the 2nd round.)

110
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:54,983
- Can we shop for groceries? - What?

111
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:56,983
It's tasty. It's really tasty.

112
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:58,822
(We're glad to hear that.)

113
00:03:58,823 --> 00:03:59,823
She's serious.

114
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:01,343
Cheese tteokbokki is really tasty.

115
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:04,322
(Mimi tries it upon seeing Young Ji's enthusiastic reaction.)

116
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:05,403
- It's really tasty. - Yes.

117
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,303
Cheese tteokbokki is really tasty, right?

118
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:08,762
- Young Ji, this one is tasty too. - Eun Ji, try it.

119
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:09,843
- It's spicy. - It's tasty.

120
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,132
There's so much cheese. We won't be able to finish it.

121
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:13,903
(Oh, my)

122
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:15,933
Yu Jin finds it tasty.

123
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,253
- It'll be perfect for camping. - It's so tasty.

124
00:04:18,573 --> 00:04:21,443
(They've worked hard all night long, so they'll rest for two hours.)

125
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:23,042
Will you take a nap?

126
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:24,343
No, I'll wash up.

127
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:26,643
What will you do?

128
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:28,583
I'll enter the world of dopamine.

129
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:31,523
YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.

130
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:32,952
You'll go to a faraway place.

131
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:35,293
I'll enter the dopamine-rich life.

132
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:36,523
Bye.

133
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:39,063
- It was fun. - It was fun.

134
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:46,603
(Without a phone, Feisty roams the living room.)

135
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,773
(She suddenly goes out.)

136
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,072
(The main building of Agent Training Center)

137
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:54,073
(Peek-a-boo)

138
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:55,272
Knock, knock.

139
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:56,642
(Writer King and Writer Jae Yeong are having a meeting.)

140
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:57,912
Is anyone here?

141
00:04:57,913 --> 00:04:59,633
Yes? Gosh, you startled me. Do you need us?

142
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:00,993
- Is that you, Young Ji? - Gosh.

143
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:02,982
It's the spirit of clocks.

144
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:03,983
(The spirit of clocks came 2 hours early.)

145
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:06,144
- Do you need anything? - Young Ji, aren't you hungry?

146
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,822
Well, it's just that I lost time.

147
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:09,992
- I see. Take a seat. - Oh, no.

148
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:11,992
So I was just walking around.

149
00:05:11,993 --> 00:05:14,323
- You're lost without a phone. - Yes.

150
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,062
- You know... - I'd get withdrawal symptoms.

151
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:17,632
I'm totally getting them. To be honest...

152
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,402
- You want to check it, right? - When I go to the restroom,

153
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,963
and such, it's the worst.

154
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:23,172
Come to think of it, you came because you didn't have a phone.

155
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:26,473
I walked over here because I didn't have a phone.

156
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:28,212
- Right now... - I wondered why you were here.

157
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,542
- She has too much free time. - You said...

158
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:30,843
that we were meeting at 11am.

159
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:34,883
I have no way of knowing when it's 11am.

160
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:39,153
That's why I currently have the mindset of Bill Gates.

161
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:41,393
By the way, Young Ji, let's have a match.

162
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:43,993
- "Culinary Class Wars." - A match.

163
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:45,892
(Let us explain what the match is.)

164
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:47,292
(Last night)

165
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:49,432
It can be a match against the production crew.

166
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,303
Young Ji is good at identifying foreigners.

167
00:05:52,863 --> 00:05:55,733
(The members suggested a match against the production crew.)

168
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:57,302
Writer Jae Yeong and I can have a match...

169
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:58,983
of how many packets of ramyeon we can eat.

170
00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:00,843
I don't eat a lot.

171
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:03,112
- Who can cook ramyeon better? - Who can cook ramyeon better?

172
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,912
- Who can cook ramyeon better? - Yes. We can do that.

173
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:06,633
- We can have a blind test. - A blind test.

174
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:07,852
- That's a good idea. - Oh, my.

175
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:08,882
- I'm so nervous. - It sounds fun.

176
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:10,413
- It really sounds fun. - Yes.

177
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:12,759
(Choi Jae Yeong, 32 years of experience in making ramyeon)

178
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:14,122
(He starred in "Qualifications of Men...")

179
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,423
(as the master of ramyeon.)

180
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:19,363
(The ramyeon expert who represents the production crew)

181
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:21,469
(I'm surprised that a TV writer can cook like this.)

182
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:23,392
(Even an expert was surprised by this ramyeon genius.)

183
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:25,402
- You and I can have a match. - I'm totally for it.

184
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:26,432
Totally.

185
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,433
The idea isn't half bad.

186
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:29,433
Producer Na, I think it'll be fun.

187
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:32,203
I challenged him to a duel.

188
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:34,302
- What are you good at? - You must have a specialty.

189
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:35,672
- Soupy ramyeon... - Is it soupy ramyeon?

190
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:38,082
- When it comes to Buldak ramyeon, - Is it your specialty?

191
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,243
- I'm top tier. - Okay.

192
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:41,213
I'll need to go easy on Writer Jae Yeong.

193
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,083
I'll need to go easy on him.

194
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:45,982
(There's a reason why Young Ji is so confident.)

195
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:49,853
(Season 1, Buldak ramyeon)

196
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:54,263
(Season 2, spicy bibim ramyeon)

197
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:57,963
(She's a true enthusiast who dreams of being a Buldak ambassador.)

198
00:06:58,203 --> 00:06:59,203
My goodness.

199
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:00,802
(She's a Buldak ramyeon master...)

200
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,803
(who has always made the noodles on Earth Arcade.)

201
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:04,003
(Impressed)

202
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:05,643
(Gosh, it's tasty.)

203
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:08,113
(Customer satisfaction)

204
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:10,973
(Young Ji's confidence isn't unfounded.)

205
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:12,712
Among all the Buldak ramyeon I've had,

206
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:14,612
Young Ji's was the tastiest.

207
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:16,053
We're getting testimonies!

208
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:18,733
I heard that Producer Na and Writer Woo Jung have eaten...

209
00:07:18,983 --> 00:07:21,692
Writer Jae Yeong's ramyeon many times.

210
00:07:21,693 --> 00:07:23,392
We've eaten it about 3,000 times.

211
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:25,322
No, it must be 3,900 times.

212
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:26,362
It's no joke.

213
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,409
He was eating ramyeon even before Young Ji was born.

214
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:29,433
Young Ji.

215
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:30,892
You're right.

216
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:32,702
(They were producers and writers when Young Ji was born.)

217
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,933
I had Jae Yeong's ramyeon for the first time...

218
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:37,203
Are you filming a show in that pose?

219
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,572
- You're unbelievable. - Are we filming?

220
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:39,979
- Are we filming? - For goodness' sake.

221
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:41,272
- "Are we filming?" - All of us knew that.

222
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:42,513
"Are we filming?"

223
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:43,673
Seriously.

224
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:44,882
(Na Yeong Seok, Age 49, In bad condition)

225
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:46,042
We're totally filming.

226
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:47,813
(What will be the prize?)

227
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:49,612
Do you want to do it for the prize of ten hours?

228
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:50,712
Will you deduct ten hours?

229
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:52,482
But if you lose... You must know where this is going.

230
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:53,483
- Will the time get extended? - Yes.

231
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:54,923
(Laughing)

232
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,592
- It's a blind test. - It's up to you.

233
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:58,722
- It's a blind test. - Is it up to me?

234
00:07:58,723 --> 00:07:59,792
You can decide on the prize.

235
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:01,863
I'll make Buldak ramyeon...

236
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,663
- for the deduction of two days. - Two days?

237
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,132
(Remaining time: 70 hours)

238
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,873
(If she wins, 48 hours will be deducted.)

239
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,732
(What will happen if she loses?)

240
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,272
(48 hours will be added.)

241
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:14,402
(Her phone will be confiscated for 118 hours.)

242
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:15,942
(For the deduction of 48 hours from Young Ji's phone confiscation, )

243
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:17,583
(they'll have the Buldak ramyeon battle.)

244
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:22,112
(The representative E-cade member and representative staff member...)

245
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:24,723
(will meet for the battle of Buldak ramyeon.)

246
00:08:24,783 --> 00:08:26,683
(Coming soon)

247
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:28,192
(Back to the lodging)

248
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:29,493
It's an emergency!

249
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:31,992
(One is drying her hair and the other is on her phone.)

250
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:33,163
It's an emergency!

251
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,293
What is it?

252
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:36,692
The Buldak ramyeon contest...

253
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:38,362
between Choi Jae Yeong and Lee Young Ji will unfold.

254
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:39,502
- Oh, my gosh. Finally. - Oh, my gosh.

255
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:41,572
The prize will be 48 hours.

256
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:42,573
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

257
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:43,903
The contest will unfold.

258
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,942
- I ask for your participation. - Don't worry about it.

259
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,372
- It'll be a blind test. - Okay.

260
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:49,319
(Player Lee politely asks for their participation.)

261
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:50,743
- Mi Hyun! - Gosh, she startled me.

262
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:52,843
(It's big news!)

263
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:54,043
Have you seen Mi Hyun?

264
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:56,282
- Young Ji. - Mi Hyun.

265
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:57,582
(She calmly waits for her turn.)

266
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,583
Mi Hyun.

267
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:00,052
- It's an emergency! - Get some sleep.

268
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:01,553
No, it's an emergency.

269
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:03,723
The Buldak ramyeon contest...

270
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,492
between Choi Jae Yeong and Lee Young Ji will unfold.

271
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:06,522
Really?

272
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:08,293
It hasn't begun yet.

273
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,933
The prize will be 48 hours.

274
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,303
(Young Ji's feistiness makes her speechless.)

275
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:14,683
How many hours remain if you win?

276
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:16,233
Then 22 hours remain.

277
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,843
(The duration doesn't diminish so easily.)

278
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:21,103
- I'll pick the tasty one. - Okay.

279
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:22,373
The tasty one will be mine.

280
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,143
(Two hours pass after Young Ji's fussing.)

281
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:27,783
(Current time: 11am)

282
00:09:28,453 --> 00:09:30,813
(It's a good day to go out.)

283
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:32,352
Everyone, congratulations.

284
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:33,383
- Why? - Congratulations.

285
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:36,052
You completed your training with flying colors yesterday.

286
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,362
Today, you'll finally have a chance to enter the actual scene.

287
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:39,423
Nice.

288
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:40,822
- Akh. - Will we catch Torong?

289
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:41,832
- Akh. - Akh.

290
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,162
Today, you'll finally infiltrate...

291
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:46,603
- downtown Abu Dhabi secretly. - Akh.

292
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:49,232
We'll drink the coffee Torong drank.

293
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:50,303
- Oh, my. - Oh, my. Okay.

294
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,673
We'll spend our time that way.

295
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:56,313
(Today is the day of the field investigation.)

296
00:09:57,143 --> 00:10:00,283
(They'll be dispatched to downtown Abu Dhabi...)

297
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:03,683
(and follow the footsteps of Torong.)

298
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:08,123
(They'll check out the things Torong ate.)

299
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:10,053
What's essential for the agents?

300
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:11,692
- What's essential for the agents? - Agility.

301
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:12,693
- Agility? - Challenge!

302
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:13,823
- Beauty. - Security.

303
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,492
- What? - Security.

304
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:16,692
Security. That's it.

305
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:18,173
- We need to hide things. - Security.

306
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:20,702
You need to enter Abu Dhabi,

307
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,932
the United Arab Emirates in the most natural way.

308
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,819
- You need to eat... - That's what I want to do.

309
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,402
And dress up like the locals.

310
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:28,442
That's what I want to do.

311
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,072
- So it's time for the first step. - Okay.

312
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:31,882
- You'll get the local makeup done. - Nice.

313
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:32,883
- Okay. - You guessed correctly.

314
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:34,713
- I was spot on, right? - Nice.

315
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:37,353
(Step 1, Local makeup)

316
00:10:37,713 --> 00:10:39,952
(The traditional beauty and modern stylishness coexist...)

317
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:41,383
(in the Arabic makeup)

318
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:46,593
(For the perfect disguise, we invited the best experts.)

319
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:50,363
(They'll look like these women after wearing a disguise.)

320
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,762
You'll go to a market...

321
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:53,083
- and wear local clothes. - Nice.

322
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:57,033
(They'll check out what's happening in the city.)

323
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:59,603
Then you'll drink the coffee the locals drink.

324
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,243
(Then they'll check out what Torong did.)

325
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:03,542
- Let's go. - It's so nice.

326
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:04,982
I really wanted to do such activities.

327
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,382
- It'll be fun. - You mentioned it just now.

328
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:07,442
You guys need to blend in.

329
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:09,189
- You guys need to become locals. - You have a good hunch.

330
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:10,213
This is insane.

331
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:11,799
- Go to the one you want. - Gosh, the makeup artists.

332
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:12,952
- Akh. - Akh.

333
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:13,953
(The agents enter the main building.)

334
00:11:13,954 --> 00:11:16,322
- I smell makeup. - Marhaba.

335
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:17,552
- Hello. - Hi.

336
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,663
- Syukran jazilan. - Hi.

337
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:22,162
Two people here...

338
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:23,532
and two people beyond the curtains.

339
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:24,809
(2 people will get their makeup done at the same time.)

340
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,103
- Hello. - Can you pick one?

341
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:28,402
Okay.

342
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:29,672
- Pick one. - Pick...

343
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:31,073
- your customer. - Pick one.

344
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,142
Pick your customer.

345
00:11:32,143 --> 00:11:33,772
- Who is your favorite person? - You.

346
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:34,843
- You. - Okay.

347
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:36,042
See?

348
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:37,643
- See? - Hello.

349
00:11:37,673 --> 00:11:39,112
- Mimi suits Abu Dhabi. - I know.

350
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:40,712
- Here. You. - Yes.

351
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:41,852
- Eun Ji, let's go. - Let's go inside.

352
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,153
- Okay. I see you. - I see you.

353
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:45,453
- Thank you. - Bye.

354
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,622
(The two remaining makeup artists)

355
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,793
Hello.

356
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,122
(Charismatic)

357
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:51,352
- Eun Ji. - Hello.

358
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:53,392
I personally want to get my makeup done by her.

359
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:54,622
- Okay. - How about you?

360
00:11:54,623 --> 00:11:55,892
I'm more drawn to this makeup artist as well.

361
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:57,662
- Really? - Let's make them choose.

362
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:59,562
- Can you pick one? - It's your choice, ma'am.

363
00:11:59,563 --> 00:12:01,302
- You need to pick. - Please.

364
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,773
- Me. - Yes. Come on.

365
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,943
- I love it. - Hello.

366
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:06,503
- What a beautiful girl. - Thank you.

367
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:07,802
- Hello. - I'm Nikki.

368
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:09,843
Nikki. Hello, I'm Young Ji.

369
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:11,942
- Zunaira? My name is Eun Ji. - Yes.

370
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:13,943
- I'm seriously excited. - Eun Ji.

371
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,812
- Zunaira? - Zunaira.

372
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:17,153
- Zunaira. Okay. - Nikki.

373
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:19,582
- Gold hands. - Gold hands?

374
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,623
Yes.

375
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:25,123
I want to be very big.

376
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:27,093
Big?

377
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,132
Mimi, what should be the theme of my makeup for today?

378
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,192
The cutest one.

379
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:33,003
Traditional makeup, but very cute.

380
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,302
(Oh, my)

381
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:37,173
Number one is cuteness, but a little bit of sexiness.

382
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,543
- Sexy. - A little bit.

383
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:41,402
She's the boss.

384
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:43,742
Is she the boss? I had a hunch.

385
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:47,142
That's right. She has the vibe of Jung Saem Mool.

386
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:48,182
(The director has unrivaled charisma.)

387
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,153
Her touches are not hesitant.

388
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:54,023
My makeup artist has the vibe of RISABAE.

389
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:57,453
Your hands are very kind.

390
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,922
Your hands are very sweet.

391
00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:02,033
Thank you.

392
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,162
Are the styles different?

393
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:06,603
Yes. You're getting the colors right away, but Yu Jin...

394
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,433
(Mimi's makeup artist focuses on the colors.)

395
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:12,273
(Her trait is the fancy eye makeup skills.)

396
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:14,673
I'm still on the foundation.

397
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:17,283
(Yu Jin's makeup artist focuses on the foundation.)

398
00:13:17,943 --> 00:13:20,443
(Her trait is the attention to details.)

399
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,113
(Step 1, basic skincare)

400
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:25,452
Basic skincare should be done with care and effort.

401
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:27,823
For the lasting makeup, make the skin smooth.

402
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:29,793
Make me an Arabic star.

403
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:32,423
(Young Ji is getting some skincare done as well.)

404
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:35,393
(Eun Ji has moved on to foundation.)

405
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:38,263
Do agents usually get their makeup done?

406
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:40,433
Do they disguise themselves...

407
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:42,603
- No, they don't. - by getting their makeup done?

408
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,742
If you watch "Mission: Impossible," they used advanced technology...

409
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,542
like making a model of an agent's face.

410
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:49,242
But we're just getting our makeup done.

411
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:50,472
They're skilled makeup artists.

412
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:52,683
I see. You have a point.

413
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:57,053
(Step 2, base makeup)

414
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,522
Foundation should be matte and smooth.

415
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:01,923
Accentuate the contours with aggressive shading.

416
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:04,023
Which step are you on?

417
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:07,122
She's applying blusher and contouring products.

418
00:14:07,123 --> 00:14:09,063
- Are you on blusher already? - Yes.

419
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:12,002
I see that they don't skimp on the products.

420
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:13,063
That's right.

421
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:14,232
They use an ample amount.

422
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:15,603
I feel like I'm boxing.

423
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:17,773
(Dabbing on her ears as well)

424
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:19,673
Why did she put makeup on my ears?

425
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:20,902
Then the color will be even.

426
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,489
(The ears need to be in the same color.)

427
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:24,472
Young Ji, what did people say that you looked like...

428
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:25,682
in your school days?

429
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:27,513
A seated Buddha statue.

430
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:30,553
(She has a generous-looking face.)

431
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:31,853
A Buddha statue.

432
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:36,153
I'm so curious about Yu Jin and Mimi.

433
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:37,823
Mi Hyun went on a long journey.

434
00:14:38,123 --> 00:14:39,603
Did she go on a long journey already?

435
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:42,333
The eyeshadow is very pretty...

436
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:44,763
- and beautiful in Korea. - Thank you.

437
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:48,733
Hold on.

438
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:53,172
(Why do my eyebrows look like gulls?)

439
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:54,203
Hold on.

440
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:58,743
(Don't worry. This is just the beginning.)

441
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:01,483
(Step 3, Eye makeup)

442
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,912
With intense eyeshadow and eyeliner, get a sense of presence.

443
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:07,853
The eyebrows should be distinctive and the lashes should be voluminous.

444
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:10,423
(She doesn't miss the gold glitter.)

445
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:12,292
- Brown. - Oh, my. Did she bring it?

446
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:13,622
- Yes. It's gray. - Gray.

447
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:14,623
My goodness.

448
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:16,392
- It's light brown. - Brownish gray.

449
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,163
Brownish gray.

450
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,933
(She applies the contact lenses the makeup artist recommended.)

451
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:22,702
(With the contact lens)

452
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:24,233
- How is it? - I love it.

453
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:27,243
(The expert of details is satisfied.)

454
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,823
(How did the agents transform?)

455
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:44,452
(They'll be revealed now.)

456
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:45,763
Please come on in.

457
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,733
Welcome.

458
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:52,802
"Welcome?"

459
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:54,833
I see that you've infiltrated...

460
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:56,673
my mansion.

461
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:58,232
It's nice to meet you.

462
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,073
(Apparently, she's the owner of this mansion.)

463
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:01,742
I've heard a lot about you.

464
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:03,543
It's Chang Dae, right?

465
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:05,012
Chang Dae.

466
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:07,243
(Agent Eun JI's disguise is complete.)

467
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:10,153
(Code name: Mariam)

468
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:11,453
Welcome.

469
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,783
It's nice to meet you guys.

470
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:15,923
I'm good at making spicy braised monkfish.

471
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:18,893
My favorite dish is abai sundae.

472
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:21,462
This show is "The Successful Days in the Arabic World."

473
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,862
- I see. - Thanks for being on the show.

474
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:25,733
- It's nice to meet you. - All right, ma'am.

475
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,433
If you don't mind my asking,

476
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,802
what's your financial situation?

477
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:31,972
My financial situation?

478
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:33,543
I have about 60,000 billion dollars.

479
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:36,512
(Her class is on another level.)

480
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:38,072
I have about 60,000 billion dollars.

481
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:39,213
Well,

482
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:40,742
I have a past.

483
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:42,552
I'm a woman with a past.

484
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:44,782
I heard that there was a business...

485
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:46,583
that earned you about 30,000 billion dollars.

486
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:49,723
When you go to Seoul,

487
00:16:49,953 --> 00:16:51,892
you can see the signboards of the sundaeguk restaurants.

488
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:54,263
- Yes. - I was the originator.

489
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:56,892
I ran a sundaeguk restaurant with my name on the signboard.

490
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:58,803
- I think I've seen it. - Yes.

491
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:01,402
After running the restaurant for many years,

492
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:02,672
my sundae meal kit...

493
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,333
- became a hit. - I see.

494
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:08,643
With that money, I built my mansion here.

495
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:10,512
It was the abai sundae business.

496
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:12,212
- Yes. - You went global.

497
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:14,643
Was your name Min Hwan? Min Hwan?

498
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,313
On that sofa where Min Hwan is currently sitting,

499
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:19,423
I spent time with George Clooney.

500
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:22,352
- What did you guys do? - With George Clooney,

501
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:23,692
- Okay. - I enjoyed a party.

502
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:26,322
What did George Clooney eat during a party?

503
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:28,792
George Clooney liked...

504
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:30,262
salted squid.

505
00:17:30,263 --> 00:17:31,593
Salted squid?

506
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:33,763
I make it spicy.

507
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:36,432
- The Arabic episode... - Okay.

508
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:37,732
- of "Na's Successful Days..." - Okay.

509
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:39,572
- has another guest. - Is there another guest?

510
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:41,272
Yes. Would it be okay to invite her here?

511
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:43,353
I thought I was the only guest. I guess I was wrong.

512
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:45,143
- We're sorry. - It's okay.

513
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:47,413
- Tell her to come on in. - Okay.

514
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:49,913
I'm curious about the other guest.

515
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:51,812
Please take a good look.

516
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:52,883
Okay.

517
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,153
Oh, my.

518
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:57,892
Hello. Oh, my.

519
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,593
Gosh, she must be rich.

520
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:01,639
You must have a lot of money. You must be wealthy.

521
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,633
I'm Aisha.

522
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:06,603
(Agent Mimi's disguise is complete.)

523
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,333
(Code name: Aisha)

524
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:11,602
- Aisha, nice to meet you. - My name isn't Sour.

525
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:12,642
It's Aisha.

526
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:13,942
Aisha. It's nice to meet you. Aisha, please come over here.

527
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:15,843
Welcome to my mansion.

528
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:18,612
- Your mansion? - Yes, my mansion.

529
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:19,742
- It's nice to meet you. - Really?

530
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:21,443
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

531
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:24,752
- You have a pretty face. - Yes.

532
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:26,883
Very gorgeous.

533
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:28,992
She outlined my lips a lot.

534
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:31,552
She outlined my lips. It's the overlip makeup.

535
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,962
- And I can't open my eyes. - I can't open my eyes.

536
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:35,793
My eyes are half closed.

537
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:37,832
They don't attach the lashes strand by strand.

538
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:38,963
You can't open your eyes.

539
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:40,103
I can't open them.

540
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:43,173
- I can't see. - The lashes are too heavy.

541
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:45,742
We met by chance, so let's take a selfie together.

542
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:47,903
Eun Ji, what's your setting? What's your name?

543
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,273
I go by Mariam, but my real name is Sook Ja.

544
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:53,013
It's your old name.

545
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,113
Namkoong Sook Ja.

546
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:58,552
In Abu Dhabi, they call me Mariam.

547
00:18:58,553 --> 00:18:59,882
- Mariam. - In Seoul, I'm...

548
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:01,382
- Sook Ja. - Sook Ja. Namkoong Sook Ja.

549
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:02,622
- Namkoong Sook Ja. - Yes.

550
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:04,252
Aisha, do you have a Korean name?

551
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:05,253
Mi Ja.

552
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:07,262
Mi Ja. We both have Ja as a syllable.

553
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:08,592
It's nice to meet you.

554
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:10,993
I see that you have this item.

555
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:12,262
- It's a must. - Yes.

556
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:13,763
Only celebrities own this item.

557
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:15,433
What's convenient about it?

558
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:20,142
A straw is attached to it.

559
00:19:20,143 --> 00:19:22,813
You can put it up like this.

560
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:26,382
This is how middle-aged women drink while wearing the lip makeup.

561
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:27,383
They do this.

562
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,553
This is how they drink.

563
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:37,092
Am I imagining things? You can't look us in the eye.

564
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,393
- It's the third guest of the show. - Who is coming?

565
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:40,693
(Who will be the third guest?)

566
00:19:40,694 --> 00:19:42,233
- Gosh, hello. - Oh, my.

567
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:48,033
- She looks pretty. - She looks so pretty.

568
00:19:48,463 --> 00:19:50,933
(Agent Young Ji's disguise is complete.)

569
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:53,703
(Code name: Cassandra)

570
00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:55,342
What's this?

571
00:19:55,343 --> 00:19:58,712
(Her dance and face go well together.)

572
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:00,342
She looks pretty.

573
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:01,942
- She looks pretty. - I love it so much.

574
00:20:01,943 --> 00:20:03,812
- She loves it so much. - This is the best makeup look.

575
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:05,212
- Take a seat. Come on down. - Seriously.

576
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:06,522
- It's nice to meet you. - She looks so pretty.

577
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,322
It's nice to meet you. What's your name?

578
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,622
- Masala Dabilou. - Masala Dabilou.

579
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,022
- Masala Dabilou? - I'm curious about your character.

580
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:15,533
This is my mansion.

581
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:19,003
My Korean name is Namkoong Sook Ja.

582
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:21,702
- Nam Koong Sook. - Namkoong Sook Ja.

583
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:23,003
Namkoong Sook Ja.

584
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:24,472
Call me Sook Ja.

585
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,572
- Her last name is Namkoong. - Sook Ja.

586
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:28,603
I have about 60,000 billion dollars.

587
00:20:28,713 --> 00:20:29,812
- Did you say 60,000 billion? - Yes.

588
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,712
Yes. May I reveal my wealth as well?

589
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:35,082
- Of course. - I have three gazillion dollars.

590
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,353
- Three gazillion dollars. - Three gazillion dollars.

591
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,253
You're sitting on the spot...

592
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:41,722
where Monica Bellucci sat.

593
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:42,723
Monica Bellucci.

594
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,053
Yes. I threw a party in my place.

595
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:47,162
So whose house is this?

596
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,193
You look a bit like Monica Bellucci.

597
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:50,592
Then I'll go by Monica.

598
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:51,733
- Okay. - Monica.

599
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,639
- Okay. Monica. - How about Beluga?

600
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:55,263
- Beluga? - Yes. Beluga.

601
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:57,702
- Beluga. - How about Cassandra?

602
00:20:57,703 --> 00:20:59,143
- Cassandra. - I'll go by that name.

603
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:00,903
- Namkoong Sook Ja. - Yes.

604
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,472
- I'm Cassandra. - Yes. Cassandra.

605
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:04,842
- What's your name? - Aisha.

606
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:06,013
- Aisha. - Aisha.

607
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:09,453
I'm sorry, but you just look like Mimi.

608
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,353
- Only your face is Aisha. - Okay.

609
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:14,873
I made a lot of money by running a sundaeguk restaurant...

610
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,392
- in Abu Dhabi. - Hey.

611
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:18,052
- Hey, girls. - Who is it? Oh, my.

612
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:20,693
- She looks so pretty. - She's like an American.

613
00:21:20,998 --> 00:21:22,667
- Hey, girls. - Who is it? Oh, my.

614
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:25,238
- She looks so pretty. - She's like an American.

615
00:21:25,638 --> 00:21:28,637
Hello, it's nice to meet you. Gosh, she's a Gen Zer.

616
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:29,708
Yu Jin looks so pretty.

617
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:31,424
- It's nice to meet you. - What is she doing?

618
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:33,217
She looks like a game character.

619
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:34,698
(She's both familiar and unfamiliar.)

620
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,118
(Agent Yu Jin's disguise is complete.)

621
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:39,888
(Code name: Patra)

622
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:42,557
(The youngest member's fancy transformation)

623
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:45,058
How does her face look so different?

624
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,028
- How do I look? Okay. - It's nice to meet you.

625
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:49,498
What's your name?

626
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:51,997
My name is Patra.

627
00:21:51,998 --> 00:21:54,437
- Yes. Patra. - She really looks like Patra.

628
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,838
Let's clink our cups.

629
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:57,907
Hello, everyone.

630
00:21:57,908 --> 00:21:59,037
- Nice to... - Hello, everyone.

631
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:01,107
- meet you. - Let's sit down.

632
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:02,977
- Yes. - Your eyes look different.

633
00:22:02,978 --> 00:22:04,748
Gosh, don't look at me.

634
00:22:05,348 --> 00:22:07,147
- Your eyes... - Yu Jin.

635
00:22:07,148 --> 00:22:09,747
- Your eyes look different. - Your eyelid folds are gone.

636
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:10,817
- Gosh. - It's like a filter.

637
00:22:10,818 --> 00:22:12,457
- She looks pretty. - It's like an Instagram filter.

638
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,634
- It really is like a filter. - Are you wearing contact lenses?

639
00:22:14,658 --> 00:22:17,988
- It's nice to meet you. - We introduced ourselves.

640
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:20,328
Hi. Where's my camera?

641
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,198
Hi, my name is Patra.

642
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:29,668
And welcome to my village.

643
00:22:29,768 --> 00:22:31,537
Oh, my gosh. I'm really upset.

644
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:33,437
- Is this your village? - Sorry.

645
00:22:33,438 --> 00:22:34,577
- Namkoong Sook Ja, I heard that... - Yes.

646
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:35,707
This was your village.

647
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:36,708
- Yes. - Yes.

648
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:38,707
- What? - This is my village.

649
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,677
- Oh, my gosh. - There's a problem of ownership.

650
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:42,718
- A long time ago... - I just took over.

651
00:22:43,188 --> 00:22:44,287
- What? - I just took over.

652
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:46,988
You just took over the property.

653
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:49,087
I'm terribly sorry, but I got my makeup done first...

654
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,058
and came up with that setting.

655
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:52,898
This is my village.

656
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:55,627
Why don't we say that you own the neighboring village...

657
00:22:55,628 --> 00:22:56,667
- for the consistency's sake? - She's preparing to take over.

658
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:57,944
Let's say that you're preparing to take over.

659
00:22:57,968 --> 00:22:59,597
- Okay. - Yes. You're preparing for it.

660
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:02,708
- Young Ji reminds me of someone. - Who?

661
00:23:03,138 --> 00:23:04,807
- I don't know. - She never cries.

662
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:08,337
- Who? - She reminds me a bit...

663
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:10,148
of a Gen Z shaman in Hongdae.

664
00:23:10,648 --> 00:23:12,678
She reminds me a bit of her.

665
00:23:13,048 --> 00:23:16,688
I'm someone who has three gazillion dollars.

666
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:19,387
- Yes? - I'll show you the money dance.

667
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:21,117
- The money dance? - It's the Arabic style.

668
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:22,457
- The money dance. - The Arabic style.

669
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:27,527
Arabian night

670
00:23:27,528 --> 00:23:30,268
(She goes to the production crew to make everyone rich.)

671
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:32,497
(Money will pour in.)

672
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:33,967
If you check your bank accounts,

673
00:23:33,968 --> 00:23:36,138
you'll see that you got 30 dollars each.

674
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:38,768
- What? I got it. - You got it.

675
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:40,178
- I got it. - Thank you.

676
00:23:40,508 --> 00:23:42,507
Let's go and use three gazillion dollars.

677
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,078
Let's go. It's very nice.

678
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,918
Let's take a photo with Mimi's phone.

679
00:23:46,248 --> 00:23:47,248
Hold on.

680
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:48,618
My goodness.

681
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,717
- Yes, we're done. - Yes. Okay.

682
00:23:51,718 --> 00:23:53,717
- Thank you. - Very good timing.

683
00:23:53,718 --> 00:23:56,027
Now, let's go to the market...

684
00:23:56,028 --> 00:23:58,427
and pick out our outfits of the day.

685
00:23:58,428 --> 00:24:00,427
- Cheers. - Cheers.

686
00:24:00,428 --> 00:24:03,328
It's cold and it lasts long.

687
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:06,497
It's cold and it lasts long.

688
00:24:06,498 --> 00:24:07,667
Like my money.

689
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:10,708
- The coldness does last long. - Jiggling.

690
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:15,538
(They leave for downtown while enjoying the coldness.)

691
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:16,647
(Today's schedule for the agents)

692
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:18,448
(Shop for local clothes.)

693
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:20,478
- Let's take a selfie together. - Why?

694
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:22,818
I don't have a phone.

695
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,917
(She confidently makes Yu Jin take a selfie.)

696
00:24:24,918 --> 00:24:26,018
Hello.

697
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:30,027
- Who are you? - My name is Cassandra.

698
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:31,658
My name is Patra.

699
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:33,098
I like it.

700
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:34,497
I sent the photo, and Rei went,

701
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:36,898
"Is it real?"

702
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:38,268
She thought it was a filter.

703
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:41,438
I really like the makeup.

704
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:43,538
We'll look great once we put on the local clothes.

705
00:24:44,468 --> 00:24:47,338
Seriously, I love Abu Dhabi.

706
00:24:47,808 --> 00:24:48,978
- Nice. - This is the place.

707
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:52,078
Torong bought something here.

708
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:54,408
(You can check out the souvenirs of Abu Dhabi...)

709
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:56,988
(and food items at this place.)

710
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:59,388
(Torong bought chocolate at a nearby place.)

711
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:02,118
(You can buy various traditional clothes here.)

712
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:04,257
Let's split into 2 teams and meet in 40 minutes.

713
00:25:04,258 --> 00:25:05,258
- Okay. Where? - Okay.

714
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:06,597
- Bye. - Bye.

715
00:25:06,598 --> 00:25:08,497
- Let's become pretty. - Okay.

716
00:25:08,498 --> 00:25:11,027
- All of these... - My goodness.

717
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:12,397
Gold.

718
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:14,138
The gold color will suit you.

719
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:15,867
Gosh, that outfit is so pretty.

720
00:25:15,868 --> 00:25:17,667
I love the full set.

721
00:25:17,668 --> 00:25:19,238
Mimi, what kind of style do you want?

722
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:21,937
- You need a gold item. - Me?

723
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,407
Mimi, how about that?

724
00:25:23,408 --> 00:25:24,408
Mimi.

725
00:25:24,578 --> 00:25:26,617
- It isn't half bad. - Mimi, take a look.

726
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:28,378
Try the top and bottom.

727
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:31,187
You're quite materialistic.

728
00:25:31,188 --> 00:25:33,658
- That's good. - Yes.

729
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:35,388
Yes.

730
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:37,057
(The belt shapes the outfit.)

731
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:38,358
Very gorgeous.

732
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:39,758
(Then the scarf goes around her head.)

733
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,258
My goodness. That's it, Mimi.

734
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:46,068
Mimi, didn't I pick the perfect outfit?

735
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:48,914
- I picked the perfect outfit. - Eun Ji, you're the best.

736
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:50,808
Gosh, look at you.

737
00:25:51,408 --> 00:25:52,784
- You look so different. - So pretty.

738
00:25:52,808 --> 00:25:54,907
I thought it was a necklace.

739
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:56,628
- You wear it like this, okay? - So pretty.

740
00:25:57,078 --> 00:25:59,277
- So pretty. - Good. Very good.

741
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:01,317
- You like it, right? - I like it so much.

742
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:03,248
This is amazing. What are you going to do?

743
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:04,417
How much is it?

744
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:06,917
I think the man on the right...

745
00:26:06,918 --> 00:26:07,918
likes Mimi.

746
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,057
(Kim Mi Kwan, 0 experience in dating)

747
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:11,928
That's what I think. What? His heart is fluttering.

748
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:13,658
She looks like a princess.

749
00:26:13,758 --> 00:26:15,558
Princess!

750
00:26:16,728 --> 00:26:18,098
Do you have a girlfriend?

751
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:21,537
- I'm married. - He's married.

752
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,608
- Yes. Thank you. - Okay.

753
00:26:23,738 --> 00:26:25,108
Can we go now?

754
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:28,038
- Bye. Thank you so much. - Thank you so much.

755
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:29,777
- Which one is yours? - Mine is orange.

756
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:30,978
I saw an orange one earlier.

757
00:26:31,178 --> 00:26:32,208
Isn't it this one?

758
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:35,318
That's right. It's this one.

759
00:26:37,118 --> 00:26:40,758
I really want it. It's the Namkoong Sook Ja style.

760
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:44,688
I want to top, bottom, and this scarf.

761
00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:47,158
- All of them. - I'll bring this one here.

762
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:49,328
In this color, I have only one.

763
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,327
- Really? - Only one piece.

764
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:52,527
It's the only one.

765
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:55,067
- I have an eye for such items. - Yes.

766
00:26:55,068 --> 00:26:56,668
The last piece.

767
00:26:57,368 --> 00:26:58,967
(As soon as she puts it on)

768
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,738
- Gosh. - My goodness.

769
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,408
- It's insane. - Come.

770
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,177
(She puts it on properly.)

771
00:27:05,178 --> 00:27:07,317
Yes. My gorgeous line.

772
00:27:07,318 --> 00:27:08,318
- Yes. - It suits her so well.

773
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,617
Is this size okay?

774
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:11,688
- Can you breathe? - Is it okay?

775
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:12,818
I'm okay.

776
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:15,718
- She looks nice. - I'm okay.

777
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:18,487
- The detail... - Wait.

778
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:20,374
(The scarf is the finishing touch to her disguise.)

779
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:22,458
- Gosh, Eun Ji. You look amazing. - Yes?

780
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:24,197
This looks amazing on you.

781
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:25,227
(As expected, Eun Ji looks stunning dressed in orange from head to toe.)

782
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:26,548
- You look good, Eun Ji. - Right.

783
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:28,438
You look stunning.

784
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:31,868
I don't think they'll recognize us. They won't know it's us.

785
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:33,407
We have to hide.

786
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:35,408
(The two older members are perfectly in disguise.)

787
00:27:35,538 --> 00:27:36,548
Goodness.

788
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:38,077
Yu Jin, what do you think?

789
00:27:38,078 --> 00:27:39,317
(The two younger members are also shopping as well.)

790
00:27:39,318 --> 00:27:40,748
- Nice, right? - You'll wear black?

791
00:27:41,018 --> 00:27:42,018
Yes, black.

792
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:43,548
Yu Jin, what about that one?

793
00:27:43,988 --> 00:27:45,217
- Black? - What about that one?

794
00:27:45,218 --> 00:27:46,517
- It's cool. - It's nice, right?

795
00:27:46,518 --> 00:27:48,158
- It looks like a stage costume. - Right?

796
00:27:48,688 --> 00:27:49,688
- This one's cool. - Hello.

797
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:50,858
How much is this?

798
00:27:51,328 --> 00:27:53,358
(Young Ji tries it on right away.)

799
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:56,658
(The dress even has a hood that she can hide her face with.)

800
00:27:57,528 --> 00:27:59,168
(Feeling ridiculous)

801
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:01,668
I look beautiful, right?

802
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:03,807
I want to try this on too.

803
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:05,608
White? She wants that white one.

804
00:28:05,738 --> 00:28:06,738
Yes.

805
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:08,384
- You want that white one? - You look cool, Young Ji. Gosh.

806
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:09,808
You look amazing.

807
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:12,307
What do you think will happen...

808
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:13,828
if I serve the Clock Spirit like this?

809
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:18,588
Nikki, the makeup artist, told me that hiding my eyes...

810
00:28:22,088 --> 00:28:24,958
(Will it make you look scarier?)

811
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,328
(Young Ji is very satisfied with her disguise.)

812
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:29,798
Goodness. This suits her perfectly.

813
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:32,097
This is so her.

814
00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:34,068
(Yu Jin looks amazing in the white dress.)

815
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:35,468
What do you think?

816
00:28:35,838 --> 00:28:37,437
- Do we... - What do you think?

817
00:28:37,438 --> 00:28:39,038
Look like rich sisters from Abu Dhabi?

818
00:28:39,408 --> 00:28:42,008
- Who looks richer? - I look richer, of course.

819
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:44,177
I look like I made money through illegal activities.

820
00:28:44,178 --> 00:28:45,608
Of course, I look richer.

821
00:28:47,148 --> 00:28:48,668
Are we supposed to carry it like this?

822
00:28:49,218 --> 00:28:50,424
It goes well with your character.

823
00:28:50,448 --> 00:28:51,518
- Right? - Yes.

824
00:28:51,888 --> 00:28:53,564
You need to create a character for yourself too.

825
00:28:53,588 --> 00:28:54,987
- I want to be... - I'm...

826
00:28:54,988 --> 00:28:56,888
When you use dark magic on someone,

827
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:58,927
- I repel you. I heal them. - You lift the spell and heal them?

828
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:00,198
The white mage of healing.

829
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:02,727
Those purses are so cool.

830
00:29:02,728 --> 00:29:04,128
(They now step into a purse store.)

831
00:29:04,198 --> 00:29:05,198
Like this?

832
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:07,567
(The dark mage spotted a black purse.)

833
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:08,968
Young Ji, it suits you so well.

834
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:10,467
White one, also. This white one...

835
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:12,007
White one? Can we see the white one?

836
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:13,777
- Can we see the white one? - White one? I love it.

837
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:15,238
- I love it. - We're twins.

838
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:17,477
Let me see.

839
00:29:17,478 --> 00:29:18,708
- I want to get this. - Hey.

840
00:29:19,578 --> 00:29:21,118
Yu Jin, I love this look.

841
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:23,264
I just want to look like this for the rest of my life.

842
00:29:23,288 --> 00:29:24,387
(Laughing)

843
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:25,717
- Young Ji. - Goodness.

844
00:29:25,718 --> 00:29:26,718
Young Ji, hold it up.

845
00:29:26,888 --> 00:29:27,958
Jafar.

846
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,027
Excuse me, sir. How much is this?

847
00:29:31,028 --> 00:29:32,628
I found my baby.

848
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:35,297
This is 40 dollars.

849
00:29:35,298 --> 00:29:37,127
Is it 40 dollars? My baby is too expensive.

850
00:29:37,128 --> 00:29:38,598
Yes, it's good quality.

851
00:29:38,728 --> 00:29:41,237
My baby, good quality. I see you, my baby.

852
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,878
(Young Ji was destined to meet her baby.)

853
00:29:42,938 --> 00:29:46,677
This length. Can it extend longer?

854
00:29:46,678 --> 00:29:48,277
- No? - No, it doesn't extend.

855
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:49,448
This doesn't extend?

856
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:50,707
Is that longer?

857
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:51,777
That's the GoPro.

858
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:53,318
(That's the GoPro.)

859
00:29:53,578 --> 00:29:55,818
I can actually use the GoPro to have the same effect.

860
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,117
The GoPro is longer.

861
00:29:57,118 --> 00:29:58,388
- The GoPro is longer. - Okay.

862
00:29:59,288 --> 00:30:01,117
Young Ji, we have to buy our rings first.

863
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:03,228
Over there. We found them.

864
00:30:04,088 --> 00:30:06,627
(From dragon rings...)

865
00:30:06,628 --> 00:30:09,058
- It's like a ring of emptiness. - Right.

866
00:30:09,468 --> 00:30:11,298
- Excuse me. - Healing with love.

867
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:14,868
(She's so entertained by the ring.)

868
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:16,338
We do.

869
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:18,408
- And this one. - This one.

870
00:30:19,978 --> 00:30:21,508
What did I say was our theme?

871
00:30:21,938 --> 00:30:24,048
- Innocent and evil. - Innocent and evil.

872
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:27,218
- We've adapted perfectly. - Yes.

873
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:29,218
Gosh, that orange girl.

874
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:31,648
I see a flutter of orange.

875
00:30:33,158 --> 00:30:34,158
Hey.

876
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:36,988
- Someone's calling us. - Don't look back.

877
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:39,058
I guess they can't hear us.

878
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:40,828
Hey, Orange!

879
00:30:42,528 --> 00:30:44,828
(Who called us?)

880
00:30:45,498 --> 00:30:47,167
(Even from afar, their vibe is strong.)

881
00:30:47,168 --> 00:30:48,798
Your disguises are perfect.

882
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:51,388
- They really look like sorcerers. - Right.

883
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,938
You really are graduates of the Secret Agent Academy.

884
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:57,348
- You guys look awesome. - I know, right?

885
00:30:57,748 --> 00:30:59,078
Don't we look like locals?

886
00:30:59,378 --> 00:31:00,378
- Amazing. - As graduates...

887
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:03,287
of the Secret Agent Academy, you've disguised yourselves well.

888
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:04,587
You've done such a good job that I can't tell who you are.

889
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:06,468
- Thank you. - I can't tell who you are either.

890
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:10,388
We must not get caught. Everyone, be careful.

891
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,327
- Is that it? - I'm sorry,

892
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,127
- but I have a question. - What is it?

893
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:15,728
Why did you choose to wear orange?

894
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:18,128
I'm not sure. It just spoke to me.

895
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:20,597
You had no intention of getting in disguise.

896
00:31:20,598 --> 00:31:22,798
- I did. No one will recognize me. - She's a tangerine.

897
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:27,337
(The dark mage doesn't exactly blend in, either.)

898
00:31:27,338 --> 00:31:28,708
(Let's stop and get moving.)

899
00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:30,578
We have to seem as local as possible.

900
00:31:30,878 --> 00:31:33,478
No, we must look as rich as possible.

901
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,917
We're agents. We have to hide our true identities.

902
00:31:35,918 --> 00:31:37,718
So then why did you choose orange, Catherine?

903
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:40,988
Catherine died in Bali.

904
00:31:41,388 --> 00:31:43,928
- So then, who are you? - I'm a secret agent.

905
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,028
Secret Agent, what's your name?

906
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:47,898
My name is Lee Yong Su.

907
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,198
Lee Yong Su?

908
00:31:49,628 --> 00:31:51,498
- You're the Commissioner. - That's right.

909
00:31:51,968 --> 00:31:53,808
My beloved junior colleague gave me that name.

910
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,774
- I love the details of your dress. - Thank you.

911
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:57,468
No one will ever recognize you.

912
00:31:57,638 --> 00:31:59,307
- You're not Lee Young Ji. - I'm not.

913
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,308
You look like a shaman.

914
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:01,337
(She looks especially extraordinary.)

915
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:02,924
You look like you're the local sorcerer.

916
00:32:02,948 --> 00:32:04,647
I will perform the rite to try and awaken...

917
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:06,108
the Clock Spirit again this evening.

918
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:08,647
Doesn't she look like Jafar from "Aladdin?"

919
00:32:08,648 --> 00:32:10,417
- Jafar? - Yes, you're right.

920
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:12,958
She's the type to use dark magic,

921
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:14,818
and you're the princess type.

922
00:32:15,718 --> 00:32:17,127
(Glancing over)

923
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:18,257
- The gym. - Gosh, we're...

924
00:32:18,258 --> 00:32:20,998
I briefly looked over at these three.

925
00:32:22,428 --> 00:32:25,428
I'm not even joking, but I suddenly could smell a foreign scent.

926
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:27,998
They don't feel Korean right now.

927
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:30,138
Especially the one on the far right.

928
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:32,367
(No one can compete with Mimi.)

929
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,608
You look like you'll be getting married here tomorrow.

930
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:37,147
No, but doesn't she look like she belongs in the national ad...

931
00:32:37,148 --> 00:32:39,648
for the local airline's flight attendants?

932
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:41,247
- Yes. - This really suits you,

933
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:42,777
- Mimi. - Yes, it suits you.

934
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:43,818
Right.

935
00:32:44,488 --> 00:32:46,718
Are we on our way to get coffee?

936
00:32:47,118 --> 00:32:49,418
We have to go to where Torong used the corporate card...

937
00:32:49,828 --> 00:32:51,527
- and check out the coffee there. - The trace Torong left behind.

938
00:32:51,528 --> 00:32:52,588
The gold coffee.

939
00:32:53,498 --> 00:32:54,728
At the eight-star hotel.

940
00:32:56,598 --> 00:32:59,228
(Emirates Palace)

941
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:01,998
(Originally built as a presidential palace, )

942
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:04,838
(it is currently the finest hotel in Abu Dhabi.)

943
00:33:06,138 --> 00:33:07,707
(It boasts its overwhelming size...)

944
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,388
(that is equal to about 53 soccer fields.)

945
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:13,318
(The hotel is decorated with a total of 8 tons of gold, )

946
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:16,518
(creating a luxurious and magnificent atmosphere.)

947
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:19,248
(At the famous cafe inside the hotel, )

948
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,118
(they will be trying the gold coffee Torong had.)

949
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:25,058
(What kind of trace did Torong leave behind?)

950
00:33:25,488 --> 00:33:26,928
- What if we're busted? - No.

951
00:33:27,928 --> 00:33:29,127
What will we do, Lee Young Chul?

952
00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:30,698
Go outside and check. What's going on?

953
00:33:31,098 --> 00:33:32,897
(The skit came out of nowhere.)

954
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:33,968
Are you checking?

955
00:33:34,168 --> 00:33:35,438
Read their minds and find out.

956
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:37,307
(Trying her best)

957
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:38,437
I'm just sitting here by the window,

958
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:40,158
and you're giving me such a difficult task.

959
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:43,377
(E-cade need-to-know: Eun Ji tends to think of Young Ji as a comedian.)

960
00:33:43,378 --> 00:33:44,747
She keeps giving me difficult tasks.

961
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:46,377
I guess I really do think of Young Ji as a comedian...

962
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:47,547
- like myself. - Right.

963
00:33:47,548 --> 00:33:49,648
She just gives Yu Jin the answer right away,

964
00:33:49,788 --> 00:33:51,824
but she makes me do all the hard and creative things.

965
00:33:51,848 --> 00:33:53,587
- Yu Jin gets to be funny... - Yes. That's right.

966
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:55,188
- with just the yes or no quiz. - Right.

967
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:57,928
- But with her... - She keeps asking for creativity.

968
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,458
(Laughing)

969
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:00,827
I have a seatbelt over me,

970
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:02,458
but she wants me to go check outside.

971
00:34:02,658 --> 00:34:04,267
(Ridiculous)

972
00:34:04,268 --> 00:34:06,028
When I look like this. The dark mage.

973
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:08,267
- I think of her as a comedian. - Right.

974
00:34:08,268 --> 00:34:09,807
- She thinks of it as teamwork. - Yes.

975
00:34:09,808 --> 00:34:11,508
- I'm a trustworthy friend to you? - Yes.

976
00:34:11,638 --> 00:34:12,638
Amazing.

977
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,807
I've been wondering about it for some time now,

978
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:16,448
but now I know.

979
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:19,077
Young Ji, they're recruiting the 34th cohort of comedians.

980
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:21,248
I'll be there.

981
00:34:21,618 --> 00:34:23,187
You treat comedian colleagues differently.

982
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,217
- I do. - She's stricter.

983
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:26,048
Minister Lee Yong Su definitely...

984
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:28,458
has a strict standard.

985
00:34:29,858 --> 00:34:31,427
I really do treat her as if she's a real comedian.

986
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:32,558
You're strict with me.

987
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:34,498
- Not like... - I'm sorry.

988
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:36,397
- This is... - We passed.

989
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:37,398
We passed safely.
- Nice. - Yes.

990
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:40,144
Everyone, make sure to hide your identities.

991
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:41,297
- Okay. - How do we hide it?

992
00:34:41,298 --> 00:34:42,437
Yes, Minister Lee Yong Su.

993
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:44,158
Everyone's hiding their identities already.

994
00:34:44,808 --> 00:34:46,777
(The secret agents enter the golden lobby.)

995
00:34:46,778 --> 00:34:48,178
This is the main lobby.

996
00:34:48,308 --> 00:34:49,308
Yes.

997
00:34:49,408 --> 00:34:50,808
- Yes, it's gold. - Gosh.

998
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:52,807
- I found someone dressed like us. - Where are we going then?

999
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:53,878
They're dressed like us.

1000
00:34:54,278 --> 00:34:56,078
After hearing the news that Torong was here,

1001
00:34:56,548 --> 00:34:57,948
we came all the way here.

1002
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,058
- What is that? - I'm not Lee Eun Ji.

1003
00:35:00,218 --> 00:35:01,287
- On your left. - I'm Lee Yong Su.

1004
00:35:01,288 --> 00:35:02,357
They recognized us.

1005
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:03,918
- Stay close to the wall. - We're here.

1006
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:06,288
You guys look very suspicious from the back.

1007
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:08,328
- Now... - You look so suspicious.

1008
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:09,928
Stay close to the wall.

1009
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:13,138
You've been caught like ten times.

1010
00:35:13,768 --> 00:35:14,838
Hide quickly.

1011
00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:16,768
- Nice work. - Hide quickly.

1012
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,208
This is it.

1013
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:20,208
Good job, secret agents.

1014
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:21,308
Good job.

1015
00:35:21,438 --> 00:35:22,877
- E-cade, e-cade, e-cade. - E-cade, e-cade, e-cade.

1016
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:23,878
Akh.

1017
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:25,048
We're so elegant.

1018
00:35:25,178 --> 00:35:26,648
You fit in so well with this place.

1019
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:29,028
- What drink did Torong have? - I'm so thirsty.

1020
00:35:29,278 --> 00:35:30,718
The gold cappuccino.

1021
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:34,188
We'd like to order four cups of that coffee Torong had.

1022
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:36,117
(They're on a brief break until their coffees are served.)

1023
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:37,534
(Mimi is sending pictures that she took)

1024
00:35:37,558 --> 00:35:39,627
(Young Ji doesn't have her phone, and Yu Jin is on social media.)

1025
00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:41,904
(Mimi is still sending pictures, and Eun Ji doesn't have her phone.)

1026
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:44,448
(The wait feels longer for those who are without their phones.)

1027
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:46,528
Gosh, there are triple fours right now.

1028
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:48,237
You're sending 444 pictures?

1029
00:35:48,238 --> 00:35:49,297
(444 pictures?)

1030
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:51,238
- No, it's 4:44pm. - Goodness.

1031
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:53,058
You believe in that superstition?

1032
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:55,898
Didn't you perform the clock rite yesterday?

1033
00:35:56,108 --> 00:35:58,308
Weren't you the Clock Spirit yesterday?

1034
00:35:59,048 --> 00:36:01,254
- The spirit of time. - Do you want to summon her again?

1035
00:36:01,278 --> 00:36:02,278
No.

1036
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:03,888
Gosh, it's done.

1037
00:36:05,148 --> 00:36:07,218
You look very familiar.

1038
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:08,318
What do you mean?

1039
00:36:08,618 --> 00:36:10,288
Nancy, it's you, right?

1040
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:13,828
You can try to hide your identity all you want, but it's no use.

1041
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:17,028
I was active as a secret agent in Thailand back then.

1042
00:36:17,698 --> 00:36:19,628
Who do you work for? Tell me.

1043
00:36:20,298 --> 00:36:22,768
To be honest, I'm Lee Yong Su's daughter.

1044
00:36:23,238 --> 00:36:24,514
(Mimi isn't interested at all in this soap opera.)

1045
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:26,778
I knew it. The respected Commissioner Lee Yong Su...

1046
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:29,358
wouldn't be doing a tedious task like this.

1047
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:31,508
Actually, Nancy is Lee Yong Su's daughter.

1048
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:34,047
I'm wearing a mask of my father...

1049
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:35,418
and working as an agent.

1050
00:36:35,648 --> 00:36:37,948
Then you must know his best friend, Lee Young Chul.

1051
00:36:38,218 --> 00:36:39,548
I know Lee Young Chul well.

1052
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:41,634
He graduated from the second class of the Secret Agent Agency...

1053
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:42,958
at the top of his class.

1054
00:36:43,188 --> 00:36:44,188
That's right.

1055
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:45,949
You seem to know a lot about Lee Young Chul.

1056
00:36:46,428 --> 00:36:48,497
I don't know where Lee Young Chul is.

1057
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,998
- The last I've heard was... - I'm his daughter.

1058
00:36:52,768 --> 00:36:55,137
You... You're Lee Young Chul's daughter?

1059
00:36:55,138 --> 00:36:56,507
There you are, Lee Yong Su's daughter.

1060
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:57,914
Nice to meet you, Lee Young Chul's daughter.

1061
00:36:57,938 --> 00:37:00,278
Nice to meet you. We'll be one team from now on.

1062
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:02,998
(They've returned to a warm-hearted, coming-of-age ending.)

1063
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:04,868
(Very satisfied with their performance)

1064
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:07,178
Look at her face.

1065
00:37:08,378 --> 00:37:09,577
Our fictional universe has expanded.

1066
00:37:09,578 --> 00:37:10,617
We got everything on GoPro.

1067
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:12,117
- Don't worry, Lee Yong Su. - Thank you.

1068
00:37:12,118 --> 00:37:13,418
(Episode 1, the end)

1069
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:16,188
Gorgeous, pretty...

1070
00:37:17,258 --> 00:37:19,088
This is poisoned.

1071
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:21,898
(Episode 2 has begun out of nowhere.)

1072
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:23,698
(Yu Jin is intrigued.)

1073
00:37:23,798 --> 00:37:26,497
Be careful of your...

1074
00:37:26,498 --> 00:37:27,644
(Flinching while breathing in)

1075
00:37:27,668 --> 00:37:29,098
(Yu Jin still feels shy.)

1076
00:37:29,398 --> 00:37:32,007
- Good job, Yu Jin. - I want to do this too,

1077
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:33,138
but I'm still a K-pop idol.

1078
00:37:34,078 --> 00:37:35,308
(Flinching while breathing in)

1079
00:37:35,808 --> 00:37:37,608
(She let go of her idol ego within a second.)

1080
00:37:37,908 --> 00:37:39,778
(The professional comedian loves it.)

1081
00:37:40,148 --> 00:37:42,077
(The experienced master demonstrates for them again.)

1082
00:37:42,078 --> 00:37:44,448
Why does she have to die so dramatically?

1083
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:47,258
(The K-pop idol is even more dramatic.)

1084
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:49,388
(Young Ji, you try it.)

1085
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,928
(Well, if you insist.)

1086
00:37:53,558 --> 00:37:54,858
(A powerful performance)

1087
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:57,528
She's staying in character until the end.

1088
00:37:57,828 --> 00:37:59,668
(Episode 2 also ended on a happy note.)

1089
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:01,338
Everyone, be careful.

1090
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:03,067
- Thank you. - Torong had hot coffee.

1091
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:04,667
I wonder how good this is.

1092
00:38:04,668 --> 00:38:06,168
Goodness, check this out.

1093
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,278
(Gold flakes decorate the surface...)

1094
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:10,848
(of the gold coffee.)

1095
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,678
- It smells amazing. - Okay.

1096
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:15,077
I blew on the gold flakes.

1097
00:38:15,078 --> 00:38:19,088
(Caution: The gold flakes may be blown away.)

1098
00:38:21,158 --> 00:38:22,187
(Yum)

1099
00:38:22,188 --> 00:38:24,327
I'm curious as to why Torong is suddenly into dessert.

1100
00:38:24,328 --> 00:38:26,358
Is he trying to open a dessert shop in the future?

1101
00:38:26,428 --> 00:38:28,108
Maybe he wants to start a rice cake store.

1102
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:29,398
It's not impossible.

1103
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:30,578
This could be foreshadowing.

1104
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:32,928
(Until now, the agents have followed Torong's trail, )

1105
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:35,038
(trying cheese kunafa, )

1106
00:38:35,568 --> 00:38:37,808
(visiting the shopping mall where he bought chocolate, )

1107
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:40,308
(and even drinking gold coffee.)

1108
00:38:40,478 --> 00:38:42,507
(The one thing all three experiences have in common is that...)

1109
00:38:42,508 --> 00:38:44,608
(they are desserts.)

1110
00:38:45,278 --> 00:38:47,078
(Soon they will realize...)

1111
00:38:47,278 --> 00:38:48,648
("He spent 2,000 dollars!")

1112
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:51,048
(So far, Torong has been after desserts only.)

1113
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:54,488
(Where is his next destination?)

1114
00:38:54,558 --> 00:38:56,018
(Back to the training center)

1115
00:38:56,288 --> 00:38:58,957
Producer Na, is there traffic here?

1116
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:01,858
There’s a traffic jam because of the evening commute.

1117
00:39:01,898 --> 00:39:04,018
They should make way for us because we're princesses.

1118
00:39:04,328 --> 00:39:05,428
(Laughing)

1119
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:07,438
You're overly immersed.

1120
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:09,368
(The Clock Spirit is separating herself from Yu Jin.)

1121
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:12,208
- Because we're princesses? - Yu Jin, if you keep this up,

1122
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,254
you won't snap out of it even when you're back in Korea.

1123
00:39:14,278 --> 00:39:15,577
Yu Jin is so weird now.

1124
00:39:15,578 --> 00:39:16,747
Yu Jin is...

1125
00:39:16,748 --> 00:39:19,008
She's become a comedian since the last time we saw her.

1126
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:22,118
Earlier, Yu Jin asked me to teach her a party trick.

1127
00:39:22,648 --> 00:39:24,388
"Eun Ji is so good."

1128
00:39:24,648 --> 00:39:26,388
(The youngest member is hyped up.)

1129
00:39:26,988 --> 00:39:29,617
Which one of you three is going to keep me entertained?

1130
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:32,387
The target is sitting in the front row.

1131
00:39:32,388 --> 00:39:33,658
(Squeezing her eyes shut)

1132
00:39:33,698 --> 00:39:35,534
- You're going to get quiet later. - Gosh, I'm bored.

1133
00:39:35,558 --> 00:39:36,627
She said, "Gosh, I'm bored."

1134
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:37,827
I'm so scared.

1135
00:39:37,828 --> 00:39:39,968
Why am I scared that she's bored?

1136
00:39:39,998 --> 00:39:42,098
(It's time for a content extravaganza.)

1137
00:39:42,568 --> 00:39:45,007
Please turn on the Lee Young Ji jukebox.

1138
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,007
Turning on the Lee Young Ji jukebox.

1139
00:39:47,008 --> 00:39:48,277
- Now playing. - This is embarrassing.

1140
00:39:48,278 --> 00:39:50,238
- This is embarrassing. - This is what you meant.

1141
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:53,348
"Drip" by BABYMONSTER.

1142
00:39:53,378 --> 00:39:56,478
Baby got passion, ambition, and I flaunt it.

1143
00:39:56,578 --> 00:39:59,417
Look at that, every challenge I feel it in my bones.

1144
00:39:59,418 --> 00:40:00,617
Baby, got drip, drip, drip.

1145
00:40:00,618 --> 00:40:02,618
(The Lee Young Ji AI jukebox is out of control.)

1146
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:04,828
In Lee Eun Ji's voice.

1147
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:06,088
"In Lee Eun Ji's voice."

1148
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:08,298
Sing songs by IVE. Enter.

1149
00:40:08,328 --> 00:40:09,597
Did you want results for...

1150
00:40:09,598 --> 00:40:13,198
"In Lee Eun Ji's voice, sing songs by IVE?"

1151
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,937
Yes, that's right. Enter.

1152
00:40:14,938 --> 00:40:16,638
Turn the cameras off!

1153
00:40:17,238 --> 00:40:18,814
(YoungGPT's vocal condition has recovered.)

1154
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:20,084
(The original speaker is pleased.)

1155
00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:21,908
- I'm pleased. - Thank you.

1156
00:40:22,038 --> 00:40:24,807
- Good job, YoungGPT. - She said, "I'm pleased."

1157
00:40:24,808 --> 00:40:25,808
Thank you.

1158
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:27,178
Impersonate me too.

1159
00:40:27,778 --> 00:40:29,448
Please enter your query.

1160
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:33,018
Mimi Earth Arcade. Enter.

1161
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:34,617
Suggested searches for "Mimi Earth Arcade" are...

1162
00:40:34,618 --> 00:40:36,357
Mimi Earth Arcade reality check,

1163
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:38,057
Mimi Earth Arcade dessert,

1164
00:40:38,058 --> 00:40:40,398
and Mimi Earth Arcade Arabia.

1165
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:41,857
- Which is your preferred search? - Arabia?

1166
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:42,858
Why Arabia?

1167
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:45,268
Mimi Earth Arcade reality check. Enter.

1168
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,448
(The biggest obstacle YoungGPT has encountered)

1169
00:40:47,498 --> 00:40:48,738
This one's hard.

1170
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:50,538
I can't even do this.

1171
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,608
Let me summon my friend real quick.

1172
00:40:52,738 --> 00:40:54,708
Mimi. Earth... Hey, Mimi.

1173
00:40:54,878 --> 00:40:56,314
- Smile widely, please. - All right.

1174
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:57,777
Why are you leaving...

1175
00:40:57,778 --> 00:41:00,818
(Search result for "Earth Arcade Season 1 Episode 7")

1176
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:02,377
What? What's wrong?

1177
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:03,988
She got hit with a reality check.

1178
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:07,118
Turn the cameras off! My baby's been hit with a reality check!

1179
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:08,958
YoungGPT.

1180
00:41:09,188 --> 00:41:11,057
YoungGPT. Hello.

1181
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:12,427
Let's sing together.

1182
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,697
You sing one line, I sing one line.

1183
00:41:14,698 --> 00:41:16,057
Is this what you mean?

1184
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,828
Yes, that sounds good. Enter.

1185
00:41:18,368 --> 00:41:20,197
- Following - The

1186
00:41:20,198 --> 00:41:22,268
- Lengthened - Shadow

1187
00:41:23,098 --> 00:41:25,007
(Yu Jin and the AI are taking turns singing each syllable of the song.)

1188
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:26,008
- Gosh, what are they... - Walking
- With - You

1189
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:28,008
- In the - Twilight

1190
00:41:28,009 --> 00:41:29,569
- Darkness - I thought she said "line."

1191
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:32,078
(Anything is possible with YoungGPT.)

1192
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:33,877
I don't know the rest of the song.

1193
00:41:33,878 --> 00:41:35,477
Let's sing a recent song. Enter.

1194
00:41:35,478 --> 00:41:38,248
Please enter the name of the K-pop idol group you like.

1195
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:40,988
YoungGPT is so scary.

1196
00:41:41,488 --> 00:41:44,858
Enter either "boy group" or "girl group."

1197
00:41:44,988 --> 00:41:47,174
(We turned off YoungGPT before she can start malfunctioning.)

1198
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:49,698
EunGPT, it's your turn. Enter.

1199
00:41:50,198 --> 00:41:53,068
Hello, EunGPT at your service.

1200
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:55,368
(Swaying sideways)

1201
00:41:55,668 --> 00:41:58,738
- EunGPT. - Yes?

1202
00:41:58,768 --> 00:42:02,508
Show me a clip of Mimi digging into her food.

1203
00:42:03,178 --> 00:42:05,247
Now that I'm tasting it, the flavor is...

1204
00:42:05,248 --> 00:42:06,478
kind of bitter.

1205
00:42:08,118 --> 00:42:10,687
Here is your search result.

1206
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:12,087
Thank you, EunGPT.

1207
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:13,888
- Sure thing. - EunGPT, go charge yourself.

1208
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:16,158
(EunGPT power off)

1209
00:42:16,388 --> 00:42:18,688
We should use SeokPT now.

1210
00:42:18,928 --> 00:42:20,897
- SeokPT? - I've never used ChatGPT before.

1211
00:42:20,898 --> 00:42:22,858
You think I have, Producer Na?

1212
00:42:23,158 --> 00:42:25,327
I keep having to attempt new things...

1213
00:42:25,328 --> 00:42:27,068
because Eun Ji and Yu Jin ask me to.

1214
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:28,897
It's because you're good.

1215
00:42:28,898 --> 00:42:30,307
- Thanks. - Right, you're too good.

1216
00:42:30,308 --> 00:42:32,708
- Thank you. - Yes, you're too good.

1217
00:42:32,908 --> 00:42:34,138
Nobody asks me to do anything.

1218
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:37,007
- MimiPT. - Let's try MimiPT then.

1219
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:38,277
- MimiPT power on. - MimPT.

1220
00:42:38,278 --> 00:42:40,348
MimPT power on. Enter.

1221
00:42:40,418 --> 00:42:41,418
Yes.

1222
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,177
- You're good. - She's good.

1223
00:42:43,178 --> 00:42:44,317
This is MimPT.

1224
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,017
MimPT, how's the weather today?

1225
00:42:47,018 --> 00:42:48,157
Today's weather?

1226
00:42:48,158 --> 00:42:49,358
Look out your window.

1227
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:52,158
(Stunned)

1228
00:42:52,288 --> 00:42:53,798
MimPT, go charge yourself.

1229
00:42:54,198 --> 00:42:55,198
Okay.

1230
00:42:56,828 --> 00:42:59,868
"Look out your window" is actually something Mimi would say.

1231
00:43:00,238 --> 00:43:01,397
If I ask her about the weather in the morning,

1232
00:43:01,398 --> 00:43:03,537
she'd say, "Look out the window, Young Ji."

1233
00:43:03,538 --> 00:43:05,738
We can create 2,000 different videos each day,

1234
00:43:06,538 --> 00:43:08,308
even when we're sitting still.

1235
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:10,677
"Yes." How do you say it?

1236
00:43:10,678 --> 00:43:12,678
- YuJinPT. Power on. - Yes.

1237
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:15,648
Yes. Are you searching for today's weather?

1238
00:43:16,548 --> 00:43:18,087
Gosh, Young Ji. You're really good at this.

1239
00:43:18,088 --> 00:43:19,917
- Thank you. - You're the best, YoungGPT.

1240
00:43:19,918 --> 00:43:21,917
No.

1241
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:23,857
- YoungGPT. - No.

Subscribe to Plus to unlock premium features.

1243
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:28,874
(To survive, she converts to a subscription-based service.)

1244
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,698
Send a payment to my bank account.

1245
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:33,074
- Her bank account." - I can't do this anymore.

1246
00:43:33,098 --> 00:43:34,137
(The older members are worn out after having a round of fun.)

1247
00:43:34,138 --> 00:43:36,937
Guys, are you going to sleep?

1248
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:37,938
(Laughing warily)

1249
00:43:37,939 --> 00:43:40,220
If you're awake, you have to become ChatGPT. Go to sleep.

1250
00:43:40,608 --> 00:43:41,878
(Scared)

1251
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:44,224
(Young Ji is looking to sacrifice someone from the front row.)

1252
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:45,808
- Producer Na, are you sleeping? - Yes.

1253
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:47,818
- What? - I'm sleeping.

1254
00:43:48,478 --> 00:43:50,217
- I'm fast asleep. - Gosh, you're...

1255
00:43:50,218 --> 00:43:51,818
You're so unbelievable.

1256
00:43:52,448 --> 00:43:53,857
Woo Jung, are you sleeping?

1257
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:55,187
Yes, I'm asleep.

1258
00:43:55,188 --> 00:43:56,318
She said, "I'm asleep."

1259
00:43:58,158 --> 00:44:00,627
You guys don't even pretend to be asleep anymore.

1260
00:44:00,628 --> 00:44:02,508
- You just say "Yes, I'm asleep." - I'm asleep.

1261
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:04,667
- We're going to catch Torong. - We'll have a ramyeon battle...

1262
00:44:04,668 --> 00:44:05,767
and catch Torong. Perfect.

1263
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,768
(The sun has set, )

1264
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,438
(but the talking continues.)

1265
00:44:08,638 --> 00:44:11,007
I wonder how things would have been if I weren't the youngest.

1266
00:44:11,008 --> 00:44:13,048
- Can I be the youngest? - You can be the youngest.

1267
00:44:14,938 --> 00:44:16,507
What did you grab when you were born?

1268
00:44:16,508 --> 00:44:17,807
I grabbed a microphone.

1269
00:44:17,808 --> 00:44:19,548
Gosh, a microphone.

1270
00:44:19,578 --> 00:44:21,817
What do you want to be when you grow up, Young Ji?

1271
00:44:21,818 --> 00:44:24,047
- I'm already grown up. - No, when you're even older.

1272
00:44:24,048 --> 00:44:25,087
- When I'm even older? Mi Hyun, - Me?

1273
00:44:25,088 --> 00:44:28,157
Out of the four of us, who would you rather have as your daughter?

1274
00:44:28,158 --> 00:44:29,918
I don't want any of us as my daughter.

1275
00:44:31,028 --> 00:44:32,868
- That's actually the right answer. - Why not?

1276
00:44:35,198 --> 00:44:38,468
(They keep talking without relaxing for even a second.)

1277
00:44:38,728 --> 00:44:41,297
Gosh, just give them their phones back.

1278
00:44:41,298 --> 00:44:44,208
- Give us our phones. - Just for ten minutes.

1279
00:44:44,438 --> 00:44:46,267
We can finally get off the bus.

1280
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:47,837
The bus felt like being in prison.

1281
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:49,907
- He said it felt like prison. - Seriously, though.

1282
00:44:49,908 --> 00:44:52,424
They might just set up the cameras instead of getting on themselves.

1283
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:54,247
It will only be the four of us on the bus from now on.

1284
00:44:54,248 --> 00:44:55,347
On the prison bus.

1285
00:44:55,348 --> 00:44:57,787
- Sun Woo will be the only one here. - His ears will bleed by the end.

1286
00:44:57,788 --> 00:44:58,887
(The production staff will be suffering forever.)

1287
00:44:58,888 --> 00:45:00,658
(They've arrived.)

1288
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:02,558
Look up at the stars.

1289
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:03,927
I saw them last night.

1290
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:04,987
- They're beautiful. - Gosh.

1291
00:45:04,988 --> 00:45:06,087
- Young Ji, look up. - I saw them last night...

1292
00:45:06,088 --> 00:45:07,097
- and they were so beautiful. - Gosh.

1293
00:45:07,098 --> 00:45:08,427
- Goodness. - Goodness.

1294
00:45:08,428 --> 00:45:09,557
- That's so pretty. - This is my first time seeing them.

1295
00:45:09,558 --> 00:45:10,898
They're beautiful.

1296
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:12,798
The stars are huge.

1297
00:45:12,928 --> 00:45:14,838
They shine much brighter here.

1298
00:45:15,198 --> 00:45:16,667
- Today, - Yes.

1299
00:45:16,668 --> 00:45:19,007
- our makeup was pretty heavy. - It was very heavy.

1300
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:21,078
So I think we should use this pack cleanser.

1301
00:45:22,238 --> 00:45:24,248
This feels so soft. You scoop it up...

1302
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:25,847
and spread it like a facial mask.

1303
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,878
This is amazing. It feels so soft.

1304
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:29,778
- The texture feels firm. - Yes.

1305
00:45:30,118 --> 00:45:32,318
I've seen people who look like this at Bulguksa Temple.

1306
00:45:33,288 --> 00:45:35,528
(After a few minutes, wash the cleanser off with water.)

1307
00:45:35,618 --> 00:45:37,527
How is this a facial mask and a cleanser at the same time?

1308
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:38,628
People are so creative.

1309
00:45:38,658 --> 00:45:41,097
We're all so busy with limited time in this modern world.

1310
00:45:41,098 --> 00:45:42,704
- This will be very useful. - Very useful.

1311
00:45:42,728 --> 00:45:43,967
It feels soft and firm.

1312
00:45:43,968 --> 00:45:45,298
This is so nice.

1313
00:45:45,728 --> 00:45:47,838
- I feel so refreshed, Young Ji. - You look fresh.

1314
00:45:48,238 --> 00:45:50,168
- It's currently 7:55pm. - Okay.

1315
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:51,307
In 20 minutes,

1316
00:45:51,308 --> 00:45:53,337
let's play a game for dinner.

1317
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:54,578
- Okay. - That sounds good.

1318
00:45:55,078 --> 00:45:57,398
(The most important trait that secret agents must have...)

1319
00:45:57,708 --> 00:46:01,348
(is speed.)

1320
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:04,687
(Soon, )

1321
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:08,258
(the agent training for dinner will take place.)

1322
00:46:08,618 --> 00:46:12,258
(Speed is key!)

1323
00:46:12,528 --> 00:46:15,228
(Coming soon)

1324
00:46:15,658 --> 00:46:16,697
(Break time, living room)

1325
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:18,767
I wonder what today's game will be.

1326
00:46:18,768 --> 00:46:20,414
With dinner on the line, it will be a team game.

1327
00:46:20,438 --> 00:46:21,468
You're right.

1328
00:46:21,538 --> 00:46:23,498
Do you want to be on the same team with me again?

1329
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:25,367
I will respect your wishes.

1330
00:46:25,368 --> 00:46:26,544
Of course, I want to be on your team.

1331
00:46:26,568 --> 00:46:28,277
Let's show them how we improve as a team.

1332
00:46:28,278 --> 00:46:29,577
Okay, let's do it.

1333
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,738
(A rare heart-warming moment)

1334
00:46:30,948 --> 00:46:33,428
I'm not going to sit back and watch you win with someone else.

1335
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:37,118
- I can't win with someone else? - No. I can't even stand the idea.

1336
00:46:37,188 --> 00:46:38,987
(Meanwhile, the eldest seems busy.)

1337
00:46:38,988 --> 00:46:41,188
(She's looking for something.)

1338
00:46:42,218 --> 00:46:44,458
(It's Young Ji's ring.)

1339
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:45,987
- Gosh. - It's like our neurons are linked.

1340
00:46:45,988 --> 00:46:47,227
- Eun Ji. - Our neurons are linked.

1341
00:46:47,228 --> 00:46:49,068
You look even cooler now than you did earlier.

1342
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:50,867
(Fully dressed up)

1343
00:46:50,868 --> 00:46:52,097
My neurons linked just now...

1344
00:46:52,098 --> 00:46:53,127
- With who? - with Young Ji's.

1345
00:46:53,128 --> 00:46:55,144
With this ring on, my neurons will be linked with Young Ji's.

1346
00:46:55,168 --> 00:46:56,168
(Link formed)

1347
00:46:56,169 --> 00:46:58,838
(Making sound effects)

1348
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,107
(Eun Ji and Young Ji's performance...)

1349
00:47:01,108 --> 00:47:02,837
(is getting intense once again.)

1350
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:04,607
(Let's go eat.)

1351
00:47:04,608 --> 00:47:06,248
I'm starting to feel hungry.

1352
00:47:06,478 --> 00:47:07,817
(They're en route while fully dressed up.)

1353
00:47:07,818 --> 00:47:09,278
Young Ji, I can't see.

1354
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:11,187
(She didn't imagine it would be this dark.)

1355
00:47:11,188 --> 00:47:12,547
Be careful, everyone.

1356
00:47:12,548 --> 00:47:13,918
Be careful. I can see now.

1357
00:47:14,158 --> 00:47:16,017
(They quickly move to the adjacent building.)

1358
00:47:16,018 --> 00:47:17,228
There must be a red carpet.

1359
00:47:17,328 --> 00:47:18,328
Let's go.

1360
00:47:18,858 --> 00:47:22,898
(The agents enter the main building.)

1361
00:47:23,128 --> 00:47:24,868
Cheer longer.

1362
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:27,937
(Satisfied by the enthusiastic cheers)

1363
00:47:27,938 --> 00:47:28,938
You look cool.

1364
00:47:29,798 --> 00:47:32,007
On the count of three, strike a pose and say "Akh."

1365
00:47:32,008 --> 00:47:33,167
One, two, three.

1366
00:47:33,168 --> 00:47:35,077
- Akh. - Akh.

1367
00:47:35,078 --> 00:47:37,408
(To the four members who are excited to eat)

1368
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:39,328
Why is there only one chair?

1369
00:47:39,948 --> 00:47:40,948
Who is this for?

1370
00:47:41,348 --> 00:47:42,677
Really though, why is there just one chair?

1371
00:47:42,678 --> 00:47:44,087
- Exactly. I'm so curious. - Exactly. Why?

1372
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:46,147
Because... This is your awaited moment.

1373
00:47:46,148 --> 00:47:48,417
- It's time for dinner. - Yes.

1374
00:47:48,418 --> 00:47:49,457
- I'm hungry. - Definitely...

1375
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:52,987
We prepared an amazing dinner.

1376
00:47:52,988 --> 00:47:55,858
I think we should start by introducing the menu.

1377
00:47:56,258 --> 00:47:57,727
- I'm hungry. - It smells...

1378
00:47:57,728 --> 00:47:58,867
- spicy... - I smell something spicy too.

1379
00:47:58,868 --> 00:48:00,708
- and seafood-like. - I smell something spicy.

1380
00:48:01,038 --> 00:48:02,697
I'll explain after the menu is served.

1381
00:48:02,698 --> 00:48:04,007
- Okay. - Please bring it in.

1382
00:48:04,008 --> 00:48:08,577
- Who is it? Please. - Who is it?

1383
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:11,248
I smell braised monkfish.

1384
00:48:12,578 --> 00:48:15,047
- My goodness. - I don't believe this.

1385
00:48:15,048 --> 00:48:17,147
(Opening her eyes wide)

1386
00:48:17,148 --> 00:48:18,648
- What is this? - My gosh.

1387
00:48:19,448 --> 00:48:21,618
(A bowl full of seafood)

1388
00:48:21,718 --> 00:48:23,958
- Is it like boiling crab? - It's boiling crab.

1389
00:48:24,058 --> 00:48:27,157
(Boiling seafood)

1390
00:48:27,158 --> 00:48:28,757
I want something spicy.

1391
00:48:28,758 --> 00:48:30,638
(For the members who always crave spicy food, )

1392
00:48:30,768 --> 00:48:33,068
(we poured in a generous amount of Cajun seasoning.)

1393
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:37,167
(You stir-fry it well...)

1394
00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:39,368
(and let the sauce seep in.)

1395
00:48:40,008 --> 00:48:42,477
(A big portion is scooped up...)

1396
00:48:42,478 --> 00:48:47,178
(and served right away.)

1397
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:49,317
(From sausages...)

1398
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:51,218
(to crab meat)

1399
00:48:51,488 --> 00:48:53,918
(Enjoy the ample portion!)

1400
00:48:54,388 --> 00:48:57,117
(Soft seafood...)

1401
00:48:57,118 --> 00:48:59,658
(meets spicy and sweet Cajun sauce.)

1402
00:48:59,858 --> 00:49:03,457
(Serving the invigorating food for his junior agents)

1403
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,327
(Looking forward to it)

1404
00:49:05,328 --> 00:49:06,328
It is...

1405
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:07,738
(Spilling)

1406
00:49:08,138 --> 00:49:10,067
- What are you doing? - What?

1407
00:49:10,068 --> 00:49:14,377
- What are you doing? - Why directly onto the table?

1408
00:49:14,378 --> 00:49:16,077
- Why waste good food? - What's wrong?

1409
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,078
Get a grip!

1410
00:49:17,278 --> 00:49:19,778
Get a grip, I said!

1411
00:49:20,548 --> 00:49:21,747
Cheol Yong, what did you do?

1412
00:49:21,748 --> 00:49:23,117
Why did you spill and waste such good food?

1413
00:49:23,118 --> 00:49:24,847
(Running away quickly)

1414
00:49:24,848 --> 00:49:26,488
They put a layer underneath.

1415
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,134
(We covered the table in plastic beforehand.)

1416
00:49:28,158 --> 00:49:29,187
Goodness.

1417
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:30,257
- Rice? - What are you doing?

1418
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,557
- Why? - What are you doing?

1419
00:49:32,558 --> 00:49:34,658
Why did we suddenly become beggars?

1420
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:37,158
We're princesses.

1421
00:49:37,898 --> 00:49:40,968
- Kimchi. - They didn't pour kimchi.

1422
00:49:41,068 --> 00:49:42,568
I love it.

1423
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:45,038
They have such a flashy performance today.

1424
00:49:45,438 --> 00:49:47,037
- What is this? - Normally,

1425
00:49:47,038 --> 00:49:49,107
- they wear gloves on both hands. - That's right.

1426
00:49:49,108 --> 00:49:51,147
They eat rice...

1427
00:49:51,148 --> 00:49:52,807
- and eat crabs. - Potatoes...

1428
00:49:52,808 --> 00:49:53,948
and corn too.

1429
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:55,977
- That's how you enjoy this dish. - That's how you do it.

1430
00:49:55,978 --> 00:49:57,824
- It tastes best with your hands. - That's how you eat it.

1431
00:49:57,848 --> 00:50:00,147
Before playing the game, you must get fired up first.

1432
00:50:00,148 --> 00:50:01,157
- We must. - We must.

1433
00:50:01,158 --> 00:50:02,158
Why don't one of you...

1434
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:03,858
- get a taste of it first? - Nice.

1435
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:05,027
- Rock-paper-scissors? - Rock-paper-scissors.

1436
00:50:05,028 --> 00:50:06,857
She always wins.

1437
00:50:06,858 --> 00:50:08,827
We already have the winner.

1438
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:10,967
It's not staged, so nobody knows who will win.

1439
00:50:10,968 --> 00:50:12,327
- That's right. - Okay.

1440
00:50:12,328 --> 00:50:13,427
- Okay. - Okay.

1441
00:50:13,428 --> 00:50:16,137
- Play or lose. - Play or lose.

1442
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,938
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1443
00:50:19,508 --> 00:50:20,807
Who won?

1444
00:50:20,808 --> 00:50:22,408
- Seriously, what? - Who won?

1445
00:50:22,778 --> 00:50:25,278
Play or lose. Rock-paper-scissors.

1446
00:50:25,548 --> 00:50:27,677
- Goodness. - Amazing.

1447
00:50:27,678 --> 00:50:28,977
(Yu Jin wins again.)

1448
00:50:28,978 --> 00:50:31,317
- What's this? - This is how it always goes.

1449
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:32,447
Did she win again?

1450
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:33,548
Hello.

1451
00:50:33,648 --> 00:50:35,858
- What is this? - I'm Yu Jin, the Short Mouth.

1452
00:50:36,558 --> 00:50:38,857
Since this is my first bite,

1453
00:50:38,858 --> 00:50:40,858
- I'll try a bite-sized bit. - That's what I want.

1454
00:50:41,158 --> 00:50:43,057
(On some rice...)

1455
00:50:43,058 --> 00:50:44,728
- Yu Jin. - That's insane.

1456
00:50:44,968 --> 00:50:46,368
- Kimchi too. - Nice.

1457
00:50:46,968 --> 00:50:49,298
It's three dishes put together by Yu Jin.

1458
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:50,668
That's insane.

1459
00:50:53,038 --> 00:50:54,038
My gosh.

1460
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:56,837
(This is it.)

1461
00:50:56,838 --> 00:50:58,798
- How does it taste? - That's an honest reaction.

1462
00:51:00,008 --> 00:51:01,348
Is it what I think it is?

1463
00:51:02,178 --> 00:51:04,538
- Her truth dimples are showing. - She shook her shoulders.

1464
00:51:05,748 --> 00:51:07,087
It tastes like spicy fried chicken.

1465
00:51:07,088 --> 00:51:09,257
- Spicy fried chicken? - Sweet and spicy fried chicken?

1466
00:51:09,258 --> 00:51:10,698
- I really want to eat it. - This...

1467
00:51:10,788 --> 00:51:12,468
I must get rid of it quickly by eating it.

1468
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,757
Isn't this our first time playing a game in this format?

1469
00:51:14,758 --> 00:51:16,498
- Yes. - I have no idea what the game is.

1470
00:51:16,858 --> 00:51:19,597
A very ominous thought flashed through my mind.

1471
00:51:19,598 --> 00:51:21,597
- Yes. - Seeing how there's just one chair,

1472
00:51:21,598 --> 00:51:23,837
I have a feeling it might be a time attack of sorts.

1473
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:26,207
- Pushing each other away. - I hope we don't have to...

1474
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,367
take turns stuffing our mouths.

1475
00:51:27,368 --> 00:51:29,838
- I really hope that's not the case. - Please.

1476
00:51:30,238 --> 00:51:32,078
You are correct.

1477
00:51:32,408 --> 00:51:33,708
Are you ready?

1478
00:51:33,808 --> 00:51:36,518
We're going to play Answer in a Row.

1479
00:51:36,878 --> 00:51:37,948
- What? - What?

1480
00:51:38,048 --> 00:51:40,288
(Answer in a Row, individual game)

1481
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:44,157
For example, name five Chinese dishes. One, two, three.

1482
00:51:44,158 --> 00:51:45,757
Jjajangmyeon, tangsuyuk, jjamppong, kkanpunggi,

1483
00:51:45,758 --> 00:51:46,758
mala xiang guo, malatang.

1484
00:51:47,258 --> 00:51:49,257
- She said 6. - She even named 6.

1485
00:51:49,258 --> 00:51:50,628
- Mimi succeeds. - Yes.

1486
00:51:51,268 --> 00:51:53,198
(When you succeed, you can start eating.)

1487
00:51:53,598 --> 00:51:55,614
- Until the next person... - Until the next person succeeds.

1488
00:51:55,638 --> 00:51:57,568
(You must step aside immediately.)

1489
00:51:59,668 --> 00:52:01,478
It's an individual game through and through.

1490
00:52:03,308 --> 00:52:04,308
- Just shout out your names. - Okay.
Just use your names.

1491
00:52:05,309 --> 00:52:07,208
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1492
00:52:07,578 --> 00:52:09,278
Answer in a Row, the first question.

1493
00:52:10,018 --> 00:52:13,287

1494
00:52:13,288 --> 00:52:14,288

- Wrong! - Young Ji!

1498
00:52:21,158 --> 00:52:22,427
- Go on. - Snake.

1499
00:52:22,428 --> 00:52:23,428
- Snake. - Eel.

1500
00:52:23,429 --> 00:52:25,397
- Eel. - Freshwater eel.

1501
00:52:25,398 --> 00:52:27,697
Freshwater eel, wrong! They're the same.

1502
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:28,938
Yu Jin!

1503
00:52:29,968 --> 00:52:31,337

1504
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:34,108

- She's right. - Correct!

1506
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:37,708
- Next question. - Next.

1507
00:52:37,808 --> 00:52:41,348
(Once you answer the question, start eating quickly.)

1508
00:52:41,848 --> 00:52:43,348
- Correct! - Next question.

1509
00:52:43,448 --> 00:52:44,587
- Ask the next question. - Next question.

1510
00:52:44,588 --> 00:52:46,517
- Producer Na, next question. - Here's the next question.

1511
00:52:46,518 --> 00:52:47,917
It was the Full Moon Day...

1512
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:49,317
- not long ago. - Yes.

1513
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:51,857
Name five Korean-style seasoned vegetables.

- I got it! - Eun Ji!

1515
00:52:53,328 --> 00:52:54,657
(Five seasoned vegetables, Eun Ji, I got it.)

1516
00:52:54,658 --> 00:52:56,228
Eun Ji.

1517
00:52:56,628 --> 00:52:59,468
Bracken, aster leaf,

1518
00:52:59,568 --> 00:53:01,768
shepherd's purse,

1519
00:53:01,868 --> 00:53:03,767

1520
00:53:03,768 --> 00:53:05,607

- japchae. - Japchae. Wrong.

1524
00:53:10,508 --> 00:53:12,378
- Why would you say japchae? - Mimi!

1525
00:53:12,478 --> 00:53:14,547
(It's so hard to eat.)

1526
00:53:14,548 --> 00:53:16,017
- Mimi. - Mimi.

1527
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:17,117

00:53:19,218 --> 00:53:21,018
- japchae... Goodness. - Eun Ji!

1530
00:53:21,088 --> 00:53:22,858
(Absolutely confused)

1531
00:53:23,088 --> 00:53:24,988
(She is very proud.)

1532
00:53:25,288 --> 00:53:26,288
Eun Ji!

1533
00:53:27,228 --> 00:53:28,527

1534
00:53:28,528 --> 00:53:29,657

- Bean sprout. Correct. - She did it.

1539
00:53:35,538 --> 00:53:36,538
(Yu Jin leaves the seat without any regret.)

1540
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:37,568
Next question.

1541
00:53:37,668 --> 00:53:39,638

(Crab meat)

1543
00:53:41,908 --> 00:53:43,308
(Kimchi)

1544
00:53:43,478 --> 00:53:46,578
(She ate quite a lot thanks to other members.)

1545
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:48,148
(Yu Jin finished her meal.)

1546
00:53:48,348 --> 00:53:49,577
(Eun Ji starts her meal.)

1547
00:53:49,578 --> 00:53:50,738
Here comes the next question.

1548
00:53:50,818 --> 00:53:52,987
Five bridges that cross the Han River.

1549
00:53:52,988 --> 00:53:55,358

00:53:55,688 --> 00:53:58,057

- Yanghwa Bridge. - Yanghwa Bridge.

00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:02,598
Wrong. Ganghwa Bridge is on Ganghwa Island.

1554
00:54:03,128 --> 00:54:06,428
(Meanwhile, Eun Ji starts eating.)

1555
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,098

(Five bridges that cross the Han River)

1560
00:54:14,908 --> 00:54:16,608
(That's not a bridge.)

1561
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:17,807
- Young Ji! - Young Ji.

1562
00:54:17,808 --> 00:54:19,007
- Mapo Bridge. - Mapo Bridge.

1563
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:20,147
- Yanghwa Bridge. - Yanghwa Bridge.

1564
00:54:20,148 --> 00:54:21,847
- Banpo Bridge. - Banpo Bridge.

1565
00:54:21,848 --> 00:54:22,848
- Masha... - Wrong!
Yu Jin.

1566
00:54:23,849 --> 00:54:25,788
(What did you say?)

1567
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,857
- Yu Jin! - Wrong. Yu Jin.

1568
00:54:27,858 --> 00:54:29,517
Banpo Bridge, Seongsu Bridge,

- Gangnam... Oh, no. - Wrong.

1574
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:40,727
- Gangnam Bridge. - Wrong.

1575
00:54:40,728 --> 00:54:41,868

Wrong.

1577
00:54:43,998 --> 00:54:45,237
- Wrong. - Young Ji!

1578
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:46,637
- Young Ji. - Banpo Bridge.

1579
00:54:46,638 --> 00:54:48,508
- Banpo Bridge. - Hey.

1580
00:54:49,008 --> 00:54:50,008
Yu Jin.

1581
00:54:50,478 --> 00:54:51,607

- Young Ji. - Mapo Bridge, Seongsu Bridge,

1586
00:54:58,448 --> 00:54:59,648
Yeongdong Bridge.

1587
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,488
- Hey. - Wrong.

1588
00:55:01,688 --> 00:55:03,317
(It's chaos.)

1589
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:05,688
- Mapo Bridge, Yeongdong Bridge. - Wrong!

1590
00:55:06,288 --> 00:55:07,798
(Laughing)

1591
00:55:08,498 --> 00:55:10,527
- Are there more bridges? - Goodness.

1592
00:55:10,528 --> 00:55:11,528
(Mapo Bridge, Seongsu Bridge, Seongsan Bridge, Yanghwa Bridge...)

1593
00:55:11,529 --> 00:55:13,128
Yu Jin.

00:55:16,399 --> 00:55:18,538
Yeongdong Bridge. And Hannam Bridge?

1597
00:55:19,038 --> 00:55:20,438
- Correct! - You're right.

1598
00:55:21,038 --> 00:55:22,678
- Move aside. - Next question.

1599
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,007
- Next question. - Hurry up.

1600
00:55:24,008 --> 00:55:26,828
- Next question. - Next question.

1601
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:28,524
I didn't even get to put on my gloves yet.

1602
00:55:28,548 --> 00:55:30,617
(Getting the answers correct for the 2nd time)

1603
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,647
(Satisfied)

1604
00:55:31,648 --> 00:55:33,517
- Next question. - The person seated...

1605
00:55:33,518 --> 00:55:34,858
can answer the questions too.

1606
00:55:35,218 --> 00:55:36,218
Next question.

1607
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:39,758
(Thanks to the rule, she's going to eat a lot more.)

1608
00:55:40,528 --> 00:55:44,097
- Name five red fruits. - Young Ji!

1609
00:55:44,098 --> 00:55:45,098

Apple, strawberry, Korean cherry,

00:55:56,538 --> 00:55:58,208
watermelon, cherry.

1618
00:55:58,308 --> 00:55:59,847
Watermelon is green. Wrong.

1619
00:55:59,848 --> 00:56:01,078
It's red inside.

1620
00:56:01,248 --> 00:56:02,278

1621
00:56:02,418 --> 00:56:04,147

1624
00:56:07,088 --> 00:56:09,088
(She resumes her meal.)

1625
00:56:09,188 --> 00:56:12,528
(Out of 4 rounds, she won 3.)

1626
00:56:12,628 --> 00:56:15,028
- Next question. Now. - Ask quickly!

1627
00:56:15,558 --> 00:56:16,597
Hurry up!

1628
00:56:16,598 --> 00:56:17,674
(Getting influenced by them and feeling impatient)

1629
00:56:17,698 --> 00:56:21,867
Name five actors without the consonant "ng" in their name.

1630
00:56:21,868 --> 00:56:22,868

- Park Bo Gum. - "Hyun" has the "ng" shape in it.

1637
00:56:36,248 --> 00:56:37,277
It has the consonant "ng."

1638
00:56:37,278 --> 00:56:38,347
- Cha Tae Hyun has "H." - Why is it...

1639
00:56:38,348 --> 00:56:39,348
- So it counts? - Yes.

1640
00:56:39,518 --> 00:56:40,678
Cha Tae Hyun and Park Bo Gum.

1641
00:56:40,748 --> 00:56:42,358

- And Song Hye Kyo. - Song Hye Kyo. Wrong.

1645
00:56:48,628 --> 00:56:49,828
- Why? - It's Song. "Ng."

1646
00:56:50,258 --> 00:56:52,174
(She is always a step behind in understanding the questions.)

1647
00:56:52,198 --> 00:56:53,278
She only thought about "H."

1648
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:54,797
- Yu Jin! - She only thought about "H."

1649
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:56,267
(Celebrities with "h" and without "ng")

1650
00:56:56,268 --> 00:56:57,614
(Ju Ji Hoon, Han Hyo Joo, Kim So Hyun, Jun Ji Hyun...)

1651
00:56:57,638 --> 00:57:00,208
- Yu Jin. - Yu Jin.

1652
00:57:00,308 --> 00:57:01,878

00:57:02,278 --> 00:57:04,238

- Cha Tae Hyun! - Correct.

1655
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:09,178
(She's already won 4 rounds.)

00:57:09,618 --> 00:57:12,608
- Next question. - Next question.

1657
00:57:13,188 --> 00:57:14,718
Mi Hyun didn't even get to taste it.

1658
00:57:15,188 --> 00:57:17,518
Then here comes a question advantageous to Mimi.

1659
00:57:17,888 --> 00:57:19,588
(Cheering up)

1660
00:57:19,988 --> 00:57:21,458
Name five ice creams...

1661
00:57:22,058 --> 00:57:24,528
that do not have three-syllable names.

1662
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:25,998
- I got it! - Okay.

1663
00:57:26,998 --> 00:57:28,198
(Mimi, I starved too.)

1664
00:57:28,398 --> 00:57:29,967
- Carp Samanco. - Carp Samanco.

1665
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:31,584

00:57:31,608 --> 00:57:32,638

1667
00:57:32,808 --> 00:57:34,238
(It's correct.)

1668
00:57:34,508 --> 00:57:36,008
(Amazed)

1669
00:57:36,238 --> 00:57:38,047
And?

1670
00:57:38,048 --> 00:57:39,507
(Name 5 ice creams that do not have 3-syllable names.)

1671
00:57:39,508 --> 00:57:41,478
- Because of your reactions... - Come on.

1672
00:57:41,818 --> 00:57:43,618
- Carp Samanco. - Three, two,

1673
00:57:43,818 --> 00:57:45,547

1678
00:57:51,888 --> 00:57:52,888
Correct!

1679
00:57:53,858 --> 00:57:55,027
(They congratulate her.)

1680
00:57:55,028 --> 00:57:56,858
(Maybe she doesn't.)

1681
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,268
(She gets up right away.)

1682
00:57:59,398 --> 00:58:01,068
Thank you. It's all thanks to you guys.

1683
00:58:01,198 --> 00:58:03,038
- Hurry up. - I let you have this one.

1684
00:58:03,338 --> 00:58:05,337
(She doesn't even remove her gloves because she feels like she'll win.)

1685
00:58:05,338 --> 00:58:06,837
- It was easy for her. - Moving on.

1686
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:08,678
Korean traditional dish, kimchi.

1687
00:58:08,878 --> 00:58:10,207
Name five types of kimchi!

1688
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:11,208
- Young Ji! - I got it!

1689
00:58:11,209 --> 00:58:12,547
(Five types of kimchi, I got it, Young Ji)

1690
00:58:12,548 --> 00:58:13,548
- Young Ji. - Aged kimchi.

1691
00:58:13,549 --> 00:58:14,777
- Sour kimchi. - Sour kimchi.

1692
00:58:14,778 --> 00:58:16,077
Less sour kimchi.

1693
00:58:16,078 --> 00:58:17,277
- Wrong. - Eun Ji!

1694
00:58:17,278 --> 00:58:18,587
- I got it. - Aged kimchi,

1695
00:58:18,588 --> 00:58:20,888

1696
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:23,358

00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:26,228
- Green onion kimchi. - Correct.

1699
00:58:27,788 --> 00:58:29,657
(Is it already over?)

1700
00:58:29,658 --> 00:58:32,328
(My first meal?)

1701
00:58:32,628 --> 00:58:35,168
(Getting pushed back endlessly)

1702
00:58:36,438 --> 00:58:38,408
How was it, Mimi?

1703
00:58:38,608 --> 00:58:39,868
I didn't get to feel it.

1704
00:58:39,938 --> 00:58:41,138
(Actually, Mimi...)

1705
00:58:41,508 --> 00:58:43,978
(got the answer right for the first time.)

1706
00:58:44,078 --> 00:58:46,178
(Rushing)

1707
00:58:46,978 --> 00:58:49,348
(She stuffed the shrimp with its shell into her mouth.)

1708
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,888
(She was just eating a bit of corn.)

1709
00:58:53,218 --> 00:58:55,187
(And then she got kicked out.)

1710
00:58:55,188 --> 00:58:57,188
- Next question. - Here comes the next one.

1711
00:58:57,658 --> 00:58:59,728
In the song title...

1712
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:02,797
(Just in case someone answers the question, )

1713
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:04,497
(she takes a big bite.)

1714
00:59:04,498 --> 00:59:05,498
(Laughing)

1715
00:59:05,499 --> 00:59:06,927
Are you okay?

1716
00:59:06,928 --> 00:59:08,197
(I'm fine.)

1717
00:59:08,198 --> 00:59:09,368
(Worried about her teeth)

1718
00:59:09,598 --> 00:59:10,998
Your performance is way too showy.

1719
00:59:11,438 --> 00:59:13,168
(She is jealous of her performance.)

1720
00:59:14,238 --> 00:59:15,438
Eat slowly.

1721
00:59:15,608 --> 00:59:17,878
Name five songs that have...

1722
00:59:18,148 --> 00:59:20,177
place or location names in their titles.

1723
00:59:20,178 --> 00:59:21,178

1726
00:59:25,548 --> 00:59:27,617
- The song by Kyu Hyun. - Wrong.

1727
00:59:27,618 --> 00:59:29,058
It's "At Gwanghwamun."

1728
00:59:29,218 --> 00:59:30,717
- A location name, right? - Yes.

1729
00:59:30,718 --> 00:59:32,304
- A location or a place name. - A location or a place name.

1730
00:59:32,328 --> 00:59:34,287
(They seem to be at a loss.)

1731
00:59:34,288 --> 00:59:35,598
"At Gwanghwamun..."

1732
00:59:36,328 --> 00:59:37,427
- Young Ji. - Young Ji.

1733
00:59:37,428 --> 00:59:39,267
After going to Seoul Cyber University

1734
00:59:39,268 --> 00:59:40,268
Wrong.

1735
00:59:40,498 --> 00:59:41,978
I heard that song on the radio often.

1736
00:59:42,138 --> 00:59:44,098
(After going to Seoul Cyber University)

1737
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:47,038
(Eun Ji the radio host is familiar with the song.)

1738
00:59:47,238 --> 00:59:49,508
(It has a very good commercial song.)

1739
00:59:49,938 --> 00:59:51,278
- Yu Jin. - Yu Jin.

1740
00:59:51,378 --> 00:59:52,847
- "At Gwanghwamun." - "At Gwanghwamun."

1741
00:59:52,848 --> 00:59:55,548
"Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan."

1742
00:59:56,248 --> 00:59:57,617
"At Andong Station."

1743
00:59:57,618 --> 00:59:59,048
- "At Andong Station." - What?

1744
00:59:59,188 --> 01:00:00,548
"Chicago."

1745
01:00:00,618 --> 01:00:01,658
- "Chicago?" - "Chicago."

1746
01:00:01,888 --> 01:00:03,157
(Unsure)

1747
01:00:03,158 --> 01:00:04,187
- "Chicago." - "Chicago."

1748
01:00:04,188 --> 01:00:05,188
(She suddenly starts dancing.)

1749
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:07,128
- And? Three, two, one. - "LA."

1750
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:09,958
- Wrong! - What song is that?

1751
01:00:10,228 --> 01:00:11,627
(She tried to fool them by rolling her tongue.)

1752
01:00:11,628 --> 01:00:12,728
(But it's wrong!)

1753
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:14,098
What's with her?

1754
01:00:14,598 --> 01:00:16,638
- What song is that? - Mimi!

1755
01:00:16,768 --> 01:00:18,068
New York

1756
01:00:19,638 --> 01:00:20,908
(New York)

1757
01:00:21,378 --> 01:00:23,738
Is that it?

1758
01:00:24,178 --> 01:00:25,308
You only have one answer?

1759
01:00:25,908 --> 01:00:27,607
- Wrong! - She is...

1760
01:00:27,608 --> 01:00:28,917
(Crunch again)

1761
01:00:28,918 --> 01:00:30,948
Excuse me, be careful with the shells.

1762
01:00:31,418 --> 01:00:32,418
Eat slowly.

1763
01:00:32,419 --> 01:00:34,048
- You have plenty of time. - I got it.

1764
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:35,288
- Eun Ji! - Eun Ji.

1765
01:00:35,289 --> 01:00:36,317
- "At Andong Station." - "At Andong Station."

1766
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:38,188
"Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan."

1767
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:40,258
"Gwanghwamun Love Song."

1768
01:00:40,328 --> 01:00:42,328
"Busan Vacance" and "Busan Seagull."

1769
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:43,698
"Busan Vacance?"

1770
01:00:43,928 --> 01:00:45,404
Is there a song named "Busan Vacance?"

1771
01:00:45,428 --> 01:00:46,468
By SKULL and Haha.

1772
01:00:46,898 --> 01:00:48,837
("Busan Vacance" by SKULL and Haha represents summer, )

1773
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:50,867
(and it invites everyone to come to Busan and have fun!)

1774
01:00:50,868 --> 01:00:52,468
- Isn't this the song? - SKULL and Haha.

1775
01:00:52,568 --> 01:00:54,237
It is indeed sung by SKULL and Haha. Correct.

1776
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:55,577
(5 songs with location or place names)

1777
01:00:55,578 --> 01:00:56,837
(Current score, Yu Jin: 4 times, Eun Ji: 3 times, )

1778
01:00:56,838 --> 01:00:57,977
(Mimi: 1 time)

1779
01:00:57,978 --> 01:00:59,947
(Young Ji: 0 time)

1780
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:01,517
Please give us the next question.

1781
01:01:01,518 --> 01:01:03,218
- It's so hard. - I really want to eat.

1782
01:01:03,748 --> 01:01:05,387
Name five words that are read the same...

1783
01:01:05,388 --> 01:01:07,124
- Phone number - left to right and right to left.

1784
01:01:07,148 --> 01:01:08,287
- I got it. - Okay.

1785
01:01:08,288 --> 01:01:09,618
- Jo Gwang Jo. - Jo Gwang Jo.

1786
01:01:09,718 --> 01:01:10,718
(A Neo-Confucian scholar)

1787
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:11,828
Jo Gwang Jo is correct.

1788
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:14,128
- Lee Hyo Ri. - Lee Hyo Ri?

1789
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:15,797
- Lee Hyo Ri. - That's right.

1790
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:17,227
(Jo Gwang Jo, Lee Hyo Ri)

1791
01:01:17,228 --> 01:01:18,298
That's all from me.

1792
01:01:19,798 --> 01:01:21,167
- It doesn't have to be a name. - Eun Ji.

1793
01:01:21,168 --> 01:01:22,168
Eun Ji.

1794
01:01:22,169 --> 01:01:23,337

- Seagull? - Wrong.

1799
01:01:28,808 --> 01:01:30,007
(Seagull? Wrong!)

1800
01:01:30,008 --> 01:01:31,377
- Why did "seagull" cross my mind? - Yu Jin.

1801
01:01:31,378 --> 01:01:32,447
- I don't know. - I thought of "seagull" too.

1802
01:01:32,448 --> 01:01:33,448
Yu Jin.

1803
01:01:33,948 --> 01:01:35,477
- Tomato. - Tomato.

1804
01:01:35,478 --> 01:01:36,648

- Woo Yeong Woo. - Woo Yeong Woo.

1806
01:01:39,318 --> 01:01:41,317
- Seagull? - Young Ji!

1807
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:43,118
- Come on, Eun Ji! - Mimi.

1808
01:01:43,558 --> 01:01:45,227
(The culprit for "seagull")

1809
01:01:45,228 --> 01:01:46,228
- Eun Ji! - Mimi.
- Mimi. - Mimi.

1810
01:01:47,229 --> 01:01:48,327
- Jo Gwang Jo. - Jo Gwang Jo.

1811
01:01:48,328 --> 01:01:50,198
Tomato. Woo Yeong Woo.

1812
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:51,798
Gosh, seagull.
- Young Ji! - Yu Jin!

1813
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:53,798
Seagull.

1814
01:01:53,799 --> 01:01:54,998
Why seagull?

1815
01:01:55,538 --> 01:01:56,567
- Young Ji! - Yu Jin!

1816
01:01:56,568 --> 01:01:57,967
(It's finally time for Young Ji in the last place.)

1817
01:01:57,968 --> 01:01:59,267
- Hurry up. - Jo Gwang Jo.

1818
01:01:59,268 --> 01:02:00,368
- Jo Gwang Jo. - Tomato.

1819
01:02:00,568 --> 01:02:01,637

- Woo Yeong Woo. - Correct.

1822
01:02:05,008 --> 01:02:06,147
- This is crazy. - This is a rare sight.

1823
01:02:06,148 --> 01:02:07,848
- Hurry up! - Hurry up.

1824
01:02:08,248 --> 01:02:10,118
- I should change my position. - Hurry up.

1825
01:02:12,618 --> 01:02:14,218
(A mouthful of Cajun sauce rice ball)

1826
01:02:14,448 --> 01:02:15,617
How is it? Is it good?

1827
01:02:15,618 --> 01:02:17,087
(Opening her eyes wide)

1828
01:02:17,088 --> 01:02:19,088
Describe the taste as you eat.

1829
01:02:19,228 --> 01:02:20,258
It's so delicious.

1830
01:02:20,358 --> 01:02:21,358
(Eating)

1831
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:23,158
(Next, she goes for the crab leg.)

1832
01:02:23,558 --> 01:02:25,727
(Soft crab meat)

1833
01:02:25,728 --> 01:02:27,398
(She dips it in the sauce.)

1834
01:02:27,598 --> 01:02:29,697
(Only two things exist here.)

1835
01:02:29,698 --> 01:02:33,368
(Me and boiling seafood)

1836
01:02:33,608 --> 01:02:34,637
It's so good.

1837
01:02:34,638 --> 01:02:36,237
(While Young Ji is busy eating...)

1838
01:02:36,238 --> 01:02:38,107
Five parts of beef.

1839
01:02:38,108 --> 01:02:39,148
- Yu Jin! - Yu Jin.

1840
01:02:39,278 --> 01:02:41,917

1841
01:02:41,918 --> 01:02:43,548
ribeye cap, la!

1842
01:02:43,648 --> 01:02:45,188
- Wrong! - Mimi.

1843
01:02:45,288 --> 01:02:48,117
(Mimi, who only succeeded once, was waiting for her chance.)

1844
01:02:48,118 --> 01:02:49,438
- Outside skirt. - Outside skirt.

1845
01:02:49,918 --> 01:02:50,957
Tongue.

1846
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:52,187
(Outside skirt, tongue)

1847
01:02:52,188 --> 01:02:53,428
(Mimi: Tongue.)

1848
01:02:53,928 --> 01:02:55,057
Why?

1849
01:02:55,058 --> 01:02:56,527
- It is correct. - That part exists.

1850
01:02:56,528 --> 01:02:57,897
- Beef tongue, yes. - Yes.

1851
01:02:57,898 --> 01:02:59,498
- Yes. - Pork skirt.

1852
01:03:00,368 --> 01:03:01,697
Isn't that pork?

1853
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:02,768
- Wrong. - Goodness.

1854
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:04,568
- Yu Jin. - It's beef parts.

1855
01:03:04,638 --> 01:03:05,667

1860
01:03:11,308 --> 01:03:12,877
Let me eat...

1861
01:03:12,878 --> 01:03:14,847
- elegantly. - I want another bite of kimchi.

1862
01:03:14,848 --> 01:03:17,448
No. Come back later.

1863
01:03:18,018 --> 01:03:19,018
Shall we continue?

1864
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:21,188
Name 5 countries with 6 or more syllables.

1865
01:03:21,658 --> 01:03:22,818
Young Ji!

1866
01:03:22,918 --> 01:03:23,918

Bangladesh.

1869
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:28,158
Six or more. Wrong.

1870
01:03:28,598 --> 01:03:30,398

1871
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:32,127

- Am I? - Yes.

1875
01:03:36,869 --> 01:03:38,037
I wanted to check if I was.

1876
01:03:38,038 --> 01:03:40,707
(Waiting for the next answer)

1877
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:41,738
That's all.

1878
01:03:42,438 --> 01:03:43,708
(Laughing)

1879
01:03:43,978 --> 01:03:45,418

01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:55,288

The United Arab Eminates.

1890
01:04:02,328 --> 01:04:03,758
"Eminates?"

1891
01:04:03,928 --> 01:04:06,027
It sounds like "laminate."

1892
01:04:06,028 --> 01:04:07,028
Wrong.

1893
01:04:07,029 --> 01:04:09,167
Just one more.

1894
01:04:09,168 --> 01:04:11,368
You're almost there. You guys got four already.

1895
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:13,007
Just one more.

(Pretending to chew and using that time to think)

1902
01:04:21,718 --> 01:04:23,078
- Wrong! - What was the other one?

1903
01:04:23,918 --> 01:04:25,838
You have five countries. Just put them together.

1904
01:04:26,048 --> 01:04:27,447
(The list of countries mentioned: Saudi Arabia, )

1905
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:28,457

(Name 5 countries with 6 or more syllables.)

1912
01:04:37,698 --> 01:04:39,927
- Three, two, one. - Hold on.

1913

(It unnecessarily feels like a rap battle.)

1919
01:04:49,508 --> 01:04:51,178
Three, two, one.

1920
01:04:51,438 --> 01:04:52,447
- Wrong! - Eun Ji.

1921
01:04:52,448 --> 01:04:54,488
They're all mentioned, but you can't memorize them.

1922
01:04:54,548 --> 01:04:55,917

1923
01:04:55,918 --> 01:04:57,317

- What's the remaining one? - What's the last one?

1928
01:05:02,758 --> 01:05:04,198
- Right next door. - It's next door.

1929
01:05:04,388 --> 01:05:05,627
- In front? - Next door.

1930
01:05:05,628 --> 01:05:06,628
- Wrong. - Next door?

1931
01:05:06,629 --> 01:05:07,987
- Abu Dhabi? - Young Ji.

1932
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:09,327
- Young Ji. - The United Arab Emirates.

1933
01:05:09,328 --> 01:05:10,727
- Yes. - Australia.

1934
01:05:10,728 --> 01:05:11,728
- Dominican Republic. - Yes.

1935
01:05:11,729 --> 01:05:12,967
- Republic of South Africa. - Yes.

1936
01:05:12,968 --> 01:05:14,527
- What's the last one? - I don't know.

1937
01:05:14,528 --> 01:05:17,138
- Seoul... - That was the first one you said.

1938
01:05:17,738 --> 01:05:18,968
Dominican Republic.

1939
01:05:19,068 --> 01:05:20,938
It's a country near this one!

1940
01:05:21,108 --> 01:05:23,278
- The United Arab Emirates. - No.

1941
01:05:23,638 --> 01:05:24,638
Wrong!

1942
01:05:24,878 --> 01:05:25,978
- Mimi! - Mimi.

1943
01:05:26,378 --> 01:05:27,608
- Saudi Arabia. - Yes.

1944
01:05:27,808 --> 01:05:29,154
- Republic of South Africa. - Yes.

1945
01:05:29,178 --> 01:05:32,118
Dominican Republic, Australia, The United Arab Emirates.

1946
01:05:32,288 --> 01:05:34,047
Correct.

1947
01:05:34,048 --> 01:05:35,518
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1948
01:05:36,258 --> 01:05:37,917
- Eat up. - Mimi, sit down and eat.

1949
01:05:37,918 --> 01:05:38,927
Eat up.

1950
01:05:38,928 --> 01:05:41,258
(She hurriedly stuffs her mouth.)

1951
01:05:41,558 --> 01:05:43,257
- This is so delicious. - It is, right?

1952
01:05:43,258 --> 01:05:44,258
It's so good.

1953
01:05:44,259 --> 01:05:45,474
(She looks a lot more relaxed as she eats.)

1954
01:05:45,498 --> 01:05:46,897
(The next round)

1955
01:05:46,898 --> 01:05:50,168
Name 5 animals with 1 syllable.

1956
01:05:50,338 --> 01:05:51,397
- Go. - Young Ji.

1957
01:05:51,398 --> 01:05:52,808
- Young Ji. - Arrowroot.

1958
01:05:53,138 --> 01:05:54,267
- What? - Arrowroot?

1959
01:05:54,268 --> 01:05:55,484
(Name 5 animals with 1 syllable.)

1960
01:05:55,508 --> 01:05:57,038
- Yes. - Arrowroot?

1961
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:58,648
- Isn't arrowroot food? - No.

1962
01:05:58,908 --> 01:06:00,977
(This is arrowroot.)

1963
01:06:00,978 --> 01:06:02,717
(I'm a leopard cat.)

1964
01:06:02,718 --> 01:06:04,617
(They can be confusing.)

1965
01:06:04,618 --> 01:06:05,647
- No. - Wrong!

1966
01:06:05,648 --> 01:06:06,788
- Eun Ji! - Eun Ji.

1967
01:06:06,948 --> 01:06:08,047
- Sheep. - Sheep.

1968
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:09,208
- Leopard cat. - Leopard cat.

1969
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:11,158
Horse. Bean.

1970
01:06:11,558 --> 01:06:12,558
- Bean, wrong. - Young Ji.

1971
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:13,588
Yu Jin!

1972
01:06:13,658 --> 01:06:15,198
(Young Ji! Yu Jin!)

1973
01:06:15,828 --> 01:06:16,857
- Go. Sheep. - Sheep.

1974
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:17,858
- Leopard cat. - Leopard cat.

1975
01:06:17,859 --> 01:06:19,298
Horse. Snake.

1976
01:06:20,428 --> 01:06:21,467
- Three, two, one. - Yu Jin.

1977
01:06:21,468 --> 01:06:22,468
Wrong!

1978
01:06:22,469 --> 01:06:24,138
Snake, cow, pheasant,

1979
01:06:24,268 --> 01:06:25,407
chicken, sheep.

1980
01:06:25,408 --> 01:06:26,814
(Snake, cow, pheasant, chicken, sheep)

1981
01:06:26,838 --> 01:06:28,007
(She sees the answer coming...)

1982
01:06:28,008 --> 01:06:30,107
(and quickly shoves a shrimp into her mouth.)

1983
01:06:30,108 --> 01:06:31,137
Sit down, Yu Jin.

1984
01:06:31,138 --> 01:06:32,308
(Yu Jin sits down again.)

1985
01:06:32,678 --> 01:06:34,207
(Yu Jin answered half the questions right.)

1986
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:35,408
(She is starting to get full.)

1987
01:06:35,548 --> 01:06:36,977
- This can be our last question. - The last one.

1988
01:06:36,978 --> 01:06:39,448
Is this the last one? I didn't get to eat much though.

1989
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:42,757
(No matter what she says, they focus on their discussion.)

1990
01:06:42,758 --> 01:06:45,028
They look a lot more serious than the CSAT examiners.

1991
01:06:45,488 --> 01:06:47,388
Shall we? Here's the last question.

1992
01:06:48,288 --> 01:06:51,228
Name 5 songs with 7 or more syllables.

1993
01:06:51,528 --> 01:06:52,597
- Young Ji. - Young Ji.

1994
01:06:52,598 --> 01:06:54,867
- They must be Korean songs. - I don't know.

1995
01:06:54,868 --> 01:06:57,138
(Think, Young Ji.)

1996
01:06:57,968 --> 01:06:59,367
Wrong!

1997
01:06:59,368 --> 01:07:00,937
(She finds meaning in participating.)

1998
01:07:00,938 --> 01:07:02,378
- Wrong. - Mimi.

1999
01:07:02,578 --> 01:07:03,638
- Wrong. - Mimi.

2000
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:05,348
"My Lips… Warm Like Coffee."

2001
01:07:05,608 --> 01:07:06,678
Nice.

2002
01:07:07,248 --> 01:07:08,847
"She Doesn't Look At Me."

2003
01:07:08,848 --> 01:07:09,917
- What? - What?

2004
01:07:09,918 --> 01:07:10,918
Wrong.

2005
01:07:11,118 --> 01:07:12,148
Eun Ji!

2006
01:07:12,918 --> 01:07:14,417
"How Can I Love You?"

2007
01:07:14,418 --> 01:07:16,458
"I Have to Love Heartbreak."

2008
01:07:16,558 --> 01:07:17,888
(Nothing makes sense.)

2009
01:07:18,388 --> 01:07:19,657
(She's speechless.)

2010
01:07:19,658 --> 01:07:20,757
- Yu Jin. - Young Ji.

2011
01:07:20,758 --> 01:07:22,597
- Young Ji. - "How Can I Love the Heartbreak?"

2012
01:07:22,598 --> 01:07:23,857
- "You’re the One I Love." - Okay.

2013
01:07:23,858 --> 01:07:25,798
"Plot Twist."

2014
01:07:25,898 --> 01:07:27,897
"My Lips… Warm Like Coffee."

2015
01:07:27,898 --> 01:07:29,768
- I memorized until here. - Wrong!

2016
01:07:30,598 --> 01:07:32,414
(Out of the blue, she reports her progress on her studies.)

2017
01:07:32,438 --> 01:07:34,207
That was great, but you're wrong.

2018
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:35,407
("My Lips… Warm Like Coffee," "Plot Twist,")

2019
01:07:35,408 --> 01:07:36,607
("How Can I Love the Heartbreak, You’re the One I Love")

2020
01:07:36,608 --> 01:07:38,078
(Only 3 songs have been mentioned.)

2021
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:39,807
- Yu Jin. - Okay, Yu Jin.

2022
01:07:39,808 --> 01:07:42,248
- "My Lips… Warm Like Coffee." - Good.

2023
01:07:42,448 --> 01:07:44,218
"Plot Twist."

2024
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:46,518
- "Abracadabra." - Correct.

2025
01:07:47,988 --> 01:07:49,834
- Three, two... - "Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan."

2026
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:50,858
- Good. - Great.

2027
01:07:51,158 --> 01:07:52,557
- Three, two, one. - Eun Ji!

2028
01:07:52,558 --> 01:07:53,688
- Eun Ji! - Young Ji!

2029
01:07:53,888 --> 01:07:55,027
(They have the titles of 5 songs.)

2030
01:07:55,028 --> 01:07:56,328
- Eun Ji! - Young Ji!

2031
01:07:56,498 --> 01:07:57,557
(Young Ji lets Eun Ji go first.)

2032
01:07:57,558 --> 01:08:00,627
- Go! - "How Can I Love the Heart Break?"

2033
01:08:00,628 --> 01:08:02,067
- "You’re the One I Love." - Okay.

2034
01:08:02,068 --> 01:08:03,697
- "My Lips… Warm Like Coffee." - Okay.

2035
01:08:03,698 --> 01:08:06,168
- "Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan." - Okay.

2036
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:09,238
"Run Away, Waiting for You on Platform 9 and 3-Quarters."

2037
01:08:10,138 --> 01:08:11,378
Sorry.

2038
01:08:12,878 --> 01:08:14,148
- Young Ji. - Young Ji.

2039
01:08:14,578 --> 01:08:15,847
- Three. - "Run Away, Waiting for You..."

2040
01:08:15,848 --> 01:08:17,117
"on Platform 1 and 3-Quarters."

2041
01:08:17,118 --> 01:08:18,118
- Okay. - That's correct.

2042
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:20,587
"Plot Twist."

2043
01:08:20,588 --> 01:08:22,587
- "Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan." - She's scary.

2044
01:08:22,588 --> 01:08:24,057
- "Abracadabra." - Okay.

2045
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:28,188
"How Can I Love the Heartbreak, You’re the One I Love."

2046
01:08:28,328 --> 01:08:29,497
(Correct!)

2047
01:08:29,498 --> 01:08:30,598
Correct.

2048
01:08:30,658 --> 01:08:32,668
- She's so scary. - You're so scary.

2049
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:34,168
You're so scary.

2050
01:08:34,228 --> 01:08:36,798
(Producer Na was so scared.)

2051
01:08:37,268 --> 01:08:41,437
(He falls under Young Ji's spell...)

2052
01:08:41,438 --> 01:08:43,707
(and ends up shouting, "Correct!")

2053
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:45,748
(But the first answer Young Ji shouted was...)

2054
01:08:47,108 --> 01:08:51,517
("Waiting for You on Platform 1 and 3-Quarters.")

2055
01:08:51,518 --> 01:08:55,858
(But it's "Waiting for You on Platform 9 and 3-Quarters.")

2056
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:57,858
(We realized our mistake while editing.)

2057
01:08:58,418 --> 01:09:00,887
(It's because of the frazzled production crew.)

2058
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:03,498
(We're sorry. We love you, TXT.)

2059
01:09:03,758 --> 01:09:06,498
(This one person urgently needs food right now.)

2060
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,597
(She couldn't care less that the other girls were...)

2061
01:09:08,598 --> 01:09:10,568
(laughing their heads off.)

2062
01:09:10,768 --> 01:09:13,338
I felt like I was under a spell.

2063
01:09:14,408 --> 01:09:15,537
That's so funny.

2064
01:09:15,538 --> 01:09:17,338
- Congratulations. - Go on and eat.

2065
01:09:20,408 --> 01:09:23,918
(The game just finished.)

2066
01:09:24,318 --> 01:09:26,248
I'm so nervous.

2067
01:09:26,488 --> 01:09:28,957
- Why? - There's going to be a big match.

2068
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:30,857
(A big match?)

2069
01:09:30,858 --> 01:09:32,328
(Last night)

2070
01:09:32,488 --> 01:09:34,328
It's "I'm Sorry, I Love You." What's it about?

2071
01:09:34,488 --> 01:09:35,998
This drama is about...

2072
01:09:36,058 --> 01:09:37,358
- In Australia... - Yes?

2073
01:09:38,028 --> 01:09:39,328
So Ji Sub...

2074
01:09:39,768 --> 01:09:41,837
- There is this actress. - Yes?

2075
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:44,968
There is this famous actress.

2076
01:09:45,168 --> 01:09:46,837
Are you talking about "I'm Sorry, I Love You?"

2077
01:09:46,838 --> 01:09:48,508
I love this drama.

2078
01:09:48,608 --> 01:09:50,008
- I watch it all the time. - Right.

2079
01:09:50,738 --> 01:09:52,447
- Go up against Jun Young. - That's right.

2080
01:09:52,448 --> 01:09:54,047
- What? - Among our production crew,

2081
01:09:54,048 --> 01:09:55,147
there is a hardcore fan of the drama.

2082
01:09:55,148 --> 01:09:56,148
- Who? - Really?

2083
01:09:56,149 --> 01:09:58,217
You should really do a battle with Jun Young.

2084
01:09:58,218 --> 01:09:59,517
Producer Jun Young...

2085
01:09:59,518 --> 01:10:00,888
- is a hardcore fan. - He is?

2086
01:10:01,018 --> 01:10:03,698
(Eun Ji even called out his name during Producer Na's fan meeting.)

2087
01:10:03,888 --> 01:10:07,188
(Hi, I'm Park Jun Young, Producer Na's right-hand man.)

2088
01:10:07,258 --> 01:10:08,387
(Park Jun Young, Egg Is Coming's Cha Mu Hyeok, )

2089
01:10:08,388 --> 01:10:09,604
(Human Encyclopedia, Team's Content Manager)

2090
01:10:09,628 --> 01:10:11,397
Then, here in Abu Dhabi...

2091
01:10:11,398 --> 01:10:12,997
- We should face off with the crew. - Good idea.

2092
01:10:12,998 --> 01:10:14,627
- It's because I wish... - With the crew.

2093
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,997
You'd make a game designed for Eun Ji.

2094
01:10:16,998 --> 01:10:18,067
Plot Summary Game.

2095
01:10:18,068 --> 01:10:21,068
- You have to summarize everything. - A face-off with the crew.

2096
01:10:21,538 --> 01:10:24,077
It could be "I'm Sorry, I Love You" Battle or something like...

2097
01:10:24,078 --> 01:10:25,477
- Content Battle. - Content Battle.

2098
01:10:25,478 --> 01:10:27,207
- With Jun Young. - He's great.

2099
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:28,747
- We have a human encyclopedia. - Sure.

2100
01:10:28,748 --> 01:10:31,847
You know, Eun Ji has to get her phone back.

2101
01:10:31,848 --> 01:10:33,387
- Yes, she should. - Yes.

2102
01:10:33,388 --> 01:10:35,517
Actually, Eun Ji should be getting...

2103
01:10:35,518 --> 01:10:37,017
her phone back tomorrow.

2104
01:10:37,018 --> 01:10:38,217
It's meaningless if we don't do it today.

2105
01:10:38,218 --> 01:10:39,257
Right, it's tomorrow.

2106
01:10:39,258 --> 01:10:40,727
(So they play the game right away.)

2107
01:10:40,728 --> 01:10:42,734
(Eun Ji versus Production Crew, "I'm Sorry, I Love You Quiz" Battle)

2108
01:10:42,758 --> 01:10:44,227
- Take a break for now. - Okay.

2109
01:10:44,228 --> 01:10:45,727
Eun Ji will win for sure.

2110
01:10:45,728 --> 01:10:47,267
I'm putting my pride on the line.

2111
01:10:47,268 --> 01:10:49,037
I need good reactions and cheers...

2112
01:10:49,038 --> 01:10:50,267
- from you. - Eun Ji.

2113
01:10:50,268 --> 01:10:51,737
- I can do that for sure. - Let's do this.

2114
01:10:51,738 --> 01:10:53,208
(Meanwhile...)

2115
01:10:53,268 --> 01:10:55,407
No! You can't make contact with the question makers!

2116
01:10:55,408 --> 01:10:57,237
- Okay. - We're all about fairness.

2117
01:10:57,238 --> 01:10:59,054
(They're in full compliance with perfect fairness.)

2118
01:10:59,078 --> 01:11:01,654
What kind of competition am I doing with "I'm Sorry, I Love You"?

2119
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:02,748
It's a secret.

2120
01:11:03,048 --> 01:11:04,577
- It's a secret. - A secret.

2121
01:11:04,578 --> 01:11:06,148
I'm not taking any more questions.

2122
01:11:06,518 --> 01:11:08,487
I'll now play you...

2123
01:11:08,488 --> 01:11:10,487
iconic scenes from the drama.

2124
01:11:10,488 --> 01:11:12,368
No. They said I couldn't study about the drama.

2125
01:11:12,828 --> 01:11:13,857
That's right.

2126
01:11:13,858 --> 01:11:15,497
(This is a fair competition, )

2127
01:11:15,498 --> 01:11:17,097
(and Producer Na stakes his 24-year career.)

2128
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:19,668
(The question are being prepared. Please wait a moment.)

2129
01:11:20,028 --> 01:11:21,498
- Are you nervous? - Yes.

2130
01:11:22,698 --> 01:11:24,038
Oh, no.

2131
01:11:24,468 --> 01:11:26,768
- So nervous. - Lim Soo Jung is so pretty.

2132
01:11:26,868 --> 01:11:28,708
I feel like I'm taking a job hiring test.

2133
01:11:29,108 --> 01:11:30,677
I wonder what questions they'll come up with.

2134
01:11:30,678 --> 01:11:31,678
I know.

2135
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,077
(Time out!)

2136
01:11:33,078 --> 01:11:35,717
(It's time to review "I’m Sorry, I Love You.”)

2137
01:11:35,718 --> 01:11:37,317
("I’m Sorry, I Love You”, 2004)

2138
01:11:37,318 --> 01:11:39,147
(This is a 16-episode miniseries that aired on KBS in 2004.)

2139
01:11:39,148 --> 01:11:42,588
(So Ji Sub as Cha Moo Hyeok, a rough, foul-mouthed outsider)

2140
01:11:42,618 --> 01:11:46,127
(Lim Soo Jung as Song Eun Chae, an ultimate pure-hearted romantic)

2141
01:11:46,128 --> 01:11:49,628
(Lee Hae Young as Oh Deul Hee, Moo Hyeok’s mother and a top star)

2142
01:11:49,828 --> 01:11:51,227
(Ratings nearing 30 percent, back on the big screen after 20 years)

2143
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:52,427
(The show created "I'm Sorry, I Love You" fanatics.)

2144
01:11:52,428 --> 01:11:53,974
(Viewer message board was flooded with over 500,000 posts.)

2145
01:11:53,998 --> 01:11:56,297
Did the line "Do you want to eat with me or date me?" come from here?

2146
01:11:56,298 --> 01:11:58,668
- Yes. - Want to eat with me or date me?

2147
01:11:58,908 --> 01:12:00,908
But why doesn't she want to go out with him?

2148
01:12:01,068 --> 01:12:04,207
The guy was terminally ill.

2149
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:07,878
But Soo Jung thought he was messing around.

2150
01:12:08,008 --> 01:12:10,448
I have a question. Why does he ask her to eat?

2151
01:12:10,678 --> 01:12:11,958
She didn't want to eat with him?

2152
01:12:12,088 --> 01:12:14,588
I think that's it.

2153
01:12:14,748 --> 01:12:16,117
What's this scene?

2154
01:12:16,118 --> 01:12:18,318
(What is this scene?)

2155
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:20,187
They're making kimchi now, right?

2156
01:12:20,188 --> 01:12:21,228
Yes.

2157
01:12:21,728 --> 01:12:23,104
You give answers like a vending machine.

2158
01:12:23,128 --> 01:12:25,668
I know. I'm looking so forward to this.

2159
01:12:25,728 --> 01:12:28,028
(And in a nearby area...)

2160
01:12:28,328 --> 01:12:30,098
Directed by Lee Hyung Min.

2161
01:12:30,468 --> 01:12:32,007
Written by Lee Kyung Hee.

2162
01:12:32,008 --> 01:12:33,884
I'm sorry, but do you know what's going to be on the test?

2163
01:12:33,908 --> 01:12:35,507
- Are these the type of questions? - I mean...

2164
01:12:35,508 --> 01:12:36,508
I already know all that.

2165
01:12:36,509 --> 01:12:39,677
Lee Hyung Min directed "Sang Doo! Let’s Go to School."

2166
01:12:39,678 --> 01:12:41,307
The drama's highest rating was 28.6 percent.

2167
01:12:41,308 --> 01:12:42,724
(Episode 16, December 28, 2004, 28.6 percent viewership rating)

2168
01:12:42,748 --> 01:12:45,318
Which agency was Lim Soo Jung with at the time?

2169
01:12:46,318 --> 01:12:47,648
It was Sidus.

2170
01:12:48,888 --> 01:12:50,517
- Incredible. - Amazing.

2171
01:12:50,518 --> 01:12:51,618
I can't believe it.

2172
01:12:52,028 --> 01:12:55,028
- The starting scene... - What's Yeong Seok's hometown?

2173
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:56,497
Chungju?

2174
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:58,628
(The answer is Cheongju.)

2175
01:12:58,898 --> 01:12:59,928
Why you...

2176
01:13:00,128 --> 01:13:01,228
(I'm sorry.)

2177
01:13:01,468 --> 01:13:03,037
You don't even know where your senior is from.

2178
01:13:03,038 --> 01:13:04,198
- Did you know? - Chungju?

2179
01:13:04,268 --> 01:13:06,867
She loved Chung Kyung Ho so much.

2180
01:13:06,868 --> 01:13:09,508
My son, Yoon.

2181
01:13:09,608 --> 01:13:13,378
My son, Yoon.

2182
01:13:13,648 --> 01:13:16,278
(Two people, same dream)

2183
01:13:17,448 --> 01:13:21,218
(They're so happy just thinking about the drama.)

2184
01:13:23,018 --> 01:13:25,299
I'm so nervous. I feel like I'm taking a job hiring test.

2185
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:26,727
This is a job hiring test.

2186
01:13:26,728 --> 01:13:27,887
My pride is on the line.

2187
01:13:27,888 --> 01:13:29,404
You should think of this as a hiring test.

2188
01:13:29,428 --> 01:13:30,998
(Eun Ji's phone is the prize.)

2189
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:33,198
(The 1st Great "I'm Sorry, I Love You" Showdown)

2190
01:13:34,298 --> 01:13:35,597
- Hello. - Hi.

2191
01:13:35,598 --> 01:13:38,318
("I’m Sorry, I Love You" committee has finished the questions prep.)

2192
01:13:38,808 --> 01:13:40,938
(Familiar tune starts playing from the speakers.)

2193
01:13:43,838 --> 01:13:44,938
Oh, no.

2194
01:13:45,548 --> 01:13:48,278
(I'm sorry, we are here.)

2195
01:13:49,678 --> 01:13:52,088
(Jun Young enters reluctantly.)

2196
01:13:52,618 --> 01:13:55,147
And now the player enters!

2197
01:13:55,148 --> 01:13:56,287
He enters.

2198
01:13:56,288 --> 01:13:58,857
- Team E-cade! - Enters.

2199
01:13:58,858 --> 01:13:59,858
(The time has come.)

2200
01:13:59,928 --> 01:14:03,898
Lee Eun Ji of Team E-cade.

2201
01:14:05,868 --> 01:14:06,968
I love you!

2202
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:08,568
(Breathing in)

2203
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:09,668
I love you!

2204
01:14:10,138 --> 01:14:11,197
Who's that?

2205
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:12,238
(Lee Eun Chae)

2206
01:14:13,268 --> 01:14:14,807
I love you.

2207
01:14:14,808 --> 01:14:15,978
Rockhead, let's go.

2208
01:14:16,138 --> 01:14:17,238
Moo Hyeok!

2209
01:14:17,878 --> 01:14:19,447
(Fake Moo Hyeok)

2210
01:14:19,448 --> 01:14:20,477
Moo Hyeok.

2211
01:14:20,478 --> 01:14:22,878
(Yeong Seok made him do this.)

2212
01:14:23,278 --> 01:14:24,447
(I found my brother-in-law.)

2213
01:14:24,448 --> 01:14:25,888
Do you want to eat with me?

2214
01:14:26,488 --> 01:14:27,618
Stop the car.

2215
01:14:28,288 --> 01:14:29,617
Do you want to eat with me?

2216
01:14:29,618 --> 01:14:31,158
(Mealtime is over.)

2217
01:14:31,388 --> 01:14:33,988
(The room is on fire fueled by the passion of the drama addicts.)

2218
01:14:34,188 --> 01:14:36,097
The battle of "I'm Sorry, I Love You..."

2219
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:37,828
on Earth Arcade is now on.

2220
01:14:38,028 --> 01:14:39,427
Both players, please sit down.

2221
01:14:39,428 --> 01:14:41,068
This is great.

2222
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:43,598
I'll just go to the bathroom.

2223
01:14:43,638 --> 01:14:44,867
(Crowd is buzzing.)

2224
01:14:44,868 --> 01:14:46,507
She's suddenly emptying out her bowels.

2225
01:14:46,508 --> 01:14:47,737
This is for real.

2226
01:14:47,738 --> 01:14:49,837
- I'll introduce the players first. - The players enter.

2227
01:14:49,838 --> 01:14:51,278
First up.

2228
01:14:51,438 --> 01:14:54,178
She's recognized as a devoted fan of...

2229
01:14:54,348 --> 01:14:55,677
"I'm Sorry, I Love You."

2230
01:14:55,678 --> 01:14:57,077
- I give you Lee Eun Ji! - Eun Ji!

2231
01:14:57,078 --> 01:14:58,747
- Lee Eun Ji! - Lee Eun Ji!

2232
01:14:58,748 --> 01:15:01,988
- My son. - Lee Eun Ji!

2233
01:15:02,048 --> 01:15:03,258
- Yoon! - Lee Eun Ji!

2234
01:15:03,888 --> 01:15:06,334
(She tries to seize the upper hand with the portrayal of Oh Deul Hee.)

2235
01:15:06,358 --> 01:15:07,528
Gal Chi!

2236
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,398
Please sit down.

2237
01:15:09,728 --> 01:15:12,097
- Eun Ji. - She's nervous.

2238
01:15:12,098 --> 01:15:14,167
- We have complete faith in you. - You can do it.

2239
01:15:14,168 --> 01:15:17,168
Eun Ji said something before this competition.

2240
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:19,838
It's like taking the comedian hiring test.

2241
01:15:20,038 --> 01:15:22,067
- She is feeling so nervous. - Very nervous.

2242
01:15:22,068 --> 01:15:23,877
- My pride is on the line. - That's right.

2243
01:15:23,878 --> 01:15:25,778
The next player.

2244
01:15:25,908 --> 01:15:28,008
- He's the team's pride. - Team's pride.

2245
01:15:28,078 --> 01:15:30,347
He is known as Left-Wing Blue Dragon.

2246
01:15:30,348 --> 01:15:31,908
- Left-Wing Blue Dragon. - Blue dragon.

2247
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:34,188
- I give you Park Jun Young. - Park Jun Young!

2248
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:35,987
- Park Jun Young! - Park Jun Young!

2249
01:15:35,988 --> 01:15:38,058
(He enters fueled by overwhelming cheers.)

2250
01:15:38,258 --> 01:15:39,587
- Exchange bows. - Exchange bows.

2251
01:15:39,588 --> 01:15:41,128
Please sit down.

2252
01:15:41,588 --> 01:15:43,957
They're already locked in a tense psychological battle.

2253
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:45,197
- It's a beautiful battle. - That's good.

2254
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:47,967
This competition has a prize.

2255
01:15:47,968 --> 01:15:48,997
- Okay. - The prize is...

2256
01:15:48,998 --> 01:15:51,398
If Eun Ji wins,

2257
01:15:51,598 --> 01:15:55,167
we'll stop her digital detox immediately.

2258
01:15:55,168 --> 01:15:56,937
- Stop it immediately. - And we'll return the phone.

2259
01:15:56,938 --> 01:15:58,907
You can watch "Iron Squad" before going to bed.

2260
01:15:58,908 --> 01:16:00,577
I can finally watch "Extreme Job."

2261
01:16:00,578 --> 01:16:01,847
- You can watch "Extreme Job." - Yes.

2262
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:03,847
I hope to watch it before going to bed.

2263
01:16:03,848 --> 01:16:05,948
But if you fail,

2264
01:16:06,288 --> 01:16:07,347
the digital detox will be extended...

2265
01:16:07,348 --> 01:16:08,387
- by a day. - It will be extended.

2266
01:16:08,388 --> 01:16:10,617
There's something I want to know personally.

2267
01:16:10,618 --> 01:16:12,017
What happens if Jun Young wins?

2268
01:16:12,018 --> 01:16:15,158
- Yes. - What kind of benefit does he get?

2269
01:16:15,288 --> 01:16:16,427
I want to know that.

2270
01:16:16,428 --> 01:16:18,757
We'll give him a 100-dollar gift certificate.

2271
01:16:18,758 --> 01:16:20,198
Nice!

2272
01:16:20,668 --> 01:16:21,727
We'll do that.

2273
01:16:21,728 --> 01:16:23,297
Before the official game begins,

2274
01:16:23,298 --> 01:16:25,608
how about we hold an unofficial battle...

2275
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:28,168
to size up each other's skills?

2276
01:16:28,508 --> 01:16:31,678
Name the year "I'm Sorry, I Love You..."

2277
01:16:31,808 --> 01:16:34,008
was aired.

2278
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,048
(Sighing)

2279
01:16:35,108 --> 01:16:36,718
It's 2004.

2280
01:16:37,148 --> 01:16:39,817
- That's so easy. - You're too easy on him.

2281
01:16:39,818 --> 01:16:41,388
But he was going like...

2282
01:16:41,688 --> 01:16:43,117
"Are you really asking me that?"

2283
01:16:43,118 --> 01:16:45,017
- That was his expression. - He answered correctly.

2284
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:46,887
- Next is Jun Young. - It's Jun Young's turn.

2285
01:16:46,888 --> 01:16:47,988
(Jun Young is going next.)

2286
01:16:48,728 --> 01:16:52,198
What's the name of Moo Hyeok's nephew in the drama?

2287
01:16:52,798 --> 01:16:54,328
His nephew's name.

2288
01:16:55,398 --> 01:16:56,398
It's Gal Chi.

2289
01:16:58,938 --> 01:17:01,968
- Lee Eun Ji. - Lee Eun Ji.

2290
01:17:02,038 --> 01:17:03,437
- Lee Eun Ji. - Hey!

2291
01:17:03,438 --> 01:17:05,578
- Who doesn't know this? - You can do it.

2292
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:08,107
Do you want to do another round?

2293
01:17:08,108 --> 01:17:10,518
In the drama, Moo Hyeok...

2294
01:17:10,818 --> 01:17:12,688
- I'm nervous. - was adopted to which country?

2295
01:17:13,818 --> 01:17:15,218
Do I have to tell you the city too?

2296
01:17:15,758 --> 01:17:16,957
(Hold on, look at this guy.)

2297
01:17:16,958 --> 01:17:18,087
- What's this? - Way to go!

2298
01:17:18,088 --> 01:17:20,328
- You have to stay sharp. - Eun Ji!

2299
01:17:20,788 --> 01:17:23,128
- What is this? - Eun Ji.

2300
01:17:23,898 --> 01:17:26,628
- This is... - Unbelievable.

2301
01:17:26,728 --> 01:17:27,998
Melbourne, Australia.

2302
01:17:29,498 --> 01:17:30,738
Is that correct?

2303
01:17:30,968 --> 01:17:32,137
- It's correct. - It's the answer.

2304
01:17:32,138 --> 01:17:34,007
- I acknowledge his talent. - Okay.

2305
01:17:34,008 --> 01:17:35,538
(She's a cool lady.)

2306
01:17:35,638 --> 01:17:38,137
One thing is giving me goosebumps.

2307
01:17:38,138 --> 01:17:39,377
We both have a pimple...

2308
01:17:39,378 --> 01:17:41,054
- in the same place. - It's the same place.

2309
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:42,417
Turn your head. It's here.

2310
01:17:42,418 --> 01:17:43,577
Even the pimple is the merchandise.

2311
01:17:43,578 --> 01:17:44,858
Even the location of the pimple.

2312
01:17:45,218 --> 01:17:46,817
They kind of seem like...

2313
01:17:46,818 --> 01:17:48,548
- a good match. - They look good together.

2314
01:17:49,188 --> 01:17:50,518
Do you have a girlfriend?

2315
01:17:51,058 --> 01:17:52,088
No, I don't.

2316
01:17:53,258 --> 01:17:55,997
(She turns her body without thinking and clasps her hands neatly.)

2317
01:17:55,998 --> 01:17:58,428
I’d appreciate it if we returned to the core issue.

2318
01:17:58,928 --> 01:18:00,698
Eun Ji and Jun Young.

2319
01:18:00,798 --> 01:18:03,137
- Please go back to the core issue. - We have to win.

2320
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:05,058
- Let’s officially begin the game. - Here we go.

2321
01:18:05,338 --> 01:18:06,368
The rules are simple.

2322
01:18:06,468 --> 01:18:08,938
We'll read the questions slowly.

2323
01:18:09,038 --> 01:18:13,178
If you think you know the answer, shout "I got it."

2324
01:18:13,278 --> 01:18:15,917
Then, we'll stop reading and listen to the answer.

2325
01:18:15,918 --> 01:18:16,918
Okay.

2326
01:18:16,978 --> 01:18:20,748
The first person to answer three questions correctly wins.

2327
01:18:20,848 --> 01:18:22,018
- Three questions? - Yes.

2328
01:18:22,918 --> 01:18:23,957
- Three questions. - Yes.

2329
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,217
(The 3-Question Battle begins!)

2330
01:18:25,218 --> 01:18:27,287
(Warning: Insanely hard questions are ahead!)

2331
01:18:27,288 --> 01:18:28,288
Are you ready?

2332
01:18:28,758 --> 01:18:30,197
- Are you ready? - I'm ready.

2333
01:18:30,198 --> 01:18:31,727
- He's really trembling. - He is.

2334
01:18:31,728 --> 01:18:33,127
- He's really trembling a lot. - For real.

2335
01:18:33,128 --> 01:18:35,668
As a true fan, my pride is on the line.

2336
01:18:35,768 --> 01:18:37,688
Frankly, getting my phone back is not important.

2337
01:18:37,868 --> 01:18:39,807
The important thing is your pride?

2338
01:18:39,808 --> 01:18:41,667
For Jun Young, the gift certificate is not what matters either.

2339
01:18:41,668 --> 01:18:43,468
- It doesn't matter at all. - It's his honor.

2340
01:18:44,108 --> 01:18:45,537
- The first question. - I'm shaking.

2341
01:18:45,538 --> 01:18:46,684
(Here comes the first question.)

2342
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:49,418
(This is the most nerve-racking moment yet.)

2343
01:18:49,848 --> 01:18:51,177
Here's the question.

2344
01:18:51,178 --> 01:18:52,578
(It's the same for those watching.)

2345
01:18:52,718 --> 01:18:54,188
When Cha Moo Hyeok...

2346
01:18:55,248 --> 01:18:58,958
met his mother for the first time...

2347
01:18:59,858 --> 01:19:04,528
(Cha Moo Hyeok barges into the house of his mother, Oh Deul Hee.)

2348
01:19:05,228 --> 01:19:08,298
(There, the two come face to face for the first time.)

2349
01:19:08,868 --> 01:19:12,408
What was the first thing she said to him?

2350
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:18,838
What was the first thing she said to him?

2351
01:19:19,908 --> 01:19:22,547
(Let me think.)

2352
01:19:22,548 --> 01:19:24,177
- What? - This is hard.

2353
01:19:24,178 --> 01:19:27,318
- I got it. - Go ahead.

2354
01:19:27,918 --> 01:19:29,588
I know what Moo Hyeok did.

2355
01:19:31,118 --> 01:19:32,118
She said, "Who are you?"

2356
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:35,728
Correct!

2357
01:19:37,128 --> 01:19:38,128
Who are you?

2358
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:40,667
(What? Is that correct?)

2359
01:19:40,668 --> 01:19:41,668
Correct!

2360
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:44,397
- Eun Ji! - Amazing!

2361
01:19:44,398 --> 01:19:45,438
- You got it! - Amazing!

2362
01:19:45,968 --> 01:19:48,468
- You did it. - Eun Ji is the best.

2363
01:19:49,008 --> 01:19:50,308
(Let's check the answer.)

2364
01:19:52,008 --> 01:19:54,048
(Who is that person?)

2365
01:19:54,378 --> 01:19:56,938
(The wording is a bit different, but contextually it's correct.)

2366
01:19:57,248 --> 01:19:58,817
Could you explain in more detail about the part...

2367
01:19:58,818 --> 01:20:00,618
- you're referring to? - More detail, please.

2368
01:20:00,888 --> 01:20:02,587
Incredible. I got goosebumps.

2369
01:20:02,588 --> 01:20:04,157
How did she end up saying "Who are you?"

2370
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:06,657
Because of something that happened,

2371
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:10,898
Moo Hyeok ends up going into Deul Hee's house.

2372
01:20:11,398 --> 01:20:12,638
- Into the house. - Deul Hee's.

2373
01:20:12,668 --> 01:20:16,738
She comes downstairs thinking it's her son.

2374
01:20:16,898 --> 01:20:18,098
But Moo Hyeok is there.

2375
01:20:20,808 --> 01:20:21,808
Who are you?
(More accurately, "Who is that person?")

2376
01:20:22,809 --> 01:20:24,908
- That's what she says. - Eun Ji deserves applause.

2377
01:20:25,478 --> 01:20:27,477
She's off to a good start.

2378
01:20:27,478 --> 01:20:28,807
The level of this game is incredible.

2379
01:20:28,808 --> 01:20:29,947
- It sure is. - Incredible.

2380
01:20:29,948 --> 01:20:31,217
The drama fanatics will love this.

2381
01:20:31,218 --> 01:20:32,818
The quality of this game is really high.

2382
01:20:33,048 --> 01:20:35,317
I'll give this a try next time with "Hospital Playlist."

2383
01:20:35,318 --> 01:20:37,758
(Current score: Jun Young 0, Eun Ji 1)

2384
01:20:37,858 --> 01:20:39,188
The score is one to zero.

2385
01:20:39,658 --> 01:20:42,018
- Now for the second question. - We believe in you, Eun Ji.

2386
01:20:42,088 --> 01:20:45,998
Cha Moo Hyeok and his twin sister.

2387
01:20:46,328 --> 01:20:48,998
What led them to discover each other's existence...

2388
01:20:49,768 --> 01:20:50,998
was their rings.

2389
01:20:51,738 --> 01:20:54,208
Give it to me. It's mine.

2390
01:20:57,508 --> 01:21:01,177
There was something engraved on those rings.

2391
01:21:01,178 --> 01:21:02,277
(Question 2: What was written on each of the rings?)

2392
01:21:02,278 --> 01:21:04,718
What was written on each ring?

2393
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:05,887
Gosh, this is really difficult.

2394
01:21:05,888 --> 01:21:07,728
- How can they know this? - How can they know?

2395
01:21:07,848 --> 01:21:08,887
(The difficulty level is high even for the drama fanatics.)

2396
01:21:08,888 --> 01:21:11,418
It's that thing...

2397
01:21:12,358 --> 01:21:14,128
- Something from the program. - Right.

2398
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:16,328
- What was that? - Why...

2399
01:21:16,428 --> 01:21:18,497
- Why are you talking to each other? - What was that?

2400
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:19,797
- Trying to find someone. - Find someone.

2401
01:21:19,798 --> 01:21:20,798
(Standing firm)

2402
01:21:22,198 --> 01:21:23,397
I got it.

2403
01:21:23,398 --> 01:21:25,038
- Go ahead. - Eun Ji.

2404
01:21:25,638 --> 01:21:28,668
"Our love" and "As it is."

2405
01:21:29,408 --> 01:21:31,437
- "Our love" on one ring. - "Our love" on one ring.

2406
01:21:31,438 --> 01:21:33,424
- "As it is" on the other? - "As it is" on the other.

2407
01:21:33,448 --> 01:21:35,248
It has the same vibe, but it's wrong!

2408
01:21:35,778 --> 01:21:37,747
The inscriptions on each ring...

2409
01:21:37,748 --> 01:21:40,448
- They connect to each other.. - They connect.

2410
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:44,118
You guys should enter a three-legged race.

2411
01:21:44,658 --> 01:21:46,788
- You should. - You two will win for sure.

2412
01:21:47,628 --> 01:21:49,227
I don't get what they're talking about.

2413
01:21:49,228 --> 01:21:51,268
- I don't know the story. - You were two years old?

2414
01:21:51,728 --> 01:21:53,027
I don't know, but this is fun.

2415
01:21:53,028 --> 01:21:54,228
- It's so fierce. - I know.

2416
01:21:55,428 --> 01:21:56,498
- I got it. - Go ahead.

2417
01:21:56,598 --> 01:21:58,437
"Forever" and "Together."

2418
01:21:58,438 --> 01:22:00,607
(Sister's ring has "Forever," Moo Hyeok's has "Together.")

2419
01:22:00,608 --> 01:22:01,608
Correct!

2420
01:22:01,908 --> 01:22:04,007
It's okay. It was within expectations.

2421
01:22:04,008 --> 01:22:05,137
It was within expectations.

2422
01:22:05,138 --> 01:22:06,607
- It's fine. - Don't cry.

2423
01:22:06,608 --> 01:22:08,177
Don't cry, Eun Ji.

2424
01:22:08,178 --> 01:22:09,477
- Don't cry. - It's okay.

2425
01:22:09,478 --> 01:22:11,017
It's okay.

2426
01:22:11,018 --> 01:22:12,278
Don't cry. No worries.

2427
01:22:12,378 --> 01:22:13,517
Lift your head.

2428
01:22:13,518 --> 01:22:15,717
- You did well. - Great.

2429
01:22:15,718 --> 01:22:16,788
It's fine, Eun Ji.

2430
01:22:17,088 --> 01:22:18,257
- It can happen. - Eun Ji.

2431
01:22:18,258 --> 01:22:19,627
- You're just starting. - This is fierce.

2432
01:22:19,628 --> 01:22:20,658
Go easy.

2433
01:22:20,858 --> 01:22:23,458
(Let's check the answer.)

2434
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:28,827
(The words "Forever" and "Together" are inscribed clearly.)

2435
01:22:28,828 --> 01:22:30,297
- Go easy. You can do it. - It's okay.

2436
01:22:30,298 --> 01:22:32,438
- That drama is planted in you. - It's fine.

2437
01:22:33,138 --> 01:22:35,167
- Impressed. - This is so fierce.

2438
01:22:35,168 --> 01:22:36,278
Is it 1 to 1?

2439
01:22:36,678 --> 01:22:38,707
- It was that. - Right?

2440
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:40,277
- "Forever" and "Together." - "Together."

2441
01:22:40,278 --> 01:22:41,307
The score is 1 to 1.

2442
01:22:41,308 --> 01:22:42,447
Gal Chi saw that and said,

2443
01:22:42,448 --> 01:22:43,608
- "This is strange." - Right.

2444
01:22:43,978 --> 01:22:45,477
- While watching... - While watching TV.

2445
01:22:45,478 --> 01:22:46,487
- Watching TV. - He said it was strange.

2446
01:22:46,488 --> 01:22:47,488
(Yet again, they're in a world of their own.)
(Now that everyone’s looking, they feel awkward.)

2447
01:22:48,489 --> 01:22:51,288
What? I think we should all leave the room.

2448
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:52,457
- They don't need us. - We should leave.

2449
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:53,987
- This is an important match. - It's important.

2450
01:22:53,988 --> 01:22:56,788
It's my first time actually meeting a "I'm Sorry, I Love You" fanatic.

2451
01:22:58,258 --> 01:22:59,827
- This is my first time too. - It's his first time.

2452
01:22:59,828 --> 01:23:01,328
I see.

2453
01:23:01,668 --> 01:23:05,268
For me... During the fan meeting...

2454
01:23:05,368 --> 01:23:07,638
I thought his dancing was fun.

2455
01:23:08,868 --> 01:23:11,137
(The moment one's embarrassing past becomes another's fond memory)

2456
01:23:11,138 --> 01:23:12,507
You were already watching him.

2457
01:23:12,508 --> 01:23:13,947
- She gave birth. - You already knew.

2458
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:15,524
She thought they were dead, and they were put up for adoption.

2459
01:23:15,548 --> 01:23:17,277
Moo Hyeok comes to see his mother.

2460
01:23:17,278 --> 01:23:19,547
But the mother asks "Who are you?" as soon as she sees him.

2461
01:23:19,548 --> 01:23:21,488
Who has the matching rings?

2462
01:23:21,888 --> 01:23:23,758
Moo Hyeok and his twin sister.

2463
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:25,388
When they were young?

2464
01:23:25,488 --> 01:23:28,328
Before abandoning the twins, Deul Hee's manager...

2465
01:23:28,428 --> 01:23:30,227
puts the rings on each baby.

2466
01:23:30,228 --> 01:23:31,898
And that manager is actually...

2467
01:23:32,598 --> 01:23:33,698
- I'll stop here. - Right.

2468
01:23:35,128 --> 01:23:37,068
- That was good. - What is this?

2469
01:23:37,498 --> 01:23:40,208
(Current score: Jun Young 1, Eun Ji 1)

2470
01:23:40,368 --> 01:23:41,407
Okay.

2471
01:23:41,408 --> 01:23:43,128
It's 1 to 1. It's fine. Let's take it easy.

2472
01:23:43,378 --> 01:23:44,408
Next question.

2473
01:23:44,508 --> 01:23:46,848
Because Moo Hyeok is terminally ill,

2474
01:23:47,178 --> 01:23:50,547
he says he will give something to Yoon before he leaves, so...

2475
01:23:50,548 --> 01:23:51,548
- Jun Young. - I got it.

2476
01:23:52,178 --> 01:23:55,017
- They called out at the same time. - There's still a lot left.

2477
01:23:55,018 --> 01:23:56,018
They called out at the same time.

2478
01:23:56,019 --> 01:23:57,057
We have to go with rock-paper-scissors.

2479
01:23:57,058 --> 01:23:58,287
To be fair. They called out at the same time.

2480
01:23:58,288 --> 01:24:00,757
- I'm sorry, I love you - I love you

2481
01:24:00,758 --> 01:24:01,758
I didn't know about this.

2482
01:24:02,328 --> 01:24:04,258
What's the answer, Ms. I Love You?

2483
01:24:04,528 --> 01:24:05,528
- Heart. - Oh, no.

2484
01:24:06,168 --> 01:24:07,727
(Did she get the correct answer so easily again.?)

2485
01:24:07,728 --> 01:24:09,097
(Heart)

2486
01:24:09,098 --> 01:24:12,438
Wrong! Please listen to the question until the end.

2487
01:24:14,038 --> 01:24:16,107
- Jun Young has the chance now. - Wait a second.

2488
01:24:16,108 --> 01:24:17,538
- I got it. - Okay.

2489
01:24:18,138 --> 01:24:19,178
Wild ginseng?

2490
01:24:19,848 --> 01:24:23,317
You threw away your hard-earned opportunity.

2491
01:24:23,318 --> 01:24:25,647
- Deul Hee brought wild ginseng. - She did.

2492
01:24:25,648 --> 01:24:27,818
She brought wild ginseng, but he went...

2493
01:24:27,918 --> 01:24:29,587
- That happened, right? - Yes.

2494
01:24:29,588 --> 01:24:31,457
- He was there. - He goes, "I'm dying!"

2495
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:32,487
It's like we're not a team.

2496
01:24:32,488 --> 01:24:34,557
- They're on the same team. - I know.

2497
01:24:34,558 --> 01:24:35,718
I'll read the question again.

2498
01:24:35,758 --> 01:24:38,797
Moo Hyeok says he's terminally ill and offers to give Yoon something.

2499
01:24:38,798 --> 01:24:41,968
In return, he asks Eun Chae to love him.

2500
01:24:42,868 --> 01:24:46,508
(I'll take out my heart and give it to Yoon.)

2501
01:24:47,138 --> 01:24:49,707
(You...)

2502
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:50,838
(Will you come to me?)

2503
01:24:52,408 --> 01:24:55,978
Eun Chae acts in this way...

2504
01:24:56,078 --> 01:24:58,318
- and says this line. - I got it.

2505
01:24:59,718 --> 01:25:00,748
I got it.

2506
01:25:01,088 --> 01:25:04,317
She poured milk on him and said, "Die. Die quickly."

2507
01:25:04,318 --> 01:25:06,758
(She poured milk and said, "Die. Die quickly.")

2508
01:25:08,388 --> 01:25:09,528
You die quickly?

2509
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:12,028
Please give an accurate answer.

2510
01:25:12,658 --> 01:25:14,328
Die, you die quickly.

2511
01:25:14,528 --> 01:25:16,798
Wrong answer. Now, it's...

2512
01:25:17,298 --> 01:25:18,837
- It's Eun Ji's turn. - Eun Ji's turn.

2513
01:25:18,838 --> 01:25:20,407
You got the right vibes.

2514
01:25:20,408 --> 01:25:21,508
- I did, didn't I? - Yes.

2515
01:25:22,108 --> 01:25:23,654
Something like telling him to die quickly.

2516
01:25:23,678 --> 01:25:25,798
- Something like that. - I hope they end up together.

2517
01:25:25,878 --> 01:25:27,147
- They go well together. - Eun Ji.

2518
01:25:27,148 --> 01:25:28,148
Eun Ji.

2519
01:25:28,149 --> 01:25:30,817
Eun Chae pours white milk...

2520
01:25:30,818 --> 01:25:32,677
- over Moo Hyeok's head. - Right.

2521
01:25:32,678 --> 01:25:33,988
The action is accurate.

2522
01:25:34,488 --> 01:25:36,588
"Die. Die quickly..."

2523
01:25:37,188 --> 01:25:39,758
"so Yoon can get your heart."

2524
01:25:40,658 --> 01:25:42,488
I never heard that before. Wrong.

2525
01:25:43,158 --> 01:25:44,657
- You're correct. - I am, aren't I?

2526
01:25:44,658 --> 01:25:46,497
- That's how I remember it. - Isn't it?

2527
01:25:46,498 --> 01:25:48,068
(The answer is revealed.)

2528
01:25:48,668 --> 01:25:49,768
(Will you come to me?)

2529
01:25:51,298 --> 01:25:54,467
(She pours milk.)

2530
01:25:54,468 --> 01:25:55,938
Don't fool around with your life.

2531
01:25:56,308 --> 01:25:58,137
(Eun Chae pours milk and says, "Don't fool around with your life.")

2532
01:25:58,138 --> 01:25:59,947
Shall I reveal the last part...

2533
01:25:59,948 --> 01:26:01,508
- of the line? - Yes.

2534
01:26:01,608 --> 01:26:03,878
- After saying something... - My goodness.

2535
01:26:03,978 --> 01:26:05,218
"Don't fool around."

2536
01:26:06,688 --> 01:26:07,817
- Eun Ji! - Oh, no.

2537
01:26:07,818 --> 01:26:08,848
Eun Ji was quicker.

2538
01:26:09,088 --> 01:26:11,257
Don't fool around with your life.

2539
01:26:11,258 --> 01:26:12,258
Correct!

2540
01:26:12,259 --> 01:26:13,659
(Don't fool around with your life.)

2541
01:26:14,058 --> 01:26:15,088
Girls!

2542
01:26:15,188 --> 01:26:17,027
You did a great job.

2543
01:26:17,028 --> 01:26:18,028
Amazing!

2544
01:26:18,029 --> 01:26:19,528
(Joy for one, sorrow for the other)

2545
01:26:19,828 --> 01:26:21,068
- This is not the end. - Great.

2546
01:26:21,168 --> 01:26:23,268
Actually, Jun Young gave her a big hint.

2547
01:26:23,638 --> 01:26:24,868
He gave her a lot.

2548
01:26:25,838 --> 01:26:27,007
I want to once again...

2549
01:26:27,008 --> 01:26:29,108
- Let's stand up. - Honestly, you're amazing.

2550
01:26:30,508 --> 01:26:31,538
You're amazing.

2551
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:33,977
(They respect each other even more now.)

2552
01:26:33,978 --> 01:26:35,048
You acknowledged her.

2553
01:26:35,548 --> 01:26:37,848
It's like watching Lee Se Dol's Go match.

2554
01:26:38,018 --> 01:26:39,048
Amazing.

2555
01:26:39,648 --> 01:26:41,618
Whatever.

2556
01:26:42,248 --> 01:26:44,557
Honestly, I don't think I'll have any regrets.

2557
01:26:44,558 --> 01:26:46,428
- If I lose to someone like her. - Me too.

2558
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,258
Such respect.

2559
01:26:48,488 --> 01:26:52,298
I thought the drama fanatics only existed on the internet.

2560
01:26:52,798 --> 01:26:54,797
I never imagined I'd meet a real live one.

2561
01:26:54,798 --> 01:26:56,297
- I think they're dating. - Good luck.

2562
01:26:56,298 --> 01:26:59,168
- Nice. - Are you two like that?

2563
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:02,438
No matter the result, I'd like to see him again in Sangam-dong.

2564
01:27:03,538 --> 01:27:05,819
We can drink soju and talk about "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

2565
01:27:06,038 --> 01:27:07,147
(This isn't a blind date. It's supposed to be a quiz battle.)

2566
01:27:07,148 --> 01:27:09,077
- What is this? - Hey!

2567
01:27:09,078 --> 01:27:11,847
(Current score: Jun Young 1, Eun Ji 2)

2568
01:27:11,848 --> 01:27:13,517
Eun Ji, you just need one more correct answer to win.

2569
01:27:13,518 --> 01:27:14,717
You need one more, Eun Ji.

2570
01:27:14,718 --> 01:27:16,187
- Let's go, Eun Ji! - Your detox will be over.

2571
01:27:16,188 --> 01:27:17,818
Okay, we'll begin.

2572
01:27:18,088 --> 01:27:20,788
When "I'm Sorry, I Love You" first aired,

2573
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:24,127
the three major broadcasting stations were in fierce competition.

2574
01:27:24,128 --> 01:27:25,198
I got it.

2575
01:27:25,528 --> 01:27:26,528
Yes?

2576
01:27:26,529 --> 01:27:28,567
Don't you want to hear the rest of the question?

2577
01:27:28,568 --> 01:27:29,737
MBC's "Age of Heroes,"

2578
01:27:29,738 --> 01:27:31,368
and SBS's "Love Story in Harvard."

2579
01:27:31,938 --> 01:27:33,008
- What? - What?

2580
01:27:33,508 --> 01:27:34,707
- What? - What just happened?

2581
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,337
- What? - What even is the question?

2582
01:27:36,338 --> 01:27:37,437
(MBC's "Age of Heroes," SBS's "Love Story in Harvard")

2583
01:27:37,438 --> 01:27:38,438
- Correct! - What?

2584
01:27:38,439 --> 01:27:39,778
- My gosh! - That's amazing!

2585
01:27:40,478 --> 01:27:42,148
(What just happened?)

2586
01:27:42,308 --> 01:27:44,078
- Hold on a minute! - What's going on?

2587
01:27:44,678 --> 01:27:46,217
(Team Eun Ji is shocked at how fast the correct answer came.)

2588
01:27:46,218 --> 01:27:47,624
- I mean... - What was the question?

2589
01:27:47,648 --> 01:27:49,517
The question was to list...

2590
01:27:49,518 --> 01:27:51,617
the two rival dramas of "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

2591
01:27:51,618 --> 01:27:53,257
Because at the time, we were all rooting for...

2592
01:27:53,258 --> 01:27:54,887
"I'm Sorry, I Love You" to win.

2593
01:27:54,888 --> 01:27:56,827
At the beginning, it was behind "Love Story in Harvard."

2594
01:27:56,828 --> 01:27:58,227
Right, starring Kim Tae Hee...

2595
01:27:58,228 --> 01:27:59,427
and Kim Rae Won.

2596
01:27:59,428 --> 01:28:00,428
I just got goosebumps.

2597
01:28:01,368 --> 01:28:02,527
Then it's tied, right?

2598
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:04,367
Yes, it's 2 to 2. Eun Ji, this is the last round.

2599
01:28:04,368 --> 01:28:06,098
- The last round! - That was amazing.

2600
01:28:06,268 --> 01:28:08,438
That was amazing. I can't believe this.

2601
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,077
This is the final round.

2602
01:28:10,078 --> 01:28:11,918
- It's the last round. - I really want to win.

2603
01:28:12,108 --> 01:28:14,124
How many times have you two watched the first episode?

2604
01:28:14,148 --> 01:28:15,148
The first episode?

2605
01:28:15,408 --> 01:28:17,328
Rather than the first episode, my favorite is...

2606
01:28:17,448 --> 01:28:19,254
Should we talk about our favorite scenes first?

2607
01:28:19,278 --> 01:28:21,518
- Go ahead. - My favorite scene is...

2608
01:28:21,818 --> 01:28:22,887
(Getting into character)

2609
01:28:22,888 --> 01:28:23,888
(Sobbing)

2610
01:28:24,218 --> 01:28:25,958
"Why... Why am I crying?"

2611
01:28:27,728 --> 01:28:29,588
- What? - My gosh.

2612
01:28:30,658 --> 01:28:32,127
(What?)

2613
01:28:32,128 --> 01:28:33,527
(No way...)

2614
01:28:33,528 --> 01:28:34,528
(Gasping)

2615
01:28:34,529 --> 01:28:35,798
(Sobbing)

2616
01:28:36,028 --> 01:28:38,597
(Where have you been my whole life?)

2617
01:28:38,598 --> 01:28:39,598
Seriously?

2618
01:28:39,599 --> 01:28:41,708
- Really? - She acted that out yesterday!

2619
01:28:41,768 --> 01:28:43,577
No, really.

2620
01:28:43,578 --> 01:28:46,077
Eun Ji reenacted that very scene last night.

2621
01:28:46,078 --> 01:28:47,778
(Last night)

2622
01:28:48,248 --> 01:28:50,848
(Producer Jun Young wasn't there, by the way.)

2623
01:28:52,148 --> 01:28:53,448
Gosh, what am I doing?

2624
01:28:54,948 --> 01:28:57,888
(Eun Ji reenacted this exact scene as well.)

2625
01:28:58,388 --> 01:29:00,287
She really told me about this scene yesterday.

2626
01:29:00,288 --> 01:29:02,428
And then Cha Moo Hyeok goes outside...

2627
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:04,057
- in front of a picture window. - Right.

2628
01:29:04,058 --> 01:29:05,328
He bows toward it, saying...

2629
01:29:05,358 --> 01:29:06,367
"Mother."

2630
01:29:06,368 --> 01:29:07,897
"In my next life, I will be born..."

2631
01:29:07,898 --> 01:29:09,067
- "as your proud son." - "As your son."

2632
01:29:09,068 --> 01:29:10,967
- That's what he says. - Goodness.

2633
01:29:10,968 --> 01:29:13,067
(Everyone is invested in "I'm Sorry, I Love You.")

2634
01:29:13,068 --> 01:29:15,268
- It's so touching. - I know, right?

2635
01:29:15,638 --> 01:29:17,508
Why is this quiz so romantic?

2636
01:29:17,878 --> 01:29:19,107
It's like "I'm Solo."

2637
01:29:19,108 --> 01:29:20,278
(Wiping her tears)

2638
01:29:20,808 --> 01:29:21,907
I really love that scene.

2639
01:29:21,908 --> 01:29:23,017
- You wanted to tell him that. - I do, too.

2640
01:29:23,018 --> 01:29:24,377
It's such a touching scene.

2641
01:29:24,378 --> 01:29:25,677
- It's so touching and sad. - I cry...

2642
01:29:25,678 --> 01:29:27,438
- every time I watch it. - I cry every time.

2643
01:29:27,718 --> 01:29:30,588
At this point, I don't think this is much of a competition.

2644
01:29:30,888 --> 01:29:31,888
They're neck and neck.

2645
01:29:31,889 --> 01:29:33,427
Why don't we finish with a final question?

2646
01:29:33,428 --> 01:29:34,428
- Okay! - Okay.
Let's go.

2647
01:29:36,528 --> 01:29:37,997
The first episode of "I'm Sorry, I Love You" begins...

2648
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:40,097
in the editing room of a TV show.

2649
01:29:40,098 --> 01:29:42,327
It shows interview clips of adopted people,

2650
01:29:42,328 --> 01:29:45,167
which includes one of Cha Moo Hyeok's.

2651
01:29:45,168 --> 01:29:47,407
(Question 5: The first episode's editing room scene)

2652
01:29:47,408 --> 01:29:50,677
(Video provided by KBS)

2653
01:29:50,678 --> 01:29:51,907
(Here's the question.)

2654
01:29:51,908 --> 01:29:53,547
What is the title of that TV show?

2655
01:29:53,548 --> 01:29:58,147
(What is the title of the TV show?)

2656
01:29:58,148 --> 01:29:59,547
(There are no lines or subtitles.)

2657
01:29:59,548 --> 01:30:00,987
(It only has some writing on the wall.)

2658
01:30:00,988 --> 01:30:03,388
(The hardest question by far)

2659
01:30:03,588 --> 01:30:05,188
What is the title of that TV show?

2660
01:30:06,658 --> 01:30:08,858
That's so hard. It's such a small detail.

2661
01:30:09,558 --> 01:30:12,127
The host is played by Lee Keum Hee.

2662
01:30:12,128 --> 01:30:13,128
- I remember her. - Wait.

2663
01:30:13,129 --> 01:30:14,297
That's after he comes back to Korea.

2664
01:30:14,298 --> 01:30:15,468
- Is it after that? - Yes.

2665
01:30:17,238 --> 01:30:18,497
(It must be nice being you.)

2666
01:30:18,498 --> 01:30:21,507
The beginning starts with interviews of Koreans...

2667
01:30:21,508 --> 01:30:22,807
- who were adopted overseas. - That's right.

2668
01:30:22,808 --> 01:30:23,778
They remember it.

2669
01:30:23,779 --> 01:30:25,137
They show you the editing room.

2670
01:30:25,138 --> 01:30:26,337
- They begin in the editing room! - Yes.

2671
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:27,747
But they decide that Cha Moo Hyeok's interview...

2672
01:30:27,748 --> 01:30:29,507
doesn't fit the program, and they cut him out.

2673
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:31,947
- And then the show really begins. - Goodness.

2674
01:30:31,948 --> 01:30:34,248
- They go over to Australia. - Right!

2675
01:30:34,648 --> 01:30:35,648
- That's amazing. - I got goosebumps!

2676
01:30:35,649 --> 01:30:36,787
- I got chills! - The story of Melbourne.

2677
01:30:36,788 --> 01:30:39,017
And I don't even remember what we had for dinner last night.

2678
01:30:39,018 --> 01:30:40,028
(Laughing)

2679
01:30:40,688 --> 01:30:42,688
Well... Should we change the question a bit?

2680
01:30:43,598 --> 01:30:44,627
- Gosh. - We'll go a different way.

2681
01:30:44,628 --> 01:30:46,197
(Quick rule change)

2682
01:30:46,198 --> 01:30:48,427
- Your collaboration right now... - Yes.

2683
01:30:48,428 --> 01:30:50,567
Seems less like a competition...

2684
01:30:50,568 --> 01:30:52,797
- They're a team. - but more like a companionship.

2685
01:30:52,798 --> 01:30:54,137
This really feels like sports to me.

2686
01:30:54,138 --> 01:30:56,437
- It's like a beautiful sports game. - If the two of you talk together...

2687
01:30:56,438 --> 01:30:58,508
and guess the program title correctly,

2688
01:30:58,778 --> 01:30:59,878
both of you...

2689
01:31:00,008 --> 01:31:01,607
(Both of them will win.)

2690
01:31:01,608 --> 01:31:03,217
(But, if they're wrong, )

2691
01:31:03,218 --> 01:31:04,477
(24 more hours of digital detox will be added.)

2692
01:31:04,478 --> 01:31:06,247
(It adds up to 60 hours in total.)

2693
01:31:06,248 --> 01:31:07,717
That's so beautiful.

2694
01:31:07,718 --> 01:31:09,318
It's like "TV Loaded with Love."

2695
01:31:09,488 --> 01:31:11,957
The title starts with "I."

2696
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:12,958
(Gasping)

2697
01:31:12,959 --> 01:31:14,319
And it has another four syllables.

2698
01:31:14,658 --> 01:31:15,688
"Overseas?"

2699
01:31:16,228 --> 01:31:17,557
Should we answer together?

2700
01:31:17,558 --> 01:31:18,627
We do?

2701
01:31:18,628 --> 01:31:19,758
You both have to...

2702
01:31:20,268 --> 01:31:21,974
- talk about it together. - Yes, it's something like that.

2703
01:31:21,998 --> 01:31:23,097
You can discuss it together.

2704
01:31:23,098 --> 01:31:24,397
What's going on with you two?

2705
01:31:24,398 --> 01:31:25,838
- Looking cute, you guys! - What?

2706
01:31:26,168 --> 01:31:27,848
- Go on a date! - I actually thought of...

2707
01:31:30,978 --> 01:31:32,308
- What? - What was that?

2708
01:31:32,608 --> 01:31:34,078
I actually thought of...

2709
01:31:34,508 --> 01:31:35,978
(Wait a minute.)

2710
01:31:36,178 --> 01:31:38,018
(Sofa-clearing brawl)

2711
01:31:38,248 --> 01:31:39,478
Look at those two!

2712
01:31:39,678 --> 01:31:40,947
What's going on?

2713
01:31:40,948 --> 01:31:42,747
(Young Ji is frozen while Yu Jin covers her face.)

2714
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:44,917
- No, seriously! - What are you doing?

2715
01:31:44,918 --> 01:31:46,418
What are you two doing?

2716
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:49,028
Why are you doing this?

2717
01:31:49,158 --> 01:31:50,358
This is the title, right?

2718
01:31:50,698 --> 01:31:52,427
- I think we're right. - I think so too.

2719
01:31:52,428 --> 01:31:54,268
- You two could discuss more. - Just go out.

2720
01:31:54,628 --> 01:31:55,667
- I think this is the one. - No.

2721
01:31:55,668 --> 01:31:56,697
- Yes. - This is the one.

2722
01:31:56,698 --> 01:31:57,868
Just go out!

2723
01:31:57,998 --> 01:31:59,038
Please tell us...

2724
01:31:59,568 --> 01:32:00,837
the program title together...

2725
01:32:00,838 --> 01:32:03,008
at the same time.

2726
01:32:03,308 --> 01:32:05,338
What is the title of the program?

2727
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:07,708
"I..."

2728
01:32:08,412 --> 01:32:09,751
Please tell us the program title together...

2729
01:32:09,752 --> 01:32:11,852
at the same time.

2730
01:32:12,282 --> 01:32:14,352
What is the title of the program?

2731
01:32:15,505 --> 01:32:16,505
"I..."

2732
01:32:16,605 --> 01:32:18,215
- "I Hate Korea!" - "I Hate Korea."

2733
01:32:19,645 --> 01:32:20,645
Correct!

2734
01:32:20,646 --> 01:32:22,045
("I Hate Korea.")

2735
01:32:22,985 --> 01:32:24,554
- "I Hate Korea!" - "I Hate Korea."

2736
01:32:24,555 --> 01:32:26,114
(Focused)

2737
01:32:26,115 --> 01:32:27,125
Correct!

2738
01:32:27,425 --> 01:32:28,455
My goodness.

2739
01:32:29,655 --> 01:32:31,324
(Jumping together)

2740
01:32:31,325 --> 01:32:32,355
Wait.

2741
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:36,995
I knew it. That's it. That's what I said.

2742
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:39,634
- Gosh. - Amazing.

2743
01:32:39,635 --> 01:32:41,064
(They can't help but applaud.)

2744
01:32:41,065 --> 01:32:42,865
Please come to the center.

2745
01:32:43,575 --> 01:32:45,234
(Let's check the answer.)

2746
01:32:45,235 --> 01:32:46,774
(Video provided by KBS)

2747
01:32:46,775 --> 01:32:48,874
("I Hate Korea")

2748
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:51,875
(They got the title that was shown for only 4 seconds.)

2749
01:32:53,315 --> 01:32:54,691
- That was amazing. - Congratulations.

2750
01:32:54,715 --> 01:32:55,814
Congratulations, both of you.

2751
01:32:55,815 --> 01:32:57,785
Please bring Eun Ji's phone back.

2752
01:32:58,485 --> 01:32:59,485
That was impressive.

2753
01:32:59,486 --> 01:33:02,185
You'll get the 100-dollar gift certificate...

2754
01:33:03,125 --> 01:33:04,455
the moment we return to Korea.

2755
01:33:04,795 --> 01:33:06,354
How about a speech?

2756
01:33:06,355 --> 01:33:07,424
- Yes, a speech. - Okay.

2757
01:33:07,425 --> 01:33:10,565
I really felt like I was playing a sports game.

2758
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:13,234
The whole experience felt like a real competition.

2759
01:33:13,235 --> 01:33:14,464
- I learned a lot from it. - A real sports game.

2760
01:33:14,465 --> 01:33:15,865
I also realized...

2761
01:33:16,635 --> 01:33:18,134
I’m not a true "I'm Sorry, I Love You" fanatic.

2762
01:33:18,135 --> 01:33:19,695
- He knows so much. - She's modest too.

2763
01:33:19,935 --> 01:33:21,244
- So modest. - He knows so much...

2764
01:33:21,245 --> 01:33:22,974
and loves the show more than I do.

2765
01:33:22,975 --> 01:33:24,575
Why did you need us for this?

2766
01:33:25,245 --> 01:33:26,714
- We're useless. - It could've been the two of them.

2767
01:33:26,715 --> 01:33:27,715
Why did you call us here?

2768
01:33:27,716 --> 01:33:28,845
I don't understand.

2769
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:32,254
- I really wanted to win at first. - Okay.

2770
01:33:32,255 --> 01:33:34,175
But Eun Ji made me feel ashamed of that thought.

2771
01:33:34,785 --> 01:33:35,884
- When she gave correct answers... - What's going on?

2772
01:33:35,885 --> 01:33:37,695
Give her your phone number!

2773
01:33:38,125 --> 01:33:39,455
Even when she got it right,

2774
01:33:39,855 --> 01:33:42,124
- it was so fun for me, too. - Oh my!

2775
01:33:42,125 --> 01:33:43,125
- I felt the same way. - I mean...

2776
01:33:43,126 --> 01:33:45,064
Why are we even here?

2777
01:33:45,065 --> 01:33:46,234
Wait, hold on.

2778
01:33:46,235 --> 01:33:48,564
Here's the last question for you two.

2779
01:33:48,565 --> 01:33:50,605
- Turn around, please. - Turn around?

2780
01:33:51,505 --> 01:33:54,905
If you're willing to exchange phone numbers,

2781
01:33:55,205 --> 01:33:57,175
please raise your right hand.

2782
01:33:58,045 --> 01:34:00,515
"I want to exchange numbers."

2783
01:34:01,215 --> 01:34:02,315
Raise your hand.

2784
01:34:03,145 --> 01:34:05,415
(Are you going to raise it or not?)

2785
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:08,285
(I'm not so sure myself.)

2786
01:34:08,755 --> 01:34:10,495
One, two, three!

2787
01:34:11,795 --> 01:34:13,595
(Shocked)

2788
01:34:13,765 --> 01:34:15,525
One, two, three!

2789
01:34:16,795 --> 01:34:18,665
(It's a match!)

2790
01:34:18,865 --> 01:34:20,464
What? Did you not raise your hand?

2791
01:34:20,465 --> 01:34:21,565
- I did. - He did.

2792
01:34:22,335 --> 01:34:23,335
(He would've been in trouble if he hadn't.)
Good job.

2793
01:34:24,605 --> 01:34:26,005
(It was summer.)

2794
01:34:26,275 --> 01:34:27,844
- Okay! - Gosh, that surprised me.

2795
01:34:27,845 --> 01:34:29,104
(The speakers play the soundtrack for "I'm Sorry, I Love You.")

2796
01:34:29,105 --> 01:34:30,105
Moo Hyeok!

2797
01:34:30,106 --> 01:34:31,114
(Automatically acting out a scene)

2798
01:34:31,115 --> 01:34:32,475
I love you, Moo Hyeok!

2799
01:34:33,515 --> 01:34:34,945
Moo Hyeok, I love you!

2800
01:34:35,415 --> 01:34:36,685
Moo Hyeok, my phone.

2801
01:34:37,415 --> 01:34:39,385
Where's my phone, Moo Hyeok?

2802
01:34:39,885 --> 01:34:40,985
Here you go, Rockhead.

2803
01:34:42,525 --> 01:34:44,294
(Can we all just forget that happened?)

2804
01:34:44,295 --> 01:34:45,295
Moo Hyeok!

2805
01:34:45,955 --> 01:34:47,865
What about Gal Chi? Where is he?

2806
01:34:48,025 --> 01:34:49,264
He's selling gimbap.

2807
01:34:49,265 --> 01:34:50,765
Let's go and help him, Moo Hyeok.

2808
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,664
(The competition ends with them leaving together.)

2809
01:34:53,665 --> 01:34:54,665
Moo Hyeok!

2810
01:34:54,666 --> 01:34:57,205
(The competition ends with them leaving together.)

2811
01:34:59,075 --> 01:35:00,904
(Thank you all for watching...)

2812
01:35:00,905 --> 01:35:02,805
(the "I'm Sorry, I Love You" quiz competition.)

2813
01:35:03,475 --> 01:35:05,144
- Gosh. - That was incredible.

2814
01:35:05,145 --> 01:35:06,185
(Everyone is still moved.)

2815
01:35:06,345 --> 01:35:08,645
(And the back door story)

2816
01:35:09,215 --> 01:35:10,385
You really know this show.

2817
01:35:10,785 --> 01:35:12,154
- You are amazing. - Right back at you.

2818
01:35:12,155 --> 01:35:14,355
- No, really. - Gosh. Let's go in.

2819
01:35:14,925 --> 01:35:17,101
- He's so good with this show. - You guys are the best.

2820
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:19,024
- How do you two do it? - It's unbelievable.

2821
01:35:19,025 --> 01:35:20,965
Eun Ji knew so much about the show.

2822
01:35:21,195 --> 01:35:22,941
- Right? - Hey, I'm nothing compared to you.

2823
01:35:22,965 --> 01:35:24,164
- What's going on? - Wait.

2824
01:35:24,165 --> 01:35:26,295
Look here, the show's over!

2825
01:35:26,535 --> 01:35:27,734
Come on, guys.

2826
01:35:27,735 --> 01:35:29,505
Do you want to meet up at the pool later?

2827
01:35:32,235 --> 01:35:34,244
Thank you for giving me the opportunity...

2828
01:35:34,245 --> 01:35:35,504
to have the competition of a lifetime.

2829
01:35:35,505 --> 01:35:37,114
It was truly unforgettable.

2830
01:35:37,115 --> 01:35:39,115
It was really the competition of a lifetime.

2831
01:35:39,815 --> 01:35:42,314
Tomorrow, since we're in the desert,

2832
01:35:42,315 --> 01:35:44,554
we're going to do some activities there.

2833
01:35:44,555 --> 01:35:46,214
- Zipline? - Yes, like ziplining.

2834
01:35:46,215 --> 01:35:47,325
- I love it. - So,

2835
01:35:47,425 --> 01:35:49,124
since you'll be moving about a lot,

2836
01:35:49,125 --> 01:35:50,824
we'll bring in breakfast to you in the morning.

2837
01:35:50,825 --> 01:35:52,395
The plan is to have breakfast, go out,

2838
01:35:52,525 --> 01:35:54,065
and enjoy the activities.

2839
01:35:55,995 --> 01:35:58,035
(The second night in Abu Dhabi)

2840
01:35:58,735 --> 01:36:00,405
(Lights out)

2841
01:36:00,665 --> 01:36:02,634
- I'm going to sleep warm tonight. - Good night.

2842
01:36:02,635 --> 01:36:03,874
(Mimi goes to bed first.)

2843
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:05,475
- Good night! - You, too.

2844
01:36:05,705 --> 01:36:07,574
You should sleep well, Young Ji. Your throat...

2845
01:36:07,575 --> 01:36:08,605
Don't worry, I will.

2846
01:36:08,745 --> 01:36:13,044
But I think my throat tonight is a lost cause.

2847
01:36:13,045 --> 01:36:15,214
You're the rock of Earth Arcade.

2848
01:36:15,215 --> 01:36:16,785
You're the dad of Earth Arcade.

2849
01:36:17,115 --> 01:36:18,984
Good night, Mom and Dad.

2850
01:36:18,985 --> 01:36:20,315
- Good night. - Good night.

2851
01:36:20,425 --> 01:36:21,455
Bye.

2852
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:25,525
(Young Ji goes back to her room while hydrating.)

2853
01:36:26,225 --> 01:36:28,925
(Dad follows her out.)

2854
01:36:29,165 --> 01:36:31,635
(Sneaking)

2855
01:36:32,165 --> 01:36:35,205
(She gives Young Ji the medicine she brought.)

2856
01:36:35,905 --> 01:36:37,575
Thanks, Eun Ji.

2857
01:36:37,835 --> 01:36:39,205
Good night.

2858
01:36:39,805 --> 01:36:43,205
(She goes to sleep only after that.)

2859
01:36:44,475 --> 01:36:47,185
(The pitch-black desert during the night...)

2860
01:36:48,215 --> 01:36:51,655
(starts to show off its golden hues with the sunrise.)

2861
01:36:52,355 --> 01:36:56,185
(The training center greets the morning as well.)

2862
01:36:57,855 --> 01:37:02,365
(The view from the center is the best feature.)

2863
01:37:03,195 --> 01:37:07,165
(The windows become frames of artwork.)

2864
01:37:07,535 --> 01:37:10,575
(Sand dunes are a given, )

2865
01:37:10,775 --> 01:37:13,605
(and you can see gazelles roaming the desert.)

2866
01:37:14,475 --> 01:37:16,945
(The lake surrounded by trees...)

2867
01:37:17,745 --> 01:37:23,285
(are also filled with animals harmonizing with nature.)

2868
01:37:23,715 --> 01:37:26,585
(It's Abu Dhabi with a view.)

2869
01:37:26,755 --> 01:37:29,755
(The current time is 8am.)

2870
01:37:32,495 --> 01:37:35,925
(Which beautiful scenery are the members enjoying?)

2871
01:37:36,925 --> 01:37:40,605
(They're enjoying "I'm Sorry, I Love You.")

2872
01:37:40,805 --> 01:37:43,405
(And all four of them are.)

2873
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:45,734
What's their relationship?

2874
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:47,845
Moo Hyeok helped Eun Chae once in Australia.

2875
01:37:48,145 --> 01:37:49,575
When she lost her passport.

2876
01:37:50,445 --> 01:37:53,885
They both feel so sorry for themselves.

2877
01:37:55,585 --> 01:37:56,745
(Sniffling)

2878
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:04,154
Are you really crying?

2879
01:38:04,155 --> 01:38:06,095
(She became too immersed.)

2880
01:38:06,755 --> 01:38:08,065
I just feel so bad for them.

2881
01:38:09,965 --> 01:38:11,594
After she realizes Moo Hyeok is terminally ill,

2882
01:38:11,595 --> 01:38:14,835
Eun Chae decides she will stay by his side until his last moment.

2883
01:38:14,905 --> 01:38:15,965
I see.

2884
01:38:16,635 --> 01:38:20,475
(But why am I the one who's crying?)

2885
01:38:21,405 --> 01:38:22,445
She's crying again.

2886
01:38:23,245 --> 01:38:25,945
You watched this more than any of us, and you can still cry?

2887
01:38:27,075 --> 01:38:28,215
It's his mom.

2888
01:38:29,385 --> 01:38:30,415
(Sobbing)

2889
01:38:30,915 --> 01:38:33,415
(She can't stop crying.)

2890
01:38:33,685 --> 01:38:35,424
Eun Ji, stop crying.

2891
01:38:35,425 --> 01:38:37,455
Don't cry, Eun Ji.

2892
01:38:39,055 --> 01:38:40,495
(Meanwhile, )

2893
01:38:40,865 --> 01:38:43,095
(even when everyone else left the room, )

2894
01:38:43,695 --> 01:38:47,635
(Young Ji stayed there and watched "I'm Sorry, I Love You.")

2895
01:38:48,205 --> 01:38:49,205
(Noticing)

2896
01:38:49,565 --> 01:38:52,335
Gosh, there's another fanatic now.

2897
01:38:52,605 --> 01:38:54,575
(Unmoving)

2898
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:56,675
Goodness!

2899
01:38:58,775 --> 01:39:03,285
(She watched for 2 hours straight after waking up.)

2900
01:39:05,855 --> 01:39:06,855
(Grinning)

2901
01:39:07,855 --> 01:39:10,155
What are you doing?

2902
01:39:10,925 --> 01:39:11,925
Gosh!

2903
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:15,465
That show...

2904
01:39:19,665 --> 01:39:24,175
(The wind is blowing.)

2905
01:39:29,205 --> 01:39:33,315
(The current time is 9:50am.)

2906
01:39:36,515 --> 01:39:39,884
(The staff who promised breakfast are still quiet.)

2907
01:39:39,885 --> 01:39:42,225
- I do this every day. - You're such a grown-up, Mimi.

2908
01:39:43,025 --> 01:39:44,571
- Although I act like a child. - It's ready.

2909
01:39:44,595 --> 01:39:45,625
Is it ready?

2910
01:39:45,825 --> 01:39:47,395
- Let's go. - Wait a second.

2911
01:39:47,465 --> 01:39:48,594
- Why? - Why?

2912
01:39:48,595 --> 01:39:50,395
- The food's ready. - The camera.

2913
01:39:50,565 --> 01:39:51,834
Let's go quickly, Eun Ji.

2914
01:39:51,835 --> 01:39:52,835
Okay.

2915
01:39:53,465 --> 01:39:54,865
Where are my shoes?

2916
01:39:57,065 --> 01:40:04,215
(They go to the main building to have breakfast.)

2917
01:40:13,055 --> 01:40:15,354
I was so hungry, I woke up at 7am in the morning!

2918
01:40:15,355 --> 01:40:17,724
It's been like 2 or 3 hours since I've been up!

2919
01:40:17,725 --> 01:40:19,695
Am I presentable on camera right now?

2920
01:40:20,155 --> 01:40:21,794
You never used to care about that, Young Ji.

2921
01:40:21,795 --> 01:40:22,825
You look really cute.

2922
01:40:23,625 --> 01:40:24,665
You're adorable.

2923
01:40:24,735 --> 01:40:26,135
Gosh, I'm starving.

2924
01:40:26,635 --> 01:40:27,835
Guys, hurry!

2925
01:40:29,205 --> 01:40:30,675
Let's go have breakfast!

2926
01:40:33,175 --> 01:40:34,604
I love this building here.

2927
01:40:34,605 --> 01:40:36,074
I smell something amazing!

2928
01:40:36,075 --> 01:40:37,415
(What's for breakfast today?)

2929
01:40:39,045 --> 01:40:41,414
- Yes! - My goodness!

2930
01:40:41,415 --> 01:40:42,584
(In awe)

2931
01:40:42,585 --> 01:40:44,614
- I'm so hungry. - Good morning!

2932
01:40:44,615 --> 01:40:46,514
- Good morning! - Good morning.

2933
01:40:46,515 --> 01:40:48,985
- I'm so hungry. - That's what I texted you

2934
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:53,965
(It's an American breakfast.)

2935
01:40:54,095 --> 01:40:56,264
Thank you for the meal!

2936
01:40:56,265 --> 01:40:57,535
Thank you!

2937
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:00,295
You need a relaxing breakfast like this sometimes.

2938
01:41:00,335 --> 01:41:02,065
- I agree. - This is dry.

2939
01:41:02,965 --> 01:41:05,035
(A bite of omelet)

2940
01:41:05,905 --> 01:41:07,644
(And a spoonful of cereal)

2941
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:08,875
It's so good.

2942
01:41:09,145 --> 01:41:11,075
Should I have this or the French toast?

2943
01:41:11,215 --> 01:41:13,514
You can have this with breakfast.

2944
01:41:13,515 --> 01:41:15,815
- Okay. - That looks really good!

2945
01:41:15,885 --> 01:41:18,115
- It's chicken. - I love that brand!

2946
01:41:18,515 --> 01:41:20,214
-That chicken is really good. - Really?

2947
01:41:20,215 --> 01:41:21,224
I hear you eat it regularly, Young Ji.

2948
01:41:21,225 --> 01:41:22,584
I really do. I buy it myself.

2949
01:41:22,585 --> 01:41:24,501
It's really good when you cook it in an air fryer.

2950
01:41:24,525 --> 01:41:26,224
- Thank you! - Thank you for this.

2951
01:41:26,225 --> 01:41:27,295
It looks great.

2952
01:41:29,395 --> 01:41:31,335
(Yummy)

2953
01:41:36,335 --> 01:41:38,904
I love this soy sauce flavor.

2954
01:41:38,905 --> 01:41:39,975
It's really good.

2955
01:41:42,005 --> 01:41:43,045
It's crunchy!

2956
01:41:43,275 --> 01:41:44,345
It's so crunchy.

2957
01:41:45,975 --> 01:41:48,175
(The crunchiness followed us all the way to Abu Dhabi.)

2958
01:41:48,885 --> 01:41:50,215
Is there any dip?

2959
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:52,284
I think this is the one, Mimi.

2960
01:41:52,285 --> 01:41:54,001
- That's not it! - Eun Ji, this is maple syrup.

2961
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:55,554
- That's not it! - Eun Ji, this is maple syrup.

2962
01:41:55,555 --> 01:41:57,354
- It's maple syrup. - My goodness.

2963
01:41:57,355 --> 01:41:58,555
It might go well together.

2964
01:41:58,825 --> 01:41:59,945
Like honey-flavored chicken.

2965
01:42:01,195 --> 01:42:02,224
Sure, I'll try it.

2966
01:42:02,225 --> 01:42:03,495
- It's good! - I want to try.

2967
01:42:04,095 --> 01:42:05,135
It's sweet and savory.

2968
01:42:06,995 --> 01:42:08,464
I feel like I'm in a movie theater.

2969
01:42:08,465 --> 01:42:09,864
(Please check the official recipe.)

2970
01:42:09,865 --> 01:42:11,275
It tastes like caramel popcorn.

2971
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:12,904
It's so crunchy.

2972
01:42:12,905 --> 01:42:14,574
(The lights go off.)

2973
01:42:14,575 --> 01:42:17,415
(They're back on.)

2974
01:42:17,645 --> 01:42:18,745
It's so crunchy.

2975
01:42:20,345 --> 01:42:22,085
- What? - That surprised me.

2976
01:42:22,285 --> 01:42:25,215
(Chilling)

2977
01:42:33,595 --> 01:42:36,665
Producer Na, I was really possessed last night.

2978
01:42:37,195 --> 01:42:38,795
I can swear it happened.

2979
01:42:39,065 --> 01:42:40,095
Where?

2980
01:42:40,235 --> 01:42:43,234
I kept hearing things in my ears.

2981
01:42:43,235 --> 01:42:44,735
Who did you sleep with last night?

2982
01:42:45,005 --> 01:42:46,134
- Mimi. - Me.

2983
01:42:46,135 --> 01:42:47,644
Maybe Mimi was saying…

2984
01:42:47,645 --> 01:42:49,175
No, I kept checking.

2985
01:42:49,345 --> 01:42:50,705
I slept like a baby.

2986
01:42:50,845 --> 01:42:51,975
I didn't wake up once.

2987
01:42:52,945 --> 01:42:54,514
Actually, I think maybe...

2988
01:42:54,515 --> 01:42:56,645
I did have a nightmare because of you, Mimi.

2989
01:42:56,945 --> 01:42:58,685
Because Mimi always sleeps...

2990
01:42:58,715 --> 01:43:00,615
with her phone right here.

2991
01:43:01,025 --> 01:43:03,855
She sets the volume to a level she thinks only she can hear.

2992
01:43:03,955 --> 01:43:06,224
And she plays baseball videos.

2993
01:43:06,225 --> 01:43:07,865
That's why I had a nightmare.

2994
01:43:08,965 --> 01:43:10,625
Wait, guys!

2995
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:14,535
Wait, guys!

2996
01:43:15,305 --> 01:43:16,934
- What should we do? - It's the Jade Phone!

2997
01:43:16,935 --> 01:43:18,034
- What? - Guys.

2998
01:43:18,035 --> 01:43:20,775
(The Jade Phone rang for the first time!)

2999
01:43:20,905 --> 01:43:22,805
Guys, it's the Jade Phone.

3000
01:43:23,805 --> 01:43:26,044
- He paid twice. - Torong spent money.

3001
01:43:26,045 --> 01:43:27,074
What? What did he buy?

3002
01:43:27,075 --> 01:43:28,084
(Mr. Tiger Woozoo, overseas payment)

3003
01:43:28,085 --> 01:43:30,885
(A text from the credit card company)

3004
01:43:31,085 --> 01:43:32,614
He spent 2,000 dollars!

3005
01:43:32,615 --> 01:43:34,154
- No, it's... - He bought something...

3006
01:43:34,155 --> 01:43:35,654
at Etihad Airways.

3007
01:43:35,655 --> 01:43:37,184
- He's going home! - Is he going back to Korea?

3008
01:43:37,185 --> 01:43:39,554
Look, this is the text I got.

3009
01:43:39,555 --> 01:43:40,994
Etihad Airways...

3010
01:43:40,995 --> 01:43:42,955
- It's 2,000 dollars! You're right! - It's 2,000.

3011
01:43:43,295 --> 01:43:45,695
He spent around 2,000 dollars.

3012
01:43:45,895 --> 01:43:48,064
(Another text)

3013
01:43:48,065 --> 01:43:49,764
(From Etihad Airways)

3014
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:52,204
(It's a confirmation text from an airline.)

3015
01:43:52,205 --> 01:43:53,734
(TO: LIS)

3016
01:43:53,735 --> 01:43:56,345
Where is "LIS?"

3017
01:43:56,545 --> 01:44:00,215
(Where is Torong trying to go?)

3018
01:44:00,475 --> 01:44:01,844
LIS. The LIS airport.

3019
01:44:01,845 --> 01:44:03,691
But I really like where we're staying right now.

3020
01:44:03,715 --> 01:44:05,354
(She doesn't want to go anywhere.)

3021
01:44:05,355 --> 01:44:06,385
Let's stay here!

3022
01:44:06,685 --> 01:44:08,455
It's Portugal!

3023
01:44:08,725 --> 01:44:10,684
He's going to Lisbon, Portugal!

3024
01:44:10,685 --> 01:44:11,755
It's Portugal!

3025
01:44:11,825 --> 01:44:13,895
He's going to Lisbon, Portugal!

3026
01:44:14,495 --> 01:44:15,665
Portugal?

3027
01:44:16,695 --> 01:44:18,835
(The screen isn't frozen.)

3028
01:44:19,065 --> 01:44:21,065
(Torong's destination)

3029
01:44:21,105 --> 01:44:23,535
(TO: LIS)

3030
01:44:29,005 --> 01:44:32,615
(Lisbon, the capital city of Portugal)

3031
01:44:32,945 --> 01:44:35,115
Did he board already? What time is the flight?

3032
01:44:35,785 --> 01:44:37,485
The boarding time is 10:55am.

3033
01:44:37,655 --> 01:44:38,814
- That's soon! - What time is it now?

3034
01:44:38,815 --> 01:44:40,614
It's 9:55am. We have to go, right?

3035
01:44:40,615 --> 01:44:42,284
- The airport... - I think it's too late.

3036
01:44:42,285 --> 01:44:44,324
It's too late. It takes us an hour and a half...

3037
01:44:44,325 --> 01:44:46,094
- just to go downtown. - Yes, it's too late.

3038
01:44:46,095 --> 01:44:48,195
Are we going to Portugal, then?

3039
01:44:49,925 --> 01:44:52,435
Could you keep to your character a little bit?

3040
01:44:52,835 --> 01:44:55,065
Is Torong a Ronaldo fan or what?

3041
01:44:55,805 --> 01:44:57,705
- Is Ronaldo from Portugal? - I don't know.

3042
01:44:59,475 --> 01:45:01,504
She's calling the credit card company.

3043
01:45:01,505 --> 01:45:02,545
The company.

3044
01:45:02,975 --> 01:45:04,214
Press call.

3045
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:06,615
(Putting in her complaint to the company)

3046
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:08,514
It didn't ring?

3047
01:45:08,515 --> 01:45:10,045
- The call failed. - It failed.

3048
01:45:10,415 --> 01:45:12,314
Do it like "Crime Scene."

3049
01:45:12,315 --> 01:45:14,424
- Like "Crime Scene." - Right, you're an expert, Yu Jin.

3050
01:45:14,425 --> 01:45:15,705
- Wait a minute. - What's wrong?

3051
01:45:17,425 --> 01:45:18,555
Let's see.

3052
01:45:19,225 --> 01:45:21,294
It'll take an hour and three minutes if we leave right now,

3053
01:45:21,295 --> 01:45:22,625
- to the airport. - Wait.

3054
01:45:22,895 --> 01:45:23,965
Is it a domestic flight?

3055
01:45:24,365 --> 01:45:26,095
Wait, what? I'm sorry.

3056
01:45:26,895 --> 01:45:28,004
I couldn't stay in character.

3057
01:45:28,005 --> 01:45:29,104
- I'm sorry, but that's... - No one breaks like that...

3058
01:45:29,105 --> 01:45:30,164
on "Crime Scene."

3059
01:45:30,165 --> 01:45:32,005
I'm sorry, but it's hard to stay in character.

3060
01:45:32,475 --> 01:45:35,444
- I need to match the tone. - He's going to Portugal!

3061
01:45:35,445 --> 01:45:36,545
- I'm sorry. - Hang on.

3062
01:45:36,805 --> 01:45:38,044
- Portugal is a different country! - Portugal?

3063
01:45:38,045 --> 01:45:39,045
(She finally got it.)

3064
01:45:39,075 --> 01:45:40,945
(Another point)

3065
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:44,785
(Seat number: 11A, 11B)

3066
01:45:45,385 --> 01:45:48,655
(Torong bought two seats on the plane.)

3067
01:45:49,555 --> 01:45:52,225
- Abu Dhabi... - Two tickets. He bought two!

3068
01:45:52,295 --> 01:45:53,755
He must've run away with Cheol Yong.

3069
01:45:54,095 --> 01:45:55,895
(Cheol Yong?)

3070
01:45:56,295 --> 01:45:58,234
- Where are they? - Are there tickets for two?

3071
01:45:58,235 --> 01:45:59,494
- Two... - Stop acting!

3072
01:45:59,495 --> 01:46:00,895
It's 11A and 11B.

3073
01:46:01,035 --> 01:46:02,134
- There are two seats. - You're right!

3074
01:46:02,135 --> 01:46:03,834
- It says 11A and 11B. - Who is it?

3075
01:46:03,835 --> 01:46:05,395
If it's 11, he's flying business class.

3076
01:46:05,475 --> 01:46:07,074
- Wait... - It's business class.

3077
01:46:07,075 --> 01:46:09,245
(An infuriating setup)

3078
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:10,905
Is he on Instagram?

3079
01:46:11,175 --> 01:46:13,744
- Check Torong's Instagram. - Check it.

3080
01:46:13,745 --> 01:46:15,214
Hurry up and check Torong's Instagram.

3081
01:46:15,215 --> 01:46:17,214
- I'll do it. - You're good at making...

3082
01:46:17,215 --> 01:46:19,095
- deductions. - I don't have a phone. Go ahead.

3083
01:46:19,315 --> 01:46:21,285
(Laughing)

3084
01:46:21,555 --> 01:46:22,824
(It's hard for her to catch Torong.)

3085
01:46:22,825 --> 01:46:24,054
I really don't have one.

3086
01:46:24,055 --> 01:46:25,354
You can't chase after Torong.

3087
01:46:25,355 --> 01:46:26,901
(The aftermath of the digital detox lasts long.)

3088
01:46:26,925 --> 01:46:27,964
- I can't see anything. - Two minutes ago.

3089
01:46:27,965 --> 01:46:31,635
(Torong just shared a post.)

3090
01:46:31,735 --> 01:46:33,494
(Since when have you guys been following me?)

3091
01:46:33,495 --> 01:46:35,281
(You guys have a long way to go. For goodness' sake.)

3092
01:46:35,305 --> 01:46:37,134
"Since when have you guys been following me?"

3093
01:46:37,135 --> 01:46:39,304
"You guys have a long way to go. For goodness' sake."

3094
01:46:39,305 --> 01:46:41,204
- Cheol Yong shared a new post. - Cheol Yong.

3095
01:46:41,205 --> 01:46:43,274
I told you that he went with Cheol Yong.

3096
01:46:43,275 --> 01:46:44,445
Cheol Yong was a spy.

3097
01:46:45,175 --> 01:46:48,084
(Cheol Yong's Instagram account)

3098
01:46:48,085 --> 01:46:49,085
I knew that I didn't like him.

3099
01:46:49,086 --> 01:46:50,261
"An account for checking out the desserts."

3100
01:46:50,285 --> 01:46:51,384
- "I dream of opening a business." - "I dream of opening a business."

3101
01:46:51,385 --> 01:46:52,614
- Let's follow him. - Okay.

3102
01:46:52,615 --> 01:46:54,524
(A recent post)

3103
01:46:54,525 --> 01:46:56,125
Hold on. In that case...

3104
01:46:56,485 --> 01:46:57,485
"It was busy helping them."

3105
01:46:57,486 --> 01:46:58,554
- What? It's mine! - What?

3106
01:46:58,555 --> 01:47:00,024
- He took my slippers! - What? It's our laptop!

3107
01:47:00,025 --> 01:47:01,465
- Eun Ji, it's our laptop! - What?

3108
01:47:01,825 --> 01:47:04,024
Hey, he took the case...

3109
01:47:04,025 --> 01:47:05,534
for my Yang Hee Eun glasses!

3110
01:47:05,535 --> 01:47:07,055
(The case for my Yang Hee Eun glasses)

3111
01:47:07,635 --> 01:47:10,535
(It's shocking news.)

3112
01:47:11,035 --> 01:47:13,375
What? It's mine! He took my slippers!

3113
01:47:13,775 --> 01:47:15,044
- Hold on. - What?

3114
01:47:15,045 --> 01:47:16,944
- Yu Jin, it's your bag. - Mimi, hurry up and...

3115
01:47:16,945 --> 01:47:17,945
- It's your bag. - No!

3116
01:47:17,946 --> 01:47:19,815
Was he a spy?

3117
01:47:21,085 --> 01:47:22,685
Was Cheol Yong a spy?

3118
01:47:23,315 --> 01:47:24,454
(I'm preparing porridge.)

3119
01:47:24,455 --> 01:47:26,915
(Another post)

3120
01:47:27,085 --> 01:47:28,725
Do you know why he's the absolute worst?

3121
01:47:29,085 --> 01:47:31,224
He was so nice to us.

3122
01:47:31,225 --> 01:47:32,624
He was a psychopath.

3123
01:47:32,625 --> 01:47:33,625
He did this to us.

3124
01:47:33,626 --> 01:47:36,195
- He did this to our backs. - That's what we had yesterday.

3125
01:47:36,795 --> 01:47:41,464
(His friendly demeanor hid his true intention.)

3126
01:47:41,465 --> 01:47:43,965
(Just you wait, amateur agents.)

3127
01:47:45,005 --> 01:47:49,005
(He appeared to be kind and shy.)

3128
01:47:51,375 --> 01:47:55,515
(Cheol Yong's true identity was...)

3129
01:47:57,315 --> 01:48:00,915
(a double agent who was sent by Torong.)

3130
01:48:01,085 --> 01:48:02,184
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3131
01:48:02,185 --> 01:48:03,784
- Thank you. - It looks delicious.

3132
01:48:03,785 --> 01:48:07,425
(While the members were absorbed in fried chicken, )

3133
01:48:07,925 --> 01:48:11,165
(he stole the items in a bold manner.)

3134
01:48:11,535 --> 01:48:13,765
(Signature gesture)

3135
01:48:14,565 --> 01:48:16,705
(Happy)

3136
01:48:18,205 --> 01:48:25,245
(Vlogging during a theft)

3137
01:48:25,675 --> 01:48:27,044
(Waddling)

3138
01:48:27,045 --> 01:48:28,115
(Bowing)

3139
01:48:28,945 --> 01:48:32,185
(He took a bus to the airport.)

3140
01:48:34,055 --> 01:48:38,355
(He dreams of running away to Lisbon!)

3141
01:48:38,395 --> 01:48:39,624
Did Young Ji have a nightmare...

3142
01:48:39,625 --> 01:48:40,854
- after eating the porridge? - Eun Ji.

3143
01:48:40,855 --> 01:48:42,325
Eun Ji, I don't care about that.

3144
01:48:42,495 --> 01:48:44,535
I need to hurry up and find Yang Hee Eun's glasses.

3145
01:48:44,765 --> 01:48:45,964
- Please. - It's okay.

3146
01:48:45,965 --> 01:48:47,234
- We need to hurry. Please. - I think he's nearby.

3147
01:48:47,235 --> 01:48:49,104
What are we supposed to do? Eun Ji.

3148
01:48:49,105 --> 01:48:52,605
I should've known. That was why he gave us food without complaining.

3149
01:48:52,805 --> 01:48:54,105
We need to hurry.

3150
01:48:54,445 --> 01:48:57,104
- Yang Hee Eun! - Oh, no.

3151
01:48:57,105 --> 01:48:58,644
- Yang Hee Eun! - What are we going to do?

3152
01:48:58,645 --> 01:48:59,745
Cheol Yong!

3153
01:49:00,175 --> 01:49:01,285
Yang Hee Eun!

3154
01:49:05,985 --> 01:49:09,484
(This is the beginning of an epic.)

3155
01:49:09,485 --> 01:49:10,524
(Abu Dhabi, obtained the recipe for the gold coffee)

3156
01:49:10,525 --> 01:49:11,525
(Moved on February 22)

3157
01:49:11,526 --> 01:49:13,366
(Lisbon, obtained the recipe for the egg tart)

3158
01:49:21,765 --> 01:49:24,900
(See you in Lisbon.)

3159
01:49:24,974 --> 01:49:26,734
(Next week)

3160
01:49:26,834 --> 01:49:29,343
(The betrayed agents' new goal)

3161
01:49:29,344 --> 01:49:31,373
(Disguise yourselves as backpackers...)

3162
01:49:31,374 --> 01:49:32,813
(and infiltrate Lisbon.)

3163
01:49:32,814 --> 01:49:33,814
(Give us backpacks.)
(For free?)

3164
01:49:34,815 --> 01:49:36,583
(5 backpacks have been prepared.)

3165
01:49:36,584 --> 01:49:38,084
(The worst one is a plastic bag.)

3166
01:49:38,184 --> 01:49:40,213
(Reverse Perfect Pitch)

3167
01:49:40,214 --> 01:49:42,523
(Original Perfect Pitch)

3168
01:49:42,524 --> 01:49:47,894
(Reverse Perfect Pitch)

3169
01:49:47,994 --> 01:49:50,464
(The woman of interest will challenge herself.)

3170
01:49:50,564 --> 01:49:52,533
(Su, su)

3171
01:49:52,534 --> 01:49:53,534
(Super)

3172
01:49:53,535 --> 01:49:55,263
(It's a disaster.)

3173
01:49:55,264 --> 01:49:58,973
(They can't get over it.)

3174
01:49:58,974 --> 01:50:01,004
(I told you that I was in your care!)

3175
01:50:01,104 --> 01:50:03,674
(It all depends on Mimi, the worst player.)

3176
01:50:03,774 --> 01:50:06,313
(What will be their backpack for Lisbon?)

3177
01:50:06,314 --> 01:50:07,373
(The Buldak ramyeon cook...)

3178
01:50:07,374 --> 01:50:08,413
(with 24 years of experience, Young Ji)

3179
01:50:08,414 --> 01:50:10,060
(The ramyeon master with 24 years of experience in the variety shows)

3180
01:50:10,084 --> 01:50:12,114
(A match of pride between the two ramyeon experts)

3181
01:50:12,214 --> 01:50:14,214
(The ending time of digital detox is on the line.)

3182
01:50:14,254 --> 01:50:17,054
(They'll have one fierce match.)

3183
01:50:17,154 --> 01:50:18,753
(Isn't it seriously tasty?)

3184
01:50:18,754 --> 01:50:20,224
(Nodding)

3185
01:50:20,394 --> 01:50:22,424
(The betrayal of the teammates she trusted)

3186
01:50:22,524 --> 01:50:24,533
(Things turn more intense.)

3187
01:50:24,534 --> 01:50:26,994
(Will she be able to get her phone back?)

3188
01:50:27,094 --> 01:50:29,764
(The second destination, Lisbon)

3189
01:50:29,964 --> 01:50:32,634
(The backpacking haven unfolds on a hill.)

3190
01:50:32,734 --> 01:50:34,934
(Since it's the romantic city that represents Europe, )

3191
01:50:35,004 --> 01:50:38,974
(they get more good cheer.)

3192
01:50:39,044 --> 01:50:44,214
(Their love for each other deepens.)

3193
01:50:44,314 --> 01:50:47,784
(The E-cade members' first backpacking trip)

3194
01:50:47,884 --> 01:50:51,023
(Their story in Lisbon is coming soon.)

3195
01:50:51,024 --> 01:50:58,264
(She briefly gets her phone back to show Yang Hee Eun's text.)

3196
01:51:02,064 --> 01:51:03,064
"Who is this?"

3197
01:51:03,065 --> 01:51:05,974
"Yang Hee Eun. I checked your number."

3198
01:51:08,274 --> 01:51:09,974
"I'm picking out your glasses."

3199
01:51:10,374 --> 01:51:12,974
"Hee Eun, I was joking. But I'll be grateful."

3200
01:51:13,444 --> 01:51:16,984
"I collected them one at a time whenever I went abroad."

3201
01:51:17,084 --> 01:51:20,084
"A pair costs 1,000 dollars, so wear them with care..."

3202
01:51:20,184 --> 01:51:21,324
"and keep them clean."

3203
01:51:21,424 --> 01:51:23,260
"Also, Young Ji, I don't give empty promises."

3204
01:51:23,284 --> 01:51:25,330
"When I promise to give something, I follow through."

3205
01:51:25,354 --> 01:51:27,624
"Wear the four pairs and send me photos."

3206
01:51:28,024 --> 01:51:30,664
"These are about 500 dollars per pair."

3207
01:51:32,594 --> 01:51:35,634
I sent her these photos.

3208
01:51:36,564 --> 01:51:40,034
She cherishes those glasses.

3209
01:51:40,204 --> 01:51:41,344
Give them back.

3210
01:51:44,204 --> 01:51:45,644
Torong took them.
