00:00:12,874 --> 00:00:14,544
(Previously)

3
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,474
(To meet Agent F,)

4
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,814
(they set off to the training center.)

5
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:19,984
(Vroom, vroom! Let's go!)

6
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:21,484
(Agent F is running...)

7
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:23,354
(the agents' lodging...)

8
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:24,924
(and the training center next to it.)

9
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:27,454
(As-salamu alaykum)

10
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:28,924
(What was the identity of Agent F that surprised the members?)

11
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:31,594
My name is...

12
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:33,464
(Cheol Yong, Fe-dragon, Manager of the Abu Dhabi branch)

13
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:35,434
(Despite looking clumsy,)

14
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:37,334
(Cheol Yong will give the members a lot of help.)

15
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:39,234
(After the awkward first meeting,)

16
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:40,804
(it was time to train.)

17
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:43,834
(They warmed up their bodies through the underwater training.)

18
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:45,074
(Then came the meal training.)

19
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,104
(For the Middle Eastern dinner, they had...)

20
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,374
(a music quiz.)

21
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:50,174
(Team Loudies, Team Quieties)

22
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:52,584
- "S-Class" by Stray Kids. - Correct.

23
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:56,484
(Quieties took the lead.)

24
00:00:57,214 --> 00:01:00,524
(It was like a festival.)

25
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:03,294
(Different atmosphere)

26
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:05,564
(I don't know.)

27
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:07,094
(What's the title?)

28
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:08,794
(A series of incorrect answers made her teammate suffer.)

29
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:10,234
(No, you can do it. Mimi, you can do it.)

30
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:11,764
(Young Ji comforted her warmly.)

31
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:13,604
("Women's Generation" by Gardasil)

32
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:15,804
(She made a new record for the legendary incorrect answer.)

33
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:18,374
(Her team lost the last dish.)

34
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:19,874
(It's time for Quieties' chicken meal.)

35
00:01:19,874 --> 00:01:21,574
- I'll begin eating then. - It must be delicious.

36
00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:23,914
- It's a bit cold, right? - It has been roasted well.

37
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:25,414
Gosh, it's hot.

38
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:26,814
Is it hot?

39
00:01:26,814 --> 00:01:27,914
- No. - She's acting.

40
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:28,954
(Laughing)

41
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,984
(Young Ji was totally fooled.)

42
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:33,084
She's the K-mime president.

43
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:34,624
Gosh, it's hot.

44
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:36,624
(A mime dinner show)

45
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:37,824
Gosh, why is it so hot?

46
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:40,124
- Hey. - It looks hot.

47
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:41,164
It's hot.

48
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:42,634
(She brings her hands to her ears for details.)

49
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:44,764
- She's really good. - Yes. She's good.

50
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:46,704
(Absorbed)

51
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:49,804
Gosh, it's hot. Hey, it's hot.

52
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:52,544
It isn't chicken we're used to.

53
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:55,274
It absorbed the tandoori sauce.

54
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:57,474
- It's tasty. - Right. It looks tasty.

55
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,944
- Is it very hot? - It's very hot.

56
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:01,244
- Be careful. - Be careful.

57
00:02:01,244 --> 00:02:02,454
(Blowing)

58
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:03,854
(Gosh!)
(Did you see that?)

59
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,184
She burned her fingers.

60
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:07,184
(This audience member is satisfied.)

61
00:02:07,984 --> 00:02:09,654
- It's hot. - Be careful.

62
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:11,594
- Be careful. - Eun Ji, how did you eat it?

63
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:13,424
(Even the mime president is satisfied.)

64
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:14,694
(Dejected)

65
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:16,364
- Shall we try it too? - Shall we try it?

66
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:17,394
"Shall we try it too?"

67
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:18,464
(They mime with their cold bread.)

68
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:20,434
(Heat comes out of the bread that can't be hot.)

69
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,034
(Bluetooth heat)

70
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:24,634
(An excessive performance)

71
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:25,704
It's hot.

72
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:27,904
It's hot. You'll hurt your teeth.

73
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:29,344
It's hot.

74
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:30,574
(Let go of me. Don't stop me.)

75
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:32,414
(Meanwhile, Yu Jin takes a bite of the chicken.)

76
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:34,684
- It's hot. It's tasty, right? - It's tasty.

77
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:37,614
This chicken is really tasty. Seriously.

78
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:39,154
Mimi, don't look.

79
00:02:39,154 --> 00:02:40,654
We came all the way to the United Arab Emirates.

80
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,594
(Feeling sad on many levels)

81
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:43,854
Would you give us the desserts?

82
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:45,994
- It's time for the desserts. - Okay. Bring them in.

83
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:48,664
Shall we check out the first dessert?

84
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,594
Here comes the first dessert.

85
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:52,564
(Here it comes.)

86
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:53,634
Mimi.

87
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:55,204
Isn't it creme brulee?

88
00:02:55,204 --> 00:02:56,574
- Pistachio? - It's pistachio.

89
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:58,774
- It's umm ali. - Umm ali?

90
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:00,544
I like the name.

91
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:04,044
(The name means, "A dessert made by Ali's mom.")

92
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:08,354
(Bread gets baked like a pudding in sweet condensed milk.)

93
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:11,954
(The texture is soft like baby food with the crispy nuts.)

94
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:16,054
(Umm ali)

95
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:17,654
No way.

96
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:18,794
- It looks homely. - Thank you.

97
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,824
Mimi, it's bound to be tasty.

98
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:22,334
- You can tell by looking. - Yes.

99
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,334
It's no joke.

100
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:25,664
- What do you think? - It's nutty.

101
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:26,934
- Is it nutty? - It's very nutty and sweet.

102
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:28,474
Do you want to eat it? Are you motivated now?

103
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:30,174
- I've always been motivated. - Right.

104
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:32,804
I just can't do as well as I want to do.

105
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:34,674
Right. You can't do well just because you're motivated.

106
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:38,384
Who wants to pick this time?

107
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:41,544
- Shall I pick it? - Sure.

108
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:42,984
- Young Ji, let's go. - Hold on.

109
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:44,554
- I'm sorry, but... - What?

110
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:45,724
Don't be so unenthusiastic...

111
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:46,754
- since you're full. - It isn't like that.

112
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:47,754
- It isn't like that. - Okay.

113
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:49,754
- Eun Ji doesn't know either. - It's okay.

114
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:50,894
For goodness' sake.

115
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:53,524
(Round 8, 2001 to 2005)

116
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,594
It's this time period again.

117
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,594
This is the time period Eun Ji knows well.

118
00:03:56,764 --> 00:03:57,934
Manager Lee Yong Su.

119
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:01,634
(Eun Ji was in the higher grades in the elementary school back then.)

120
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:02,974
Quieties.

121
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:05,944
Of course, she knows. Quieties.

122
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:07,244
"Joolae" by Lee Jung Hyun.

123
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:08,714
- Correct. - Is that the song?

124
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:09,714
("Joolae" by Lee Jung Hyun)

125
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:11,814
- Is that the song? - I like this song.

126
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:15,214
(She answered the question at high speed again.)

127
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,654
It's the Doll Dance. You have to dance like a doll.

128
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:18,654
- It's this dance. - That's right.
(The original dance)

129
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:22,954
(Everyone copies the Mimi Doll and becomes a doll.)

130
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:25,694
(She sings with her nose.)

131
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:27,264
(She's more of a robot than a doll.)

132
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:28,464
The Doll Dance.

133
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:31,194
(Mimi knows all the dance moves.)

134
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:32,234
Good.

135
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:34,404
(The girl who was born in 2003 mimes to a song from 2000.)

136
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:35,804
Be like the Mimi Doll.

137
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:39,344
(Quieties will take the desserts as well.)

138
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:42,814
(They lose their energy after the song ends.)

139
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:45,214
What's the use...

140
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:46,484
What's the use of dancing diligently?

141
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:47,484
You need to get the song right.

142
00:04:47,484 --> 00:04:49,054
What's the use of dancing diligently?

143
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:52,154
Mimi is getting all the dances right.

144
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,954
- Shall we move on to the next one? - Only my sight is heightened.

145
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:56,224
(Round 8, 2nd song from 2001 to 2005)

146
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:00,924
Do you know the song?

147
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:02,964
(Mimi reacts right away.)

148
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:05,864
- It's okay. Keep listening. - What is it?

149
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:07,034
Mimi, are you raising your hand?

150
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:08,264
- No. - Keep listening.

151
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:10,834
(Waiting)

152
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:11,944
It sounds like your voice.

153
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,574
(The rhythm gets heightened.)

154
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:14,804
(Don't cry, it's all in the past)

155
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:15,974
It's all in the past

156
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:18,814
- You know... - Don't cry, it's all in the past

157
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:19,914
(The woman who's crying again)

158
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:22,284
- You need to cry while smiling. - It's like a message to me.

159
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:23,614
(A very big hint)

160
00:05:24,254 --> 00:05:25,854
- I don't know the singer. - Don't you know the singer?

161
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:26,984
I don't know the singer.

162
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:28,454
Just take a wild guess.

163
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:29,654
(Judging from her past behaviors,)

164
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:30,894
(there's a 90-percent chance she doesn't know the title as well.)

165
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,024
- The singer... - Why do I know this song?

166
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:36,764
(Don't do this)

167
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:39,734
(Don't do this)

168
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,374
(Even Young Ji knows the ballad song.)

169
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,974
(She goes into the full music show mode.)

170
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:47,074
The title... Hold on.

171
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:48,074
(Here come Yu Jin's shoulders.)

172
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:49,814
Let me... Loudies.

173
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:51,884
- Loudies. - Loudies.

174
00:05:52,244 --> 00:05:53,244
Fin.K.L.

175
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:55,684
(She disregarded the man's voice in the intro.)

176
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:56,984
Come on.

177
00:05:57,354 --> 00:05:58,784
I have no idea.

178
00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:00,484
- The song title. - What's the song title?

179
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:02,054
"Please Don't Do This, Okay?"

180
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:03,094
Incorrect.

181
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:04,094
(No.)

182
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:05,724
Who are you talking to?

183
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:06,994
Mi Hyun.

184
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:09,094
- Does the song sound familiar? - Totally.

185
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:10,464
I know who it is.

186
00:06:11,494 --> 00:06:13,164
It sounds like Mi Hyun's voice.

187
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:17,034
(She focuses on the voice that's similar to hers.)

188
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:18,574
Doesn't it sound like Mi Hyun's voice?

189
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:20,374
(Quieties also don't have a clue except for Eun Ji.)

190
00:06:20,374 --> 00:06:21,774
"I love you. I love you so much."

191
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:24,274
(Totally focused)

192
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:25,444
It's like crying while smiling.

193
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:26,714
- I have a question. - Eun Ji, hold on.

194
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:29,284
- Can I ask a question? - A question?

195
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:30,654
- A question? - Can I ask a question?

196
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:31,784
(Getting a grasp of the situation)

197
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:33,324
- A question? - Can I ask a question?

198
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:35,624
(They assemble.)

199
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:36,694
No?

200
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:38,294
- Can't I ask a question? - You can't ask a question.

201
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:39,494
(The K-comedy president shows a variety of charms.)

202
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:42,934
(Since when was there such a system?)

203
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:44,064
- I mean, the question... - Hold on.

204
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:45,094
- Hold on. - Let's hear it.

205
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:46,904
- Why would you ask a question? - Don't talk among yourselves.

206
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:48,234
Don't find it strange.

207
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:49,734
- It's Mimi. - Let's hear it.

208
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,674
- Let's hear the question. - What do you want to know?

209
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:53,174
Do the lyrics contain the song title?

210
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:54,644
No, the lyrics don't contain the song title.

211
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:55,644
You need to guess.

212
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:57,074
- I see. Okay. - Okay. Me.

213
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:58,744
- Loudies. - Loudies.

214
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:00,384
- Loudies. - Sharp's...

215
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:02,354
- Sharp's... - "A Cup of Coffee."

216
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:04,314
(Sharp's "A Cup of Coffee")

217
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:05,484
It's something like that. Incorrect.

218
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:06,624
- Loudies. - Loudies.

219
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:08,224
- Sharp's "Two Cups of Coffee." - Sharp's...

220
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:10,824
- Incorrect. - You know,

221
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:12,324
- I really want to get it right. - Something like "A Cup of Coffee."

222
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:15,434
Hold on. I know this.

223
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:19,064
- What? - Why did you suddenly do that?

224
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:21,304
(She struck a strange pose without thinking.)

225
00:07:22,104 --> 00:07:23,534
All of them...

226
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:25,274
- became strange. - Seriously.

227
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:28,344
(Please don't do this)

228
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:31,014
(Released in 2003, the song enters everyone's mind in winter.)

229
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:32,514
(It's "My Lips... Like Warm Coffee...")

230
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:34,814
(by Sharp, a 4-member co-ed group.)

231
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:38,354
Joy sang this song at year-end.

232
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:39,354
That's right.

233
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:42,724
Where are you going?

234
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:43,724
Loudies.

235
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:46,394
- Sharp's... - Sharp's...

236
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:47,464
"Espresso."

237
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:48,934
(Sharp's "Espresso")

238
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,294
What am I supposed to do?

239
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:51,934
Incorrect.

240
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:54,264
- The title is a bit long. - It's long.

241
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:55,534
"Espresso." "Caramel Macchiato."

242
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:57,074
Me! An Yu Jin.

243
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:58,174
- An Yu Jin. - Hold on.

244
00:07:58,174 --> 00:07:59,404
"Caramel Macchiato."

245
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:01,404
- Quieties. - Quieties.

246
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:04,114
Sharp's "You're Like the Scent of Coffee."

247
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:05,344
("You're Like the Scent of Coffee")

248
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:06,514
- Something like that, right? - Something like that.

249
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:07,684
- Something like that. - The title is something...

250
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:08,814
- like that. Incorrect. - Loudies.

251
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:09,914
Loudies.

252
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,624
Sharp's "You're Like a Cup of Coffee in Cool Summer."

253
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,824
("You're Like a Cup of Coffee in Cool Summer")

254
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:15,854
What am I supposed to do?

255
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:17,024
(This isn't an essay contest.)

256
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:18,424
- What am I supposed to do? - What was that?

257
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,864
Shouldn't it be longer?

258
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:22,194
- Please don't do this - All right.

259
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:24,494
- Don't say that this is the end - "Blank," ellipsis,

260
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:26,434
"Like Warm Coffee."

261
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:28,004
- Loudies. - Loudies.

262
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:29,474
- "She Is..." - "She Is..."

263
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:31,504
"Like Warm Coffee."

264
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:33,044
- Correct. - Nice approach.

265
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:34,144
- Quieties. - Was it okay?

266
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:35,144
Quieties.

267
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:37,074
"We Are..."

268
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:38,744
No?

269
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:39,744
- "We Are..." - Incorrect.

270
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:40,814
- Go ahead. - Sharp.

271
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:42,314
- What? - That came out wrong.

272
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,084
- Excuse me. - Loudies.

273
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:45,654
I'm sorry, but are you here for the bathhouse?

274
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:47,924
Miss, are you here for the sauna?

275
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:49,194
- Loudies. - Miss.

276
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:50,494
- Loudies. - Loudies.

277
00:08:50,494 --> 00:08:51,494
"Lovers Are."

278
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:52,924
- "Lovers Are..." - What?

279
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:54,194
- "Like Warm Coffee." - "Like Warm Coffee."

280
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:55,634
- Incorrect. - Incorrect.

281
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:57,234
I think you're close to the answer.

282
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:59,304
Let's sit down now.

283
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,404
- Okay. - Let's sit down now.

284
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:02,734
The last hint.

285
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,734
- I think we'll get a huge hint. - All right.

286
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:06,204
- Listen to the rap part carefully. - Here it comes.

287
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:07,244
Let's sit down.

288
00:09:07,674 --> 00:09:09,844
(So that my lips will be warm even for a moment)

289
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:12,514
- Quieties! - Quieties!

290
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:15,454
"My Lips... Like Warm Coffee."

291
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,014
- "My Lips... Like Warm Coffee." - Producer Na gave us everything.

292
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:20,224
Correct.

293
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:21,924
Producer Na gave us everything.

294
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,794
He didn't leave anything behind.

295
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:24,924
(A kiss of consolation)

296
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:26,664
(My lips)

297
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:28,464
It really sounds like your voice.

298
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:31,034
(Her voice is similar to that of Seo Ji Young, a Sharp member.)

299
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:32,504
(Puppy An enters the main stage.)

300
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:33,764
(Ta-da)

301
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:34,904
(Quieties have the perfect win.)

302
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:37,574
Did they get everything right? They got everything right.

303
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:40,744
I've been playing with seriousness.

304
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:43,274
Please.

305
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:45,244
(Somewhere between Munch and sadness)

306
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:47,784
- I have a favor to ask. - Okay.

307
00:09:47,784 --> 00:09:49,554
Would you give us a new fork and spoon?

308
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,484
(I can't watch this.)

309
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:53,524
(Quieties takes umm ali.)

310
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:56,224
Those two don't need them.

311
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,324
Their eating utensils are new.

312
00:09:58,154 --> 00:09:59,894
(Sure thing.)

313
00:10:00,324 --> 00:10:01,464
Easy.

314
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:03,494
Shall we eat?

315
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,364
Why don't our years overlap?

316
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:07,734
(She becomes interested in the other table's conversation.)

317
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:10,304
I know the songs from 2021 to 2025.

318
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:13,044
I can cover the songs from 2017 or 2016.

319
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,004
But you know the songs until 2010.

320
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,414
The years don't overlap.

321
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:18,574
(There's a 5-year gap between them.)

322
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:19,644
What are we supposed to do?

323
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:22,314
It's my absolute favorite style of dessert.

324
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:25,524
(Eun Ji takes a spoonful in an elegant manner.)

325
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:27,984
(Yu Jin takes a spoonful as well.)

326
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:29,724
(Nodding)

327
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:31,224
Eun Ji, does it suit your taste?

328
00:10:31,224 --> 00:10:32,464
Totally.

329
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:35,564
It's like eating the Ace crackers...

330
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:37,694
by soaking them in a snack.

331
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:39,104
- Coffee, you mean. - In coffee.

332
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:42,904
We ate the Ace crackers by soaking them in instant coffee.

333
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,434
It's like that.

334
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:45,944
- Sponge cake. - It's so soft.

335
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:47,074
Let me tell you what it's like.

336
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:49,214
The texture is so soft.

337
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:50,674
(It's so tasty.)

338
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:51,974
And...

339
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,984
I don't know how to describe the cream.

340
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:55,454
I'll tell you after another bite.

341
00:10:57,854 --> 00:11:02,224
(They got mocked in their faces.)

342
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:05,464
The nuts make it nutty.

343
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:07,024
- Yes. - There are nuts.

344
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:09,964
Why do you think we fail? I really want to know.

345
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:12,064
Why do we fail?

346
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:13,404
How many dishes have there been? Ten?

347
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:14,964
Why did we fail each and every time?

348
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:16,874
We can't take a single win...

349
00:11:16,974 --> 00:11:19,004
unless we cheat.

350
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:21,104
We can't take a single win.

351
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:23,574
(Their cute complaint makes her chuckle.)

352
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:26,344
You should see the food first, right?

353
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:27,714
- Yes. - Please bring in the dish.

354
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:29,314
This is...

355
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,484
- a dessert anyone would like. - Is it something like carrot cake?

356
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:34,784
- Mimi, this is it. - It looks tasty.

357
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:37,254
- It's chocolate fondant. - Yes. Chocolate fondue.

358
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,824
("Fondant" means "To melt" in French.)

359
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:43,894
(It's a spongy cake with the crispy outside.)

360
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:46,004
(But the inside is molten.)

361
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:48,404
(It's sweet chocolate.)

362
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:53,074
(Chocolate fondant)

363
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:54,804
- Here. - Gosh.

364
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:56,414
You probably can't smell it, but... Can you smell it?

365
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,244
- It's a strong vanilla scent. - Vanilla.

366
00:11:58,244 --> 00:11:59,344
- Ice cream. - This is driving me crazy.

367
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,714
- Vanilla bean. - It's ice cream.

368
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:02,184
- I think the inside is... - It looks delicious.

369
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:03,384
molten chocolate.

370
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:04,954
Once you open it, chocolate will pour out.

371
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:07,254
- Yes. You eat it with ice cream. - We have to eat this one.

372
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:08,994
- I'll make sure you eat it. - My goodness.

373
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:12,764
- Shall I pick it this time? - Yes, Manager Lee Yong Su.

374
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:13,824
(The K-pop stele picks the time period.)

375
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:14,864
- You can do it, Mimi. - Yes.

376
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:16,434
We're invincible. We're fully awake.

377
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,494
- I'll do my best. - Okay.

378
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:19,564
It's the most cutthroat time period.

379
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,534
- It's 2011 to 2015. - Okay. It's okay.

380
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:22,604
- Mimi. - Totally.

381
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:24,304
- It's the gap between us. - Yes.

382
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:25,304
- Hey. - Exactly.

383
00:12:25,304 --> 00:12:27,174
It's like the Bermuda Triangle.

384
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:29,244
- The intersection. - Yes.

385
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:31,244
(The first question)

386
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:32,514
Loudies.

387
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:33,744
(Young Ji shouts out the team name as soon as the music starts.)

388
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:34,984
EXO's "Love Me Right."

389
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:36,684
(Surprised)

390
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:37,854
Correct.

391
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,454
What a match.

392
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:41,954
(This is a runway on the road)

393
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:44,094
(Sliding back)

394
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:46,064
(A photo with the stele)

395
00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:48,194
(Moving to the lady to her right)

396
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:50,834
(You're my entire universe)

397
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:52,304
(Enjoying the performance)

398
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,334
They're good.

399
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:54,804
(This isn't the Random Play Dance.)

400
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:55,874
- Let's go. - Love me right

401
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:58,734
You're my entire universe

402
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:00,404
You're my entire universe, Kim Mi Hyun.

403
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:03,044
(A touching confession of love)

404
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:04,214
Will you be okay?

405
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:06,114
- Will you be okay with me? - I believe in you.

406
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:08,244
She only listened to a bit of the intro.

407
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:10,284
(Eun Ji was surprised by Young Ji.)

408
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:13,624
- Quieties. - Quieties.

409
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:15,084
It's 2PM's "My House."

410
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,754
- It's 2PM's "My House." - Take you home tonight

411
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:18,154
- Correct. - It's your song.

412
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:19,864
(Missing the answer numerous times)

413
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,664
(After Young Ji, Eun Ji answered at high speed.)

414
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:24,034
(The idols quickly find the cameras for the solo shot.)

415
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:27,204
(They're inviting people to the housewarming party.)

416
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:31,304
(This member has nothing to do with "My House.")

417
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:36,244
(She's either doing the dance or freestyling.)

418
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:38,144
(When she doesn't know the dance, she lip-syncs.)

419
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:41,014
(They do the signature dance move clearly.)

420
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:42,754
Mimi, are you okay with this flow?

421
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:44,954
- This flow? - Is it okay? Is it bad?

422
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:47,654
Whether it's bad or not, you have no choice.

423
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:48,654
You have to go.

424
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:50,494
There's no going back.

425
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:51,824
Which one of you got the last question right?

426
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:52,964
- Eun Ji did. - Okay.

427
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,964
(Round 9, 3rd song from 2011 to 2015)

428
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:00,004
- Mimi. - I know this song.

429
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:01,064
Hold on.

430
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:02,334
- Mimi. - Hold on.

431
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:05,234
Quieties. Ailee's "I Will Show You."

432
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:07,744
Quieties. Ailee's "I Will Show You."

433
00:14:08,104 --> 00:14:09,214
- It's correct. - Correct.

434
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:11,644
(She shows them even before the music comes out.)

435
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:13,544
(Mimi fails without a chance to show anything.)

436
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:17,954
(I will show you that I have completely changed)

437
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:20,654
(What was the use of answering quickly?)

438
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:25,094
(Let's enjoy her solo performance.)

439
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:26,924
(An apologetic hug)

440
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:29,094
(She has strong core muscles.)

441
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:30,734
(She's good!)

442
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:32,664
(Copying the youngest member)

443
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,734
Young Ji, I'm sorry.

444
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:35,874
You know,

445
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,104
Yu Jin's shoulder shimmy got an upgrade.

446
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:39,444
- Yes. - Look at that.

447
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:41,244
(An encore performance)

448
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:42,274
Like this.

449
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:43,974
Young Ji should eat something.

450
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:47,044
(Young Ji drags Mimi without a word.)

451
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:48,884
I'll have a 1-on-1 match against Kim Mi Hyun.

452
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:51,814
I'm serious.

453
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:53,484
I'll have a 1-on-1 match against her.

454
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,324
Can you give the winner a bite then?

455
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:56,554
- Of course. - Okay.

456
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:58,154
It'll be funny if you get this right.

457
00:14:58,324 --> 00:15:00,024
- Hold on. - Let's begin.

458
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:02,024
Kim Mi Hyun versus Lee Young JI.

459
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:03,494
- Okay. - Let's begin.

460
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:04,664
(Round 9, Loudies' 1-on-1 from 2011 to 2015)

461
00:15:06,634 --> 00:15:07,804
Kim Mi Hyun.

462
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:11,434
Kim Mi Hyun.

463
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:14,074
- No way. - Come on.

464
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,914
(Her reaction speed was faster than usual.)

465
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:18,047
Kim Mi Hyun versus Lee Young JI.

466
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,277
- Okay. - Let's begin.

467
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:20,647
(Round 9, Loudies' 1-on-1 from 2011 to 2015)

468
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:23,717
Kim Mi Hyun.

469
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:27,487
Kim Mi Hyun.

470
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:30,157
- No way. - Come on.

471
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:32,027
(Her reaction speed was faster than usual.)

472
00:15:32,157 --> 00:15:33,797
No way.

473
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:35,797
I don't know what to do.

474
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,027
Don't pretend not to know it. Just get it right.

475
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:39,397
- Just go ahead and answer. - Three, two, one.

476
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:41,597
It's 4MINUTE's "What's Your Name?"

477
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:42,637
Correct.

478
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:44,737
Correct.

479
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:46,277
(Young Ji only ate fish...)

480
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:47,707
(despite answering 6 questions in 9 rounds.)

481
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:49,277
(Mimi won in a 1-on-1 match...)

482
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:50,447
(despite answering 2 questions in 9 rounds.)

483
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:52,517
What's up with you?

484
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,317
You knew all the answers, right?

485
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:56,747
Don't you know all the answers?

486
00:15:57,587 --> 00:16:00,357
(Walking through in a cool way)

487
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:02,627
Mimi, hurry up and eat it. You need to hurry up.

488
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:03,657
It's so tasty.

489
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:04,657
(She gets drawn to the chocolate fondant.)

490
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:06,597
- Take a bite. - Try some ice cream.

491
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,057
Young Ji should've won.

492
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:12,067
(Solitude in a crowd)

493
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:13,567
Take a seat.

494
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,867
- Young Ji. - Take a bite.

495
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:18,007
- Take a bite. - It's really tasty.

496
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:20,707
- Young Ji should've won. - This is fun.

497
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:23,147
I never thought...

498
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:24,547
that she'd get it right.

499
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:26,477
She even picked up...

500
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:28,447
- the spoon... - Try some ice cream.

501
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,217
- right now. - She's already there.

502
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:32,447
- She dug it in the fondant. - Have a spoonful.

503
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:33,657
(Warm heart and not-so-warm stomach)

504
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:34,757
Have a spoonful.

505
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:37,027
Is it tasty?

506
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:39,457
I told you that I'd make sure you ate it.

507
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,227
I kept my promise.

508
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:45,267
- It's 3 against 1 now. - I didn't...

509
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,037
(A new member of Quieties)

510
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:49,507
This team is meaningless.

511
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:50,937
(They enjoy the dessert despite gaining a new team member.)

512
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:52,107
- Did you not answer on purpose? - It's so tasty.

513
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:53,307
No. I'm serious.

514
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:54,777
She answered correctly after an hour and a half.

515
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:57,847
Her guilt must've piled up during an hour and a half.

516
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:00,247
But she overcame everything. It's okay, Mimi.

517
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:02,787
- It was fun. - It was so tasty.

518
00:17:03,547 --> 00:17:05,347
I told you that I'd let you eat it. Look at that. Did you see that?

519
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,357
- You know... - Hold on a second. Seriously.

520
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:10,427
I can't stand it anymore.

521
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:12,757
- What do you mean? - She drank Mi Hyun's soft drink.

522
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:14,527
- What? - Seriously,

523
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:17,127
I can't stand your antics anymore.

524
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,497
Who cares if you were born in 2003?

525
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,137
Who cares if there are tens of millions of DIVE members?

526
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:21,367
I can't stand them anymore.

527
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:23,867
Until when will you behave that way?

528
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:27,407
What was so upsetting?

529
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:28,577
I'll tell you what was upsetting.

530
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:30,647
Step one. She drank the soft drink.

531
00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:35,047
(The cross-examination is quite systematic.)

532
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:36,187
Step two.

533
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:37,787
She put it down like this.

534
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:40,717
- Her fingers were like this. - Let's use VAR.

535
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:41,787
- Mimi. - She just ended up taking it.

536
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:44,187
(Upset)

537
00:17:44,257 --> 00:17:45,657
I'm mad at you too.

538
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:47,327
(Resentful)

539
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:49,267
No one is on my side.

540
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:52,297
Seriously, I feel so victimized.

541
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,567
Ms. Yang Hee Eun, I feel so victimized.

542
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:57,737
You told me that I'd do well if I wore these glasses.

543
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,907
Why do I keep losing?

544
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,077
Please text me.

545
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:04,747
(Yang Hee Eun Ji will answer instead.)

546
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:09,987
- The lodging is far, right? - Yes. We need to walk for a while.

547
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:11,447
- Will you go back? - Yes.

548
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:15,657
(The sky turns orange.)

549
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,887
Eun Ji, I'm so tired.

550
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:20,827
The day seems long today.

551
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:23,597
Gosh, I'm tired.

552
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:27,597
(Yu Jin gets ready to sleep right away.)

553
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,037
(Meanwhile, Eun Ji and Young Ji are in the living room.)

554
00:18:29,037 --> 00:18:30,537
The blanket suits you well.

555
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:31,667
It's so warm, Eun Ji.

556
00:18:32,037 --> 00:18:34,877
Is "Hospital Playlist" a medical drama?

557
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:36,207
"Hospital Playlist" is a medical drama.

558
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:37,407
(Young Ji is curious about the drama she'll watch someday.)

559
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,077
They do music too.

560
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:40,517
That's right.

561
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:42,817
Many people pick "Hospital Playlist..."

562
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,247
- as the best drama in their lives. - That's right.

563
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:47,517
(In any case, it isn't the best drama in Young Ji's life.)

564
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:51,287
Which drama have you watched from the beginning to the end?

565
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:52,487
None.

566
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:54,927
- None. - The drama of your life.

567
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:56,667
None.

568
00:18:57,027 --> 00:18:59,067
For me, it's "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

569
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:01,337
So Ji Sub and...

570
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:04,007
- What was the actress's name? - Lim Soo Jung.

571
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:06,177
- She's so pretty in the drama. - I know.

572
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:08,207
What's "I'm Sorry, I Love You" about, Eun Ji?

573
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:09,847
"I'm Sorry, I Love You?"

574
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:13,177
In Australia, So Ji Sub...

575
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:17,787
(A 3-minute summary of "I'm Sorry, I Love You")

576
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:20,857
- There's an actress. - Okay.

577
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:23,427
She's an actress who used to be famous.

578
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:29,257
(Oh Deul Hee used to be a famous actress.)

579
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:32,427
She falls in love with a director who is a married man...

580
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:33,767
and becomes pregnant with twins.

581
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:35,737
She gives birth to the twins.

582
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:36,737
(Chuckling)

583
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:38,267
They get sent to an adoption agency.

584
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:39,877
(The twins get sent to an adoption agency.)

585
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:41,607
One of them gets adopted...

586
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,047
- and goes to Australia. - The boy.

587
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:44,877
That boy is So Ji Sub.

588
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:48,877
So Ji Sub struggles and lives on the streets...

589
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:50,717
like a homeless man.

590
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:52,647
- That explains the hairstyle. - There's a woman he loves.

591
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:55,257
(Oh Deul Hee, biological mom)

592
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:57,427
(Cha Moo Hyeok, adopted son)

593
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,227
Deul Hee thinks that the twins are dead.

594
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,297
- She begins... - Does she begin her life anew?

595
00:20:02,297 --> 00:20:04,327
She begins her life anew and adopts a boy.

596
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:06,237
- My goodness. - That boy is Chung Kyung Ho.

597
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:07,697
Okay. It's Chung Kyung Ho again.

598
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:14,107
(Oh Deul Hee's adoptive son, Choi Yoon)

599
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:17,147
(Job: Popular singer)

600
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:22,017
Lim Soo Jung is Chung Kyung Ho's stylist and best friend.

601
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:23,017
My goodness.

602
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:25,217
(Aren't you Choi Yoon's stylist?)

603
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:26,317
(Yes. Me?)

604
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:27,687
(Choi Yoon's performance is over.)

605
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:28,787
(Okay!)

606
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:30,287
Lim Soo Jung goes to Australia.

607
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:31,657
(Song Eun Chae goes to Australia because of Choi Yoon's schedule.)

608
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:34,727
In Australia, Lim Soo Jung gets lost.

609
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:37,197
(The legendary rainbow sweater appears then.)

610
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:41,837
She gets her passport and suitcase stolen.

611
00:20:41,997 --> 00:20:43,937
Since Cha Moo Hyeok is homeless,

612
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:45,737
he approaches her with the intention of making money off of her...

613
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,977
by selling her to a shady place.

614
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:49,847
But he ends up feeling bad for her.

615
00:20:50,107 --> 00:20:53,077
So he grabs her hand and the music goes, "Ta-da."

616
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:57,417
(She's talking about this scene.)

617
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,257
(Even the first meeting has...)

618
00:21:00,257 --> 00:21:02,587
(the exposition, rising action, complication, and climax.)

619
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,487
(The first meeting is too hard.)

620
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:10,067
He has lived with his girlfriend for many years.

621
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:13,397
(Cha Moo Hyeok's girlfriend, Moon Ji Young)

622
00:21:13,997 --> 00:21:14,997
Hey.

623
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:17,437
(Come here right now.)

624
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:18,967
She goes, "I'm sorry, Moo Hyeok."

625
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:22,077
"I prefer money over love."

626
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:24,347
- In Australia... - Does she go to another man?

627
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:26,317
She gets married to a foreigner.

628
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:28,247
She's a mafia boss.

629
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:29,917
There are gunshots.

630
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:37,057
(A gun gets fired at their wedding.)

631
00:21:37,057 --> 00:21:40,797
Instead of his girlfriend, Cha Moo Hyeok gets shot.

632
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:42,127
(He gets shot.)

633
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:48,997
He becomes terminally ill.

634
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,367
Determined to meet his mom before death, he comes to Korea.

635
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,877
He goes to see his mom.

636
00:21:55,437 --> 00:21:56,447
"My son."

637
00:21:57,247 --> 00:21:59,717
- She's living happily in a mansion. - Right.

638
00:22:01,247 --> 00:22:03,547
- He thought she'd be unhappy. - He thought she'd be unhappy.

639
00:22:03,547 --> 00:22:06,917
He thought she had put him up for adoption due to poverty,

640
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,117
- but that wasn't the case. - Only he struggled.

641
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:10,327
Only he struggled. It shocks him.

642
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:14,997
(He feels betrayed upon seeing his biological mom.)

643
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,927
Lim Soo Jung goes, "Did you come to Seoul to see me?"

644
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:19,067
- It's a cute misunderstanding. - Right.

645
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:21,637
(Episode 1)
(Episode 2)

646
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:23,767
(Episodes 3 and 4)

647
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,137
(Episodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15)

648
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:28,307
She wakes up and goes, "Right. I took a photo of him yesterday."

649
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:29,607
But it has been deleted.

650
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:31,377
- Why? - He wanted her to forget about him.

651
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:32,747
- Cha Moo Hyeok did that? - Yes.

652
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:33,877
Why did he do that?

653
00:22:34,217 --> 00:22:35,217
(Absorbed)

654
00:22:35,217 --> 00:22:36,347
Why did Cha Moo Hyeok do that?

655
00:22:36,717 --> 00:22:38,787
Cha Moo Hyeok rides a motorcycle...

656
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:41,117
- while bleeding from his nose. - That's right.

657
00:22:44,457 --> 00:22:45,527
Cha Moo Hyeok dies.

658
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:50,297
Then the music goes...

659
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:52,997
- Following the shadow - Is that "Snow Flower?"

660
00:22:53,697 --> 00:22:55,437
I really enjoyed "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

661
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:56,637
- It's good, right? - Five stars.

662
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:57,637
Thank you.

663
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,337
It's a masterpiece. It's on Wavve. Make sure to watch it.

664
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,437
I know the whole story now. I don't need to watch it.

665
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:03,377
I know the whole story now.

666
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:05,377
Eun Ji's summary was better than YouTube shorts.

667
00:23:06,207 --> 00:23:07,817
(A few days later)

668
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:10,147
All episodes of "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

669
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,747
No. I need to watch "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

670
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:16,857
No. Cha Moo Hyeok, don't die.

671
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:17,857
(Crying)

672
00:23:17,857 --> 00:23:20,357
(Completely absorbed in "I'm Sorry, I Love You")

673
00:23:20,957 --> 00:23:22,757
Imagine hearing that from someone you love.

674
00:23:22,757 --> 00:23:25,727
(All the members become absorbed in "I'm Sorry, I Love You.")

675
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:30,007
(They watch the drama nonstop from sunrise to sundown.)

676
00:23:30,237 --> 00:23:32,507
Where... Where's Episode Two?

677
00:23:32,507 --> 00:23:33,677
(Give me the next episode.)

678
00:23:34,477 --> 00:23:36,177
Eun Ji, it'll be perfect if we watch "I'm Sorry, I Love You" like this.

679
00:23:36,177 --> 00:23:37,677
- We'll cry. - "I'm Sorry, I Love You?"

680
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:41,247
Because of me, they became "I'm Sorry, I Love You" fanatics.

681
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:43,717
Yu Jin cried. Mimi cried. Young Ji cried.

682
00:23:43,717 --> 00:23:45,147
- Everyone cried. - Totally.

683
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:50,187
Why?

684
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,527
Is that the reason?

685
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:55,897
- Hey. - Yu Jin.

686
00:23:55,897 --> 00:23:57,027
Hey, you need to film a show.

687
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:58,497
(Even Eun Ji, who has watched it multiple times, cries too.)

688
00:23:58,497 --> 00:23:59,797
He's so pitiful.

689
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:02,497
(Bawling)

690
00:24:02,797 --> 00:24:03,907
(The end)

691
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:05,507
Let's stop it here.

692
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:06,907
- Eun Ji. - Let's stop it here.

693
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:08,207
No more.

694
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:11,207
- Why? - We need to get ready.

695
00:24:11,947 --> 00:24:14,117
- Why? - Where's the remote control?

696
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:16,347
- Why? - Come on!

697
00:24:16,347 --> 00:24:17,647
We need to watch it together.

698
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:23,157
(Thus, evening falls at the lodging.)

699
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:29,327
(The members become hungry.)

700
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,567
- Let's go. - Let's go.

701
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:34,167
(The agents gather at the main building.)

702
00:24:34,797 --> 00:24:37,707
Our energy is fully charged.

703
00:24:37,707 --> 00:24:38,807
(Oh, my)

704
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:39,807
Akh.

705
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:41,937
All of us took a nap.

706
00:24:42,507 --> 00:24:44,347
Yu Jin took a long nap.

707
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:46,747
Eun Ji gave a summary of a drama.

708
00:24:47,077 --> 00:24:48,077
Hello.

709
00:24:48,077 --> 00:24:49,117
(Well-rested Yu Jin and a "I'm Sorry, I Love You" fanatic)

710
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:50,117
It's good to see you.

711
00:24:50,217 --> 00:24:52,087
- Mi Hyun used the restroom. - Yes.

712
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:54,257
All of us have good energy.

713
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,187
One, two, three.

714
00:24:56,187 --> 00:24:57,427
- Akh. - Ha.

715
00:24:58,727 --> 00:24:59,757
You need to be in sync.

716
00:24:59,757 --> 00:25:01,157
- You need to be in sync. - I'm sorry.

717
00:25:01,557 --> 00:25:04,727
Let me tell you what the prize will be today.

718
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:06,867
You eat three meals a day,

719
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:08,937
- Yes. - but you're abroad now.

720
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,107
- The food might not suit you. - It's Korean food.

721
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:12,607
Ramyeon?

722
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:15,007
- You might crave snacks. - Yes.

723
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:16,877
This is the Emergency Food Game.

724
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:19,107
- Okay. - We need to save up food.

725
00:25:19,747 --> 00:25:23,287
(At any moment, the agents can face...)

726
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:27,017
(a distress situation.)

727
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,887
(To overcome the desert of thirst and hunger,)

728
00:25:32,357 --> 00:25:38,297
(emergency food supply has been prepared.)

729
00:25:38,427 --> 00:25:39,597
We must stock up on food.

730
00:25:39,597 --> 00:25:40,597
- It's a must. - We must stock up on food.

731
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:42,597
We'll take out various emergency food items.

732
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:44,367
- If you win, you keep it. - Keep.

733
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:46,107
- If you lose, you return it. - Stolen.

734
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:47,477
- Then you move on. - Stolen.

735
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:49,377
- Yes. - There'll be 9 to 10 items.

736
00:25:49,377 --> 00:25:51,147
- Stolen. - It's simple.

737
00:25:51,747 --> 00:25:53,247
- There's good news. - What is it?

738
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:55,917
It's a new game we developed ambitiously.

739
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:57,717
- Young JI wanted that. - Finally.

740
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,417
- Young JI wanted that. - Finally.

741
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:00,557
- All of us wanted that. - Everyone.

742
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:02,457
It's called the SBA Game.

743
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:03,987
- SBA? Strawberry, banana... - What are we going to do?

744
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:05,287
- Ace? - Ace?

745
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:06,457
- Strawberry, banana, ace? - What's that?

746
00:26:06,727 --> 00:26:08,727
Wouldn't most people say, "Strawberry, banana, apple?"

747
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:09,727
Right.

748
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:11,127
- "Strawberry, banana, ace?" - Ace.

749
00:26:11,397 --> 00:26:13,767
(Strawberry, Banana, Apple)

750
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,667
I'm so excited.

751
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,737
Let's say I go, "Strawberry."

752
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:19,507
I'll show you the pose for strawberry. Strawberry.

753
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:21,107
Strawberry.

754
00:26:22,437 --> 00:26:23,447
Strawberry.

755
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:25,607
- It's cute. - How cute.

756
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:27,077
- How cute. - Shout, "Strawberry."

757
00:26:27,077 --> 00:26:28,317
- Strawberry. - Say, "Strawberry."

758
00:26:28,317 --> 00:26:29,317
- Then return to your position. - Strawberry.
- Okay. - Strawberry.

759
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:32,117
What's the pose for banana? Banana.

760
00:26:32,987 --> 00:26:33,987
Banana.

761
00:26:35,357 --> 00:26:36,357
Banana.

762
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:39,127
- For banana, go back. - Go back. Banana.

763
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:41,257
- Strawberry. Banana. - Banana.

764
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:42,697
- There you go. - Strawberry.

765
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:44,167
- Here's the pose for apple. Apple. - Ace. I mean, apple.

766
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,067
Apple.

767
00:26:47,297 --> 00:26:48,297
Apple.

768
00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:50,507
- Apple. - Apple.

769
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:51,967
- Jump a bit... - Apple.

770
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,337
- to make it more dynamic. - Strawberry.

771
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:54,907
- Banana. Apple. - Banana. Apple.

772
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:56,877
- There you go. You're good. - Okay.

773
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:59,777
You guys are definitely better than us.

774
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:01,477
- We're the athletic ones. - It's hot.

775
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:03,747
- Now... - She feels hot already.

776
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:05,417
- She feels hot already. - She feels hot already.

777
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:07,117
This game improves the agents' stamina...

778
00:27:07,117 --> 00:27:08,717
through aerobic exercise.

779
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:10,857
- Aerobic exercise. Nice. - It's an exercise.

780
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:12,787
Shall we do it together? Set, go.

781
00:27:12,787 --> 00:27:15,127
- Strawberry, banana, apple. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

782
00:27:15,457 --> 00:27:16,667
- Strawberry, banana... - Strawberry, banana...

783
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,197
- Don't waste your energy. - You're right.

784
00:27:18,197 --> 00:27:19,197
Don't waste your energy.

785
00:27:19,497 --> 00:27:20,867
- That's how it goes. - It's hot.

786
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:23,637
A very simple rule will get added to this.

787
00:27:23,637 --> 00:27:25,037
(An additional rule)

788
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:27,137
- Young Ji. Strawberry. - Strawberry.

789
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:29,907
Let's say I shout "Strawberry" once more.

790
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:32,607
- Okay. - When that happens, stay still.

791
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,347
Don't shout or move.

792
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:36,347
- For example... Strawberry. - Strawberry.

793
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,347
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

794
00:27:38,447 --> 00:27:39,857
I told you to stay still.

795
00:27:40,387 --> 00:27:42,857
(That's how you fail.)

796
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:45,087
Let's say you get strawberry for the second time.

797
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:47,097
- Gosh, it's hard. - It's hard.

798
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:49,657
- It's hard. - You put much thought into it.

799
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:51,227
- Seriously. Thank you. - Understood?

800
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:52,797
- Yes. - Let's have a practice round.

801
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:53,937
- It's hard. - Strawberry.

802
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:54,937
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

803
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:56,667
Strawberry.

804
00:27:57,267 --> 00:27:58,267
What was that?

805
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,437
(Oh, my)

806
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,507
- If you do that, you fail. - How about an intake of breath?

807
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:03,707
- It's prohibited. - So...

808
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:05,007
- It has to be a clean answer. - Yes. Stay still.

809
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:06,307
- Banana. - Banana.

810
00:28:06,307 --> 00:28:07,877
Was this the gesture for "banana?"

811
00:28:07,877 --> 00:28:08,877
- Banana. - Banana.

812
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:10,747
(Standing awkwardly)

813
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:11,787
Gosh.

814
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:13,087
- What's the gesture? - Jump backward.

815
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:14,117
- Banana. - Banana.

816
00:28:14,117 --> 00:28:15,257
- Okay. - Let's give it a try.

817
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:16,257
Apple.

818
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:17,287
- Apple. - Apple.

819
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:18,487
Fail.

820
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:20,097
(In a daze)

821
00:28:20,097 --> 00:28:21,257
(Laughing in embarrassment)

822
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:22,927
- What did you do? - The gestures are hard to remember.

823
00:28:23,027 --> 00:28:24,427
The gestures are hard to remember.

824
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:25,827
Apple!

825
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:28,237
- You don't have to move your hips. - Why not?

826
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:29,367
- Just jump forward. - Apple.

827
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:30,667
(I want to.)

828
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:32,007
Apple.
(Yu Jin's encore performance)

829
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:34,677
- I like it. - That was very IVE of you.

830
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:36,277
- Ten times. - Ten times?

831
00:28:36,277 --> 00:28:38,047
If you do it ten times, you succeed.

832
00:28:38,077 --> 00:28:40,177
Ten times without anyone getting it wrong.

833
00:28:42,817 --> 00:28:44,217
- Let's put the first... - Food? Got it.

834
00:28:44,217 --> 00:28:45,947
emergency food on the line.

835
00:28:45,947 --> 00:28:47,357
We really have to secure the food.

836
00:28:47,357 --> 00:28:48,417
Spicy ramyeon.

837
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:49,557
- Anything spicy we have to secure. - Spicy.

838
00:28:49,557 --> 00:28:50,657
- Like kimchi. - There's a kitchen here.

839
00:28:50,657 --> 00:28:52,057
- What are those? - What are those?

840
00:28:52,187 --> 00:28:53,187
- Aloe juice? - We'll start off...

841
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:54,957
- with these. - This is good.

842
00:28:54,957 --> 00:28:56,127
(4 kinds of local juice)

843
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:57,467
- Local juice. - Local juice.

844
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:59,827
- The fruits here are so delicious. - Right.

845
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:02,167
Our local guide strongly recommended...

846
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,967
- He strongly recommended them. - the local juice.

847
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:05,607
Shout "Strawberry, banana, apple" at the same time...

848
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:07,077
as the intro of the game.

849
00:29:07,077 --> 00:29:08,177
- Let's begin. - Okay.

850
00:29:08,177 --> 00:29:09,307
- Ready? - Yes.

851
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:10,777
- Intro. - Start.

852
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:12,177
- Strawberry, banana, apple! - Strawberry, banana, apple!

853
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:13,177
Let's begin.

854
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:16,117
- Banana. - Banana.

855
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:17,717
You get a warning.

856
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:19,717
Apple.

857
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:20,887
Apple.

858
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,257
Wrong!

859
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:25,187
Apple.
(Mimi jerked up her arm.)

860
00:29:28,527 --> 00:29:29,527
Apple.

861
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:30,597
(Young Ji flicked her tongue.)

862
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:33,397
Apple.

863
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:34,697
Wrong!

864
00:29:36,397 --> 00:29:37,667
This is hard.

865
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:39,237
I don't think we can do this.

866
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:40,877
- This is hard. - This is too hard.

867
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:41,877
- This is too hard. - This game...

868
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:43,207
makes you feel miserable.

869
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:44,247
It's too hard.

870
00:29:44,677 --> 00:29:46,947
Can Young Ji shout out the fruits?

871
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:47,947
- Okay. - For Mimi.

872
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:49,547
- Like... - Practicing is fine.

873
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:50,787
One, two, three.

874
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:52,347
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

875
00:29:52,587 --> 00:29:53,617
Strawberry.

876
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:54,657
Banana.

877
00:29:57,957 --> 00:29:58,957
(She's not good at this either.)

878
00:29:58,957 --> 00:30:00,157
- Mimi. - Mi Hyun.

879
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:02,197
- This is insane. - I'm too stupid.

880
00:30:02,597 --> 00:30:04,067
It's all right. Let's go, Eun Ji.

881
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:06,127
The intro. Start.

882
00:30:06,197 --> 00:30:07,567
Strawberry, banana, apple.

883
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:09,037
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

884
00:30:09,037 --> 00:30:10,037
Strawberry.

885
00:30:10,037 --> 00:30:12,067
(Strawberry)

886
00:30:12,307 --> 00:30:14,607
- An Yu Jin, you go. - I keep moving in rhythm.

887
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:16,537
Yu Jin, the intro. Start.

888
00:30:16,877 --> 00:30:18,307
Strawberry, banana, apple.

889
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:19,677
- Apple. - Apple.

890
00:30:19,677 --> 00:30:20,677
Apple.

891
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:21,977
- Banana. - Banana.

892
00:30:22,147 --> 00:30:23,517
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

893
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:24,687
- Banana. - Banana.

894
00:30:24,687 --> 00:30:25,917
- Apple. - Apple.

895
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,587
Apple. She's good.

896
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:28,887
(Yu Jin quickly got the hang of it.)

897
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:30,627
I know how she does it.

898
00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:32,557
She stares into the person's eyes.

899
00:30:32,557 --> 00:30:33,627
Like this.

900
00:30:33,857 --> 00:30:35,397
She does this with her eyes.

901
00:30:35,397 --> 00:30:37,267
- Stop. - It's so scary.

902
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:39,227
(The 4 kinds of local juice are out.)

903
00:30:39,697 --> 00:30:41,097
- Can we... - Again?

904
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:42,897
- They're changing it. - The second...

905
00:30:42,897 --> 00:30:44,507
- I see chocolate. - What are these?

906
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:45,737
- They're full of nutrients. - Are they protein drinks?

907
00:30:45,737 --> 00:30:46,837
These are necessary.

908
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:48,677
They are four kinds of local milk.

909
00:30:48,677 --> 00:30:49,677
Milk? Okay.

910
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:50,807
- I love milk. - They look so good.

911
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,577
- Is this jujube-flavored? - This is caramel-flavored.

912
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:54,447
- Right. - It's salted caramel.

913
00:30:54,447 --> 00:30:56,647
- Salted caramel-flavored milk. - This is jujube-flavored milk.

914
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,047
Why are there so many jujube here?

915
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,387
They're not jujube.

916
00:31:00,387 --> 00:31:02,017
- Dates. - They're dates.

917
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:03,657
Dates are sweet and so good.

918
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:05,157
They're famous for dates.

919
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:06,357
- Shall we begin? - Yes.

920
00:31:06,997 --> 00:31:08,557
The intro. Start.

921
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:09,827
- Strawberry, banana, apple. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

922
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:10,867
Let's go.

923
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:13,767
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

924
00:31:14,237 --> 00:31:15,267
Strawberry.

925
00:31:15,937 --> 00:31:17,067
Wrong!

926
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:18,507
Strawberry.

927
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:20,537
(I'm Eun Ji, 34 years old.)

928
00:31:20,537 --> 00:31:22,607
Wait. Can we just compete individually?

929
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:25,377
I don't think we can win as a team.

930
00:31:25,377 --> 00:31:27,047
- Eun Ji. - You okay?

931
00:31:27,277 --> 00:31:29,077
Wait. I saw you getting it wrong too, Mimi.

932
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:30,587
I saw Mimi getting it wrong too.

933
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:31,787
Strawberry.

934
00:31:31,787 --> 00:31:33,387
(She did a tiny squat.)

935
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:34,687
Wait.

936
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:36,087
- You two. Let's practice. - We keep getting it wrong.

937
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:37,227
- Let's practice. - Get ready.

938
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:38,787
- They're studying. - Eun Ji, Mimi. Get ready.

939
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:40,327
The intro. Start.

940
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:41,727
- Strawberry, banana, apple. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

941
00:31:41,727 --> 00:31:42,727
Apple.

942
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:43,797
- Apple. - Apple.

943
00:31:44,097 --> 00:31:45,167
- They're late. - Apple.

944
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:46,867
(Both of them are a bit late.)

945
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:48,967
Guys.

946
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:50,167
Why is this so funny?

947
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:52,767
- Are the milks out? - This is really...

948
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:53,977
- Last chance. - This is your last chance.

949
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:54,977
That was the practice round.

950
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:56,177
These are really good.

951
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:57,377
They're so good that I want you to win them.

952
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:58,607
- Right. - We'll get our heads in the game.

953
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:00,947
Doing the chant just once is boring.

954
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:02,247
- Let's do it twice for the intro... - Okay.

955
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:03,647
- for more rhythm. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

956
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:05,317
- Got it. - The intro.

957
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,987
- Strawberry, banana, apple. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

958
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:12,387
- Apple. - Apple.

959
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:13,827
- Banana. - Banana.

960
00:32:13,827 --> 00:32:15,157
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

961
00:32:15,157 --> 00:32:16,157
Strawberry.

962
00:32:16,157 --> 00:32:17,527
- Banana. - Banana.

963
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:18,627
- Apple. - Apple.

964
00:32:18,627 --> 00:32:19,627
Apple.

965
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:21,667
- Wrong! - Who got it wrong?

966
00:32:22,037 --> 00:32:23,197
- Apple. - Apple.

967
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:24,207
Apple.

968
00:32:25,337 --> 00:32:27,637
(How do I look?)

969
00:32:27,637 --> 00:32:28,807
I'm nervous.

970
00:32:29,607 --> 00:32:31,007
(Why is she taking her anger out on the pillar?)

971
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:32,007
Gosh.

972
00:32:32,007 --> 00:32:34,577
Getting it wrong makes you feel empty.

973
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,617
(Yelling)

974
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:38,447
(The 4 kinds of local milk are out.)

975
00:32:39,187 --> 00:32:40,787
I think we got this.

976
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:42,557
- You should. - We can do a good job...

977
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:43,627
if he doesn't suddenly switch things up.

978
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:45,887
Please bring in the next items.

979
00:32:45,887 --> 00:32:46,997
- Gosh. - Please.

980
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:49,227
- All right. We have to win these. - We have to win these.

981
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:50,467
- Cup tteokbokki. - Cup tteokbokki.

982
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:51,727
- We have to win these. - They're spicy.

983
00:32:51,727 --> 00:32:52,727
You're sure, right?

984
00:32:52,727 --> 00:32:53,967
- They're spicy. - We have to win these.

985
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:55,137
I'm sorry,

986
00:32:55,137 --> 00:32:56,667
but what should we do about getting the intro wrong?

987
00:32:57,007 --> 00:32:58,407
Who got it wrong? Be honest.

988
00:32:58,407 --> 00:32:59,737
- Kim Mi Hyun. - Kim Mi Hyun.

989
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,707
(Flinching)

990
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:04,047
Mi Hyun, do the intro.

991
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:05,647
Three, two, one. Let's go.

992
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:06,977
- Strawberry, banana, apple. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

993
00:33:06,977 --> 00:33:08,917
- Strawberry. Oh, no. - What...

994
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:10,687
(Puzzled)

995
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:12,287
- Strawberry, banana, apple. Pause. - Hey, you're...

996
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:13,447
Strawberry, banana, apple.

997
00:33:13,447 --> 00:33:14,787
Three, two, one. Let's go.

998
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:16,357
- Strawberry, banana, apple. Pause. - Strawberry, banana, apple. Pause.

999
00:33:16,357 --> 00:33:17,627
- Strawberry, banana, apple. - Strawberry, banana, apple. Yes.

1000
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:19,387
- You did it. - Okay.

1001
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:21,527
(The main dancer found her rhythm.)

1002
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:22,627
I'm exhausted.

1003
00:33:23,397 --> 00:33:24,467
- All right. - The intro.

1004
00:33:25,127 --> 00:33:26,127
The intro.

1005
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:27,837
- Strawberry, banana, apple. Pause. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

1006
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:29,267
- Strawberry, banana, apple. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

1007
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:30,737
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1008
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:31,767
Strawberry.

1009
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:33,137
- Apple. - Apple.

1010
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:34,377
- Banana. - Banana.

1011
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:35,707
- Apple. - Apple.

1012
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:36,737
Apple

1013
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:37,807
(Apple)

1014
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,207
That's the same pose. Wrong!

1015
00:33:39,947 --> 00:33:41,147
Apple.

1016
00:33:43,077 --> 00:33:45,347
(Copy and paste)

1017
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:47,717
(Goodness)

1018
00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:48,917
She's adorably wrong.

1019
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:51,787
(Screaming)

1020
00:33:51,787 --> 00:33:53,697
(The cup tteokbokki is out.)

1021
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:54,997
Let's shout out E-cade.

1022
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:56,157
- It's because we didn't do it. - You're right.

1023
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:57,367
All right.

1024
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:59,097
One, two, three. Let's go.

1025
00:33:59,097 --> 00:34:00,437
- E-cade, E-cade, E-cade. - E-cade, E-cade, E-cade.

1026
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:03,437
- I got it now. - Bring in the next item, please.

1027
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:04,967
- Next item. - I got this.

1028
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:06,667
- What is that? Ice cream? - Ice cream.

1029
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:07,777
(It's Mimi's favorite.)

1030
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:08,937
We should have them right now.

1031
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:11,177
How do they know we're craving that right now?

1032
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:12,477
- Right. I want that right now. - This one is coconut-flavored.

1033
00:34:12,477 --> 00:34:13,717
- I know. - That looks great.

1034
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:14,717
- Gosh. - All right.

1035
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,147
- They all... - They're ice cream.

1036
00:34:16,147 --> 00:34:17,147
- Local ice cream. - They look good.

1037
00:34:17,147 --> 00:34:18,387
- They look good, right? - Yes.

1038
00:34:18,747 --> 00:34:19,847
- So... - The important thing is...

1039
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:21,687
that reality hits me too hard mid-game.

1040
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:22,987
- I get angry. - When do you feel that way?

1041
00:34:22,987 --> 00:34:24,957
When I do this.

1042
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:26,957
- When we do this, - Yes.

1043
00:34:26,957 --> 00:34:28,557
- we get a view of the ceiling. - Right.

1044
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:30,027
- That's when reality hits us. - I can't look at other people.

1045
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,767
- I can't look at other people. - My eyes are glued to the ceiling.

1046
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:33,967
(Let's look back at when reality hit them.)

1047
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:35,367
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1048
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:38,467
(This is it.)

1049
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,977
(Carrot Lee loves the ceiling.)

1050
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:43,237
- Banana. - Banana.

1051
00:34:43,237 --> 00:34:44,377
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1052
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:46,007
(Moving stiffly)

1053
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,017
Apple.

1054
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:48,347
- Banana. - Banana.

1055
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:49,347
Banana.

1056
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:50,387
(Showing all her teeth)

1057
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:51,387
- Apple. - Apple.

1058
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:52,487
Strawberry. Apple.

1059
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:54,487
(Her gesture is a blend of strawberry and apple.)

1060
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:56,017
- Apple. - Apple.

1061
00:34:56,017 --> 00:34:58,857
(The fruit seller was hit by reality with them.)

1062
00:34:58,857 --> 00:35:00,497
(Change of rules)

1063
00:35:00,857 --> 00:35:03,697
We will now upgrade the game.

1064
00:35:03,697 --> 00:35:04,767
(Annoyed)

1065
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:05,827
We've just got used to the game now.

1066
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,167
Are you adding another rule?

1067
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,267
The upgrade will be very simple.

1068
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:11,237
- Simple? - It's a very simple upgrade.

1069
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:14,177
The gestures for strawberry and banana will stay the same.

1070
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,177
- Are you adding one after apple? - But for apple,

1071
00:35:16,177 --> 00:35:17,907
when I say "apple,"

1072
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:19,607
you're not shouting "apple" anymore.

1073
00:35:19,947 --> 00:35:20,977
(Ho!)

1074
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:23,277
- Ho? That's not too bad. - Ho!

1075
00:35:23,277 --> 00:35:24,587
- We can do it. - You got it, right?

1076
00:35:24,587 --> 00:35:25,687
- Ho! - Let's practice.

1077
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:26,687
- Apple. - Ho!

1078
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:28,287
- Apple. - Ho!

1079
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:29,857
- We're not supposed to do anything. - You had to stay still.

1080
00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:30,887
Right.

1081
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:32,857
I thought you meant we had to keep doing it.

1082
00:35:33,157 --> 00:35:34,257
Does the change apply to the intro as well?

1083
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,257
Stick to apple for the intro.

1084
00:35:35,257 --> 00:35:36,657
- Strawberry, banana, apple. - Apple.

1085
00:35:36,657 --> 00:35:37,927
- Apple stays in the intro. - This is confusing.

1086
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,027
- Gosh, this is insane. - That's even more difficult.

1087
00:35:39,027 --> 00:35:40,397
- Right. - Ready?

1088
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,637
- Yes. - We'll begin right away...

1089
00:35:41,637 --> 00:35:42,767
- with the ice cream on the line. - All right.

1090
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:43,967
The intro!

1091
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,667
- Strawberry, banana, apple. Pause. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

1092
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:47,177
- Strawberry, banana, apple. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

1093
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:48,507
- Apple. - Ho!

1094
00:35:48,837 --> 00:35:50,077
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1095
00:35:50,077 --> 00:35:51,107
Strawberry.

1096
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,247
- Apple. - Ho!

1097
00:35:52,747 --> 00:35:55,177
(Wrong!)

1098
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:56,577
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1099
00:35:56,577 --> 00:35:57,847
(Yu Jin lost her balance.)

1100
00:35:57,847 --> 00:35:59,287
(Ap... Ho!)

1101
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:01,187
(It's not like Yu Jin to get this wrong.)

1102
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:02,417
- Apple. - Ho!

1103
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:04,927
(Mimi's gesture is a blend of apple and banana.)

1104
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:07,597
(Overall, everyone got it wrong.)

1105
00:36:07,597 --> 00:36:09,497
- They all got it wrong. - It's too difficult.

1106
00:36:09,557 --> 00:36:10,697
You all got it wrong.

1107
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,867
I can see Mimi out of the corner of my eye,

1108
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:14,437
and I saw her do this by herself.

1109
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:15,997
Right?

1110
00:36:15,997 --> 00:36:17,437
Why do I keep getting banana and apple confused?

1111
00:36:17,437 --> 00:36:18,937
- How did Yu Jin get it wrong? - Why would you get...

1112
00:36:18,937 --> 00:36:20,167
banana and apple confused?

1113
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:21,577
How did Yu Jin get it wrong?

1114
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:23,777
Yu Jin? I don't know. I got it wrong too.

1115
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:25,247
I flinched at "Strawberry,"

1116
00:36:25,247 --> 00:36:26,807
and for apple, I went "Ap... Ho!"

1117
00:36:27,377 --> 00:36:28,947
I did it the same way.

1118
00:36:29,047 --> 00:36:31,187
- I said "Ap... Ho!" too. - Ap... Ho!

1119
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:33,547
(The ice cream is out.)

1120
00:36:33,547 --> 00:36:34,587
- Let's stop. - The next round.

1121
00:36:34,787 --> 00:36:36,917
This is just in case you don't win food...

1122
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:38,457
during the dinner mission.

1123
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:39,627
Only one person is capable of doing that.

1124
00:36:39,627 --> 00:36:41,097
- Goodness. - Goodness.

1125
00:36:41,197 --> 00:36:42,957
- Is that plain rice? - I'm sorry, is that plain rice?

1126
00:36:42,957 --> 00:36:43,967
(Is that plain rice?)

1127
00:36:44,197 --> 00:36:45,327
- Is that plain rice? - I'm sorry, is that plain rice?

1128
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:46,967
(Politely putting the rice down)

1129
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:48,397
This feels like an ancestral rite.

1130
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:50,267
- It's like an ancestral rite. - For an ancestral rite.

1131
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:52,007
- An ancestral rite... - All it needs is a spoon.

1132
00:36:52,437 --> 00:36:54,007
If you put an incense stick...

1133
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:55,307
(It's definitely a misleading sight.)

1134
00:36:55,907 --> 00:36:58,707
The table itself is so...

1135
00:36:59,077 --> 00:37:00,617
- This is... - This is how you mock someone.

1136
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:02,017
just a display.

1137
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:04,047
- You'll get instant rice later. - Okay.

1138
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:05,087
- You're replacing it. - Yes, we'll exchange it.

1139
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:06,247
We love instant rice.

1140
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:08,057
Why am I so exhausted?

1141
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:09,557
- This is cardio. - Cardio.

1142
00:37:09,557 --> 00:37:10,827
The day feels long.

1143
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:12,427
All right. The intro!

1144
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:14,457
- Strawberry, banana, apple. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

1145
00:37:14,697 --> 00:37:16,397
- Strawberry, banana, apple. - Strawberry, banana, apple.

1146
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:18,397
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1147
00:37:18,397 --> 00:37:19,427
- Apple. - Ho!

1148
00:37:19,827 --> 00:37:20,837
Apple.

1149
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:22,437
(Ho!)

1150
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:23,637
(Wrong!)

1151
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:25,367
(The solo vocalist)

1152
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:27,207
Apple.

1153
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:28,777
(Ho!)

1154
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:31,747
(Young Ji put on a solo performance out of the blue.)

1155
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:34,147
Please.

1156
00:37:34,147 --> 00:37:35,547
- Hey. - At least I got it right.

1157
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:36,717
It's fine because you were loud and clear.

1158
00:37:36,717 --> 00:37:38,587
It's been a while since I got apple right,

1159
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:40,457
so I was feeling great. I'm sorry.

1160
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:41,787
- I'm sorry. - To be honest,

1161
00:37:41,787 --> 00:37:42,987
if it weren't you, it would have been me.

1162
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:46,857
- Apple. - Ho!

1163
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:50,127
(Startled)

1164
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:52,067
(The instant rice is out.)

1165
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:54,497
- Do you feel... - We're okay now.

1166
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:55,797
- more confident? - Yes.

1167
00:37:56,237 --> 00:37:57,937
It's time for the last upgrade.

1168
00:37:57,937 --> 00:37:59,937
- That's insane. - He always does this.

1169
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:01,637
We're finally introducing...

1170
00:38:01,637 --> 00:38:03,077
- the last fruit to the game. - The last fruit.

1171
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:04,347
- This is crazy. - Avocado?

1172
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:05,977
- The final fruit. - It's a jujube.

1173
00:38:06,647 --> 00:38:07,717
Quince.

1174
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:10,787
(4. Quince)

1175
00:38:11,017 --> 00:38:12,517
- Quince. - Okay.

1176
00:38:12,517 --> 00:38:14,017
- That's it. A bit like... - Quince.

1177
00:38:14,517 --> 00:38:16,657
- Strawberry, banana, apple, quince. - Quince.

1178
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:19,027
- Strawberry, banana, apple, quince. - Right.

1179
00:38:19,027 --> 00:38:20,357
The footwork is... How did you...

1180
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:21,397
- Quince. - What did you do?

1181
00:38:21,497 --> 00:38:22,957
- Did you go like this? - It's what you do well.

1182
00:38:22,997 --> 00:38:24,727
(The dance sports version)

1183
00:38:24,727 --> 00:38:26,227
- Then you have to change like this. - Right.

1184
00:38:26,227 --> 00:38:28,437
- Like bam, bam? - Strawberry, banana, apple, quince.

1185
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:29,497
Oh, like that?

1186
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:31,867
- That was IVE. - Does the rhythm go, ta-da?

1187
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:34,437
- Strawberry, banana, apple, quince. - Strawberry, banana, apple, quince.

1188
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,177
- Let's go right away. - All right. Let's go.

1189
00:38:36,437 --> 00:38:38,177
- Gosh, quince. - Oh, the prize isn't here yet.

1190
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:39,207
- Oh, right. - True.

1191
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:40,977
- From now, it's rice's friends. - What could it be?

1192
00:38:40,977 --> 00:38:42,077
- Oh, my. - I hope it's kimchi.

1193
00:38:42,077 --> 00:38:43,117
- What's this? - What is it?

1194
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:44,317
- Is it ramyeon broth? - This is also...

1195
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:46,247
- for display. - What?

1196
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:47,857
If you succeed,

1197
00:38:47,857 --> 00:38:49,287
- you'll get the retort version. - Chili...

1198
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:52,387
- It's a kimchi tuna rice sauce. - My goodness.

1199
00:38:52,387 --> 00:38:53,427
(Perfect for those who love Korean food)

1200
00:38:53,427 --> 00:38:54,857
- This is the best. - That looks delicious.

1201
00:38:55,397 --> 00:38:57,267
- Kimchi and tuna sounds good. - You just have to microwave it.

1202
00:38:57,267 --> 00:38:58,327
That's the best.

1203
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:00,327
- You can eat it right away. - Oh, thank you in advance.

1204
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:01,397
Let's get started.

1205
00:39:01,397 --> 00:39:03,637
- Strawberry, banana, apple, quince. - Ready? It includes quince.

1206
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:05,537
- Okay. - All right. Intro.

1207
00:39:05,837 --> 00:39:09,777
- Strawberry, banana, apple, quince. - Strawberry, banana, apple, quince.

1208
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:12,377
- Banana. - Banana.

1209
00:39:12,377 --> 00:39:13,777
- Quince. - Quince.

1210
00:39:13,777 --> 00:39:14,847
Apple.

1211
00:39:16,777 --> 00:39:18,447
(Incorrect)

1212
00:39:18,487 --> 00:39:19,487
Apple.

1213
00:39:19,517 --> 00:39:22,757
(Is that the dance move from "Catallena?")

1214
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:25,987
Happy New Year.

1215
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:27,357
- What was that? - Happy New Year.

1216
00:39:27,357 --> 00:39:28,397
She's bowing for the new year.

1217
00:39:28,397 --> 00:39:29,657
What did you do, Eun Ji?

1218
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:31,967
For quince?

1219
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:33,827
But I know how you feel.

1220
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:35,497
- I went like this too. - Oh, I don't know.

1221
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:36,537
Apple.

1222
00:39:36,537 --> 00:39:39,137
(Her version was like a strawberry apple smoothie.)

1223
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:41,107
(Kimchi tuna rice sauce is out.)

1224
00:39:42,377 --> 00:39:43,837
We can start ramping up the speed now, can't we?

1225
00:39:43,837 --> 00:39:45,077
- Not really. - Speed?

1226
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:47,047
Please watch your pronunciation for quince and apple.

1227
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:48,117
- Especially for quince. - What?

1228
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:50,947
- We have to win this for sure. - We practiced...

1229
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:52,417
- in order to eat this. - For real. I'm serious about this.

1230
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:53,847
- It was all to eat this. - Right.

1231
00:39:53,847 --> 00:39:54,857
(Serious)

1232
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:56,057
Girls, let's hurry up and practice.

1233
00:39:56,357 --> 00:39:57,357
Practice? I know how to do this.

1234
00:39:57,357 --> 00:39:58,927
- One, two, ready, go. - Start with the intro. Go.

1235
00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:00,087
(A practice session led by Yu Jin)

1236
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:02,527
(Serious)

1237
00:40:02,857 --> 00:40:04,267
- Quince. - Quince.

1238
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:05,267
Quince.

1239
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:06,597
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1240
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:08,297
- Apple. - Apple.

1241
00:40:08,637 --> 00:40:09,697
Apple.

1242
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:12,237
- What was that? - For apple...

1243
00:40:12,707 --> 00:40:14,607
Girls, we really have to eat this.

1244
00:40:14,607 --> 00:40:16,237
- Okay? - Let's eat it. I'll do well.

1245
00:40:16,407 --> 00:40:17,647
- Okay. - Let's say a cheer.

1246
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:18,707
- Shall we? - Okay.

1247
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:19,907
One, two, ready, go.

1248
00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:21,117
- E-cade, E-cade, E-cade. - E-cade, E-cade, E-cade.

1249
00:40:21,217 --> 00:40:22,517
- Okay. Ready? - Yes.

1250
00:40:23,747 --> 00:40:24,787
- Intro. - Ready...

1251
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:28,757
- Strawberry, banana, apple, quince. - Strawberry, banana, apple, quince.

1252
00:40:28,757 --> 00:40:29,987
- Banana. - Banana.

1253
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:30,987
Banana.

1254
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:32,127
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1255
00:40:32,127 --> 00:40:34,357
Apple.

1256
00:40:34,357 --> 00:40:35,497
- Quince. - Quince.

1257
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:36,727
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1258
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:37,967
- Banana. - Banana.

1259
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,527
- Quince. - Quince.

1260
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:42,467
(Incorrect)

1261
00:40:42,897 --> 00:40:44,107
- Banana. - Banana.

1262
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:45,107
- Quince. - Quince.

1263
00:40:45,637 --> 00:40:47,937
(The weakest member)

1264
00:40:48,207 --> 00:40:49,577
- How did you do it? - What did you do?

1265
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:50,747
Show us what you did.

1266
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:51,777
Quince.

1267
00:40:53,647 --> 00:40:55,217
- Come on, Eun Ji. - Quince.

1268
00:40:55,217 --> 00:40:56,247
(Northern Praying Mantis-style of Kung Fu)

1269
00:40:56,677 --> 00:40:58,247
- Eun Ji went for the comedy factor. - Eun Ji.

1270
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,317
- No, I... - You did this on purpose, right?

1271
00:41:00,317 --> 00:41:03,017
Back in the day, was it called, "When You Go to the Market?"

1272
00:41:03,317 --> 00:41:05,057
There's something I'm not good at.

1273
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:07,657
I don't have a good sense of rhythm. I don't even play "R2Beat."

1274
00:41:07,827 --> 00:41:10,867
- What is "R2Beat?" - I gave up on "R2Beat."

1275
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:12,267
- I tried "R2Beat," but... - But your quince move is addicting.

1276
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:14,037
- Can't you show us again? - Quince.

1277
00:41:14,497 --> 00:41:15,567
(Praying Mantis Mimi)

1278
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:16,567
It looks like you're scheming something.

1279
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:18,467
(The cup noodles are out.)

1280
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:20,237
Well, we can't do anything about it.

1281
00:41:20,537 --> 00:41:22,637
I will go and steal them at night.

1282
00:41:23,407 --> 00:41:25,107
That's not a bad idea. That would be faster, Eun Ji.

1283
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,777
- I'll steal them at night. - That would be faster.

1284
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:27,977
All right.

1285
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:30,077
Yu Jin, do you need to do a solo round?

1286
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:31,487
Do you want to do a solo performance?

1287
00:41:31,587 --> 00:41:33,747
- Other than ramyeon, I don't... - Oh, no.

1288
00:41:33,747 --> 00:41:34,917
- I don't want anything else. - Really?

1289
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:37,017
- Yu Jin is too good at this game. - What should we do?

1290
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:39,587
How about you let Yu Jin try by herself?

1291
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:40,797
- One cup noodle... - There's no one else...

1292
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:42,357
besides her who will get to eat anyway.

1293
00:41:42,357 --> 00:41:43,357
- An individual match for Yu Jin. - But...

1294
00:41:43,357 --> 00:41:45,127
she's too good at this.

1295
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:46,797
- How about 20 times? Yes. - You mean by herself?

1296
00:41:46,827 --> 00:41:48,037
Come on. She will be able to do that, for sure.

1297
00:41:48,037 --> 00:41:49,837
No, she might not be able to. You never know.

1298
00:41:49,997 --> 00:41:52,007
- And you can be speedy. - Then, shall we go with Eun Ji?

1299
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:53,767
- Eun Ji? - No, why?

1300
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:55,007
That's not bad either.

1301
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:56,177
- How many times? - Well...

1302
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:57,607
I think Eun Ji can do it five times.

1303
00:41:57,607 --> 00:41:58,607
- Ten times? - How many times?

1304
00:41:58,607 --> 00:41:59,947
- How about ten times? - Ten times.

1305
00:41:59,947 --> 00:42:01,677
- Lee Eun Ji, 10 times. - Lee Eun Ji, 10 times.

1306
00:42:01,747 --> 00:42:03,717
Like "Dad's Challenge," this is "Eun Ji's Challenge."

1307
00:42:03,717 --> 00:42:04,947
Have all the girls sit here,

1308
00:42:04,947 --> 00:42:06,317
- waiting for me to win a prize. - Then...

1309
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:07,617
- Right. - Yes.

1310
00:42:07,617 --> 00:42:08,987
- "Eun Ji's Challenge?" - "Eun Ji's Challenge."

1311
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:10,887
(With cup noodles on the line,)

1312
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:12,857
(it's Eun Ji's Challenge.)

1313
00:42:13,287 --> 00:42:15,527
- Let's cheer for Eun Ji once. - So, strawberry, banana...

1314
00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:19,527
- Lee Eun Ji! - Strawberry, banana, apple, quince.

1315
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:21,767
You know, for real,

1316
00:42:21,897 --> 00:42:24,507
I'm more afraid of these three than of my mom.

1317
00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:27,637
- Will I be able to do well? - This is a big one. It's Las Vegas.

1318
00:42:27,637 --> 00:42:29,107
- Will I be able to do it? - You can do it.

1319
00:42:29,107 --> 00:42:30,907
- Thank you. - Lee Eun Ji!

1320
00:42:30,907 --> 00:42:32,447
(You can do it, Eun Ji.)

1321
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:33,607
- Let's go. - Ready.

1322
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,217
Intro.

1323
00:42:35,547 --> 00:42:39,017
Strawberry, banana, apple, quince.

1324
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,787
- Quince. - Quince.

1325
00:42:40,787 --> 00:42:41,857
(Quince)

1326
00:42:41,857 --> 00:42:43,787
- That was close. - Okay. Here we go.

1327
00:42:43,787 --> 00:42:44,987
- Strawberry! - Strawberry!

1328
00:42:44,987 --> 00:42:46,657
- Apple. - So!

1329
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:49,627
(So?)

1330
00:42:49,627 --> 00:42:50,627
So?

1331
00:42:50,627 --> 00:42:52,427
(What did you say?)

1332
00:42:52,627 --> 00:42:54,397
(We're guessing she managed to stop herself...)

1333
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:56,337
(from saying apple and thought of "Ho!")

1334
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:59,037
- All right. This is a warning. - It's a warning.

1335
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:00,237
Akh.

1336
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:01,407
(Thank you.)

1337
00:43:01,437 --> 00:43:03,507
- It's back to zero. - Akh.

1338
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:05,777
You can do it.

1339
00:43:05,777 --> 00:43:07,277
- Quince! - Quince.

1340
00:43:07,307 --> 00:43:08,717
Apple.

1341
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:10,017
- Quince! - Quince.

1342
00:43:10,017 --> 00:43:11,247
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1343
00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:12,247
Strawberry.

1344
00:43:12,247 --> 00:43:13,287
(Chuckling)

1345
00:43:13,447 --> 00:43:15,357
Oh, that was so good.

1346
00:43:15,357 --> 00:43:16,587
- Okay, I'll give you half credit. - It was so good.

1347
00:43:16,687 --> 00:43:18,027
- That was five. - Let's keep going.

1348
00:43:18,027 --> 00:43:19,027
(She succeeded up to number 5.)

1349
00:43:19,157 --> 00:43:20,487
- She looks cute. - Quince!

1350
00:43:20,587 --> 00:43:21,857
- Quince. - Apple.

1351
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,057
Tow!

1352
00:43:23,627 --> 00:43:24,667
Incorrect.

1353
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:26,227
But why?

1354
00:43:26,227 --> 00:43:27,267
Tow!

1355
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:28,967
(Why else?)

1356
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:30,737
But why?

1357
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:32,767
You were wrong too many times.

1358
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:35,107
- It was so cute, though. - Why are you so cute?

1359
00:43:35,107 --> 00:43:37,037
How old are you, Eun Ji? Why are you so cute?

1360
00:43:37,037 --> 00:43:38,447
I'm 34 years old.

1361
00:43:38,777 --> 00:43:39,907
Why is she so cute, though?

1362
00:43:39,907 --> 00:43:41,817
- I'm 34 years old. - She's so cute.

1363
00:43:41,817 --> 00:43:43,517
Applause. Seriously, Lee Eun Ji.

1364
00:43:43,617 --> 00:43:45,087
That was awesome.

1365
00:43:45,317 --> 00:43:46,787
- Can't you try once... - So...

1366
00:43:46,787 --> 00:43:47,857
- instead of me? - I'm sorry.

1367
00:43:47,857 --> 00:43:49,987
Let's go with "The Second Eldest's Challenge."

1368
00:43:49,987 --> 00:43:51,787
(The Second Eldest's Challenge)

1369
00:43:51,987 --> 00:43:53,257
Mimi has gotten a lot better.

1370
00:43:53,387 --> 00:43:54,397
I've gotten a lot better.

1371
00:43:54,397 --> 00:43:55,997
Because Mimi has dance in her DNA.

1372
00:43:55,997 --> 00:43:57,727
Our main dancer. The main dancer of Earth Arcade.

1373
00:43:58,027 --> 00:43:59,097
Dancer.

1374
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:00,327
You can do it.

1375
00:44:00,867 --> 00:44:01,967
Are you ready?

1376
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:03,597
Okay. Intro!

1377
00:44:03,897 --> 00:44:07,907
Strawberry, banana, apple, quince.

1378
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:09,677
(She injures her own honor right away.)

1379
00:44:09,677 --> 00:44:11,507
- What was that? - Why did you get it wrong here?

1380
00:44:11,877 --> 00:44:13,847
- I'm sorry, but... - No one has gotten that wrong.

1381
00:44:13,847 --> 00:44:15,117
The intro is the hardest.

1382
00:44:15,117 --> 00:44:17,077
- Be serious. - All right. Once more.

1383
00:44:17,117 --> 00:44:18,217
Go. Intro!

1384
00:44:18,317 --> 00:44:19,887
Strawberry, banana, apple, quince.

1385
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:21,587
(Mimi the minion)

1386
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:22,987
- You're doing well. - Banana!

1387
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:24,327
- Banana. - Apple!

1388
00:44:24,527 --> 00:44:25,727
- Ho! - Apple!

1389
00:44:26,257 --> 00:44:27,257
Quince.

1390
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:29,057
- Quince. - Quince.

1391
00:44:29,297 --> 00:44:30,397
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1392
00:44:30,397 --> 00:44:31,397
Strawberry!

1393
00:44:31,397 --> 00:44:32,497
(Moving awkwardly)

1394
00:44:32,497 --> 00:44:34,537
(Incorrect)

1395
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:37,667
(It's hard to find a move that was actually right.)

1396
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,507
Is someone shooting arrows at you from behind?

1397
00:44:42,477 --> 00:44:43,907
She was like this the whole time.

1398
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:46,177
We tried to let it slide as much as we could, but...

1399
00:44:46,607 --> 00:44:48,647
We all tried to turn a blind eye.

1400
00:44:48,817 --> 00:44:52,047
Excuse me, sir. Won't we see "The Younger Girls' Challenge?"

1401
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:54,047
An Yu Jin, go and win it yourself.

1402
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:55,517
- Yes. - Actually, this is the fastest way.

1403
00:44:56,357 --> 00:45:00,757
(The final boss of this game appears.)

1404
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:04,427
But she is...

1405
00:45:04,427 --> 00:45:06,997
I think you could try it at the highest speed for her.

1406
00:45:07,697 --> 00:45:09,267
- She's way too good. - At 2 times the speed? Or 4 times?

1407
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:11,067
I'm ready.

1408
00:45:13,307 --> 00:45:15,177
She never gets it wrong.

1409
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:17,337
(The Youngest Girl's Challenge)

1410
00:45:17,607 --> 00:45:18,877
- Let's try twice the speed. - Twice the speed.

1411
00:45:18,877 --> 00:45:19,947
Here it goes. Twice the speed.

1412
00:45:20,607 --> 00:45:21,677
Yu Jin is good.

1413
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,947
Yu Jin, let's do the intro.

1414
00:45:22,947 --> 00:45:24,217
- Three, two, one, let's go. - Twenty times?

1415
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:25,847
- Apple. Banana, apple, quince. - Strawberry, banana, apple, quince.

1416
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:28,417
(She's so light on her feet.)

1417
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:30,157
Why do you keep adding a body roll?

1418
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:32,327
- Quince. - Why are you tilting your head?

1419
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:33,327
Yu Jin, you must do it 20 times.

1420
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:34,697
- Yu Jin, you have to do 20 times. - What, 20?

1421
00:45:34,727 --> 00:45:36,327
- That's so tough. - At twice the speed, 20 times.

1422
00:45:37,227 --> 00:45:38,227
She was taken aback.

1423
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:40,167
- I'm so scared. - Okay. Intro!

1424
00:45:41,237 --> 00:45:44,867
- Strawberry, banana, apple, quince. - Quince.

1425
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,867
Apple!

1426
00:45:46,267 --> 00:45:47,677
Apple. Quince!

1427
00:45:47,737 --> 00:45:48,777
- Quince. - Quince!

1428
00:45:48,977 --> 00:45:50,037
- Strawberry! - Strawberry.

1429
00:45:50,037 --> 00:45:51,277
- Banana! - Banana.

1430
00:45:51,277 --> 00:45:52,307
- Quince! - Quince.

1431
00:45:52,307 --> 00:45:53,377
- Strawberry! - Strawberry.

1432
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:54,617
- Apple! - She's so good.

1433
00:45:54,617 --> 00:45:55,647
- Quince! - Quince.

1434
00:45:55,647 --> 00:45:56,677
Quince!

1435
00:45:56,677 --> 00:45:57,747
- Strawberry! - Strawberry.

1436
00:45:57,747 --> 00:45:58,847
- Quince! - Quince.

1437
00:45:58,847 --> 00:45:59,947
- Banana! - Ho!

1438
00:45:59,947 --> 00:46:00,957
Apple!

1439
00:46:01,087 --> 00:46:06,527
- My gosh. - Hey, you're so good at this!

1440
00:46:06,627 --> 00:46:08,627
Hey, you're so good.

1441
00:46:08,797 --> 00:46:10,827
(Currently ranked number 1 in the world)

1442
00:46:10,827 --> 00:46:12,297
- I mean, she's so good. - She is...

1443
00:46:12,297 --> 00:46:14,197
- seriously amazing. What, 15 times? - She did it 15 times.

1444
00:46:14,197 --> 00:46:15,767
Hey, you could just try it once more.

1445
00:46:15,937 --> 00:46:17,837
Didn't she just fail?

1446
00:46:17,837 --> 00:46:19,567
No, it wasn't a failure. Young Ji should go now.

1447
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:20,737
- Who, me? - Yes, Young Ji.

1448
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,477
- The younger members... - I'm not useful at all.

1449
00:46:22,477 --> 00:46:23,937
This is "The Younger Girls' Challenge."

1450
00:46:23,937 --> 00:46:26,307
- Hey, Yu Jin. Applause. - Me? But I...

1451
00:46:26,347 --> 00:46:27,377
Seriously, that was impressive.

1452
00:46:27,377 --> 00:46:29,547
I thought Yu Jin would succeed for sure, so I forgot everything.

1453
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:31,417
(The Third Eldest's Challenge)

1454
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:32,987
- Young Ji should go. - But Young Ji is good too.

1455
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:33,987
Hang on. Strawberry...

1456
00:46:33,987 --> 00:46:35,757
(She's more talented than she seems.)

1457
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:38,957
For Young Ji, let's go with about 15 times.

1458
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,427
- Crush them with your spirit. - Was it this side for apple?

1459
00:46:40,427 --> 00:46:41,597
The other side. The other hand.

1460
00:46:41,857 --> 00:46:44,227
- Yes, that's it. - There you go. Good job.

1461
00:46:45,297 --> 00:46:46,667
(Dominating)

1462
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,597
- Intimidate him. You're doing well. - Crush them.

1463
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,637
Okay, here we go.

1464
00:46:50,337 --> 00:46:51,367
Intro!

1465
00:46:51,407 --> 00:46:53,107
- Strawberry, banana, apple, quince. - Quince.

1466
00:46:53,107 --> 00:46:54,937
- Strawberry, banana, apple, quince. - The hand...

1467
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:55,977
Apple!

1468
00:46:56,007 --> 00:46:57,637
Hang on. Someone said something...

1469
00:46:57,777 --> 00:46:59,577
Somebody asked me something...

1470
00:46:59,877 --> 00:47:03,177
(Who just made that sound?)

1471
00:47:03,177 --> 00:47:04,987
Someone asked me a question before I started.

1472
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:06,987
Oh, I used the wrong hand? I'm sorry.

1473
00:47:07,187 --> 00:47:08,757
I've been doing it like that all my life.

1474
00:47:08,757 --> 00:47:10,387
Let me try it once more. I'm sorry.

1475
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:12,087
- For apple? - Yes.

1476
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:13,357
Does it go like this?

1477
00:47:13,357 --> 00:47:14,827
Oh, sorry. I'm really sorry.

1478
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,997
I also... But you shouldn't do this to the player, should you?

1479
00:47:17,997 --> 00:47:20,067
Hey, but who asked you a question?

1480
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:21,937
It was Producer Hyun Yong. "That's the wrong hand for apple."

1481
00:47:21,937 --> 00:47:23,297
That pierced my eardrum so clearly.

1482
00:47:23,297 --> 00:47:24,337
I'm sorry.

1483
00:47:24,337 --> 00:47:25,507
- So, you're ready, right? - Yes.

1484
00:47:25,507 --> 00:47:27,707
- It's 15 times. - I have to do it 15 times?

1485
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:29,077
But I'm just a sloppy player. Why would you make me...

1486
00:47:29,077 --> 00:47:30,077
Intro!

1487
00:47:30,077 --> 00:47:31,447
(Young Ji tries once more.)

1488
00:47:31,877 --> 00:47:33,907
- Strawberry, banana, apple, quince. - Quince.

1489
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:34,926
Apple!

1490
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,240
- The intro. - Strawberry, banana, apple...

1491
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,050
- Quince. - Strawberry, banana, apple,

1492
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,750
- quince. - Apple.

1493
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:41,780
(Apple)

1494
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,880
- Quince. - Quince.

1495
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,120
- Quince. Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1496
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,220
- Banana. - Banana.

1497
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,290
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1498
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,890
- Strawberry. Quince. - Quince.

1499
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,890
- Apple. Quince. - Quince.

1500
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:51,890
Strawberry.

1501
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,560
(Strawberry)

1502
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,300
(Wrong)

1503
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,270
Goodness. I'm sorry.

1504
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:03,900
I'll join you when you go stealing.

1505
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,570
- Let's go together. - I'm sorry. Thank you so much.

1506
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:08,140
- Quince. - This is national-level sports.

1507
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,610
I'm exhausted.

1508
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,880
Is this it? Is there nothing left for us?

1509
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,880
What should we do?

1510
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,780
(Cheol Yong's surprise gift)

1511
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,450
It's ready. Come in.

1512
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,190
- This is really the final round. - It's a laptop.

1513
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,690
- I told you it would be a laptop. - I knew it.

1514
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,120
- Gosh, Young Ji. - Wait.

1515
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,960
- We need to practice. - This...

1516
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,360
Come in.

1517
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,690
How are you so good at it?

1518
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,460
If you succeed in this round,

1519
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,900
we'll pay for it.

1520
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,900
- Okay. - Okay.

1521
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,400
- If you don't, you have to... - Pay with our own money.

1522
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,570
pay for it yourselves.

1523
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,100
- Strawberry. - Strawberry.

1524
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,570
- Strawberry. Quince. - Quince.

1525
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:40,240
- Quince. - Apple. Banana.

1526
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,240
- Wrong! - Banana.

1527
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:42,910
Mimi.

1528
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,280
(Thanks to the smoothie master's outstanding performance,)

1529
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,250
(they each must pay 250 dollars.)

1530
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,190
You pay 700 dollars.

1531
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,890
(Intimidated)

1532
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,830
(They bought it with their money!)

1533
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,260
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1534
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,600
I didn't expect you to really buy it.

1535
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,670
- Akh. - Akh.

1536
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,230
- Good job today. - Thanks.

1537
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,540
Get some rest.

1538
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,900
We'll visit you at home and explain...

1539
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,940
- the Morning Mission soon. - Okay.

1540
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,170
- Come to our headquarters. - We'll have fun with this.

1541
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,170
- Okay, have fun. - Okay.

1542
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:16,040
- Thank you, akh. - Thank you, akh.

1543
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,280
Let's take some pictures with it.

1544
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,610
That sounds nice.

1545
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:23,080
- Unboxing. - Unboxing.

1546
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,520
(Amazed)

1547
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,790
- It's brand new. - What color?

1548
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:28,920
Look at the camera and say akh.

1549
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,060
- Akh. - Three, two, one.

1550
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,130
- Akh. - Akh.

1551
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,300
- It's customized for Abu Dhabi. - It's a local one.

1552
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,360
It's from this region.

1553
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,270
(A power plug for the Arab Emirates)

1554
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:44,340
(The keys are in English and Arabic.)

1555
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,670
Even when we go to other countries,

1556
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:47,810
- will the Arabic keys stay? - Yes.

1557
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,010
Doesn't this feel like merchandise in a way?

1558
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:51,110
It's a bit...

1559
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,750
It's so cool.

1560
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,720
(Watching the Super Bowl performance they missed)

1561
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,660
That's insane.

1562
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:13,500
That's so sexy.

1563
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,480
You can't help the shaking.

1564
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,680
You can't help it.

1565
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:39,490
(The members become one with the laptop.)

1566
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,530
(An ominous cut alluding to the passing of time)

1567
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,700
When you're wide awake like now,

1568
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,140
- Yes? - they start a difficult game.

1569
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,140
That's right.

1570
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,970
It's 2:30am in Korea.

1571
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,040
(It's 9:30pm in Abu Dhabi.)

1572
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,610
(The members are still singing.)

1573
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,080
Can we go in?

1574
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,120
(Singing)

1575
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,920
(They're still singing with the laptop.)

1576
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:06,390
Goodness.

1577
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,620
(Laughing)

1578
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,060
(She spots him.)

1579
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:13,990
We're having so much fun with it. Thanks a lot.

1580
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:15,060
I love it.

1581
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,900
- It's nice, right? - Yes.

1582
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:20,100
(Wait a minute. Let us finish the last song.)

1583
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,840
("Perfect Man" by SHINHWA)

1584
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,600
(Just leave them alone)

1585
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,710
(I'm sure my girl needs some time)

1586
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:29,410
(I'm sure Yeong Seok needs some time.)

1587
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:30,610
Who is he?

1588
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:32,950
- Lee Min Woo. - Lee Min Woo.

1589
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:35,980
(The staff members are ready and waiting for them.)

1590
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,980
Nothing.

1591
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,490
Let's perform this at the end of the year.

1592
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,150
- That sounds good. - That's a good idea.

1593
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,760
(The members are planning a year-end performance...)

1594
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,090
(at the start of the year.)

1595
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:50,400
(The chorus marks the end of Verse 1.)

1596
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:54,330
(Insane concentration)

1597
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,300
This is problematic.

1598
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,140
(She's the only one who heard him.)

1599
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,340
Let's wrap it up.

1600
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,510
- Let's stop. - Goodness.

1601
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,380
Thank you so much.

1602
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,750
- We're having so much fun. - You are, aren't you?

1603
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,420
The password is "Earth Arcade."

1604
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,980
- I see. - The problem is,

1605
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,290
the keyboard is Arabic,

1606
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,720
and I keep seeing Arabic ads on YouTube.

1607
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,490
Isn't it amazing to have a laptop?

1608
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,160
- Yes. - It is. I'm so happy. Akh.

1609
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:19,860
What have you done ever since you got your laptop?

1610
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,300
- We watched stuff on the laptop. - You watched stuff on it.

1611
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,530
- Yes, right up until just now. - I thought so.

1612
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:24,700
- Why? - Are we addicted?

1613
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,700
What are you going to do?

1614
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,240
(Instinctively feeling a sense of trepidation)

1615
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,670
We gave you the laptop to see what'd happen just in case.

1616
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,310
(Right after they got the laptop)

1617
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,750
(Just seeing it made them cheer.)

1618
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,110
(Look at the camera and say akh.)

1619
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,720
(They couldn't hide their excitement.)

1620
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,700
(They spent every second staring at the laptop for 2 hours.)

1621
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,860
(So we came up with this.)

1622
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,430
This is your Morning Mission.

1623
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:00,370
Morning Mission... Goodness.

1624
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,400
- I have a question. - Yes.

1625
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,510
You called us in one by one for every Morning Mission until now.

1626
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,570
So why...

1627
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:08,580
- Why are you announcing it here? - Is he going to do that now?

1628
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,180
No. It's a very simple mission.

1629
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,510
(Their Morning Mission is...)

1630
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:17,280
The theme of this Morning Mission is digital detox.

1631
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,960
By digital detox, we don't just mean your laptop.

1632
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,760
- Our phones. - We'll confiscate your phones.

1633
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:34,070
This isn't some kind of school camp. I'm 23, you know.

1634
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,600
I've long since graduated from school.

1635
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:40,910
- An Yu Jin. Agent An Yu Jin. - Teacher.

1636
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:42,280
- I already graduated. - You.

1637
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,610
- Young Ji looks very anxious. - Now...

1638
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,180
(Expected to feel most anxious)

1639
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,920
(Without their phones,)

1640
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,150
(what we're hoping to see is...)

1641
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,590
In this Mother Nature, in this beautiful desert,

1642
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,860
look at the nature, breathe in it,

1643
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,190
and become one with it.

1644
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,170
(Dear viewers, why don't you distance yourselves...)

1645
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,330
(from the digital world for a while too?)

1646
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,640
(Oops, the screen you're looking at right now is digital.)

1647
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,180
(I take that back.)

1648
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,620
(We'll stick to the initial plan. The members will be the only ones.)

1649
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,720
- Oh, dear. - Oh, dear.

1650
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,250
- You can spend such time... - Why is there a fly around you?

1651
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:30,920
(Buzzing)

1652
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,430
(A fly appears out of nowhere.)

1653
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:36,130
(He's already become one with nature.)

1654
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:37,260
Such a time...

1655
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,300
Wait, I have a question.

1656
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,930
Do we have an extra mission on top of this?

1657
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:44,300
Of course. We'll confiscate your phones and laptop.

1658
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,810
Tomorrow, at 8am.

1659
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,280
Relying purely on your senses,

1660
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,250
when you think it's exactly 8am,

1661
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,250
go to the carpeted area in the yard which has a Cheol Yong doll.

1662
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:59,550
Pick up the doll and shout, "Good morning."

1663
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:03,720
- That will be your 8am. - Good morning.

1664
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,560
The winner and the runner-up will get the phones back right away.

1665
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,560
What?

1666
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,460
(The winner and the runner-up can use their phones immediately.)

1667
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,630
We'll also return your laptop to those two.

1668
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:12,730
My goodness.

1669
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:16,100
As for those in 3rd and 4th places who are farther away from 8am,

1670
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,110
we will count every minute they're away from 8am as 1 hour...

1671
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,110
and keep their phones with us for those hours after the Mission.

1672
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,110
I might faint.

1673
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:24,240
- No. - The laptop...

1674
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,680
(For example)

1675
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,450
For example, let's say you got it at 7:57am, you at 7:55am,

1676
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:29,880
you at 8:08am,

1677
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,650
- and you at 8:20am. - Yes.

1678
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,590
Then 8:08am and 8:20am...

1679
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:36,760
- are in 3rd and 4th places. - That's right.

1680
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,990
- For those two, seven hours. - Eight hours.

1681
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,260
- For twenty minutes of difference, - Twenty hours.

1682
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,230
- it will be 20 hours. - No.

1683
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:46,400
We'll give you enough time to enjoy your digital detox.

1684
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,570
Must we guess 8am exactly?

1685
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:52,010
It'll be nice if you can, but it might be hard to do so.

1686
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,210
Probably, since we're human.

1687
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:54,210
Probably, since you're human.

1688
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:57,280
- We... - Is it okay to go there before 8am?

1689
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,980
- Where have you been? - What are you talking about?

1690
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,150
You can go at 7:57am,

1691
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,820
- but you'll be 3 minutes early. - The difference is 3 minutes.

1692
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,090
It's best to be as close as 8am.

1693
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:07,590
Yes. It doesn't matter if you're there before or after 8am.

1694
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:09,960
- Is there more? - In that state...

1695
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:11,790
- Wait. - Hold on.

1696
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,190
- You're being hasty. - Since when were you so obedient?

1697
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:14,590
- Don't take it away so fast. - I've been wanting to do...

1698
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,600
a digital detox.

1699
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,030
I'm very confident.

1700
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,200
- Hey. Why are you so confident? - Don't do that.

1701
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,430
- I'm very confident. - Why?

1702
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,370
- For this moment... - Yes.

1703
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,870
(Actually, Young Ji, since long ago...)

1704
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:26,210
(Their pre-meeting in February)

1705
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,270
(I really want to go to Mongolia. It'll make me stay away...)

1706
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,340
(from the Internet and improve my eyesight.)

1707
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,040
(There's this idea I keep saying, no.)

1708
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,780
(There's something I keep bringing up.)

1709
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,680
(Going on diet and digital detox. These two.)

1710
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,950
(Since before, Young Ji has wanted to do a digital detox.)

1711
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,250
(A while later)

1712
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,420
(We didn't know at that time.)

1713
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,860
(Young Ji without her electronic devices...)

1714
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,500
(is unstoppable.)

1715
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:55,870
(She can tell time even without an electronic device.)

1716
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:02,610
(The only way, the spirit of clocks)

1717
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:06,450
(To be revealed in 20 minutes and 18 seconds)

1718
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:08,780
Can't I just go to the palace with you, Producer Na?

1719
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,150
- What? - As a penalty.

1720
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,890
No. Do your digital detox.

1721
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,690
We've prepared things to help you estimate the time.

1722
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,460
- Allow me to show you these. - What are those?

1723
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,260
(Non-electronic time estimating set)

1724
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,890
- An hourglass. - Just in case.

1725
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,730
I don't know if you'll use these,

1726
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,300
but we got them ready just in case.

1727
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,270
- Starting now. - So you become close to nature.

1728
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:29,400
These measure 30 minutes and these measure 1 hour.

1729
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,210
(Black: 60 minutes, White: 30 minutes)

1730
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,510
This...

1731
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,710
If anyone is up for it, go ahead and use it.

1732
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:37,710
- What is it? - This...

1733
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:38,980
- What... - I don't know if it'll help.

1734
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,950
- It's a sundial. - Is it really a sundial?

1735
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,080
- It really is a sundial. - Really?

1736
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,850
They want us to become Jang Yeong Sil.

1737
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,450
(A wrist sundial, with a shout-out to Jang Yeong Sil)

1738
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,060
(Of course, you must build it yourself.)

1739
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,390
- Amazing. - Nice.

1740
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,990
Do you know how to make it?

1741
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,660
I'll try to make it. What can I do?

1742
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,130
No, this should be completely based on...

1743
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:58,470
- shamanism and the sixth sense. - Yes.

1744
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:00,070
I think we'll all rely on our sixth sense.

1745
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:01,300
- We must rely on our sixth sense. - Yes.

1746
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,240
- What time is it now? - It's 10:20pm.

1747
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,440
It's 10:20pm now.

1748
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,770
Make urgent calls for one minute.

1749
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,140
We'll take them from you after that.

1750
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:09,680
Start now.

1751
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,810
(One minute to use their phones starts now.)

1752
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:13,050
- Are you really calling your mom? - I should call Mom.

1753
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:14,350
- Are you really calling your mom? - Yes.

1754
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,520
(Eun Ji calls her mom.)

1755
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,550
- I'll text my director. - Okay.

1756
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,390
"Director, how are you doing?"

1757
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:23,320
"I'm going on a digital detox."

1758
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:25,630
Goodness.

1759
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,930
I sent. "I'm going on a digital detox."

1760
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,000
Where is Mimi?

1761
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,200
She's there making an emergency call.

1762
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
An emergency call.

1763
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,600
Nice. I made an urgent call...

1764
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,440
You must have a lot of people to call.

1765
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,810
(Yawning)

1766
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:41,640
(Yu Jin doesn't call anyone?)

1767
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:43,240
(There are only 10 seconds left.)

1768
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,540
An... Yu Jin.

1769
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,280
Don't you have anyone to call?

1770
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:47,610
Not really.

1771
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,750
Then you don't need your phone anyway.

1772
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,950
Still,

1773
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,220
- it gives me a sense of security. - Can I do this?

1774
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:55,020
- One minute is up. - I'm still on a call.

1775
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,420
Why?

1776
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:59,230
- Goodness, you. - It's over.

1777
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:01,090
Current time is 10:21pm.

1778
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,470
(They put their phones away in the box one by one.)

1779
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,470
Okay.

1780
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:11,300
- Is everyone done? - I'll lock it up.

1781
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:12,670
- Okay. - Closing it.

1782
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,240
Okay.

1783
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,310
(The phones are locked away with stickers to cover the screens.)

1784
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:16,480
This is sad.

1785
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,240
We were having so much fun...

1786
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,410
- with the laptop. - Exactly. They took it away.

1787
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,610
I can't listen to songs.

1788
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,880
We can't listen to songs or take selfies.

1789
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:25,450
I need to take selfies.

1790
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,590
I can't watch "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

1791
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:29,260
That's a huge blow.

1792
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:31,190
Do you own anything else...

1793
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:33,860
that shows time electronically?

1794
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,100
- No. I'd rather use the sundial. - What about my growling stomach?

1795
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,800
You must get rid of it. It's pretty accurate.

1796
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,830
My stomach is very accurate.

1797
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:39,930
- It's accurate. - I get hungry every four hours.

1798
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:40,970
Yes.

1799
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,770
- Intermittent fasting. - Is there nothing here?

1800
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:44,340
- Is there nothing to show time? - There isn't anything.

1801
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,940
(For the members who already got so used to the show,)

1802
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:50,140
(while they were playing the game...)

1803
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:54,350
We put a tape on every screen of electronic devices...

1804
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:56,020
that might indicate time.

1805
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,120
(Air conditioner monitor)

1806
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,990
(Phone)

1807
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:01,020
(Microwave monitor)

1808
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,260
Distance yourself from electronic devices...

1809
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,720
for the first time in a while.

1810
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,860
- Nice. - That's good.

1811
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,230
- Become one with nature. - I'm worried.

1812
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,760
- It's better this way. - Have fun doing that.

1813
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:10,630
See you at 8am in the morning.

1814
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:11,800
- Akh. - Good night.

1815
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,400
- Good night, akh. - Good night, akh.

1816
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,800
Just in case, it's 10:21pm now,

1817
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,870
and I'll flip it.

1818
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,140
(They can't see a digital clock from now on.)

1819
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:22,980
What time is it now?

1820
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,680
I flipped this at 10:21pm.

1821
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,080
It's 10:21pm?

1822
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,850
Enjoy spending time away from electronic devices.

1823
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:34,590
(Starting now is the time...)

1824
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:42,430
(to become one with nature.)

1825
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,370
(Starting the Morning Mission, Digital Detox)

1826
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:50,040
(Not you guys.)

1827
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,700
My goodness.

1828
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,570
- It feels... - Leave my house.

1829
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,740
I didn't mind it so much when I didn't use it,

1830
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,080
- But they're telling us not to. - but they're telling us not to.

1831
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,780
Now that I'm told not to use it, I feel strange.

1832
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,750
It's funny how we got the laptop only to have it taken away.

1833
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,320
Read the nutritional facts.

1834
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,520
- It's fun. - It's in Arabic.

1835
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,890
- It's in Arabic. - Oh, no.

1836
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:08,090
It's in Arabic.

1837
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:11,660
Tomorrow morning, we'll have a bloody war.

1838
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,930
Chang Dae, what time is it now?

1839
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,460
- Lee Young Ji. - Can I tell her now?

1840
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:15,900
No.

1841
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,060
(Laughing)

1842
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,700
I should just ask casually.

1843
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:21,730
They might slip up and tell me.

1844
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,770
I flipped it at 10:21pm,

1845
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:26,610
so it'll be 11:21pm by the time all the sand falls.

1846
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:28,070
Will you keep looking...

1847
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,180
- at the hourglass? - Yes.

1848
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,810
I'll meditate.

1849
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,810
Young Ji's face looks very funny from here.

1850
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,610
I can't take a picture of it.

1851
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:35,950
Exactly. It's so...

1852
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,450
- What are you doing? - Her eyes look very big.

1853
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:40,390
(We'll film it for you.)

1854
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:41,860
She looks really funny.

1855
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,190
(Mimi laughing)

1856
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,530
Right?

1857
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:47,960
The camera...

1858
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,700
(She bursts out laughing again.)

1859
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,500
Young Ji looks so funny.

1860
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,870
How cute.

1861
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,500
(We have no idea what her plan is.)

1862
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,470
- Just now... - You said it was 10:21pm.

1863
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:00,670
(Even as they talk,)

1864
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:03,780
(she heads back to the pot.)

1865
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,450
(Mimi's plan is...)

1866
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,280
I should make the sundial.

1867
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,750
I've wanted to try something like this.

1868
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:11,890
(Yu Jin's plan is making a wrist sundial.)

1869
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,190
Something like this that makes me look smart.

1870
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:17,220
(Yu Jin takes a wrist sundial kit.)

1871
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:19,960
Let's start.

1872
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:20,960
(She starts assembling it right away.)

1873
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,130
(Current situation: Sounding out the staff,)

1874
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:25,930
(using a hourglass, making a wrist sundial)

1875
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,870
What is this?

1876
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:29,140
(Crunch)

1877
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,370
The pictures aren't well-depicted.

1878
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:32,470
(Laughing)

1879
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,810
(Crunch)

1880
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,250
It's strange to see Young Ji this quiet.

1881
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,880
- I'm getting an allergic reaction. - Why are you so quiet?

1882
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,980
My personality has changed.

1883
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:46,850
You aren't really all that interested.

1884
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:47,850
(Laughing)

1885
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:51,060
I want them to dump us in the middle of a desert tomorrow.

1886
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,060
Why?

1887
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,330
And we have to find our way back to this place.

1888
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:55,500
(They are each doing the mission in their own ways.)

1889
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,830
I can contemplate like this.

1890
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,530
Do you like to contemplate, Young Ji?

1891
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:01,600
Yes, I do.

1892
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,970
Does anyone want to read?

1893
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,000
- Me. - Me.

1894
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,110
- I really want to. - I have a book.

1895
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:07,240
(They have something to spend their time doing.)

1896
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,640
- I love reading. - What is it?

1897
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,180
("The Race Is Long Anyway by Producer Na Yeong Seok")

1898
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,750
(They brought it without letting Yeong Seok know.)

1899
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:14,350
Eun Ji, pass it to them.

1900
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,450
(Eun Ji checks the book first.)

1901
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,020
It's already past.

1902
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,020
(Laughing)

1903
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,250
- I'll show you. - Okay.

1904
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,350
- Young Ji. - Yes.

1905
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,120
"The Race Is Long Anyway by Producer Na Yeong Seok."

1906
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,220
I've really wanted to read it.

1907
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,360
- Really? I'm glad. - Yes.

1908
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,430
I'll read the first line and see if it hits right.

1909
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,760
- Okay. - I'm a bit curious too.

1910
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,730
"The Race Is Long Anyway by Producer Na Yeong Seok."

1911
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:32,770
"Written by Na Yeong Seok."

1912
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:34,870
"My fellows running toward somewhere..."

1913
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:37,270
"with the engine of success on one chest."

1914
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,110
"Compared to me five years ago, did I become happier?"

1915
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:41,710
"My answer is, 'I'm not sure.'"

1916
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:43,310
"Becoming higher up in ranking..."

1917
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:44,380
"means you get to take others' credits more,"

1918
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,450
"no matter how nicely you put it."

1919
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:46,610
That's why he took our credit.

1920
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:49,150
"What if the cognitive dissonance worsens?"

1921
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,850
"Should I go to Iceland again?"

1922
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:53,250
"Should I wish upon the auroras again?"

1923
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:54,390
(Breathing in)

1924
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:56,720
"After living 5 more years, I learned 1 thing."

1925
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:58,420
"You can never be free of concerns."

1926
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:01,630
"What matters is whether you have the courage to face those concerns."

1927
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,630
"Whenever that happens, I remember Iceland."

1928
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:05,060
Iceland must've left a big impact on him.

1929
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,900
Is he Princess Aurora?

1930
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,040
Why does he bring up the aurora so often?

1931
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,440
(He is neither a princess nor an aurora.)

1932
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,740
There's a face of Lee Su Geun here.

1933
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,010
What about our faces?

1934
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,710
Sadly, I can't find our faces.

1935
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:17,340
- Ask him to rewrite it. - It was five years ago. Yes.

1936
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:18,780
"Both five years ago and now,"

1937
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,950
"what I want to tell exhausted employees remains the same."

1938
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:21,950
(Impressed)

1939
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,250
"The race is long anyway."

1940
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,890
"Having a short break isn't the end of the world."

1941
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:29,760
It feels like a very nice book.

1942
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,920
Exactly. It's fun.

1943
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,330
(Selected as a must-read book for car racers in 2032...)

1944
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:33,390
(by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport)

1945
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,930
- Eun Ji. - Yes?

1946
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:37,300
Would you press a 500-million-year button?

1947
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,630
Five hundred million years?

1948
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,600
- If you press the button, - Yes.

1949
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:43,040
- you get 10,000 dollars at once. - Okay.

1950
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,370
Instead, the moment you press it,

1951
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:46,710
you'll get sucked into an unknown space,

1952
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:48,240
and you must live there for 500 million years...

1953
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,610
without water, food, friends and whatnot.

1954
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,650
Instead, once you leave the place after 500 million years,

1955
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:53,850
you won't remember those years.

1956
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,750
Will you press the 500-million-year button?

1957
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,380
- I won't. - Why not?

1958
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,390
- I won't. - Why not?

1959
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,320
(It's not the answer Young Ji wanted to hear.)

1960
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,060
I'm happy with how my life is now.

1961
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,590
I won't remember you, Mimi,

1962
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:08,230
- and Yu Jin. - No.

1963
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,260
For you, if you press the 500-million-year button,

1964
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,900
you'll technically get 10,000 dollars just like that.

1965
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,630
But actually, as soon as you press the button,

1966
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:16,970
you get sucked into that space, live there for 500 million years,

1967
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:18,540
and come out without remembering all those years.

1968
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,240
(She finally understands.)

1969
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,640
- Will you press it? - I don't want to.

1970
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,740
Why won't you press it?

1971
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:24,640
It's...

1972
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,080
(Why won't you press it?)

1973
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,380
(Intense)

1974
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,320
I'll ask until you press it.

1975
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,480
What are you asking?

1976
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:32,790
Will you press the 500-million-year button?

1977
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:34,590
- No. - Why not?

1978
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:35,760
I'm afraid of challenges.

1979
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,990
What challenges?

1980
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:39,560
I don't want to get sucked into an unknown space.

1981
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,290
Why don't you want to get sucked into an unknown space?

1982
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:42,430
(She is slightly tired.)

1983
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,530
- I don't want to. - Why not?

1984
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,970
- I want to remember Young Ji. - Thank you.

1985
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:48,900
(Eun Ji, who didn't understand the concept until the end, wins.)

1986
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,040
I wanted to watch Rihanna's Super Bowl performance but couldn't.

1987
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,070
I'll perform it for you.

1988
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:56,340
- Work - No, you must do this first.

1989
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,050
(She takes over the stage just with her appearance.)

1990
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:04,650
(It's like the finals of Super Bowl.)

1991
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:07,120
(Watching from the 1st row)

1992
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,690
She is standing in for the laptop.

1993
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,590
To be honest...

1994
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:14,730
You don't need to do that.

1995
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,400
Wait. I'll look up another video.

1996
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,800
"Super Bowl, 'Crazy in Love' by Beyonce."

1997
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,440
Click.

1998
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,680
(This is how it's really like.)

1999
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:32,880
(Beyoungji is injured.)

2000
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,980
Please look up another video.

2001
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,350
I'm sorry. I hit my foot.

2002
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:38,250
"Earth Arcade, Lee Young Ji's legendary moments."

2003
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,990
Strawberry.

2004
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:43,190
Four strawberries.

2005
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:44,420
("Earth Arcade" Season 1, Episode 9)

2006
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:47,030
(It's even more touching than watching a movie in IMAX.)

2007
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:50,030
"Earth Arcade, Mimi's legendary moments."

2008
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,770
("Earth Arcade" Season 1, Episode 7)

2009
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,940
(Next video playing in 3 seconds, "An Yu Jin's legendary moments")

2010
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:59,110
"Earth Arcade, An Yu Jin's legendary moments."

2011
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:02,140
Do I look like An Yu Jin to you now?

2012
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,240
(Do I look like Yu Jin to you?)

2013
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,580
You're so good.

2014
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:08,710
"Earth Arcade, Lee Eun Ji's legendary moments."

2015
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:11,920
(Double V? "Earth Arcade" Season 1, Episode 2)

2016
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:14,650
I want to say "Turn off the camera," but I can't get it out properly now.

2017
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:17,690
IVE's "Attitude" performance.

2018
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:21,390
(It's our youngest Yu Jin's song.)

2019
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:23,730
(She makes a controlled head turn.)

2020
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,760
Look.

2021
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,770
(Her eyes are set on a clear path.)

2022
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:29,500
(My starting point flows differently from the ending.)

2023
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,940
- My emotional flow - My starting point

2024
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,840
Flows differently from the ending

2025
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,480
(I just drink regular Coke, instead of Coke Zero.)

2026
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,910
I want to watch something else.

2027
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,150
Iconic scenes from "Hospital Playlist."

2028
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,490
(Laughing)

2029
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:48,320
(Young Ji has never watched "Hospital Playlist.")

2030
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,520
(Cutting something)

2031
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:52,860
(Reality hits her.)

2032
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,460
I mean...

2033
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:56,430
Cutting, cutting, cutting.

2034
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,130
(Operating Room)

2035
01:07:58,130 --> 01:07:59,270
Dr. Chung Kyung Ho!

2036
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:01,100
What do I do now?

2037
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:02,600
What happens?

2038
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,970
Then, Dr. Cho Jung Seok goes like this.

2039
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,940
(I don't know, either)

2040
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:09,410
(She probably saw a clip about the characters being in a band.)

2041
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:11,240
I don't really know the characters.

2042
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,850
Then, Dr. Jeon Mi Do goes,

2043
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:14,380
You can't do it like this!

2044
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,480
Did you do CPR?

2045
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,220
What about the vital signs?

2046
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:18,250
(When you don't know, fake it with confidence.)

2047
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,690
Department of Artery Carotid, and Department of Radial Vein.

2048
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:22,660
Next is... Eastern District Prosecutors' Office.

2049
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:24,290
Who are you talking to?

2050
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:26,990
I'll stop doing "Hospital Playlist" now.

2051
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,660
Why have I become the TV all of a sudden?

2052
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:30,700
- I don't know. - There was nobody else?

2053
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,330
- I'll take over now. - Yes, please.

2054
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,300
(There will be a player substitution.)

2055
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:37,300
Oh Deul Hee from "I'm Sorry, I Love You."

2056
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,570
Mr. Cha!

2057
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,610
Aren't you going to eat ramyeon?

2058
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:43,510
(Quick pause. This is for those who haven't seen the drama series.)

2059
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,380
(Oh Deul Hee's iconic scene)

2060
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,180
(In the scene, Mr. Cha eats ramyeon Deul Hee cooked for him.)

2061
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:48,980
(But he leaves abruptly, and she washes the bowl he used.)

2062
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:50,550
(She finds herself lost in thought.)

2063
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,450
(Mr. Cha)

2064
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:55,020
(Oh Deul Hee)

2065
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,920
(She is the character Eun Ji has to play.)

2066
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:02,130
(He leaves without finishing his meal.)

2067
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:06,400
(Audrey Eun Ji returns to the empty kitchen.)

2068
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,700
Really...

2069
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,270
Why didn't you finish the ramyeon you asked me to cook?

2070
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,410
I'd better do the dishes.

2071
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:14,740
(Hesitating)

2072
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:18,840
What's wrong with me?

2073
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:21,580
Oh, no!

2074
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,650
(This is somewhere between comedy and drama.)

2075
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:23,680
What's wrong with me?

2076
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,220
(Correct answer screen)

2077
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:29,760
(Hesitating)

2078
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,030
(What's wrong with me?)

2079
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,230
(Her acting and lines are are almost totally in sync.)

2080
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,930
(This is the drama's most powerful scene.)

2081
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,600
(Here, long-suppressed emotions surge like a storm.)

2082
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:44,400
(This is the same scene.)

2083
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:46,740
(Dopey Deul Hee)

2084
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:49,340
- What's wrong with me? - Time for a change.

2085
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,580
Iconic scenes from "Something Happened in Bali."

2086
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:56,380
Hello! I'm your guide in Bali.

2087
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:58,250
My name is Soo Jung.

2088
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,250
("Something Happened in Bali")

2089
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:01,950
(This is a drama depicting a tragic and fatal love story...)

2090
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:03,560
(between four young people.)

2091
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,760
Right. I have to call Zo In Sung.

2092
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,160
(The sound of buttons being pressed)

2093
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:10,400
(Zo In Sung playing Jung Jae Min)

2094
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:12,030
Yes, what?
(Gasping)

2095
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,670
What are you doing now?

2096
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:17,870
Huh? Nothing much.

2097
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,170
(It feels new every time.)

2098
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,140
- That's all for now. - Okay.

2099
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:25,540
Iconic scenes from "Lovers in Paris."

2100
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:28,250
(Panting)

2101
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:30,580
(Eun Ji, the queen of dopey, gives her last dance.)

2102
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,850
Are you stupid?

2103
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:34,290
That guy is mine.

2104
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:35,590
Are you stupid?

2105
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:38,090
(She moves the audience from the very first line.)

2106
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:41,230
Why can't you say that he is your lover?

2107
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,300
How can I do that?

2108
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,270
(She pulls off the dual role perfectly.)

2109
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,100
- She's so good. - How can I do that?

2110
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,870
(Standing ovation)

2111
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:51,900
How can I...

2112
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:55,440
- She's so good. - How can I do that in this state?

2113
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,740
- She's so good. - How can I...

2114
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,410
(Passionate acting)

2115
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:01,750
- The kissing scene. - You're the best.

2116
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,120
- I'm turning off the TV now. - Yes, let's do that.

2117
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,150
(Vocalization)

2118
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:06,890
That was perfect.

2119
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:08,650
It really was perfect. It really was.

2120
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:10,290
(Ageless strength only seen on Earth Arcade)

2121
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:12,160
(Did you think that was the end?)

2122
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:15,800
Mimi's "Breathe" cover before her debut.

2123
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,270
Weird robot dance in zombie game.

2124
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,510
(Flashy)

2125
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:29,140
"As Life Goes On" from the musical by Eun Ji.

2126
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:34,980
(As life goes on)

2127
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,050
She's so good.

2128
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,190
(The staff, worn out from watching, begin to slip away one by one.)

2129
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:43,060
That audience is leaving.

2130
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,490
One, two...

2131
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:46,030
(Gasping)

2132
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:51,560
(It looks like there aren't many channels left.)

2133
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:55,300
I'll watch the last one before going to bed

2134
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:02,010
"The Seasons: Rainbow of Lee Young Ji" and tears.

2135
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:08,080
(She revisits the emotions she had back then.)

2136
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:09,380
(Laughing awkwardly)

2137
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:13,420
(Thank you for watching "Rainbow of Lee Young Ji.")

2138
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,650
- Let's go to bed. - We need the next TV.

2139
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,290
Please let's go to bed.

2140
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:19,560
Where's Hyun Yong TV?

2141
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,230
- She's even calling out the staff. - He's not here.

2142
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,730
Hyun Yong TV, please turn on the power.

2143
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:26,730
- Hyun Yong TV. - Hyun Yong TV.

2144
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,830
(This is the downside of digital detox.)

2145
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,510
(I'm just worried you might have forgotten.)

2146
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,070
(Right now, we are on Morning Mission to get up at 8am,)

2147
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:36,710
(through "Digital Detox.")

2148
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:38,840
(We're not playing around.)

2149
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:40,950
We can see through the window now.

2150
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:43,480
I was filming because it looks so pretty now.

2151
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,150
Please turn on Hyun Yong TV.

2152
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:47,850
Did it look like a real TV?

2153
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:49,960
Young Ji, ask me to do something again.

2154
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,460
- I'm going in. - You are?

2155
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:53,760
- Wasn't it over? - Search for Eun Ji TV.

2156
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:57,560
(Due to soundproofing issues, this is a silent musical.)

2157
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,030
She's doing "Chicago."

2158
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:01,730
(The last round is the musical "Chicago.")

2159
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,800
The name

2160
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,010
- On everyone's lips - On everyone's lips

2161
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:10,410
- It's Roxie - It's Roxie

2162
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:11,940
There's someone doing the dubbing.

2163
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:13,980
(Silent-film narrator in Abu Dhabi)

2164
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:16,080
It's Roxie

2165
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,750
(The backstage feels a bit empty.)

2166
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:21,620
(Is she giving up halfway?)

2167
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:24,520
Have you hit a rut?

2168
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:25,990
I can't see properly from here.

2169
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:27,560
- You can't see? - Not from here.

2170
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,460
I have to do this.

2171
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,900
(From inside, it was basically a mirror.)

2172
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:33,100
I need one person.

2173
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:34,970
(Young Ji answers her call for backup without missing a beat.)

2174
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:36,170
- I'm going. She's burned out. - I see.

2175
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:37,400
- I knew it. - Okay.

2176
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:38,770
(Just like that, the strongest ones in the universe reunite.)

2177
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:40,070
Sit down, you goof.

2178
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,480
(Young Ji plays Billy Flynn, and Eun Ji plays Roxie Hart.)

2179
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:45,140
Sit down, stupid!

2180
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,680
Where are you from?

2181
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,580
- Mississippi - Mississippi

2182
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,120
What about your parents?

2183
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,050
- They're filthy rich - Rich

2184
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:54,890
Where are they?

2185
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:56,190
In their graves

2186
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:57,920
Looking for a new chance

2187
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,960
I went to the convent

2188
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,530
(Facing a crisis)

2189
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,930
(From a distance, it looks like a comedy.)

2190
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:08,700
(Even up close, it's still a comedy.)

2191
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,540
(Look even closer, and it's a total clash.)

2192
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:15,270
What are they doing?

2193
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,810
(Muted laughter)

2194
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:20,250
They're driving me crazy.

2195
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,380
(Total chaos)

2196
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,280
(The end)

2197
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,750
This is kind of embarrassing.

2198
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:28,050
Are they watching?

2199
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,290
- Are they watching? - They are.

2200
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:31,720
(She is exhausted from laughing.)

2201
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:33,960
That's curtain call.

2202
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:37,400
(We never skip the curtain call.)

2203
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,970
(As always, it ends with a dance for the audience.)

2204
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,840
(And now a fight?)

2205
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:46,940
(They wrap up with a slapstick ending.)

2206
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:49,240
(Young Ji wins.)

2207
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,410
Great job.

2208
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,410
Nobody says anything inside.

2209
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:56,850
So the vibe is very tense.

2210
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:00,720
This is so funny. I don't think I need a TV.

2211
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:02,660
Get some rest, everyone.

2212
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:05,890
But honestly, I don't think we're going to use the sundial.

2213
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,730
Or the hourglass either. What do we do?

2214
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:09,430
I'm already using the sundial.

2215
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:10,630
- You are? - You are?

2216
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:12,100
What? You're already doing it?

2217
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:13,300
Where's your sundial?

2218
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:14,800
It's there somewhere.

2219
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,900
(Do you want to know where it is?)

2220
01:15:17,370 --> 01:15:19,100
(While the others were chatting away,)

2221
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,710
(she already completed the wrist sundial.)

2222
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:25,110
(Taking the sundial she finished in secret,)

2223
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,050
(An Yu Genius calmly strolls out.)

2224
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:33,320
(She walks all the way to the far end of the yard.)

2225
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:36,660
Here...

2226
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,020
(First, she adjusts the compass attached to the sundial.)

2227
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,190
What am I supposed to do now?

2228
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,290
(It's Yu Jin's first time with a sundial, too.)

2229
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:43,630
I'm done.

2230
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:45,530
Here.

2231
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:47,430
What if it flies off?

2232
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,540
Wait a minute. What should I do?

2233
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:52,200
(Will Yu Jin's sundial make it through the night?)

2234
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,940
What will I do if it breaks?

2235
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,880
But I have my own method.

2236
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,680
It's something I do when I go out at dawn.

2237
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:01,550
If I punch my pillow before going to sleep, I say,

2238
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:05,250
"Wake up at 8am!" I really wake up at 8am.

2239
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:07,490
Even when you are in another country?

2240
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,050
Is it your own...

2241
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:11,520
I've never tried it in another country.

2242
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,490
There has to be a few days for it to work.

2243
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:16,330
You're punching the pillow to leave behind a strong energy.

2244
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,330
"Wake up at 8am!" You really wake up when you do this.

2245
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:22,300
But now, since I haven't adjusted...

2246
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,840
to Abu Dhabi's biorhythm, I'm not really sure about this.

2247
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,740
I did think whether I should go by the local time...

2248
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,110
or stick to Korean time.

2249
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,310
(Current Status: Yu Jin is assembling the sundial.)

2250
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:32,710
(Yu Jin has completed the sundial and now punching pillows.)

2251
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:35,480
- I'm sleepy. - You're the one.

2252
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:36,750
I'm going to bed.

2253
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:40,820
(One by one, they head back to their rooms...)

2254
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:42,920
(to wake up before 8am.)

2255
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:50,830
(Just then, one person heads outside.)

2256
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,830
I will now...

2257
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:56,140
entrust myself entirely to the many spirits I have believed in.

2258
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:58,170
There are all sorts of random spirits.

2259
01:16:58,170 --> 01:16:59,740
The spirit of feng shui.

2260
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,940
Then there are other spirits.

2261
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,340
(Then there are other spirits.)

2262
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:09,010
(What other spirit?)

2263
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:10,920
Do you believe in Clock Spirit?

2264
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:13,020
Do you believe in shamanism?

2265
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:16,990
I will show you what really happens...

2266
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:18,020
when you believe in shamanism.

2267
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:20,390
Your hair and hat right now are totally shamanistic.

2268
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:24,400
I'll come back exactly at 8am.

2269
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,500
(Current Status: Hourglass)

2270
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:28,170
(Now Young Ji is going for Clock Spirit.)

2271
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:30,200
Have a good sleep and we'll meet tomorrow morning.

2272
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,800
I can't afford to sleep now.

2273
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,670
- Why not? - I need to channel shaman energy.

2274
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:36,140
I'll need to take action. Please just go to bed.

2275
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:37,140
Wait a second.

2276
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:38,680
Who wore this hat?

2277
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:40,210
Yu Jin did.

2278
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,420
I need to layer this up.

2279
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:47,720
Like this.

2280
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,320
What do you think?

2281
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,760
(Act 1. Contacting the Clock Spirit)

2282
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,460
- I see the time! It's 10:03pm. - What?

2283
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:55,390
Just messing with you.

2284
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,760
(Her acting has improved.)

2285
01:17:58,760 --> 01:17:59,770
How was I right now?

2286
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:01,770
Do you think I can be cast for the "Reply" series?

2287
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:03,340
- What do you think? - Maybe.

2288
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:04,970
(Great.)

2289
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:08,710
She's scary. We need to stay sharp.

2290
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,740
I can see the time. It must be 11:11pm now.

2291
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:15,150
- How do you know? - I just know.

2292
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:16,450
How do you know?

2293
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:18,880
- How? - Just believe in shamanism.

2294
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,250
Where's the spirit?

2295
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:23,060
Jump right now. Jump, Eun Ji!

2296
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,090
(Eun Ji is Comedy Spirit. Young Ji is Clock Spirit.)

2297
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:27,560
If you believe in me, you'll see the time.

2298
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:32,030
If you believe in me, time will follow me.

2299
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:34,670
It will follow me.

2300
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,070
Jang Yeong Sil's sundial is also useless.

2301
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:41,370
- Are you... - Are you planning to do that...

2302
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:42,910
until eight in the morning?

2303
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,280
(She did it and is now feeling awkward.)

2304
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,680
- Come on. - I just go around like this.

2305
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,720
What time is it now?

2306
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,250
It's 11:12pm.

2307
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:53,750
- Is it really 11:12pm? - It is.

2308
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,850
- Are you sure? - I am.

2309
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:57,760
I'll take a guess.

2310
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,560
(Vocalization)

2311
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,160
That was accurate.

2312
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:05,100
You don't need the sundial

2313
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,400
You just have to look at the staff's watch

2314
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:10,640
When they pass by, shoot sneak glances

2315
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,410
Aim for the back of their head

2316
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:16,380
- I don't need the sundial - You don't need it

2317
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:19,240
- I don't need the fire dial - You don't need it

2318
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,250
- Throw away the analogue - Throw it away

2319
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:25,180
- Throw away the digital too - Throw it away

2320
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:27,590
Tal, tal, tal, tal, digital

2321
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:30,520
- Tal, tal, tal, tal, leg hair - Tal, tal

2322
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:33,390
- Tal, tal, tal, tal, leg hair - Tal, tal

2323
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:36,460
- It's coming. - Tal, tal, tal, tal, armpit hair

2324
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,200
- It's coming - Tal, tal, tal

2325
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,560
- That being is coming - Side body hair

2326
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,030
- It's coming - Tal, tal, tal

2327
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:42,200
- It's coming - Sideburn hair

2328
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,740
(Vocalization)

2329
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,240
(Act 3. Making the Most of the Terrain)

2330
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,910
Looking at the flow of the water

2331
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,210
It's 11pm

2332
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:52,880
(She's even figured out the flow of the pool water.)

2333
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,750
- Let me see! - It's 11pm.

2334
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,780
- What time is it? - Look at her.

2335
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:58,450
- What time is it? - It's 11pm.

2336
01:19:58,650 --> 01:19:59,920
- There! - Oh, my!

2337
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,320
Judging by the splash of the water

2338
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:05,520
It's 11:14.39 pm

2339
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,290
Judging by the splash of the water

2340
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:11,200
- It will soon be 11:15pm - All right.

2341
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,830
The flow is very good

2342
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:16,070
We just have to do this for 12 more hours

2343
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:19,000
Like this for just 12 more hours

2344
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:22,170
- Let's do this - When are we going to bed?

2345
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:24,240
(Mimi woke up because of the noise.)

2346
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,810
Clock Spirit is coming

2347
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:28,650
- Go to sleep. - It's coming

2348
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:30,580
- Present time is - Master, show us...

2349
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:32,120
your psychic powers.

2350
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,850
- Present time... - Present time is...

2351
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:37,360
It is 11:22pm.

2352
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,560
(It is 11:22pm now.)

2353
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,230
- I got it right! - She got it!

2354
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:44,230
- Clock Spirit got it right. - She got it.

2355
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:45,530
- It's 11pm. - I can see it.

2356
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:47,730
- I can really see it. - Yes.

2357
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,130
(They really saw the time?)

2358
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:50,440
- I can see it. - We can see it.

2359
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,600
I can really see it.

2360
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:55,410
I'm messing with you!

2361
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:57,510
(Was it reflected on the lens?)

2362
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,110
(He runs away.)

2363
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:02,910
We fooled them completely

2364
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:05,920
- We messed with them - We messed with them

2365
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,690
- Humans are so easy - They're easy

2366
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:11,090
- We messed with them - We messed with them

2367
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:14,290
Humans of the world, they are hopeless.

2368
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,330
- All of you.. - Do you believe?

2369
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:19,870
- You're hopeless. - Do you believe in Clock Spirit?

2370
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:22,770
Guess who's going to win tomorrow.

2371
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:24,170
I can tell you that with the energy of water.

2372
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:26,640
Okay... Tomorrow...

2373
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,770
- Who will... - Splash me with water.

2374
01:21:27,770 --> 01:21:30,310
Tell us who will win tomorrow.

2375
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:32,180
Splash water accurately on my socks.

2376
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:35,880
So, who will be the winner?

2377
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,150
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)

2378
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:40,650
(Calm down.)

2379
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:43,920
(The meeting is over. Everyone, go back in.)

2380
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,360
- Good night. - Good night.

2381
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:50,360
(Even Yu Jin, who came out late, goes back into the room.)

2382
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,800
(Slowly...)

2383
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,800
(the door closes.)

2384
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,800
It's 8am.

2385
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:01,640
I'll wake up at 8am.

2386
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,810
At 8am.

2387
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:08,280
At 8am.

2388
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:10,820
What is it?

2389
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,320
Yu Jin will wake up at 8am.

2390
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:15,120
Yu Jin will wake up at 8am.

2391
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,260
- She's Sundial Spirit. - Yu Jin will wake up at 8am.

2392
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:19,160
Yu Jin will wake up at 8am.

2393
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,290
(What is this pose and why?)

2394
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:23,860
I'll wake up at 8am, Abu Dhabi time.

2395
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:28,600
Wake up at 8am.

2396
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:30,400
What are you doing?

2397
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,900
I'm going to wash up.

2398
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,310
I've already washed.

2399
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:34,640
I envy you.

2400
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,540
(Older girls go to bed.)

2401
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:39,540
(Young Ji and Mimi)

2402
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:42,510
(They drift off to the land of dreams.)

2403
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:45,520
(Present time is 12:30am.)

2404
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:49,050
(One by one, the production crew clears out.)

2405
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,220
(The door closes.)

2406
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:57,400
(As if something is entering,)

2407
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:01,030
(the door opens on its own.)

2408
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:07,770
(What result will Young Ji's magic spell bring?)

2409
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,840
(Mimi and Young Ji's room)

2410
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:12,840
(Present time is 1am.)

2411
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,280
(Young Ji and Mimi)

2412
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:17,420
(At 1,200 times the speed)

2413
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:19,150
(Present time is 2:01am.)

2414
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:20,990
(Young Ji wakes up a little.)

2415
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:24,220
(At 2,400 times the speed)

2416
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:26,590
(Present time is 4:01am.)

2417
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,490
(She keeps waking up.)

2418
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:31,530
(Mimi ends up tossing and turning too.)

2419
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:33,060
(Looking)

2420
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:34,770
(At 2,400 times the speed)

2421
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:36,400
(Young Ji and Mimi)

2422
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:40,070
(Present time is 6:13am.)

2423
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:41,210
(Young Ji)

2424
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:43,280
(Rubbing her eyes)

2425
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:47,180
(She's waking up every 2 hours.)

2426
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:51,380
(As she continues to toss and turn,)

2427
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:56,420
(the pitch-black darkness lifts.)

2428
01:23:56,590 --> 01:23:57,690
(Eun Ji and Yu Jin's room)

2429
01:23:57,690 --> 01:24:01,730
(Yu Jin)

2430
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:03,330
(The living room)

2431
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:06,770
(Yu Jin is the first to wake up.)

2432
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:10,370
(As soon as she sits down,)

2433
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:12,800
(the door opens quietly.)

2434
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,640
(The staff clocked in right away.)

2435
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:18,980
(The alert mode...)

2436
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:22,610
(is instantly deactivated.)

2437
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:24,050
Did you sleep well?

2438
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:25,880
It must be 6am at least.

2439
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:27,350
You think?

2440
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:28,850
(Yu Jin bursts out laughing at the staff.)

2441
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:30,090
I need a microphone.

2442
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:32,360
(Changing her microphone)

2443
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:35,890
(Staring intently)

2444
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:38,030
(Instant blocking)

2445
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:40,730
(The first thing Yu Jin does...)

2446
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:43,770
(is to check outside.)

2447
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:46,570
(The sun hasn't fully risen yet.)

2448
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:49,340
(It's a bit cloudy.)

2449
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,880
(Her analysis is complete.)

2450
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:57,120
(She turns over the 30-minute hourglass first.)

2451
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,980
(She glances at the staff for cues.)

2452
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,320
(She covers her watch with her sleeve.)

2453
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:03,890
(She's covering her phone screen.)

2454
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,690
(Pretending not to know anything)

2455
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:09,490
(So stingy!)

2456
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,130
I have to put on my makeup.

2457
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:18,170
(She starts to put on her makeup.)

2458
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:20,040
(Glaring)

2459
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,240
What time do you think it is?

2460
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,840
(Being evil)

2461
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:28,210
(Let me see.)

2462
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:30,180
I think it's around six.

2463
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,480
Maybe 6:20am?

2464
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,050
(I'm not going to tell you.)

2465
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:36,550
If it's 6:20am now,

2466
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:39,290
and considering that this lasts for 30 minutes...

2467
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:41,690
(She calculates that when the sand empties, it will be 6:50am.)

2468
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:44,060
When I turn this over again, it will be 7:50.

2469
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:48,200
I'll go outside and check out what the staff is doing.

2470
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,600
(Humming)

2471
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,970
I'll put on my makeup.

2472
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,340
(Was Yu Jin's estimation correct?)

2473
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:58,240
(Time flows and dawn finally breaks.)

2474
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,050
(Eun Ji wakes up.)

2475
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:03,050
I know.

2476
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:05,180
(Looking back)

2477
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,020
(Stumbling)

2478
01:26:09,450 --> 01:26:11,990
(Something fearsome has awakened.)

2479
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:15,660
(She hurriedly heads out.)

2480
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,700
(She walks straight ahead as if in a trance.)

2481
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:19,300
Where are you going?

2482
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,230
(She's a little scared.)

2483
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:22,470
Where are you going?

2484
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:25,970
(Eun Ji goes outside without answering.)

2485
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:35,280
(Yu Jin follows her out.)

2486
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:40,920
(Doing performance art numerous times)

2487
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:42,790
(Here,)

2488
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:44,460
(one more person is joining in.)

2489
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:47,360
Clock Spirit, Clock Spirit.

2490
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,530
Clock Spirit, Clock Spirit.

2491
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:52,330
Look.

2492
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,640
We have to think carefully about the time we went to the restaurant.

2493
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:59,700
They said, "It opens at 8am."

2494
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:00,710
Right.

2495
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:03,480
(This was 8am yesterday in Abu Dhabi.)

2496
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,540
(Compared to that,)

2497
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:07,350
(it looks a bit early now.)

2498
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,850
The temperature and air,

2499
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:09,980
- at this time of day... - I know, right?

2500
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:11,320
Abu Dhabi!

2501
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,680
I think this package tour is a scam!

2502
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:15,320
- Abu Dhabi! - Abu Dhabi!

2503
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:16,620
(Let me think.)

2504
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:17,860
(Eyes opening)

2505
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:22,230
I think it'll be around 6:50am now.

2506
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:25,030
But they said the sun would rise at 6:50am.

2507
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:27,830
The sun rises at 6:50am?

2508
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:28,870
Yes.

2509
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:30,600
The sunrise is at 6:50am.

2510
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,240
(The sunrise in Abu Dhabi was 6:50am while we were filming.)

2511
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:36,240
(Right now, the sky is slowly getting brighter.)

2512
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,440
This leaves us no choice.

2513
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:41,410
(Going back to her performance art)

2514
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:43,380
Eun Ji, you're not going to tell the fortune?

2515
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,450
Use water.

2516
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:45,750
I need Young Ji for that.

2517
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:48,750
Let's see, Clock Spirit...

2518
01:27:49,350 --> 01:27:50,360
Let's see here...

2519
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:52,260
What time is it right now?

2520
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,260
(Spraying)

2521
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,960
(Connecting with the spirit of clocks)

2522
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,900
(Shaking)

2523
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,000
What time is it?

2524
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:01,200
It's 6:42am!

2525
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,100
(It's 6:42am!)

2526
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,670
Then I shall go inside.

2527
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,340
- Why? - It's too cold.

2528
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:07,410
Are you going back to bed?

2529
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:08,740
No, I'll just grab a jacket.

2530
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:12,510
(It's exactly 6:42am!)

2531
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:14,480
(11 minutes ago)

2532
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:17,650
(When the staff asked Yu Jin for the time)

2533
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,080
I think it's around six.

2534
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,250
Maybe 6:20am?

2535
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:29,190
(And...)

2536
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:31,260
(with her hourglass technique,)

2537
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:33,600
(she gets high accuracy.)

2538
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:36,370
(An Yu Genius)

2539
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:38,200
(Meanwhile)

2540
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:42,410
(Mimi and Young Ji's room)

2541
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:45,810
(Mimi gets up...)

2542
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:48,650
(and goes to the shower.)

2543
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:51,250
(Waking up)

2544
01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:54,050
(The spirit of clocks emerges.)

2545
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:55,790
The spirit of clocks!

2546
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:58,420
What time is it right now?

2547
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,860
- Spirit... - It's...

2548
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:02,060
(Right now...)

2549
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:03,560
(she's connecting to the spirit world.)

2550
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,260
(Pondering)

2551
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:12,900
Clock Spirit, you have risen.

2552
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,640
No, the spirit isn't awake yet.

2553
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,640
(No, the spirit isn't awake yet.)

2554
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,340
- It's just you, Young Ji? - Yes.

2555
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:20,010
- The spirit didn't wake up yet. - She's not here yet.

2556
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,810
I woke up so many times last night, and it was horrible.

2557
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,680
Were you possessed?

2558
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,650
I really thought I was, too.

2559
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:29,690
I had a bad dream, too.

2560
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:34,430
(The weather today looks bad too.)

2561
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:37,900
Look, the sun!

2562
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:42,870
(It does look brighter than before.)

2563
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:46,170
(And they start to become restless.)

2564
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:47,270
Wait, yesterday...

2565
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:49,270
(Thinking)

2566
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:52,080
But yesterday at sunrise, wasn't it...

2567
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:55,210
It was 8am. We went to the restaurant at 8am.

2568
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:58,750
But right now, it seems like...

2569
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:00,180
You know,

2570
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:02,820
around the time we took that picture at the photo spot.

2571
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:05,860
- Right now? - Yes, before we got food.

2572
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:08,130
- That was... - It was around 7:40am.

2573
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:10,600
(Yesterday)

2574
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:12,330
(When they were arguing...)

2575
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:15,670
(about getting off the bus at the photo spot...)

2576
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:20,570
(and decided to get off anyway...)

2577
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:25,110
(It was exactly 7:37am.)

2578
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:26,910
It was around 7:40am.

2579
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:29,550
(Intriguing information)

2580
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:31,780
I think it's now.

2581
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:34,450
I think it's 8am right now.

2582
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:36,850
- Really? You think so? - Yes.

2583
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:38,590
- You're going? - Yes.

2584
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:39,920
- Are you going to guess? - Yes.

2585
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:40,930
(She suddenly goes to give it a go.)

2586
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:42,930
Young Ji really looks like a shaman.

2587
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,730
Even her walk!

2588
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:47,230
She walks like a shaman, too.

2589
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,940
(She's headed for the spot near the rooms,)

2590
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:54,070
(the Good Morning Base where Cheol Yong is.)

2591
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:55,370
(Every minute off from 8am...)

2592
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:58,010
(means an hour of their phones taken for the 3rd and 4th places.)

2593
01:30:58,410 --> 01:31:00,710
(Will Young Ji...)

2594
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:03,550
(be able to retrieve her phone?)

2595
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:06,420
I was distracted by mere mortals,

2596
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,990
so I might be off by a minute or so.

2597
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:10,660
But it feels like 8am.

2598
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:14,330
Shout "Good morning" out loud, please.

2599
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:16,660
Good morning, Clock Spirit!

2600
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,700
She's a shaman.

2601
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:22,570
Good morning, Spirit of Clocks!

2602
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:24,340
(Young Ji is the first to say good morning.)

2603
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,640
(Meanwhile)

2604
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,840
It's 8:30am.

2605
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:29,710
I should keep checking.

2606
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:31,240
It's 10:30am...

2607
01:31:31,510 --> 01:31:37,080
(She's muttering incomprehensible words.)

2608
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,880
(Lying down)

2609
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:41,690
(Springing back up)

2610
01:31:41,690 --> 01:31:44,360
So the two people who answered closest to 8am...

2611
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:45,860
are 1st and 2nd places, right?

2612
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:50,160
(You should really understand the rules by now.)

2613
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,260
I just hope to be in second place!

2614
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:56,730
I think Young Ji and I will come in last together.

2615
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,300
I should get a blanket.

2616
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:05,410
(Reorganizing her spot)

2617
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:06,810
It's not time yet.

2618
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:08,550
(Going back and forth)

2619
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:12,920
Countries with hot summers are really sunny around 8am.

2620
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,690
(Countries with hot summers are really sunny around 8am.)

2621
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:17,590
Should I go when it's sunny?

2622
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:20,560
(Should I go when it's sunny?)

2623
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,860
It was sunny yesterday.

2624
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:24,360
(Stream of consciousness)

2625
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,730
I think Yu Jin might try soon.

2626
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:33,910
(Mimi grows deep in thought...)

2627
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:37,280
(while her eyelids start to close.)

2628
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:41,250
(Zooming in to check whether she's asleep or thinking)

2629
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:49,420
(The camera is confused.)

2630
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:52,220
What?

2631
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:55,760
(Meanwhile, Young Ji goes to the room.)

2632
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:57,860
(Turning)

2633
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:02,070
Clock Spirit.

2634
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:04,970
Please save these poor souls.

2635
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,140
Clock Spirit.

2636
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,840
Please save these poor souls!

2637
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,580
(Standing up)

2638
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:13,780
(Bewitched into participating)

2639
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:15,150
Clock Spirit.

2640
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:17,750
Do you have faith in the spirit of clocks?

2641
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:18,780
Yes, I believe!

2642
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:20,850
You all shouldn't be so nervous.

2643
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:25,120
Mortals cannot fight the ticking of the clock!

2644
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:26,660
(The ticking of the clock)

2645
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:28,190
Where is it?

2646
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:30,830
I already guessed, so...

2647
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:32,360
(Yu Jin only has faith in her hourglass.)

2648
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:35,500
For me, when this hourglass runs out...

2649
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:38,900
You're going to guess when it runs out?

2650
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:40,510
- No. - You're not?

2651
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:42,210
I plan to flip it one more time.

2652
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:44,710
So you think it's around 7am right now.

2653
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:47,610
- No, I think it's 7:30am... - You foolish mortal!

2654
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:49,480
(You foolish mortal!)

2655
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:51,020
This is why I said you'll come in last place.

2656
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:53,350
I think it'll be around 7:40am...

2657
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:55,520
or 7:50am.

2658
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:58,490
(The staff remains silent.)

2659
01:33:58,790 --> 01:34:04,100
Keep your expressions straight, staff members!

2660
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,260
It is past 8am.

2661
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:07,670
Director, your watch!

2662
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,800
I see it, I can see it!

2663
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,500
I can see the watch!

2664
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:15,310
- Take it off, Won Seok. - I see the watch.

2665
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:17,680
Clock Spirit, I enjoyed your stories last night.

2666
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:18,880
What have you heard?

2667
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,650
I heard you guessed things like if people had boyfriends or pets,

2668
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:21,950
and you got them all right.

2669
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:23,610
- Mighty Clock Spirit! - I did, I guessed them right.

2670
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,150
(Connecting to the spiritual world again)

2671
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:28,450
Clock Spirit!

2672
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:29,690
(Sprinkling sand)

2673
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:31,220
Will she...

2674
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:33,020
(Coughing)

2675
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:35,730
Why don't you guess the camera operator's MBTI?

2676
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:37,730
- I will guess his MBTI. - Go ahead.

2677
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:39,200
I won't rely on physiognomy.

2678
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,870
- Guess, Spirit. - I will focus on the clock.

2679
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,630
I think,

2680
01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:45,840
- ESTP... - He is?

2681
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,940
I mean, ESTJ.

2682
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:48,770
ESTJ!

2683
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:49,910
Is it truly...

2684
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:52,080
It's ISTJ!

2685
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:54,280
What is your MBTI?

2686
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,350
I'm ENFP.

2687
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:58,120
- ENFP! - You got everything wrong!

2688
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,150
Nothing right!

2689
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:02,290
You had it the other way around!

2690
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:03,890
(Guessing completely wrong is actually harder.)

2691
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:06,390
(Once again,)

2692
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:07,860
(the game is to guess the time.)

2693
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:10,390
Going to see the sun!

2694
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:14,000
Here it is.

2695
01:35:15,330 --> 01:35:18,700
I think that part should be brighter.

2696
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:21,140
I should go when it feels like...

2697
01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:24,540
"Bruce Almighty" or "Constantine."

2698
01:35:24,980 --> 01:35:27,210
I think that won't be for another 20 minutes...

2699
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,510
Gosh, it's raining again!

2700
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:30,980
- Clock Spirit! - Yes?

2701
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:33,450
Clock Spirit! It has started to rain!

2702
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:35,650
And the sun is rising!

2703
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:38,120
Do you believe in the spirit of clocks?

2704
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,890
I do! Tick-tock!

2705
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,530
Do you believe?

2706
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:42,530
Tick-tock!

2707
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:44,500
Come down here and sign up!

2708
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,330
Sign up where?

2709
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:48,500
I meant the good morning thing!

2710
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,300
The spirit smells fishy to me.

2711
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:54,070
I don't think it's 8am now. It'll be a while.

2712
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:57,410
I think that spirit is totally crazy.

2713
01:35:57,410 --> 01:35:58,840
(Laughing)

2714
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,910
(Coming to her senses)

2715
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:03,850
Who is she, asking us to believe?

2716
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:05,380
And calling us foolish mortals?

2717
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:07,490
Look, the sun isn't up yet.

2718
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:09,120
I don't think it's time.

2719
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,320
(The reality is clear to her now.)

2720
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,260
I can really feel it up here.

2721
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:14,460
- Hey, spirit! - Yes?

2722
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:16,260
Looking at the sky from here,

2723
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:18,560
I think you guessed at 7am.

2724
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:20,460
(Avoiding)

2725
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:22,200
Hear, hear!

2726
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,730
I agree with her!

2727
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,900
And is the spirit of clocks even real?

2728
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:27,970
No, it isn't!

2729
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:30,270
You just made it all up!

2730
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:32,680
There's no spirit of tick-tock!

2731
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,910
(Inner peace)

2732
01:36:34,210 --> 01:36:35,350
What is she doing?

2733
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:36,450
(Laughing)

2734
01:36:36,850 --> 01:36:38,680
So was it all a lie, Spirit?

2735
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:42,520
Of all the spirits in the world, there wouldn't be a clock spirit...

2736
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:43,890
You dare, Lee Eun Ji?

2737
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,460
(You dare, Lee Eun Ji?)

2738
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:46,760
(Eun Ji questioned the spirit world.)

2739
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:47,890
How dare her?

2740
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:50,860
(Chuckling)

2741
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:52,860
There are so many spirits out there,

2742
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:54,670
but I've never heard of a clock spirit!

2743
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:56,770
Those who look down on the clock,

2744
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:59,170
you shall face your doom.

2745
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,670
How many jobs do you have?

2746
01:37:00,670 --> 01:37:02,240
Yesterday, you were a musical actress,

2747
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:04,080
and today you're the Clock Spirit?

2748
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:05,480
I will...

2749
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,410
(I love you.)

2750
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:10,410
It looks different from just now.

2751
01:37:10,850 --> 01:37:13,250
It definitely looks different. It feels like "Constantine" now.

2752
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:16,690
(The sun does look brighter now.)

2753
01:37:17,890 --> 01:37:19,990
(She's suddenly waving?)

2754
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:22,090
What time?

2755
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:25,030
Excuse me, what time?

2756
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:29,600
See, they're going to work now!

2757
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:30,840
Right?

2758
01:37:31,870 --> 01:37:33,940
Excuse me, what time?

2759
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:36,440
Do you know... Time?

2760
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:39,080
(Troubled)

2761
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:41,310
What? There's someone walking over there.

2762
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:44,550
"It's 8am! Time to go to work!"

2763
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:46,180
Wouldn't they say something like that?

2764
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:48,420
They must be going to work.

2765
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:50,390
Then I think it must be now.

2766
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:54,190
Does he drive the forklift?

2767
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:55,560
- He said hi to the driver. - He did?

2768
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,160
- He greeted the driver. - Yes.

2769
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,730
(He goes on to shake another employee's hand.)

2770
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:02,870
(She feels in her gut that people are on their way to work...)

2771
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:05,000
(and goes to guess.)

2772
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,510
Clock Spirit! I saw something!

2773
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:12,310
I saw someone going to work!

2774
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:14,280
Doesn't that mean it's 8am?

2775
01:38:14,510 --> 01:38:17,150
(Cold)

2776
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:18,920
I think it's 8am.

2777
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,320
I have faith in that stranger.

2778
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,890
(Walking towards her phone)

2779
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:29,430
(Doing her last performance art)

2780
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:33,530
(Would Eun Ji's digital detox be over?)

2781
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:37,370
Good morning!

2782
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:40,770
Okay, we have marked your time.

2783
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:46,110
(Good morning order)

2784
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,180
No, it's not time yet.

2785
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:51,550
(Mimi goes in front of the plant again.)

2786
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:53,120
What happens if this is wrong?

2787
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:57,520
(Mimi is staring at one place only.)

2788
01:38:57,790 --> 01:38:59,160
(Meanwhile...)

2789
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:01,730
The time is approaching.

2790
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:04,700
(The hourglass will run out soon.)

2791
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,630
(Whatever people say,)

2792
01:39:08,630 --> 01:39:12,100
(Yu Jin goes her own way with her hourglass.)

2793
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:15,040
(She was the first one to wake up.)

2794
01:39:15,170 --> 01:39:17,370
Maybe 6:20am?

2795
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:21,210
(And after a pretty accurate guess,)

2796
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,720
(She turned an hourglass straight away.)

2797
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:37,900
(The clear-eyed freak didn't waver.)

2798
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:40,000
(Yu Jin flipped the hourglass 3 times.)

2799
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,030
(That means an hour and 30 minutes have passed.)

2800
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:44,500
- I'm going to guess now. - Okay!

2801
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:45,670
You got a feeling.

2802
01:39:45,970 --> 01:39:47,810
It'll take a minute for me to walk.

2803
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:50,410
One, two, three...

2804
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,610
Ten, eleven...

2805
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:56,410
(One step at a time to retrieve her phone)

2806
01:39:57,150 --> 01:40:00,550
(She grabs Cheol Yong first,)

2807
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:02,720
(and dances until the minute passes.)

2808
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,620
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine...

2809
01:40:05,090 --> 01:40:06,520
Good morning!

2810
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:09,260
- Okay! - Thank you!

2811
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:10,660
Yu Jin.

2812
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:13,460
(Only Mimi didn't guess yet.)

2813
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:17,600
(The sun is starting to brighten the sky.)

2814
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:20,140
I'm really nervous now that everyone's done it.

2815
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,510
You still haven't guessed, Mimi?

2816
01:40:22,870 --> 01:40:25,610
My calculations tell me I should go 20 minutes later.

2817
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:27,040
- 20 minutes? - Yes.

2818
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:28,610
(Mimi has a calculation method?)

2819
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:29,680
I see.

2820
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:34,120
But maybe I'm wrong, judging from your reactions.

2821
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:37,690
What's the point of calculating if you judge from people's reactions?

2822
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,420
(Smiling)

2823
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:42,230
(That's true, but still...)

2824
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:46,130
Woo Jung and Producer Na have come into work.

2825
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:48,170
Show your respect...

2826
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:52,270
to Clock Spirit!

2827
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:55,740
(Bowing down without a clue)

2828
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:58,180
Writer Woo Jung and Producer Na are here.

2829
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:59,940
That means I'm late.

2830
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:02,880
No, maybe they're here because you're going to guess soon, Mimi.

2831
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:05,780
(Is she really late?)

2832
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:09,850
Kim Mi Hyun will be in last place.

2833
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:12,690
- What are you looking at? - Mimi will be so nervous,

2834
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:14,330
she will go and guess within three minutes.

2835
01:41:14,330 --> 01:41:15,490
I'll get going now.

2836
01:41:16,430 --> 01:41:17,530
I'm going!

2837
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:19,430
(Mimi is almost swept into her decision.)

2838
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:20,760
She's going!

2839
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:22,400
She's going to guess!

2840
01:41:22,970 --> 01:41:25,400
(Mimi hurries over to the base...)

2841
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,500
(while the members follow her.)

2842
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:28,970
Are you coming with me, Spirit?

2843
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:30,270
Yes, let's go together.

2844
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:32,210
Be careful, there's a rock.

2845
01:41:32,210 --> 01:41:33,280
Thank you.

2846
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:35,450
I think the time now will be...

2847
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,110
seven...

2848
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:40,920
It's between 7:54am and 7:56am.

2849
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:43,720
Between 54 and 56? That's just 55.

2850
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:45,460
(Snorting)

2851
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:47,830
I'll put in my guess 3 to 4 minutes early.

2852
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:50,130
- Where is it? - Pick it up, please. Good morning.

2853
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:51,830
Say "Good morning" loudly, please.

2854
01:41:51,930 --> 01:41:53,030
Good morning!

2855
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:55,770
Good morning!

2856
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:57,370
(Mimi is last to say good morning.)

2857
01:41:57,370 --> 01:42:01,340
Now then, since Mimi has also guessed,

2858
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:02,970
everyone finished guessing.

2859
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:04,880
Who was the first to guess?

2860
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:07,510
- The Clock Spirit. - The spirit of clocks!

2861
01:42:08,150 --> 01:42:09,710
And who was the last?

2862
01:42:10,650 --> 01:42:11,650
Mimi.

2863
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:14,620
(Good morning order)

2864
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:16,620
Please...

2865
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:19,620
(The 1st and 2nd places will get their phones back right away.)

2866
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:21,690
I am not nervous.

2867
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:22,830
(The 3rd and 4th place won't get their phones back.)

2868
01:42:22,890 --> 01:42:23,930
Okay.

2869
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:25,860
- Now then. - All right.

2870
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:28,870
- Why am I so nervous? - You all must be wondering...

2871
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:29,870
what time it is right now.

2872
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:30,900
- Yes! - That's right.

2873
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:32,840
Should I just announce it now?

2874
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:33,900
- Yes. - Yes!

2875
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:35,810
(Everyone's tense for their phones.)

2876
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:36,970
The current time!

2877
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:38,680
The last number is...

2878
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:40,740
five.

2879
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,810
- Is it 8:55am? - Is it 8:05am?

2880
01:42:42,810 --> 01:42:44,950
- It might be 8:15am. - No, it's 7:55am.

2881
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:46,180
The tenth digit.

2882
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,620
It's 45.

2883
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:50,690
It must be 8:45am.

2884
01:42:50,850 --> 01:42:52,460
- Do you think so? - I'm positive.

2885
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:53,520
It's 8:45am?

2886
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:55,060
It's 7:45am!

2887
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:56,230
(The two who went last claim it's 7:45am.)

2888
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:58,630
Congratulations.

2889
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:00,800
In Abu Dhabi time, it is currently...

2890
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:04,870
- 7:45am! - See?

2891
01:43:04,870 --> 01:43:06,540
(Current time is 7:45am.)

2892
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,970
- Mimi is in first place! - I told you!

2893
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,880
How early did you go, Young Ji?

2894
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,410
(Mimi is 1st place, and Yu Jin is in 2nd place.)

2895
01:43:13,410 --> 01:43:14,810
(Eun Ji is 3rd place, and Young Ji is in 4th place.)

2896
01:43:14,950 --> 01:43:16,580
The time Mimi guessed...

2897
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:18,720
was only about 17 minutes off.

2898
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:20,650
Mimi was almost exactly right.

2899
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:24,520
What was Mimi's strategy to get in first place?

2900
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:26,360
I'm curious what it was.

2901
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:27,730
I was very meticulous.

2902
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:31,430
I turned in my phone around 10:21pm or 10:22pm.

2903
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:34,800
(Yesterday)

2904
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:38,170
(Clue 1: The time they turned in their phones)

2905
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:41,770
(Mimi turned her phone in at 10:21pm.)

2906
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:44,710
I saw the camera operator slating yesterday.

2907
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:45,780
I was next to the camera.

2908
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:47,210
Okay, we slate often.

2909
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:48,610
(What is "slating?")

2910
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:52,720
(It's when you clap after a pause from filming.)

2911
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:55,390
(Here's an example.)

2912
01:43:55,390 --> 01:43:56,620
One, two, three.

2913
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:58,260
Yes.

2914
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:01,090
(When we stop filming for a moment,)

2915
01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:02,690
(we say that we "slate.")

2916
01:44:02,730 --> 01:44:04,560
(Last night)

2917
01:44:04,730 --> 01:44:07,800
You told us about that game yesterday.

2918
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:08,870
(Noticing)

2919
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:10,130
(Slating)

2920
01:44:12,070 --> 01:44:13,900
Are you turning the camera off?

2921
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:16,310
(Mimi saw the moment he slated.)

2922
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:17,810
- What? - What time is it now?

2923
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:20,740
(While the other members grilled the staff,)

2924
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:24,080
(she just laughed and turned around...)

2925
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:30,220
(to start staring quietly into the camera screen.)

2926
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:32,160
(The screen that Mimi is looking at)

2927
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:33,320
(Stand-by)

2928
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:37,690
(When you start recording,)

2929
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,760
(it shows how long you've been recording.)

2930
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:43,030
(So Mimi checked the duration,)

2931
01:44:43,330 --> 01:44:46,840
(and made her calculation!)

2932
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:49,310
(Even while saying good night,)

2933
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:54,510
(Mimi's hands and eyes did not rest.)

2934
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:58,220
(Mimi found a loophole under the staff's nose.)

2935
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:00,580
I have my plans.

2936
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:01,990
Seven...

2937
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:04,020
It's 7:13am.

2938
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:05,690
Am I wrong?

2939
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:08,290
(Despite her nervousness)

2940
01:45:08,890 --> 01:45:10,830
Isn't it 7:13am?

2941
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:16,770
(So she went inside and outside constantly.)

2942
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:18,070
It's me again.

2943
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:21,000
It's not time yet.

2944
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:24,210
If I'm the closest guesser, anyway...

2945
01:45:24,210 --> 01:45:26,210
(She's confident she will win.)

2946
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:28,080
(That's why...)

2947
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,280
(she said good morning so confidently.)

2948
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:32,350
Mimi, I think you're a genius sometimes.

2949
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:36,250
Yu Jin was also close, about 25 minutes off.

2950
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:39,060
Could you tell us how you made your guess?

2951
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:42,230
I woke up several times at night as well.

2952
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:45,500
So I woke up around the time the darkness began to fade away.

2953
01:45:45,530 --> 01:45:48,070
I estimated that it was around 6:30am then.

2954
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:49,630
How did you estimate that?

2955
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:52,170
Because when we arrived yesterday,

2956
01:45:52,170 --> 01:45:55,070
you said the sunrise was at 6:50am.

2957
01:45:55,170 --> 01:45:56,910
- Did I really say that? - You did.

2958
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:58,580
- Yesterday? - Yes.

2959
01:45:58,580 --> 01:46:00,340
Gosh, that's so smart.

2960
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:01,980
(The reason only Yu Jin remembers it is...)

2961
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:03,780
(In the bus after landing)

2962
01:46:03,850 --> 01:46:05,350
The sun rises at 6:50am, so...

2963
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:07,650
(It's because a staff member mentioned it in passing!)

2964
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:08,850
- Really? - Yes.

2965
01:46:09,290 --> 01:46:10,720
Okay.

2966
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,360
(Noted)

2967
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:15,130
- Yes. - Gosh, that's so smart.

2968
01:46:15,130 --> 01:46:18,430
After that, I used the hourglass...

2969
01:46:18,430 --> 01:46:20,330
to check 30 minutes at a time.

2970
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:23,070
But the Clock Spirit messed with my head.

2971
01:46:23,070 --> 01:46:25,270
I know! She kept pushing us.

2972
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:26,670
She said that I was late,

2973
01:46:26,670 --> 01:46:29,570
- so I guessed a little early. - I see.

2974
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:32,180
- That's really accurate. - Thank you.

2975
01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:34,610
Sir!

2976
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:36,780
At what time did the Clock Spirit guess?

2977
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:37,980
That one is amazing.

2978
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:41,290
I'll move on to the next record.

2979
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:43,820
- You picked Cheol Yong up... - Yes.

2980
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,190
- at 7:22am, Eun Ji. - Okay.

2981
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:47,390
And lastly, Young Ji.

2982
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:50,860
(Shocked by the ridiculous guess)

2983
01:46:51,190 --> 01:46:54,260
(How early could it be?)

2984
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,270
(Already laughing)

2985
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,170
Young Ji, you guessed at 6:50am!

2986
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:01,640
(6:50am)

2987
01:47:02,170 --> 01:47:03,470
(Laughing)

2988
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:04,880
Oh, no. Young Ji.

2989
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:06,340
You were off by 70 minutes.

2990
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:08,980
It did seem like a cult.

2991
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:10,580
- The spirit was a quack. - The spirit was a quack.

2992
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:13,650
You're Catholic. Why do you say that you're the Clock Spirit?

2993
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:14,820
The spirit was a quack.

2994
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:16,090
Was my time 6:50am?

2995
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:17,450
- Was that when I registered? - Yes.

2996
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:19,790
It's the human time that's wrong.

2997
01:47:20,860 --> 01:47:22,460
My time is right.

2998
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:27,300
(Young Ji, Eun Ji, Yu Jin, Mimi)

2999
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:29,070
The 3rd and 4th places must keep going...

3000
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:30,570
with the digital detox.

3001
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,200
This is insane, Eun Ji.

3002
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,270
I'm going crazy because I want to listen to music.

3003
01:47:36,940 --> 01:47:38,380
- How much longer? - Eun Ji,

3004
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,040
you were off by 38 minutes.

3005
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,050
So 38 hours?

3006
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:44,850
- At 10pm tomorrow... - Did you say 10pm tomorrow?

3007
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:47,520
If we visit downtown today,

3008
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:49,920
we won't be able to look up anything.

3009
01:47:50,150 --> 01:47:52,260
(Meanwhile,)

3010
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:54,260
Ask Yu Jin to take photos of you.

3011
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:55,260
(reality begins to sink in.)

3012
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:57,860
- Clock Spirit. - I'll need to ask her nonstop.

3013
01:47:57,860 --> 01:48:01,200
The one who placed last was Young Ji, the Clock Spirit.

3014
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,030
The additional time for the digital detox is...

3015
01:48:05,470 --> 01:48:06,500
seventy hours.

3016
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:10,140
Seventy hours.

3017
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:12,640
(About 3 days)

3018
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:13,710
It's what you need.

3019
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:16,010
- It's what you need. - I got what I wanted...

3020
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:17,480
in the end.

3021
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:20,020
(3 days later)

3022
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:23,150
I'll check the screen time.

3023
01:48:24,290 --> 01:48:25,290
Zero minutes.

3024
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:26,920
- It's zero minutes. - Zero minutes.

3025
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:28,060
(It's proof that she went through with digital detox.)

3026
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:29,960
- Zero minutes. - No way.

3027
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:32,800
This week. Zero seconds.

3028
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:34,630
Zero seconds.

3029
01:48:34,630 --> 01:48:35,700
(In the past 3 days, she was on the phone for 0 seconds.)

3030
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:38,300
If you look over here...

3031
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:41,140
Last week, the average screen time was 8 hours and 30 minutes.

3032
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:42,270
(Last week, the average screen time was 8 hours and 30 minutes.)

3033
01:48:42,670 --> 01:48:43,740
The week before that, it was 14 hours and 23 minutes.

3034
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:45,280
(Average screen time: 14 hours and 23 minutes)

3035
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,040
How many hours after the 1st one, 8 hours?

3036
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,050
Fourteen hours.

3037
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:49,080
(Her screen time was shocking 2 weeks ago.)

3038
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:52,180
Young Ji was our target. She walked right into it.

3039
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:55,050
Look at this. On February 2, Sunday, I was on the phone for 20 hours.

3040
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:56,590
(20 hours)

3041
01:48:56,590 --> 01:48:58,020
Were you on the phone for 20 hours?

3042
01:48:58,820 --> 01:48:59,990
Twenty hours?

3043
01:48:59,990 --> 01:49:01,320
(She was on the phone all day except for 4 hours.)

3044
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:02,330
Hey.

3045
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:03,330
(She can't believe it.)

3046
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:05,200
- Young Ji. - It makes no sense.

3047
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:06,500
Let's see the time for Monday.

3048
01:49:06,860 --> 01:49:08,370
The next Monday.

3049
01:49:08,730 --> 01:49:09,870
- It's 21 hours. - It's 21 hours.

3050
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:11,170
(21 hours and 22 minutes)

3051
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:12,440
It's 21 hours.

3052
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:15,940
(It's an unbelievable number.)

3053
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:18,040
Young Ji, you needed it.

3054
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:19,410
I really needed it.

3055
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:23,280
February 10. What happened on February 10?

3056
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,120
Out of 24 hours...

3057
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,120
Geon Jun.

3058
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:29,320
(For Young Ji's mental rest,)

3059
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:30,590
It's turned off.

3060
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:35,460
(the production crew kept a close watch on her.)

3061
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,260
I want to use my phone.

3062
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,000
I want to watch the reels.

3063
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,500
Jennie's new song came out. I want to listen to it.

3064
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:47,100
(The 3-day journey wasn't easy.)

3065
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:48,370
(The ups of a digital detox: 1. Restore mental health.)

3066
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:49,470
(2. Improve focus. 3. Improve the quality of sleep.)

3067
01:49:49,470 --> 01:49:50,570
(4. Improve eye health and fatigue.)

3068
01:49:50,570 --> 01:49:51,710
(5. Restore relationships. 6. Connect with true self.)

3069
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,840
Otherwise, give me the audio equipment...

3070
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,010
Sun Woo is wearing.

3071
01:49:55,410 --> 01:49:57,410
I just need an electronic device.

3072
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,320
I'm bored by myself. I don't have a phone.

3073
01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:02,820
Meet up with the others after walking around.

3074
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:05,960
How will I contact the others without a phone?

3075
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,590
It's the best egg tart place among them, right?

3076
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:10,890
That's right. Look up the place, Agent Young Ji.

3077
01:50:10,890 --> 01:50:12,160
Me? How will I do that...

3078
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:13,900
- without a phone, Producer Na? - Right.

3079
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:15,070
Young Ji, I'll look it up.

3080
01:50:15,070 --> 01:50:18,030
The 82-hour digital detox has made my mental state...

3081
01:50:18,030 --> 01:50:20,670
(The last conversation with the CEO of her agency)

3082
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:23,070
"This will be the last text."

3083
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:27,840
"The Clock Spirit has betrayed me."

3084
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,850
Hold on. I received money from the Copyright Association.

3085
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:33,450
Let me check it.

3086
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:35,190
No.

3087
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:39,960
You can check it three days later.

3088
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:41,390
I'm sorry.

3089
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:42,860
(Please root for Young Ji's lengthy digital detox.)

3090
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:45,500
(A secret infiltration operation)

3091
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:47,300
(To infiltrate downtown Abu Dhabi,)

3092
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:49,070
(the agents prepared the local makeup.)

3093
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:50,670
(I'm Aisha.)

3094
01:50:50,970 --> 01:50:52,610
(My name is Petra.)

3095
01:50:52,710 --> 01:50:53,880
(I'm Cassandra.)

3096
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:56,510
(Isn't it like the divorcee special of "I'm Solo?")

3097
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:58,480
(For the perfect disguise,)

3098
01:50:58,480 --> 01:50:59,980
(they even purchase the local clothes.)

3099
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,950
(No one will recognize us. Never.)

3100
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:05,160
(Avoid people's eyes...)

3101
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:07,560
(and find the clues Torong left behind.)

3102
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:08,960
(Is it what Torong ate?)

3103
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,690
(Will he open a dessert shop later?)

3104
01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:12,960
(Is it his goal to leave us stranded here?)

3105
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,400
(They don't understand what Torong is thinking.)

3106
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:20,240
(The infiltration operation turns chaotic.)

3107
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:21,500
(The game is...)

3108
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,510
(the Answer in a Row.)

3109
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:23,510
(1. Bracken)

3110
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:24,840
(2. Water parsley)

3111
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,040
(3. Shepherd's purse, 4. Spinach)

3112
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:27,380
(5. Bean sprout)

3113
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:28,380
(You must answer correctly...)

3114
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:30,650
(for a meal.)

3115
01:51:30,650 --> 01:51:34,080
(The one who answers correctly can have her fill...)

3116
01:51:35,190 --> 01:51:37,820
(until someone else answer correctly.)

3117
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:39,120
(I couldn't even taste the food.)

3118
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:41,830
(Actor names that don't contain ieung.)

3119
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:44,590
(Go Soo)

3120
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:46,200
(Na Yeong Seok)

3121
01:51:46,230 --> 01:51:47,930
(Glutinous rice cake ice cream)

3122
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:48,930
(Wa)

3123
01:51:48,970 --> 01:51:52,340
(Young Ji gives consecutive incorrect answers.)

3124
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:57,770
(Other members finish adjusting and give consecutive correct answers.)

3125
01:51:57,770 --> 01:52:01,210
(The owner of the table continues to change.)

3126
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:02,780
(I couldn't even put on the gloves.)

3127
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:05,920
(Will Young Ji be able to eat dinner?)

3128
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:07,420
(And...)

3129
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:11,390
(during a relaxed breakfast)

3130
01:52:11,490 --> 01:52:12,720
(Hey!)

3131
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:15,790
(They hear shocking news.)

3132
01:52:15,790 --> 01:52:18,090
(It'll be revealed next week.)

3133
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:20,860
With a big smile on his face,

3134
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:23,870
the driver asked the audio director,

3135
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:27,340
"Give me the Instagram account of the comedienne."

3136
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,910
"Who is she? She's so funny."

3137
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:32,040
So the audio director showed him my Instagram account.

3138
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:35,450
He said, "Not her. I want her Instagram account."

3139
01:52:37,010 --> 01:52:41,180
"Isn't she a comedienne?" It was a big mess.

3140
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:43,090
He saw Young Ji's Instagram account...

3141
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:44,850
and said, "That's her."

3142
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:47,690
"That's the comedienne I was talking about."

3143
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:50,130
- The positions are switched. - Thanks for the explanation.

3144
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:51,130
You're my junior.
