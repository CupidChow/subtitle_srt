25
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:56,207
Well,

26
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:57,528
you look honest,

27
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:00,104
but you acted otherwise
when you were drunk.

28
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:04,280
I'm sorry, Mdm. Wang.

29
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:06,168
I just want to pursue Gu Yi,

30
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:08,088
but

31
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,488
I don't know what to do.

32
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:13,088
Well,

33
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:15,368
that's exactly what I'm waiting to hear.

34
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:16,607
Tell me

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,816
what Gu Yi said to you.

36
00:02:19,768 --> 00:02:20,407
She said

37
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:22,167
she doesn't mind my alexithymia issue,

38
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,048
only my attitude.

39
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:26,847
She said I treat her like a trash cat.

40
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:28,088
And

41
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:29,407
she wants me to live well

42
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:30,248
and stop seeing her.

43
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:32,808
What should I do?

44
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:34,887
That's tricky.

45
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:37,368
She's lost trust in you.

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,032
Is there any way

47
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:42,328
to fix it?

48
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:45,648
Forget about that for now.

49
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:47,768
Tell me about your alexithymia

50
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:48,727
in detail.

51
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:52,847
My therapist says

52
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:54,567
it's a kind of personality trait

53
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,488
or a psychological symptom.

54
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:58,687
The main issue is

55
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:00,968
my lack of ability to feel,

56
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:01,847
identify,

57
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:03,887
and express feelings.

58
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:05,920
I have a poor imagination,

59
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:06,928
I'm overly objective,

60
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:10,727
and I can't interpret
feelings correctly.

61
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,048
I get it.

62
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:20,127
It means

63
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,048
you're still a kid.

64
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:24,488
That's not a big deal.

65
00:03:25,464 --> 00:03:26,936
Gu Yi was the same when she was young.

66
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:29,048
Some kids are different.

67
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,280
They have done nothing wrong.

68
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:32,440
What's the problem with that?

69
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:34,528
The world is so complicated

70
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:35,567
and full of deceit.

71
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:37,887
Isn't it good

72
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:38,928
to live like a kid?

73
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:40,712
Just live in a comfortable way
for yourself.

74
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:41,800
You're not hurting anyone,

75
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:42,447
right?

76
00:03:49,768 --> 00:03:50,368
Liang,

77
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:53,488
you can't take away
my daughter so easily.

78
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:56,648
Let's have a drink.

79
00:04:13,407 --> 00:04:14,048
Let me tell you

80
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:15,920
Gu Yi's childhood story.

81
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:18,487
Kids always write essays like...

82
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:25,448
Here. Over here.

83
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:27,648
Jacqueline,

84
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:30,008
lie down.

85
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,128
Who is this?

86
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,864
She looks like the Consort Jing.
[*A character in a harem series.]

87
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:41,208
My superior,

88
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:43,088
the wicked Medusa.

89
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:45,487
Music!

90
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:54,568
What kind of music does she like?

91
00:04:57,656 --> 00:04:58,640
You don't know her at all.

92
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:14,448
Are you trying to get me into trouble?

93
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:37,607
Zhang Junjie!

94
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:41,648
Wake up.

95
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:43,128
Wake up!

96
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:43,807
What are you doing?

97
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:44,367
Gu Yi.

98
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:44,847
Wake up.

99
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:45,528
Wake up.

100
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:48,128
Zhang Junjie,

101
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:50,727
give me the right
to create independently!

102
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:51,568
Give me an opportunity!

103
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:53,008
Give me a promotion!

104
00:05:53,008 --> 00:05:55,448
Give me a raise!

105
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:01,328
You all call me Demoness.

106
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:02,847
I know.

107
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:04,528
And I don't care.

108
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:07,640
Let me tell you this.

109
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,328
I'm a machine.

110
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:13,008
I'm heartless.

111
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,568
Rules of the jungle.
Only the strong survives.

112
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:16,487
Don't you know that?

113
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:17,807
Look at you.

114
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:20,047
You're an honest fool.

115
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:22,607
You can't even handle someone
like Penny.

116
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:25,128
Listen up.

117
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:27,888
If it weren't for me, you would've...

118
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:31,727
Don't throw up yet. No!

119
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:32,648
I just cleaned the place.

120
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,672
I just cleaned the place.

121
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:35,328
Bathroom.

122
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,607
Help me out.

123
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:51,407
Should I call your friend over?

124
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:06,807
No need.

125
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:08,808
I don't have friends.

126
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:35,727
Zhang Junjie.

127
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:41,208
You never changed.

128
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:43,927
Get up.

129
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:45,200
Let's have another drink.

130
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:45,847
Come on.

131
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:46,528
Get up.

132
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:47,328
Up.

133
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:48,448
Stand properly.

134
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:50,847
Walk slowly.

135
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:53,088
Mr. Huang,

136
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:55,400
I don't have the strength
to send her home.

137
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:56,807
But let me remind you.

138
00:07:57,487 --> 00:07:58,448
Don't take advantage of her.

139
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:00,247
Little girl,

140
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:01,880
when I was taking advantage of others,

141
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:03,047
you were still in kindergarten.

142
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:04,407
Be careful.

143
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,407
I warn you, don't throw up on me.

144
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:08,287
Careful.

145
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:11,528

194
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:50,487
You're awake?

195
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:55,408
Here.

196
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:56,448
Drink this.

197
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:57,060
You'll feel better.

198
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:57,560
Get off.

199
00:11:58,487 --> 00:11:59,727
Here.

200
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:02,487
You haven't changed one bit.

201
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:03,736
You always throw up the next day

202
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:04,800
after drinking a lot.

203
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:10,568
What?

204
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,727
Why am I at your place?

205
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:15,568
You ask me why?

206
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:16,847
You were drunk,

207
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:18,367
and I helped you.

208
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:18,847
Get off.

209
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:20,527
You're a lunatic.

210
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:21,968
I'm a lunatic?

211
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,880
If it weren't for me taking you in,

212
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,544
you would've been on the news
this morning,

213
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:25,920
you know?

214
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,607
I'd rather be on the news.

215
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:29,847
I'll pay

216
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,208
for the room charge.

217
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,288
Also,

218
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:34,408
from now on,

219
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,408
don't ever get close to me.

220
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,448
You never speak nicely

221
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,527
as you always have.

222
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:44,767
Hangover tea.

223
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:46,168
It's the brand you always drink.

224
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:48,208
It's clean.

225
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:49,568
Drink it.

226
00:12:58,048 --> 00:12:58,928
Well,

227
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:01,007
I went to visit your aunt
a couple of days ago.

228
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,440
She's in good health.

229
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:04,616
Do you know she was hospitalized
before Chinese New Year?

230
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:08,367
You don't have to tell me this.

231
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:10,847
I pay her

232
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:12,208
without a dime less.

233
00:13:13,288 --> 00:13:15,048
You're cold-blooded.

234
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:19,448
Huang Wenda,

235
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,088
don't think I don't know
why you went back.

236
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:25,599
You just want to know

237
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,400
if I gave birth to the child
and handed it over to her.

238
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:28,808
Give up already.

239
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:30,688
Let me make this clear again.

240
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,088
No!

241
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:34,080
Zhang Junjie.

242
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:35,048
What are you doing?

243
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:38,088
That's also my child.

244
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:39,679
How desperate you are for your career

245
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,304
is equal to how desperate I was
to keep the child.

246
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,968
You know what I truly want is

247
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:44,247
to have a child with my loved one,

248
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:45,527
but you aborted the baby.

249
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:46,527
You threw the baby away.

250
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:47,448
How ruthless you are.

251
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:48,448
Don't you have nightmares?

252
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,328
I don't.

253
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:51,847
I'm glad I didn't give birth
to the baby.

254
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:53,767
Because

255
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,168
you don't deserve it.

256
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:57,808
I don't deserve it?

257
00:13:58,168 --> 00:13:59,328
I'm the baby's father!

258
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:02,367
I just want to know if
it's a boy or a girl.

259
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,288
Is that too much to ask?

260
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:05,208
Do you remember what you replied to me?

261
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,400
(Zhang Junjie: It)

262
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:07,247
Just one word.

263
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:08,208
You used "it".

264
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,568
Are you an animal?

265
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:11,328
I still keep the message on my phone.

266
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:12,440
Let me be honest with you.

267
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:14,240
Every time I can't fall asleep
thinking about you,

268
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:15,487
I read the message

269
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:17,127
to warn myself.

270
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:18,727
Mr. Huang,

271
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:21,727
we can argue about this until we're 80.

272
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:23,496
Haven't you gotten sick of it yet?

273
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:26,408
By the way,

274
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:28,968
here's a kind reminder.

275
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:31,688
Marry a young woman and have a child

276
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,328
as soon as possible.

277
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:34,647
The kids won't be as good

278
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,887
when you get older.

279
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:37,887
Stop following me.

280
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:05,288
You're awake?

281
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:09,647
Morning.

282
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:11,088
Morning?

283
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:13,007
You're a habitual drunk, aren't you?

284
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,048
Do you have anything to tell me?

285
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:27,367
Will you be my girlfriend?

286
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:34,208
You...

287
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:36,847
You were drinking a lot

288
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:37,847
with my mom

289
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:39,688
last night, and this is the first thing

290
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:41,487
you say when you wake up?

291
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:43,208
If so,

292
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:46,247
what should I do
to make you my girlfriend?

293
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:52,448
Forget it.

294
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:55,208
We'll talk when you're sober.

295
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,247
What's wrong with you? Let go of me.

296
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,367
I won't if you don't say yes.

297
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,208
If you want to leave the door single,

298
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:11,048
kill me

299
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,440
and step over my dead body.

300
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:14,247
Liang Daiwen,

301
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:15,408
what's wrong with you?

302
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,840
Can you please consider my feelings

303
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:18,607
before you say something this gross?

304
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:22,247
I like you, and you like me.

305
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:23,847
Why can't we be together?

306
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:26,007
Let go of me first.

307
00:16:26,408 --> 00:16:27,607
My mom will wake up soon.

308
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:29,288
I'm already up.

309
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:47,527
Mom, I'm off to work.

310
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:50,367
Mom, I'm off to work.

311
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:56,288

313
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:22,128
Dad.

314
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:23,247
You're up early.

315
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:24,280
Aren't you sleeping in today?

316
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:26,527
Xin.

317
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:31,807
Are you going out?

318
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:35,888
I bought you a new dress.

319
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:36,807
Do you not like it?

320
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:39,168
It's not that.

321
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:44,688
Put that on.

322
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,247
It doesn't look good

323
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:48,608
wearing this.

324
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:55,208
Xin,

325
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:57,688
you look prettier in a dress.

326
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,480
Listen to your mom. Go put it on.

327
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:13,208
Come.

328
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:16,807
Dear,

329
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:18,767
that's enough.

330
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,648

331
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:23,247

What were you doing?

333
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:25,807
Get married?

334
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:27,680
Who is she marrying?

335
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,408
That jobless guy?

336
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:30,888
That's impossible.

337
00:18:31,168 --> 00:18:31,928
Keep it down.

338
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:34,767

00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:24,888
Okay.

382
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:40,247
That's funny.

383
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:43,567
Isn't Guan Xingxin Nextmonday's artist?

384
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:45,920
Why does she need Roger's consent
to attend events?

385
00:23:46,744 --> 00:23:48,080
Her parents are irrationally anxious.

386
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:49,807
They called Roger
to have Guan Xingxin replaced.

387
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:50,968
Do I have a reason to reject them?

388
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:54,527
Then what was the point
of all the preparation?

389
00:23:56,807 --> 00:23:58,567
Guan Xingxin's homewrecker scandal
is exposed

390
00:23:58,567 --> 00:23:59,959
through Nextmonday.

391
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,808
It's understandable

392
00:24:00,824 --> 00:24:02,050
that her parents don't trust us.

393
00:24:02,168 --> 00:24:03,327
Roger has to do them this favor.

394
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:04,440
We just follow the orders.

395
00:24:04,632 --> 00:24:05,640
The exhibition is important,

396
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:07,288
but it's also normal to replace artists.

397
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,087
No more questions.

398
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:09,047
I can keep quiet,

399
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:11,480
but Guan Xingxin will ask questions.

400
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:13,287
How should I explain to her?

401
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,272
Continue working on the contract.

402
00:24:15,272 --> 00:24:17,240
Then, find an excuse to cancel it
when she signs.

403
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,888
Don't make things difficult
for her parents.

404
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:25,408
Don't tell Gu Yi about this.

405
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:26,168
Roger

406
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,448
doesn't like her.

407
00:24:28,648 --> 00:24:29,608
Leave Guan Xingxin's matter

408
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:30,688
to Huang Wenda.

409
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:06,344
Why haven't you left yet?

410
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:10,536
Deputy Director took on a promotion
project for an aesthetic clinic.

411
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,839
I'm thinking of creating a comic

412
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,216
for both Nextmonday and the bypass.

413
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:15,360
This is the manuscript.

414
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,208
Have you had
a cosmetic treatment before?

415
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:19,168
No.

416
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:22,448
There aren't always heart-shaped faces.

417
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:25,128
You need to experience
to create a comic about it.

418
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:32,312
Here's a clinic membership card.

419
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:33,648
Don't need to pay me back.

420
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:38,007
Thank you.

421
00:25:38,648 --> 00:25:39,760
Get off work after eating.

422
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:47,527
Well,

423
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,047
would you like to eat together?

424
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:01,888
Ms. Zhang,

425
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,567
you and

426
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:06,247
Mr. Huang...

427
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,247
Are you all right?

428
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:09,247
Keep quiet if you have nothing to say.

429
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:16,287
If that happens again,

430
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:17,968
don't call him.

431
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:22,767
Why do I get the feeling

432
00:26:23,608 --> 00:26:24,807
you really dislike him?

433
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:28,408
Are you asking,

434
00:26:28,448 --> 00:26:29,608
if I dislike him so much,

435
00:26:29,928 --> 00:26:31,247
why was I with him in the first place?

436
00:26:35,047 --> 00:26:36,648
Huang Wenda is very smart.

437
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,368
Many people notice

438
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:40,368
opportunities in the industry,

439
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:42,767
but only a few

440
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:44,008
can truly reap the benefits.

441
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:46,047
He's gifted.

442
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:48,168
He's born to be an opportunist.

443
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:50,888
When I first came to this city,

444
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:52,648
I didn't know anything.

445
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:55,608
He taught me step-by-step
how to build a client base

446
00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:57,727
and expand networking resources.

447
00:26:59,408 --> 00:27:00,648
Because of his guidance,

448
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:02,208
I avoided many missteps.

449
00:27:03,007 --> 00:27:03,848
However,

450
00:27:04,368 --> 00:27:05,287
an overly smart person

451
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:07,327
tends to control everything.

452
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:09,527
I didn't want him to decide on my life,

453
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:12,487
so I joined his competitor

454
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:15,007
and took away
all his clients and resources.

455
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:17,928
To put it nicely,

456
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,384
it was a competition between a couple.

457
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:20,767
But to put it bluntly,

458
00:27:21,256 --> 00:27:22,360
we turned against each other.

459
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:26,047
So

460
00:27:26,168 --> 00:27:27,608
you broke up

461
00:27:27,608 --> 00:27:28,448
because of competition?

462
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,520
If two people can't meet
each other's expectations,

463
00:27:35,128 --> 00:27:36,767
they end up pursuing self-interest.

464
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:42,688
Why?

465
00:27:43,112 --> 00:27:45,096
Is something wrong
between you and Liang Daiwen?

466
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,168
It's hard to say.

467
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,848
Do you have to stay up late
writing scripts

468
00:27:54,128 --> 00:27:56,448
as a public account editor?

469
00:27:57,648 --> 00:28:00,047
You suddenly become so dedicated
because of a breakup.

470
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:07,087
I heard about Liang Daiwen's reputation.

471
00:28:08,327 --> 00:28:10,327
He's unsociable, stubborn, and aloof,

472
00:28:10,848 --> 00:28:12,928
but a true talent.

473
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:15,807
Everyone knows
he didn't commit plagiarism,

474
00:28:16,448 --> 00:28:17,648
but no one will stand up

475
00:28:17,848 --> 00:28:18,688
for him.

476
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:20,408
Because they all know

477
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,208
Zhang Qingya and he
each have their own motives.

478
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:25,648
Breaking a contract is like a breakup.

479
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:27,567
Either you end things nicely,

480
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:28,368
or

481
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:29,767
both sides suffer.

482
00:28:31,047 --> 00:28:31,648
Do you think

483
00:28:31,848 --> 00:28:32,968
the allegorical long comic

484
00:28:32,968 --> 00:28:33,968
really supported him?

485
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:35,527
If they fall out,

486
00:28:35,784 --> 00:28:37,160
it'll also be tough for Liang Daiwen.

487
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:38,767
After all,

488
00:28:39,128 --> 00:28:40,408
Zhang Qingya led him into the industry.

489
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,327
What are you talking about?

490
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:45,727
Stop pretending.

491
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:48,327
The long comic

492
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:49,688
is your creation.

493
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:55,368
However,

494
00:28:55,848 --> 00:28:57,448
it's a shame you did it for a man.

495
00:28:58,648 --> 00:29:00,368
The bypass is a suitable platform.

496
00:29:01,112 --> 00:29:02,040
Play to your strengths.

497
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,327
You were shouting at me

498
00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:06,767
and demanding the right
to do independent content.

499
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:11,527
Weren't you drunk?

500
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:13,168
Did you hear everything?

501
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:15,327
I was drunk,

502
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:16,608
not deaf.

503
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:20,448
I'm surprised

504
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:21,448
by your drive.

505
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,920
I'm also glad to see it.

506
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:25,047
Go ahead and do it.

507
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:26,968
But remember,

508
00:29:28,128 --> 00:29:29,807
finding a partner who matches you

509
00:29:30,392 --> 00:29:31,520
is like hitting the jackpot.

510
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,208
Having

511
00:29:33,848 --> 00:29:35,287
your own muscle

512
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:38,128
gives you true strength.

513
00:29:42,888 --> 00:29:44,327
Since you brought it up,

514
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:46,928
please reimburse me

515
00:29:47,448 --> 00:29:49,168
for the taxi fare from that day.

516
00:29:53,807 --> 00:29:54,928
What did I just tell you?

517
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:56,727
Muscle.

518
00:29:58,767 --> 00:29:59,767
Build my own muscle.

519
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:00,848
I remember your advice.

520
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:07,913
(61.9km, 419 yuan)

521
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:09,560
I'll transfer you the money.

522
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,016
Take the trash out later.

523
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:39,848
What are you doing here?

524
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:43,408
I'm here to pick you up.

525
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:45,688
Liang Daiwen,

526
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:48,448
did you forget what I told you

527
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:49,247
at Fuzzy?

528
00:30:49,888 --> 00:30:50,527
No, I remember.

529
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,408
You said we shouldn't meet again.

530
00:30:53,968 --> 00:30:55,408
Then what are you doing here?

531
00:30:56,448 --> 00:30:57,448
I remember what you said,

532
00:30:58,008 --> 00:30:59,200
but that doesn't mean I agree.

533
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,520
It's hard to get a cab on a rainy day.

534
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:06,360
I only have one umbrella.

535
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:09,920
Do you want to share it with me?

536
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:39,247
Tactile paving.

537
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:41,968
It may not be common

538
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:43,848
to meet people with disabilities
in real life,

539
00:31:44,608 --> 00:31:46,368
but we need to respect their space.

540
00:32:05,848 --> 00:32:06,567
How's your studio

541
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:08,368
coming along?

542
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:10,007
It just started.

543
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:13,928
Li Ai is developing an application

544
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:16,767
that amplifies sound
for people with hearing issues.

545
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:18,648
It's like

546
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:20,767
a cochlear implant on a phone.

547
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:23,767
Isn't that

548
00:32:24,888 --> 00:32:25,928
a hearing aid?

549
00:32:28,368 --> 00:32:28,848
Sort of.

550
00:32:30,087 --> 00:32:31,087
But hearing aids

551
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:32,727
have strict medical standards

552
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:33,767
and are pricey.

553
00:32:34,928 --> 00:32:36,287
Compared to hearing aids,

554
00:32:37,168 --> 00:32:38,128
everyone has a phone now.

555
00:32:38,968 --> 00:32:39,928
A phone application

556
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:41,448
could achieve wider accessibility.

557
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:43,527
Subtitles were initially designed

558
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:46,208
for the hearing impaired.

559
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:51,688
Why are there

560
00:32:52,128 --> 00:32:54,007
apps to aid

561
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:55,368
hearing and sight

562
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:57,807
but not smell?

563
00:32:59,408 --> 00:33:02,047
Both hearing and sight
facilitate communication.

564
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:03,527
However, smell

565
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:05,567
can't be digitized.

566
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:06,968
Also,

567
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,616
it doesn't affect our daily lives much.

568
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:10,487
Why not?

569
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:12,767
The sense of smell is very important.

570
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:15,087
If you can't smell,

571
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:17,168
you won't know how fragrant the food is.

572
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:21,608
You can't also smell
perfume, fragrances,

573
00:33:21,848 --> 00:33:23,087
or body wash.

574
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:26,128
Right.

575
00:33:27,968 --> 00:33:28,688
And also pheromone.

576
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:33,007
It's said

577
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:34,247
everyone carries

578
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:35,527
a unique scent.

579
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:37,327
It helps us

580
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:38,776
identify our loved ones.

581
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,920
Why are you avoiding me?

582
00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:02,600
Did you think I wanted to kiss you?

583
00:34:05,047 --> 00:34:06,527
What are you sniffing for?

584
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:08,728
Are you a dog?

585
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:13,368
Don't worry.

586
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:14,687
I promised your mom

587
00:34:15,408 --> 00:34:16,007
I'd behave.

588
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,624
Regardless of the type of disability,

589
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:24,808
disabled people

590
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,888
can never fully enjoy the world.

591
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:29,408
This is the purpose of my job.

592
00:34:31,647 --> 00:34:32,968
I went to Italy before.

593
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:34,888
In Naples,

594
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,687
there's Braille on the railing.

595
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:39,808
It says,

596
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:42,368
"You're facing the ocean.

597
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:44,448
There are houses around you.

598
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:46,448
On the road,

599
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:47,720
flowers are in full bloom."

600
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:51,448
It helps blind people know

601
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,408
the scene they are visiting.

602
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:01,047
What a romantic place.

603
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:02,647
Did you go there with Zhang Qingya?

604
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:05,167
Are you jealous?

605
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:10,047
It was a business trip.

606
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:11,440
Nothing happened between us.

607
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:13,647
Nothing happened?

608
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:15,848
Then why didn't you file a lawsuit

609
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:17,647
when she slandered you?

610
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,487
I notice

611
00:35:22,968 --> 00:35:24,248
you hold grudges more than I do.

612
00:35:31,368 --> 00:35:32,207
Zhang Qingya

613
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:33,768
is my senior.

614
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:35,567
She helped me a lot

615
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:39,560
and guided me into this industry
when I was in college.

616
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:41,687
She went with me to every competition

617
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,296
and looked after me like a big sister.

618
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,488
I'm not a cooperative person,

619
00:35:47,527 --> 00:35:49,047
so she was always torn

620
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,344
between me and the clients.

621
00:35:52,207 --> 00:35:53,448
However, I never expected things

622
00:35:53,928 --> 00:35:54,728
to turn out this way,

623
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,360
and I don't want to argue over it.

624
00:35:58,904 --> 00:36:00,424
It's seven figures we're talking about.

625
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:02,047
You let it go that easily.

626
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:05,607
You're too soft-hearted.

627
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:07,607
No wonder she bullies you.

628
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,328
It's fine that they bully me,

629
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,768
but they can't bully you.

630
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:16,087
Boya is your client.

631
00:36:16,504 --> 00:36:18,472
You have a lot of flaws
when dealing with people,

632
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:19,448
careless,

633
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:20,607
and easily riled up.

634
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,344
That's why it's easy
for her to target you.

635
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:25,248
Who has a lot of flaws?

636
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:31,567
I do.

637
00:36:36,687 --> 00:36:37,647
You asked me that question

638
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:39,288
back at your place.

639
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:40,928
I wasn't sober enough

640
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:42,167
to react.

641
00:36:44,527 --> 00:36:45,728
Now I want to answer you properly...

642
00:36:46,848 --> 00:36:48,328
Wait.

643
00:36:49,288 --> 00:36:51,047
Don't you say something tacky.

644
00:36:51,192 --> 00:36:52,328
I don't want to hear it.

645
00:36:57,207 --> 00:36:58,087
I want to tell you

646
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:04,087
I love you.

647
00:37:38,296 --> 00:37:39,040
The door is unlocked.

648
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:39,888
I'm home, Mom.

649
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:42,288
You're back.

650
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:44,768
You look tired.

651
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:45,288
Come here.

652
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:47,607
Why haven't you slept yet?

653
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:49,527
What are you writing?

654
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:52,047
I'm waiting for you

655
00:37:52,127 --> 00:37:52,888
and doing bookkeeping.

656
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:55,400
There's no need to jot down
your grocery expenses.

657
00:37:56,487 --> 00:37:58,328
I got promoted.

658
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:00,127
I can pay for anything
you buy from now on.

659
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,848
Really?

660
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,127
You're such a nice girl.

661
00:38:06,127 --> 00:38:07,127
I have something to tell you.

662
00:38:07,527 --> 00:38:08,087
Sure.

663
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:12,248
If you're not busy with your work,

664
00:38:12,848 --> 00:38:13,647
take a few days off.

665
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:15,160
Let's go back to our hometown.

666
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:16,607
Why?

667
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:18,768
I want to sign the house over to you,

668
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:20,888
so I won't have any worries.

669
00:38:23,487 --> 00:38:24,279
What do you mean?

670
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,206
Why do you want to transfer

671
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:26,808
the house to me
all of a sudden?

672
00:38:28,728 --> 00:38:30,248
You've grown up.

673
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:31,487
Aren't you worried?

674
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:33,728
Liang Daiwen is back now.

675
00:38:34,328 --> 00:38:35,808
If I sign the house over to you,

676
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:37,928
it's considered
your premarital property.

677
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:39,527
Owning a house

678
00:38:39,808 --> 00:38:40,567
gives you confidence

679
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:41,567
and courage.

680
00:38:41,784 --> 00:38:43,992
You'll have nothing to worry about
even if anything happens to you.

681
00:38:45,848 --> 00:38:47,928
I never said I wanted
to get married, Mom.

682
00:38:48,184 --> 00:38:49,480
Don't try to brush me off with that.

683
00:38:49,624 --> 00:38:50,840
Hurry up and tell me. What's it?

684
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,312
You're getting sharper now.

685
00:38:54,728 --> 00:38:55,768
You can see through me.

686
00:38:56,216 --> 00:38:57,280
If you don't tell me the truth,

687
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,368
I won't go back with you.

688
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:02,047
All right.

689
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:03,928
Well,

690
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:05,928
I'm getting married to Mr. He.

691
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:07,808
What?

692
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:09,607
Seriously?

693
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:10,487
Yes.

694
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:12,728
After I sign the house over to you,

695
00:39:13,007 --> 00:39:14,007
I'll be on my own.

696
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,128
Anything wrong with that?

697
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,728
I knew something had happened.

698
00:39:19,928 --> 00:39:21,400
You're so anxious to transfer the house

699
00:39:21,432 --> 00:39:22,680
so it won't delay your wedding.

700
00:39:23,047 --> 00:39:23,728
So, do you agree?

701
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:26,527
Of course I do. I couldn't agree more.

702
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:28,527
Mr. He is a good man.

703
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:30,607
I'll take leave tomorrow.

704
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:32,127
Very good.

705
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:33,768
Yes!

706
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,112
Now go wash up.

707
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:36,127
All right.

708
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:38,368
That's wonderful.

709
00:40:02,808 --> 00:40:03,928
I think I'm pretty

710
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:05,487
and I usually

711
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:06,567
dress up a lot.

712
00:40:07,567 --> 00:40:08,448
People around me

713
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:10,368
gave me a nickname.

714
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:11,288
It's called

715
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:13,808
"Gorgeous-Wicked Lady".

716
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:16,328
I really liked it.

717
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:18,928
Only then

718
00:40:18,928 --> 00:40:19,600
(My Request)

719
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,968
(Jacqueline approved)
did I realize that...

720
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:22,288
Yes!

721
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:28,567
Why are you so happy?

722
00:40:31,408 --> 00:40:33,007
You should be sitting in the audience.

723
00:40:33,207 --> 00:40:34,087
What are you doing here?

724
00:40:34,888 --> 00:40:36,047
I can't be far away from you.

725
00:40:36,408 --> 00:40:37,127
I get anxious.

726
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:39,087
Too bad,

727
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,167
I just got my leave approved.

728
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,784
I'm taking my mom back
to the northeast tomorrow.

729
00:40:44,047 --> 00:40:44,968
Enjoy the anxiety yourself.

730
00:40:46,087 --> 00:40:47,047
Take me with you.

731
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,864
We're back for some serious business.
Why should I take you?

732
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:51,808
I can

733
00:40:52,527 --> 00:40:53,408
help you out.

734
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:55,848
We can manage.

735
00:41:08,288 --> 00:41:09,007
Honestly,

736
00:41:11,007 --> 00:41:12,768
I went to a boarding school in Donghai

737
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,928
when I was in junior high.

738
00:41:14,968 --> 00:41:15,968
It's been many years

739
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:18,368
since I last went back to the northeast.

740
00:41:18,368 --> 00:41:18,928
My hometown...

741
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:19,527
Liang Daiwen,

742
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:21,328
drop your act.

743
00:41:22,768 --> 00:41:24,728
You just went back from Dalian.

744
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:36,487
Don't call my mom.

745
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:38,167
No.

746
00:41:38,808 --> 00:41:39,248
Very well.

747
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,408
You'd better keep your word.

748
00:41:43,448 --> 00:41:44,368
Are you there, Mdm. Wang?

749
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,368
Are you there, Mdm. Wang?

750
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,007
Are you there, Mdm. Wang?

751
00:41:47,928 --> 00:41:49,207
What are you doing?

752
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:52,207
Who's calling me?

753
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:57,647
Mdm. Wang,

754
00:41:58,687 --> 00:41:59,328
I'm Liang.

755
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:02,047
Gu Yi said you're going back
to your hometown tomorrow.

756
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:03,888
Can I tag along?

757
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:04,848
Sure.

758
00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:06,207
Mom.

759
00:42:07,888 --> 00:42:08,408
It's fine.

760
00:42:08,616 --> 00:42:10,056
If she doesn't want to take you, I will.

761
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:13,448
See you tomorrow, Mdm. Wang.

762
00:42:13,527 --> 00:42:14,127
All right.

763
00:42:59,768 --> 00:43:00,567
We've arrived.

764
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:06,647
Come.

765
00:43:06,968 --> 00:43:07,408
Come.

766
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,087
Nephew-in-law!

767
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:14,647
Nephew-in-law!

768
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:16,928
Nephew-in-law!

769
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:18,248
Here you go.

770
00:43:18,288 --> 00:43:19,328
Nephew-in-law!

771
00:43:20,328 --> 00:43:20,888
Aunt,

772
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:21,928
what is this?

773
00:43:21,968 --> 00:43:23,448
You look like a fan girl at the airport.

774
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:24,567
Look at him.

775
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:25,728
Tall and handsome.

776
00:43:26,007 --> 00:43:28,167
Perfect for my nephew-in-law.

777
00:43:28,207 --> 00:43:30,007
Who said he's your nephew-in-law?

778
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:30,768
I did.

779
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:32,136
Why? Is he not good enough for you?

780
00:43:32,328 --> 00:43:33,047
I am.

781
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:33,607
Shut up.

782
00:43:33,888 --> 00:43:34,567
You shut up, too.

783
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:36,687
Let's take a photo.

784
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,288
Look at me.

785
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:39,647
Wait.

786
00:43:40,768 --> 00:43:41,607
What's wrong with you?

787
00:43:43,768 --> 00:43:44,328
My bad.

788
00:43:45,487 --> 00:43:46,408
Are you guys ready?

789
00:43:46,408 --> 00:43:47,607
One, two, three.

790
00:43:47,607 --> 00:43:49,527
Cheese.

791
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:50,248
