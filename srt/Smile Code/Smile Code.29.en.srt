=Smile Code=

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
(Adapted from Douban Read's work
"Smile Code" by Zu Yue)

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,040
=Episode 29=

25
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:58,143
The data is very intuitive.

26
00:01:58,863 --> 00:01:59,863
Tell me what you think.

27
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:02,423
In my opinion, I think we can

28
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:04,540
let go of a portion
of high-end luxury deals,

29
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:05,703
create deeper content,

30
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:07,783
and create topics that youngsters
can resonate with

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,140
to streamline communication channels.

32
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:10,982
We can give it a try.

33
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:12,742
But print media is the main focus here.

34
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:13,939
The backend data for the revamped

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,512
public social media account
looks pretty good.

36
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:17,023
The number of fans is growing.

37
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:18,808
The business operations
are keeping up too.

38
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:20,262
However, print media

39
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:21,743
doesn't do online sales.

40
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,783
The sales performance is subpar.

41
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:25,382
No matter how good the data looks,

42
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:26,952
the company will still incur losses.

43
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:29,662
I studied Art List's sales data before.

44
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:32,743
It relies mainly on idols
and celebrities to create buzz.

45
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:34,503
They'll create content
based on the buzz.

46
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,360
It's time-dependent.

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,210
It looks fancy, but the content
doesn't have any substance.

48
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:39,343
The fan base is weak.

49
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:41,343
There's no stable customer base.

50
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:43,262
Data doesn't grow by itself.

51
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:44,463
It's accumulated through time.

52
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,862
The group's entire line of print media

53
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:46,943
has a stable business chain.

54
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:50,102
For Art List, you don't need
to make it as hot-selling as Nextmonday.

55
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:51,832
However, your content
must be substantial.

56
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:53,183
You must maintain its reputation.

57
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:56,382
Understood.

58
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,088
I'll head back
and organize the proposal.

59
00:02:58,542 --> 00:02:58,982
By the way,

60
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:01,736
Liang Daiwen will be giving a seminar
about accessible designs tonight.

61
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:02,584
Why don't you attend it?

62
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:04,743
What's wrong?

63
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:06,780
Are you interested in
something like this as well?

64
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:10,382
I'm unconvinced by Penny's words.

65
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:11,862
She told me

66
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:13,820
that we would be damaging
Zhang Qingya's reputation

67
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,382
by publishing Liang Daiwen's interview.

68
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,820
Let's put aside the magazine for now.

69
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,968
We have to fulfill our social
obligations from time to time,

70
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:19,420
am I right?

71
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:21,303
Publicly supporting a seminar once

72
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,936
doesn't mean we have selfish motives.

73
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,102
Understood.

74
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:25,288
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

75
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:26,702
You don't need to thank me.

76
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:28,180
I did nothing to help you out.

77
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:31,422
I've told Penny about this.

78
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,340
Just do what you're supposed to do.

79
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:36,500
For the branch publications,

80
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:38,783
if the readership for the next issue
exceeds 10,000 views,

81
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,740
you'll get a 20,000 yuan year-end bonus.

82
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:45,743
50,000 yuan.

83
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:47,223
35,000 yuan.

84
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:48,183
45,000 yuan.

85
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:49,063
40,000 yuan.

86
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:49,582
You...

87
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:50,142
Deal.

88
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:56,262
Go now.

89
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:26,902
Ladies, please.

90
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,728
(The newer mobile phone features will
make you farther away from these people)

91
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:02,142
Hello, everyone.

92
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:03,543
Welcome to

93
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:05,320
our accessibility product
promotional seminar.

94
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,020
I'm Liang Daiwen,
the designer of the product.

95
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:10,142
Before I begin,

96
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:11,782
I have a question for you all.

97
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:13,779
Among

98
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,888
your friends, family members,

99
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:15,983
and colleagues,

100
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:17,700
are there any people with disabilities?

101
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:26,420
According to my understanding,

102
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:28,503
one out of seven people

103
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,222
has disabilities.

104
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:33,022
We might not notice their presence

105
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:34,342
during our daily lives,

106
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:35,743
however,

107
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,222
just like us,

108
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:39,943
they have the right
to fulfill their needs too.

109
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:43,342
Now, I mainly focus on
accessibility design.

110
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,582
I have a professional R&D team.

111
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:48,540
I have gained a deeper understanding
of people with disabilities.

112
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:50,222
I realized that...

113
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:53,503
Director Peng planned to give you
some additional business ads

114
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:54,423
in the later issues.

115
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,072
Why didn't you reply
to his texts on WeChat?

116
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:00,744
I'll definitely do it
if the ads are good.

117
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,663
But I won't do something like this

118
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,848
just to please the clients.

119
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:07,022
Girl, are you dumb?

120
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:08,540
How could the sponsor know who you are

121
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:10,582
if you don't show yourself?

122
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:12,663
Can you two please stop talking?

123
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,863
There's a seminar going on right now.

124
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:18,103
You're Gu Yi, right?

125
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:19,782
I remember you.

126
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:21,462
You're Zhang Junjie's sweetheart.

127
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:24,222
How is it?

128
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:25,582
Has she given you a raise?

129
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:27,582
Shut up.

130
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:29,800
There are regulations
for a wage raise in Nextmonday.

131
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,680
She's still inexperienced.

132
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:34,582
The editor-in-chief doesn't even
have the right to demand a raise?

133
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:36,022
Just look at them.

134
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:37,943
I told you before.

135
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,608
I said you could become
my business partner.

136
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:40,808
But you weren't willing to do so.

137
00:06:42,063 --> 00:06:43,262
That old fox Roger

138
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:44,543
is suppressing you every day.

139
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:45,983
How can you stand that?

140
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:47,822
You're noisy.

141
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:49,582
Shut up. Stop talking.

142
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:51,423
I'll tell you in private.

143
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:53,822
Now, Penny's reign

144
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:54,943
is already over.

145
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,262
If you kick her out of the company

146
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:58,543
and replace her with Gu Yi,

147
00:06:59,063 --> 00:06:59,582
I'm sure Roger

148
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:01,342
won't raise any eyebrows.

149
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:03,688
Sit down.

150
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:04,380
What are you doing?

151
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,582
I'm not done yet.

152
00:07:06,222 --> 00:07:06,943
Sorry about this.

153
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:08,743
The people in the last row,

154
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:10,743
please leave immediately.

155
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:16,303
Are you referring to me?

156
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:17,663
That's right.

157
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:20,142
Sorry. We'll stop talking.
Please continue.

158
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:23,582
Please leave.

159
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:26,103
Your speaking volume
has already affected other people.

160
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:28,462
And, you guys kept chatting.

161
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,543
That means

162
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:32,022
you guys are uninterested in my seminar.

163
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,543
Please reserve those seats
for those who need it.

164
00:07:34,863 --> 00:07:36,022
For those who need it?

165
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:36,743
What?

166
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:38,744
Are these priority seats
for disabled people?

167
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:40,423
Are there any disabled people here?

168
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:42,782
Please leave immediately.

169
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:45,063
Hey, you.

170
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:48,022
Do you think you can achieve success

171
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:49,543
with your accessible designs?

172
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,020
You're getting ahead of yourself

173
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:53,262
just because of this seminar, huh?

174
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:54,408
I'll say this one last time.

175
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:55,983
Leave immediately.

176
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,392
Sorry about that, everyone.

177
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:33,663
Let's continue.

178
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,340
I'll get the car. I'll send you back.

179
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:49,342
Gu Yi,

180
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:51,060
follow me back and work overtime.

181
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:52,943
Drive the car here.

182
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:02,383
Do you need me to text Mr. Yu

183
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:03,423
and tell him to pick you up?

184
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:08,580
No need for that.

185
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:10,063
Gu Yi,

186
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:12,143
once I'm done with this program,

187
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:13,099
I can be together

188
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,392
with Yu Dule
without any worries.

189
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:16,102
Just trust me.

190
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:17,023
I know my own limits.

191
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:20,220
I'll be going now.

192
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,656
(Mr. Yu, grant me access
to Fuzzy's backend.)

193
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:37,582
I've already granted you access.

194
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:39,779
After you're done,

195
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,824
just upload the video directly.

196
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,720
Thank you, sir.

197
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,143
Just shut up.

198
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:01,023
You were the one who wanted
to do rough cuts.

199
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:02,183
Stop mocking me.

200
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:03,742
I'm not.

201
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:05,170
Doing rough cuts
is a kind of job as well.

202
00:10:05,176 --> 00:10:06,616
There's nothing embarrassing about that.

203
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:11,139
Are you in trouble lately?

204
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,680
You've been trying to
do all kinds of jobs here.

205
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:14,303
Just tell me if you're in trouble.

206
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:15,783
I'll do everything
I can to help you out.

207
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,888
I'm getting married

208
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:19,780
and buying a house.

209
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:21,502
As if.

210
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:23,342
You think I don't know you?

211
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:26,568
You're someone who has seen through
the facade of life

212
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:27,900
and has no desire at all.

213
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:30,456
You would only think of getting married
after losing your mind.

214
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:32,862
Maybe...

215
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,536
Maybe I did lose my mind.

216
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:36,742
I'll stop messing with you.

217
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:37,822
I'll make a move first.

218
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:38,943
You should leave early too.

219
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,120
Since they're rough cuts,

220
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:40,903
just do a rough job.

221
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:41,702
Alright.

222
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:43,112
I'll organize the materials first.

223
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,294
(Official Filming)

224
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:06,640
(Liang Daiwen
Accessibility Design Seminar)

225
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:55,622
All of these are something
that we can come up with.

226
00:12:56,702 --> 00:12:58,383
It's also easily accepted

227
00:12:58,462 --> 00:13:00,023
by youngsters like us.

228
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:00,903
However,

229
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:02,303
for elderly people,

230
00:13:02,664 --> 00:13:03,976
people with disabilities are...

231
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,023
Guan Xingxin has been
living with me lately.

232
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:13,543
During our casual chat,
she mentioned by accident

233
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:15,702
that Liang Daiwen has alexithymia.

234
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:18,822
To outsiders,
this psychological issue may seem

235
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:19,543
insignificant,

236
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:22,102
but to his partner,

237
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,240
he'll show you the cold shoulder
like what he did today

238
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:26,840
on numerous occasions in the future.

239
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:28,582
Are you sure you don't mind that?

240
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,822
Liang Daiwen is very important to me.

241
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,822
It doesn't make sense for me
to give up on him

242
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:38,222
because of alexithymia.

243
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:42,780
I've come up
with this week's theme for you.

244
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:45,176
Finalize the schedule plan
within this week.

245
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:47,102
You can't edit this video

246
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:48,582
with your lousy laptop.

247
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:50,582
Edit it with my computer.

248
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,896
But you're not allowed
to touch the items on the desk.

249
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:55,943
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

250
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:07,943
Here.

251
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:13,663
The ads

252
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:14,939
were very effective.

253
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,022
It's all thanks to Director Peng.

254
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:16,862
You were outstanding.

255
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:17,622
And,

256
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:18,702
the female lead beside him

257
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:19,663
was outstanding too.

258
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:19,939
Yes.

259
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,288
Director Peng,
thank you for your support.

260
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:22,423
Good job, everyone.

261
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:23,502
Come on, let's eat.

262
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:23,862
Okay?

263
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:24,462
Let's eat.

264
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,063
Let's eat.

265
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,742
Wenda.

266
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:27,663
Xingxin.

267
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:30,943
You're late.

268
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:31,903
Sorry about that.

269
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:32,783
Mr. Liu, I'm truly sorry.

270
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:33,379
Come.

271
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,760
Mr. Liu, let me introduce her to you.

272
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:35,620
This is Guan Xingxin.

273
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:36,900
This is Mr. Liu. Hurry and greet him.

274
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,520
Nice to meet you, Miss Guan.

275
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,464
Nice to meet you, Mr. Liu.

276
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:40,423
I've long heard of you.

277
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:42,543
Wenda often mentioned you.

278
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:43,663
You look great.

279
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:45,502
Mr. Liu,

280
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:47,183
I'm truly sorry about today.

281
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:48,023
Sorry for the wait.

282
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,912
I prepared some excellent liquor
for you in my car.

283
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:50,600
I'll drink with you

284
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:51,420
once it arrives.

285
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:52,822
Why don't we

286
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:53,862
invite Miss Guan as well?

287
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:55,903
Unfortunately,

288
00:14:56,168 --> 00:14:58,220
Miss Guan is negotiating
a deal with other variety shows.

289
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,489
It would be terrible if someone were

290
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,440
to film her on camera, right?

291
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:01,704
What about this?

292
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,288
Both of us will buy you
a meal in the future,

293
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:03,702
okay?

294
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:04,543
That will do.

295
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:05,480
Please have a seat first.

296
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:06,216
I'll come back in a second.

297
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:06,660
Okay.

298
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,336
Please have a seat.

299
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:11,940
Here, Mr. Liu.

300
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:13,303
Come. Let's drink.

301
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:13,982
Let's drink.

302
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,416
Don't misunderstand me.

303
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,783
I did that on purpose
for that lecher to see.

304
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:28,943
There's nothing fun around here.

305
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:30,423
My room is upstairs.

306
00:15:30,423 --> 00:15:31,543
This is the access card. Take it.

307
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:33,303
Take a break and wait for my news.

308
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:35,423
No need for that.

309
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:37,048
If there's nothing else,
I'll head back first.

310
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:39,183
Where?

311
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:40,968
Are you heading to find your boyfriend?

312
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,579
It's just one night, you know?

313
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,032
How much is this going to delay you?

314
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:47,943
Listen,

315
00:15:48,263 --> 00:15:49,663
wouldn't it be meaningless for you

316
00:15:49,943 --> 00:15:50,979
to be angry at your boyfriend

317
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,088
if they replace you after this?

318
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:53,502
Are they going to replace me?

319
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:57,423
I don't think this scene

320
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,502
is included in the script, right?

321
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:00,260
A complex multi-individual relationship

322
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:01,383
that includes the three casts.

323
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:02,303
That's how they boost

324
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,582
the viewership rating.

325
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:05,582
You're beautiful.

326
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,544
And, you were on the Hot Search
because of a scandal.

327
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,580
You're the best scapegoat they have.

328
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,816
There's no risk if they replace you.

329
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:10,423
Besides,

330
00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:11,960
you don't have
any business endorsements now.

331
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:13,496
They can save a hefty sum
of compensation fees.

332
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:14,770
Why did you think I brought you here

333
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:16,260
to meet the advertisers?

334
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,480
You think it was for fun?

335
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:19,982
What are you doing?

336
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:21,739
You don't need to cry.

337
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,112
They won't replace you when I'm here.

338
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:24,940
Who will they replace me with?

339
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:28,663
Have you lost your mind?

340
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,312
You face the risk
of getting replaced, you know?

341
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:31,368
Why consider others' feelings?

342
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:32,263
Guan Xingxin,

343
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:33,822
listen closely.

344
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:35,700
If she withdraws from the deal,

345
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,984
she can make her debut in a web drama.

346
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,912
If you withdraw from the deal,

347
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:39,272
you can only head back
and get a rich husband.

348
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:40,063
Understood?

349
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:42,102
Tend to your needs first.

350
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,303
Do a good job with the variety show.

351
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:45,783
Once you become popular,

352
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:47,502
you never need
to depend on anyone again.

353
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:56,982
Guan Xingxin!

354
00:16:57,303 --> 00:16:57,742
What's wrong?

355
00:16:58,462 --> 00:16:59,063
Guan Xingxin!

356
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:31,423
Are you awake?

357
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,600
Your blood sugar level
was too low, you know?

358
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,616
You need to bring
some sweet snacks with you.

359
00:17:37,383 --> 00:17:38,062
Finish this.

360
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,728
Get some sugar.

361
00:17:39,302 --> 00:17:40,022
Did you make this?

362
00:17:40,472 --> 00:17:41,736
No. I called for room service.

363
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,424
Zhang Junjie faced the same issue
in the past.

364
00:17:44,702 --> 00:17:45,979
That's why I always made her this.

365
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,032
It's taro balls with milk paste.

366
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,220
It's too sweet for me.

367
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:49,183
Hurry and finish it.

368
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:50,863
I have no appetite.

369
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:52,863
Where's my phone?

370
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:55,262
Stop looking for it.

371
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:57,262
I have it with me.

372
00:17:58,742 --> 00:17:59,782
Look closely.

373
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:02,022
No one texted you.

374
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:04,062
You should forget about that man.

375
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:06,383
You'll have a better life soon.

376
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:10,462
You're very open-minded.

377
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:12,062
Why can't you get over Jacqueline?

378
00:18:16,408 --> 00:18:17,800
I need to return to the dinner table.

379
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:18,980
Remember to finish it.

380
00:18:20,262 --> 00:18:20,742
And,

381
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:22,262
it's just a variety show.

382
00:18:22,296 --> 00:18:24,260
Don't do such an extreme diet
and risk your own health.

383
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:26,143
Rest well.

384
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:34,507
(Baby girl, the signal is terrible here.
Mom will call you back later.)

385
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:19,103
Ms. Gu.

386
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:20,542
You...

387
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:21,943
Are you still angry at me?

388
00:20:26,062 --> 00:20:26,702
Ms. Gu,

389
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:28,583
why are you still angry at me?

390
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:35,103
Ms. Gu,

391
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:37,143
I knew that you were still angry.

392
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:50,302
Gu Yi,

393
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:52,782
I'm sorry.

394
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:55,903
I...

395
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,062
I don't know
how I should apologize to you.

396
00:20:59,943 --> 00:21:01,183
I was wrong for kicking you out

397
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:02,623
of the venue.

398
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:04,943
I...

399
00:21:05,302 --> 00:21:07,143
I didn't consider your feelings.

400
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:08,542
I made you lose face.

401
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,823
I was in a working mood back then.

402
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:13,262
I couldn't think straight.

403
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:14,782
I promise

404
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:17,262
that I won't do it again.

405
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:19,823
I'm begging you.

406
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:21,583
Can you please forgive me?

407
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:28,823
I'm begging you.

408
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:30,022
Can you please

409
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:32,022
forgive me?

410
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:36,183
What are you doing?

411
00:21:43,663 --> 00:21:45,062
Have you heard everything?

412
00:21:46,423 --> 00:21:47,103
Yeah.

413
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,104
I'm here to apologize to you.

414
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:52,383
I was just

415
00:21:52,903 --> 00:21:53,623
rehearsing the scene.

416
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:57,583
You even bought a cake?

417
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:00,583
I bought it as an apology.

418
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,512
I didn't want the misunderstanding
to last overnight.

419
00:22:04,302 --> 00:22:04,742
I'm sorry.

420
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:07,700
I shouldn't have kicked you out
of the venue.

421
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:15,262
Are you no longer angry at me?

422
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:20,062
I wasn't angry at you
in the first place.

423
00:22:21,143 --> 00:22:22,702
And, we interrupted your seminar too.

424
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:24,542
I was planning to apologize to you too.

425
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:27,742
Come here.

426
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,872
I have something to show you.

427
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:31,663
In recent years,

428
00:22:31,704 --> 00:22:33,304
smartphones have been
constantly evolving.

429
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,103
I believe that you guys can tell

430
00:22:35,863 --> 00:22:36,982
that the methods of operation

431
00:22:37,096 --> 00:22:38,472
starting from the keyboard to...

432
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:41,502
I came back and rewatched

433
00:22:41,502 --> 00:22:42,262
the entire seminar.

434
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,502
I selected several important scenes

435
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:45,782
and turned them into a short clip.

436
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:48,742
Although the SFX might look terrible,

437
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:49,903
I think

438
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:50,943
they should be usable.

439
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:53,022
I plan to post it online

440
00:22:53,462 --> 00:22:55,022
after adding a topic to it.

441
00:22:55,502 --> 00:22:57,183
This way, people will find your seminar

442
00:22:57,352 --> 00:22:58,860
when they search for
accessibility designs.

443
00:23:03,502 --> 00:23:04,863
I'll post it online

444
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,328
if you don't have any objections.

445
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:15,863
You...

446
00:23:16,302 --> 00:23:16,903
What's wrong?

447
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,448
It's nothing.

448
00:23:23,222 --> 00:23:25,222
I was just reminded of
what Huang Wenda said to me.

449
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,616
He said there's no future
for accessible designs.

450
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:35,423
Girlfriend,

451
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:37,823
thank you for the clip.

452
00:23:43,062 --> 00:23:43,583
Eat up.

453
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,222
For such topics,

454
00:24:14,222 --> 00:24:15,702
it might cause copyright issues.

455
00:24:16,143 --> 00:24:17,383
Remember to cite the sources

456
00:24:17,383 --> 00:24:18,502
when you gather materials.

457
00:24:18,982 --> 00:24:20,222
Verify everything before posting it.

458
00:24:21,432 --> 00:24:22,700
These social topics can be highlighted

459
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:24,462
and developed into a dedicated feature.

460
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:26,702
But you should interview more people

461
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,992
and gather more information.

462
00:24:28,863 --> 00:24:30,502
As for the rest,

463
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,262
you can use them as product placement.

464
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:34,583
However, you need to filter out
the products

465
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:36,600
so that it won't overlap with
Nextmonday's issue.

466
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:37,583
Understood.

467
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:38,502
Boss, don't worry.

468
00:24:51,613 --> 00:24:54,660
(Xu Guanrui: Gravity Bar)

469
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,048
You're here.

470
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:12,260
You guys can go ahead.

471
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,256
Alright, you can go ahead.

472
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:16,823
What are we interviewing today?

473
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,782
Music performance space,
like what I told you last time.

474
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:21,423
Many singers

475
00:25:21,423 --> 00:25:23,062
started out their careers here.

476
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:24,583
At night, the atmosphere here

477
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,780
is comparable to a concert.

478
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:28,863
But it's not open yet.

479
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:30,022
Aren't we too early?

480
00:25:31,903 --> 00:25:32,823
We're a little early.

481
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:34,863
But actually,

482
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:36,542
I wanted to take you out for a walk.

483
00:25:37,383 --> 00:25:38,343
Do you feel troubled lately?

484
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:44,782
Mr. Xu,

485
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:47,502
actually,

486
00:25:47,782 --> 00:25:49,383
I haven't had the time to tell you this.

487
00:25:54,823 --> 00:25:56,183
Liang Daiwen and I are a couple now.

488
00:25:59,022 --> 00:25:59,982
I'm not surprised.

489
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:02,103
However,

490
00:26:02,823 --> 00:26:03,739
you just need to be sure

491
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,144
that the relationship
he's providing to you

492
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:05,780
is what you seek.

493
00:26:09,623 --> 00:26:10,823
Many things had happened

494
00:26:10,823 --> 00:26:12,103
after his return.

495
00:26:13,742 --> 00:26:15,343
I can't face all of them alone,

496
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:17,782
yet he can empathize with me.

497
00:26:19,343 --> 00:26:20,542
Although I don't know how far

498
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:21,903
our relationship can go,

499
00:26:22,903 --> 00:26:23,702
at this very moment,

500
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:24,903
I wish

501
00:26:25,903 --> 00:26:27,262
to experience more things with him.

502
00:26:28,623 --> 00:26:29,103
Good.

503
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:30,262
I'm happy for you.

504
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:33,262
I can sing any song you like

505
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:35,782
as long as you're happy.

506
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:37,782
You...

507
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:39,022
What's wrong?

508
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,776
I'm a professional singer too, you know?

509
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:45,542
Perform Errenzhuan for me.

510
00:26:51,742 --> 00:26:52,222
Alright.

511
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:53,502
Look closely.

512
00:26:53,502 --> 00:26:53,982
Alright.

513
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:11,943
This song is for a certain individual.

514
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:15,383
I always thought
that humans were connected

515
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:17,423
to each other magnetically.

516
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:20,504
I've been trying to look for
someone who has the same frequency

517
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,943
with me all these years.

518
00:27:23,262 --> 00:27:24,663
I was lucky enough to find her.

519
00:27:26,903 --> 00:27:28,183
But unfortunately,

520
00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:30,502
I cannot possess her.

521
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:35,462
Gu Yi,

522
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:40,222
I truly fancy you.

523
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:45,060
I had plenty of wonderful memories

524
00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:46,903
of spending my time with you.

525
00:27:49,022 --> 00:27:50,343
I will never forget them.

are you done having fun?

545
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:07,782
to tell you.

546
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:16,220

It's good news.

00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:17,863

(Answer)

551
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:32,022
Hello, Mom.

552
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:35,272
Why did you give me a voice call
instead of answering my video call?

553
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,423
Isn't it the same thing?

554
00:30:38,343 --> 00:30:41,062
I've gained quite
a lot of weight lately.

555
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:43,062
My skin is in terrible condition too.

556
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:45,383
Give me some time.

557
00:30:48,903 --> 00:30:50,343
I thought you had something to tell me.

558
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:51,423
Why are you keeping quiet?

559
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,640
I'll hang up if you have nothing to say.

560
00:30:58,742 --> 00:30:59,183
Mom,

561
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:03,623
I love you.

562
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,062
I love you the most.

563
00:31:09,663 --> 00:31:10,782
I love you forever.

564
00:31:12,782 --> 00:31:13,823
I'll still love you the most

565
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:15,272
even when I'm 100 years old.

566
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:16,168
I'll always love you.

567
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:19,502
Me too.

568
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:26,302
Mom,

569
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,502
the Errenzhuan clip I sent to you,

570
00:31:29,502 --> 00:31:30,262
have you watched it?

571
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:31,823
I have.

572
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:33,062
It sounded great.

573
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:37,222
I'll sing it for you

574
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,623
once I've learned the art.

575
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:41,823
I'll wait for you.

576
00:31:43,062 --> 00:31:44,823
You can sing it for me when I'm back.

577
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:46,343
Okay.

578
00:31:48,183 --> 00:31:48,982
Gu Yi,

579
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:51,343
I'm getting sleepy.

580
00:31:52,863 --> 00:31:54,183
I'll hang up first.

581
00:31:55,022 --> 00:31:55,903
Good night, Mom.

582
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:56,982
Good night.

583
00:31:57,823 --> 00:31:58,542
I love you.

584
00:32:00,103 --> 00:32:01,062
Got it.

585
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:02,702
I'll hang up now.

586
00:32:43,022 --> 00:32:43,943
Liang Daiwen,

587
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,343
my mother didn't answer my video call.

588
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:53,782
Whenever I gave her video calls,

589
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,903
she would put on very thick makeup.

590
00:32:59,462 --> 00:33:01,663
I know that she's afraid
that I might find out

591
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:03,222
that she wasn't in her best state.

592
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,022
But this time,

593
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,262
she didn't even answer my video call.

594
00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:18,502
I know that I shouldn't
overthink things.

595
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:22,742
But I can't help myself.

596
00:33:31,863 --> 00:33:33,542
I don't know what I should do.

597
00:33:37,423 --> 00:33:38,542
I don't want to...

598
00:34:59,383 --> 00:34:59,943
Girl,

599
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:01,943
is your door lock broken?

600
00:35:03,943 --> 00:35:04,783
Let me check it out.

601
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,662
It's done now.

602
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:14,783
The electronic door lock is fixed.

603
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:16,020
Next time, remember to check

604
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:17,502
the battery.

605
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,383
It's no wonder your boyfriend

606
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:20,383
was panicking.

607
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:22,462
He insisted on hiring
a female locksmith to fix the door

608
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:23,542
at this late hour.

609
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:25,542
Alright. I'll make a move now.

610
00:35:35,743 --> 00:35:36,582
Liang Daiwen,

611
00:35:38,343 --> 00:35:39,223
are you there?

612
00:35:40,662 --> 00:35:41,263
I'm downstairs.

613
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,328
I just arrived.

614
00:35:51,802 --> 00:35:54,552

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,958

Alright.

632
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:21,662
That's it.

633
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:23,303
Ms. Zhang,

634
00:37:24,582 --> 00:37:26,582
can I apply for a few days' leave?

635
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:28,982
You're applying for leave?

636
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:30,783
I...

637
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,096
I have something to do.

638
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:34,502
Is it urgent?

639
00:37:36,943 --> 00:37:37,622
It's very important.

640
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:41,582
You've finished your annual leave.

641
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,368
What about this?

642
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,903
Finish drawing the comic
for the next issue.

643
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,920
If it's approved,

644
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,680
I'll let you apply for personal leave.

645
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,648
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

646
00:38:00,102 --> 00:38:01,062
Nowadays, there are

647
00:38:01,142 --> 00:38:02,582
two types of online scams.

648
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:04,823
For the first type,
their targets are usually...

649
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,856
I'm taking a break.

650
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,512
Why don't we drink?

651
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,728
You don't offer me drinks for no reason.

652
00:38:10,863 --> 00:38:11,783
Just get to the point.

653
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,450
(Guan Xingxin's Mom: Break up
with my daughter immediately.)

654
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,443
(You can't even afford a house.
You're deadweight.)

655
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:26,364
(You took advantage of my daughter's
kindness, you scum.)

656
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:28,600
(You can't afford a house or rent.
You're sponging off a girl.)

657
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,424
(We won't let you
take advantage of her.)

658
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,832
Does Guan Xingxin know about this?

659
00:38:37,062 --> 00:38:37,582
She doesn't.

660
00:38:38,343 --> 00:38:39,343
Don't tell her about it.

661
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:41,903
She's not willing
to let me see her parents.

662
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:42,743
It's pointless

663
00:38:42,982 --> 00:38:43,823
to tell her about it.

664
00:38:45,368 --> 00:38:46,580
Let me delete the conversation.

665
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:48,423
You don't need to do that.

666
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:52,102
It's not like
my mental strength is that weak.

667
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:55,062
Her parents aren't the only kind
of parents in the world.

668
00:38:55,343 --> 00:38:56,182
Her parents

669
00:38:56,223 --> 00:38:58,263
shouldn't be the standard you use
to measure yourself.

670
00:38:58,263 --> 00:38:59,863
I know that.

671
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:02,383
I just didn't expect

672
00:39:03,582 --> 00:39:05,062
parents who looked

673
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,743
as well-educated as them

674
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:08,102
could be this mean

675
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:09,462
behind people's backs.

676
00:39:14,423 --> 00:39:15,142
Mr. Yu,

677
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:17,943
you've been together with Guan Xingxin
for a long time.

678
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:19,944
You spent time with her every day.

679
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:23,703
Have you noticed if she has
any bitter reasons behind her actions?

680
00:39:26,462 --> 00:39:27,142
No, I haven't.

681
00:39:27,622 --> 00:39:28,462
What do you mean?

682
00:39:30,823 --> 00:39:31,823
You see,

683
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,102
is it possible

684
00:39:34,462 --> 00:39:36,343
that the parents you saw

685
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:38,182
weren't the ones

686
00:39:38,383 --> 00:39:39,542
who sent this text to you?

687
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:43,062
If so...

688
00:39:43,462 --> 00:39:44,622
If so, who else can it be?

689
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,582
My information is limited as well.

690
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:50,502
I can only tell you

691
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,223
that she has anxious attachment issues.

692
00:39:52,502 --> 00:39:54,022
And, she visited a psychiatrist before.

693
00:39:55,022 --> 00:39:55,863
Therefore, her world

694
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:57,423
might be more complicated
than you think.

695
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,179
But if you have any questions,

696
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,232
you should ask her about it.

697
00:40:00,582 --> 00:40:02,142
Couples shouldn't
hide things from each other.

698
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:12,823
Ms. Gu,

699
00:40:15,022 --> 00:40:16,383
do you think

700
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,903
that it's better for us to break up?

701
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:22,943
Cut the crap.

702
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:25,160
You should cherish your time with her
while you two are together.

703
00:40:26,462 --> 00:40:27,182
And,

704
00:40:27,982 --> 00:40:29,223
she cannot find another person

705
00:40:29,223 --> 00:40:30,743
who can make her as happy as you.

706
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:53,998
(Guan Xingxin,)

707
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,520
(I think you should
check on Mr. Yu lately.)

708
00:41:21,743 --> 00:41:22,343
Don't send that.

709
00:41:22,984 --> 00:41:24,300
You've been sighing the entire trip.

710
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,288
Even so, you didn't send it.

711
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:27,863
I have to give her a hint somehow.

712
00:41:28,502 --> 00:41:29,582
If not, what will happen to them?

713
00:41:30,142 --> 00:41:30,783
There's no choice.

714
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:33,100
Guan Xingxin shouldn't have hidden

715
00:41:33,102 --> 00:41:34,743
the fact that she had four parents.

716
00:41:35,982 --> 00:41:37,539
Yu Dule already bumped into
her foster parents,

717
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,824
yet she still didn't
come clean with him.

718
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,120
Her running away from home
was just adding fuel to the flame.

719
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:44,102
Their ending is there
for everyone to see.

720
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:46,343
It's just a matter of time.

721
00:41:57,102 --> 00:41:57,783
If so,

722
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,383
why don't I have a chat
with Guan Xingxin?

723
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:03,502
Forget about it.

724
00:42:04,142 --> 00:42:06,062
She's already trying to drag it out.

725
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:07,943
If you chat with her,
you'll end it immediately.

726
00:42:15,343 --> 00:42:15,823
By the way,

727
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:17,703
I need your opinion on something.

728
00:42:18,223 --> 00:42:18,943
What is it?

729
00:42:22,703 --> 00:42:24,502
Li Ai's online program
will be launched soon.

730
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:26,943
However, we're facing difficulties
with the cash flow.

731
00:42:27,903 --> 00:42:28,743
I have a job,

732
00:42:29,528 --> 00:42:31,384
but I don't know
whether I should take it or not.

733
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,823
What job is it? Why are you hesitating?

734
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,142
Zhang Qingya took over Ounce.

735
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:39,980
She wants me to redesign the place.

736
00:42:41,816 --> 00:42:42,740
You should take the job.

737
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,816
Why aren't you taking it?

738
00:42:43,816 --> 00:42:44,792
There's money to be made.

739
00:42:47,863 --> 00:42:48,542
Don't you mind it?

740
