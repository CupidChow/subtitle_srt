26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,221
Gu Yi,

27
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:54,820
that ride is not crowded. Let's go.

28
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:56,901
You guys go ahead.
I want to take a break.

29
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:57,820
Okay, then.

30
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,740
Liang, come on.

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,740
Do you want me to accompany you?

32
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:06,439
It's okay. You don't always
get the chance to come here.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,959
Go and have fun with them.

34
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,639
Your legs feel weak?

35
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,741
I'll sit and wait for you guys here.

36
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:22,260
I did tell you to go.
But you actually went?

37
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:25,781
He's more obedient
than when he was sleepwalking.

38
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:57,660
Just throw up.

39
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,940
I don't feel like throwing up anymore.

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,581
Then

41
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,621
how about we go for a walk?

42
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,581
For you.

43
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:04,100
Legend has it that in ancient times,

44
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:05,741
there was a hero named Armiscius

45
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,621
who suffered from an eye disease.

46
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:09,100
One night,

47
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,461
the god of war appeared
in his dream and told him

48
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:14,420
that a small blue flower
by the roadside at dawn

49
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,100
could heal his eyes.

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,060
So the next day,

51
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,021
he found a cornflower
and placed it on his eyes.

52
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,540
Soon, they were completely healed.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,420
Later, people began to call it...

54
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:36,461
Later, people began
to call the cornflower as...

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,920
I didn't know stand-up comedians
would forget their lines.

56
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,439
No, I have them all memorized.

57
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,920
That big fool Gu Yi scared me half
to death with her yelling,

58
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:48,941
which made me forget my lines.

59
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:55,941
Later, the cornflower became known
as the "Guardian of the Eyes."

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,381
Yeah, that's right.

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,901
That sounds a little cheesy.

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,821
No, it doesn't.

63
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,300
When I was blind,

64
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,300
my mom used to tell me

65
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:09,941
that the ocean
and sky were vast and blue.

66
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,500
I couldn't even imagine it.

67
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:14,381
Later, when I could see,

68
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:18,261
I realized many things had turned
my assumptions upside down.

69
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:21,021
There's no such thing as a black ocean.

70
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,740
Do you know
what the cornflower symbolizes?

71
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:35,261
It symbolizes an encounter.

72
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:42,280
They hope to meet people

73
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:43,581

74
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,180

75
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:48,740

to light any open flames
in the house anymore.

185
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:54,621
I'll tell her. Thanks.

186
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,661
If you're lighting incense next time,

187
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,221
remember to use a smaller candle.

188
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:14,701
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

189
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:16,820
I just wanted

190
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:19,580
to set up a candlelit dinner.

191
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,661
If you had meant it,

192
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:25,060
it'd be considered malicious arson.

193
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:33,861
Wash up and change into dry clothes.

194
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:27,359
(Live ordinary life, Have Feelings)

195
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,660
(Love, Gu Yi)

196
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,701
I'm sorry.

197
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,861
I'll have the cleaner come over
tomorrow to clean up.

198
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:24,621
I'll pay for the damages.

199
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,340
You don't need to pay.

200
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,540
The property management said not
to light any open flames in the house anymore.

201
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:34,101
Yes, I heard.

202
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:37,820
He also said

203
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,701
I'm your girlfriend.

204
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:42,820
He just got it wrong.

205
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:51,221
I've had two girlfriends.

206
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,260
The first one thought I was boring.

207
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:54,901
So we broke up after a year.

208
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,980
The second one lasted a year and a half.

209
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,120
But she gave up
because she couldn't feel

210
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:03,060
that I liked her.

211
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,060
I didn't try to make her stay

212
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,461
because I couldn't think
of any reason to.

213
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:11,020
To be honest,

214
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:13,540
seeing them made me feel bad.

215
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:16,820
Bad?

216
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:21,020
Do you mean

217
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,740
heartbroken?

218
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,540
They asked what made me feel bad.

219
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,621
But I couldn't describe it.

220
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,759
I just felt uncomfortable

221
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,901
when I saw her.

222
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,980
After breaking up,

223
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,621
I realized the girls I date

224
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:43,500
all end up unhappy.

225
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:53,020
Don't say that.

226
00:21:53,361 --> 00:21:54,360
Many female audiences in Ounce

227
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:56,661
are asking for your contact info.

228
00:21:57,561 --> 00:21:59,060
You didn't grab that opportunity.

229
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:04,060
The only girl from Ounce
whose contact I keep

230
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,421
is you.

231
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:15,840
Then

232
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:19,421
why did you only save my contact number?

233
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,500
Liang Daiwen.

234
00:22:33,321 --> 00:22:35,300
By offering to take me in,

235
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:38,740
doesn't that mean

236
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:42,020
I'm a little different

237
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,461
from the others?

238
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:50,141
Do you mean

239
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:52,500
I'm interested in you?

240
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,060
Well,

241
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:03,580
I mean different feelings in some way.

242
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,980
Not at all.

243
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,740
You're an adult, not a stray cat.

244
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:14,861
I took you in with no other intentions.

245
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,820
I hope you don't misunderstand.

246
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:30,640
You don't have to worry.

247
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:32,540
I'll find a place as soon as possible.

248
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,260
If you see me in trouble in the future,
just stay away.

249
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,540
Or else I'll think
you're interested in me.

250
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:11,680
(Memo: Insomnia, terrifying nightmares,
sleepwalking at night,)

251
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,440
(intense headache, hand pain,
numbness in all limbs,)

252
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,923
(sleepless again tonight, sleepwalking.)

253
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:05,740
I'm leaving, Yi.

254
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,719
Okay, bye.

255
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,580
Bye-bye.

256
00:25:15,623 --> 00:25:19,662
(Guan Xingxin: You mentioned wanting
to see Dr. Shen before. He's available tonight.)

257
00:25:19,663 --> 00:25:22,763
(Gu Yi: Okay, thanks.)

258
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:35,621
Your caretaker is here to feed you.

259
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:41,060
Okay, let's go and eat.

260
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,719
About that guy in black clothes
at the police station that day,

261
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,740
he's Liang Daiwen, right?

262
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,780
Do you like him?

263
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,941
Thanks.

264
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:17,980
I didn't really go through
the magazine article about him.

265
00:26:18,121 --> 00:26:19,060
What does he do for a living?

266
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,701
He's in accessible design.

267
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:27,941
He designs for people with disabilities.

268
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,701
Both for mobile applications
and physical spaces.

269
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,060
Accessibility design?

270
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:34,740
That's quite innovative.

271
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:37,980
Does he like you?

272
00:26:41,881 --> 00:26:42,701
I'm okay.

273
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,941
I'm a bit direct.

274
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,020
He's not very good

275
00:26:54,921 --> 00:26:56,661
at expressing his feelings.

276
00:26:58,321 --> 00:26:59,500
Actually,

277
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,260
it doesn't matter
if a guy can express his feelings.

278
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,221
If he likes you, he'll take the initiative
to come and find you.

279
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:24,800
Guan told me

280
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:26,661
you wanted to know
about emotional dysregulation.

281
00:27:27,561 --> 00:27:29,820
I'm not trying to pry
into anyone's private matters.

282
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:31,740
I am only

283
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:33,780
curious.

284
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,300
Are you more curious
about emotional dysregulation

285
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,020
or about Liang Daiwen?

286
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,360
I've reminded her

287
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:42,901
that Liang Daiwen is someone
who's been "sentenced to death" by love.

288
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,880
To say that sounds

289
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:46,901
a bit too extreme.

290
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:48,400
Objectively speaking,

291
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:51,181
he's someone who just can't seem
to connect emotionally in close relationships.

292
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:54,820
Let me explain
what emotional dysregulation is first.

293
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:57,120
It's also known

294
00:27:57,121 --> 00:28:00,020
as emotional expression difficulty,
or emotional speechlessness.

295
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,101
It's not really a mental disorder
on its own.

296
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,260
It's more like a personality trait.

297
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,039
It can also be...

298
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,520
It can also be
a psychological characteristic

299
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,861
commonly associated with some physical
or mental health issues

300
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:11,740
or even a symptom of them.

301
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,421
I did some research.

302
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:20,221
See? She really likes Liang Daiwen.

303
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:28,780
Even though it's called a disorder,

304
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,120
it's not listed

305
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:31,400
in the DSM-5

306
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:33,260
as a mental illness.

307
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,381
It's more of a personality trait.

308
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:37,239
Since it was first named in 1972

309
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,861
by Sifneos,

310
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,141
there's been reliable research showing

311
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:44,060
that patients have no issues
in perceiving or sensing things.

312
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,800
They're able
to receive external signals,

313
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:49,621
and they can still feel things,
and experience emotions.

314
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,980
The problem

315
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:54,800
is their brain

316
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:57,221
doesn't recognize these emotions,

317
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,020
let alone process or understand them.

318
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,300
Simply put,

319
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,701
emotions can't "enter" their minds.

320
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,421
You're not giving a medical report here.
Can you summarize that in simpler terms?

321
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:12,221
Sure.

322
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:15,300
Basically, the person's brain is a void.

323
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:17,999
They have limited imagination,

324
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,840
have trouble distinguishing
between different feelings,

325
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,861
and they're not really aware
of emotions.

326
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,679
It's actually more common

327
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,719
than you might think.

328
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,901
It varies in severity.

329
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,560
Some people can live
their lives normally

330
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,221
without realizing they suffer from it.

331
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:33,260
Some even manage
to build relationships or families.

332
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:39,020
Are they born with it?

333
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,181
Some people are born with it.

334
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:46,421
But for others, it's due to trauma,

335
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,080
chronic pain,

336
00:29:48,081 --> 00:29:50,540
mental health issues,
or even things like internet addiction.

337
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:53,101
No matter the cause,

338
00:29:53,161 --> 00:29:54,880
most patients have gone through

339
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,920
a devastating experience

340
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:58,820
that destroyed part
of their body or soul.

341
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:01,800
This experience threatens

342
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,340
their sense of identity and security.

343
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,540
So they shut themselves off emotionally.

344
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320
In other words,

345
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:12,060
the patient has experienced
overwhelming emotions.

346
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:14,621
So they unconsciously push

347
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,861
their emotions away.

348
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,861
So, what did Liang Daiwen go through

349
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:27,101
that made him shut off his ability
to express his emotions?

350
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,260
I'm sorry.

351
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,759
This is his privacy.

352
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,141
I'm not in a position
to share it with you.

353
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,381
Let me put it this way.

354
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,941
Imagine this is Liang Daiwen.

355
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:46,141
He's physically fine.

356
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:48,340
But his mind is like an empty vessel.

357
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:53,580
Right now, we need to fill that vessel

358
00:30:53,641 --> 00:30:55,780
by connecting with the outside world.

359
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:58,320
I suggested he do things

360
00:30:58,321 --> 00:31:00,780
that involve emotional engagement,

361
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,901
We fill what's missing
with what's needed.

362
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,421
For instance, watching dramas.

363
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:11,421
Or even watching a talk show.

364
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:15,221
Watching stand-up comedy was also
one of my suggestions for him.

365
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:17,300
Awareness is the first step in practice.

366
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:20,701
So that's why he came to Ounce

367
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,141
and offered me a place to stay.

368
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:25,800
Is that also a part of the practice?

369
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,861
No, Miss Gu.

370
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,580
I don't think he did it
with that in mind.

371
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,640
Liang Daiwen

372
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:32,340
doesn't make friends easily.

373
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,941
But when he does,

374
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,679
he's incredibly generous with them,

375
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,759
almost like a giver by nature.

376
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,540
Don't you agree, Guan?

377
00:31:39,081 --> 00:31:41,780
That's right.
Gu Yi, you must not overthink this.

378
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:49,060
But I don't want to just be his friend.

379
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,181
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

380
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,461
Thank you, Dr. Shen.
Sorry for taking up your time.

381
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,820
- Don't worry about it.
- We'll get going now.

382
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:10,160
Bye-bye.

383
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,020
Okay, bye-bye.

384
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,440
You've heard everything, right?

385
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,861
I told you before.

386
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,060
If you're not ready for a relationship,

387
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,980
don't lead anyone on.

388
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:55,060
I'll ask Guan Xingxin

389
00:32:57,161 --> 00:32:58,780
if she's open to Gu Yi staying with her.

390
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:41,661
Can I help you?

391
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:44,701
Guan Xingxin

392
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,621
was considering a roommate

393
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:49,621
for safety.

394
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,300
Someone to help with packages and trash.

395
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,060
You two know each other
and she's also a girl.

396
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,540
Are you saying you want me to move out?

397
00:34:06,161 --> 00:34:07,820
If you're willing to be her friend,

398
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,141
she can be a good roommate.

399
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,061
I will leave.

400
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,860
I won't keep staying here.

401
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,740
Even if you want to help Guan Xingxin,

402
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,740
I understand.

403
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:27,039
This was never

404
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,300
my place anyway.

405
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,021
I don't mean to make you move.

406
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,501
Even if you left,

407
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:41,940
she wouldn't move in.

408
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,340
I just think

409
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:46,661
you might feel

410
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:50,021
more comfortable staying with her.

411
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,621
Liang Daiwen,

412
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:58,740
sometimes I envy you.

413
00:35:00,761 --> 00:35:02,159
There are benefits

414
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,501
to being emotionally detached.

415
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,061
At least you don't feel pain

416
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,701
from other people's emotions.

417
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,300
I do.

418
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,581
Mine

419
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,181
and others.

420
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:35,221
I feel pain
because I don't feel anything.

421
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,860

I left it on the table.

453
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,661
Also,

454
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,061
I have a performance at Ounce tonight.

455
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,021
If you're free,

456
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,501
you can come and watch me.

457
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,300
What's the matter?

458
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,740
Another setback?

459
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,860
I think he knows that I like him.

460
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:30,181
He has been avoiding me lately.

461
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:32,780
Didn't I tell you this before?

462
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,981
As long as you don't want him to know,

463
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,460
he will never know.

464
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,740
He's tactful in this matter.

465
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,141
But he will run away.

466
00:42:43,921 --> 00:42:45,981
Many girls liked him before.

467
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:49,221
But as soon as they show signs
of confessing,

468
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:50,541
he will immediately reject them.

469
00:42:51,241 --> 00:42:53,141
Later, he would stop adding contacts.

470
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,940
You're staying at his place now.

471
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,581
That's the biggest difference.

472
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,061
I can't stay for long.

473
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:04,420
He's been hinting at me to move out.

474
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,240
Gu Yi, the most important thing
for you to do

475
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:10,900
isn't figure out
whether Liang Daiwen likes you or not.

476
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,860
That's beyond his capacity right now.

477
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:14,900
What you need to focus on

478
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,300
is making sure he doesn't back out.

479
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:22,420
People who don't get love
will still be boring, even if they're attractive.

480
00:43:24,721 --> 00:43:26,900
Even if he suffers
from emotional dysregulation,

481
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:28,900
he's still a guy, right?

482
00:43:30,281 --> 00:43:31,581
When it comes to guys,

483
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:35,021
you should handle things their way.

484
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,860
How?

485
00:43:45,281 --> 00:43:47,300
When Mr. Liang

486
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:48,701
has some drinks,

487
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:51,221
he will change.

488
00:44:27,241 --> 00:44:29,221
I thought you were not coming.

489
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:31,581
I just didn't answer you.

490
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:33,260
I never said I'm not coming.

491
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,661
You're too high up.

492
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,141
My neck hurts.

493
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,380
Sit down.

494
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,151
Have you considered
my suggestion of moving out?

495
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:08,021
Do you really want me to move out?

496
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:14,541
I just think it would be more convenient

497
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,701
for two girls to stay together.

498
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:25,860
Liang Daiwen,

499
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,061
you don't have emotions,
but other people do.

500
00:45:29,721 --> 00:45:31,581
Can't you talk properly?

501
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,320
You could just say

502
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:35,039
living with me makes

503
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,860
you uncomfortable.

504
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,039
You don't need to use

505
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,940
all those lame excuses like yesterday.

506
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:43,181
When you do that,

507
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:44,860
it feels like you're kicking me out.

508
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:50,940
I'm not making excuses.

509
00:45:53,201 --> 00:45:54,101
Really?

510
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:58,501
Well then, I'll just move in
with Guan Xingxin.

511
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,981
If she agrees, I'll move out.

512
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:06,181
I'm going to move out for real.

513
00:46:13,361 --> 00:46:16,820
See? You just can't talk properly.

514
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,221
Haven't you heard of the saying,

515
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:23,380
"To deny and avoid dealing
with problems?"

516
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,780
You're not even a doctor.

517
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:31,581
Well, I know how to tell jokes.

518
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:33,501
How about it?

519
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,599
Do you want me

520
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,940
to treat your emotional dysregulation?

521
00:46:37,401 --> 00:46:39,380
I may not have a medical license.

522
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,860
But I'm funny.

523
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,141
You're missing out

524
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,820
if you let someone like me go.

525
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,940
You're being quiet again.

526
00:46:57,321 --> 00:46:59,400
If you're not saying anything,
I'll just assume you agree.

527
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:02,981
Please pay the treatment fee.

528
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,900
How much?

529
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,380
You let me stay another month.

530
00:47:20,241 --> 00:47:22,120
The treatment fee will be used
to cover the rent.

531
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,740
Okay.

532
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,380
It's a deal, then.

533
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,840
Now,

534
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:39,860
I'm going to ask you the first question.

535
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,420
How do you feel about the world?

536
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:49,701
I don't know.

537
00:47:52,881 --> 00:47:54,581
Then how do you feel about me?

538
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:05,661
I don't know.

539
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,300
Do you not know

540
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:12,101
or have no feelings at all?

541
00:48:16,841 --> 00:48:17,701
You're drunk.

542
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:19,221
Let's go home.

543
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:21,820
Liang Daiwen,

544
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,119
if you have no feelings

545
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,300
for the world or me,

546
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:29,380
