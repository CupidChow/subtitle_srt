25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,680
Zhi,

26
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:53,660
what's the content you deleted

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,980
from Art List's latest entry?

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,100
Yi,

29
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:57,579
it's an issue on the commercial side.

30
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,380
We need to wait for the ad and product
launch before pushing it out.

31
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,299
Next time before you push it out,

32
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,859
let the operations department review it.

33
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,299
Deleting and resending
is not a good look.

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,739
Got it.

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,160
(Director's Office - Jacqueline)

36
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,220
You're back.

37
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,619
Ms. Zhang,

38
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,380
I was in a bad mood last time.

39
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,380
I took leave without notice.

40
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,299
I'm sorry for disrupting work.

41
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,660
It's okay.

42
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,540
Guan Xingxin explained it to me.

43
00:03:17,288 --> 00:03:18,060
I'm glad you're back.

44
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:21,380
Take a look.

45
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,459
Art List's offline data.

46
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,340
Sales aren't great.

47
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,100
Selling a magazine at 30 yuan each,

48
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,579
recalling them all

49
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,619
is still a smaller loss
than a full launch.

50
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,380
You were in charge of the redesign.

51
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,299
Now that you're back,

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
think about what to do next.

53
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,859
Abandon print and pivot to an app.

54
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:45,459
Abandon print?

55
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:46,808
Stop the offline publication?

56
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,299
Art List never had substantial
business assets.

57
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,619
Relying solely on content
can't drive sales.

58
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,500
Our audience is mainly

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,540
working professionals aged 20 to 40.

60
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,689
They buy e-readers

61
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,776
just to use as cup noodle covers.

62
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,100
This group won't think of

63
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,540
spending money on print magazines.

64
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,940
But our public account numbers

65
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,859
have been steadily rising.

66
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,859
This shows the content isn't the issue.

67
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,699
So I think

68
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:11,940
abandoning print
and switching to an app,

69
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,100
developing a paid knowledge section,

70
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,940
and forming partnerships

71
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,340
to enter a new field
is the best path forward.

72
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,980
If Roger agrees,

73
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:24,220
Art List's online figures must double.

74
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,850
Do you have the confidence to do it?

75
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,660
Give me time.

76
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:29,340
I can try.

77
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,299
Two months.

78
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,660
Double the online profits,

79
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,700
then I'll talk to Roger.

80
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,140
Deal.

81
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,419
By the way,

82
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,299
about what happened that day,

83
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,419
I think you should apologize to Penny.

84
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:43,780
After all,

85
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:45,140
she's your superior.

86
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:49,700
Understood.

87
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:52,939
Gu Yi.

88
00:04:58,059 --> 00:04:58,939
Take care of yourself

89
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:01,730
and try to put your mom at ease.

90
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:10,540
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

91
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,140
Thank you.

92
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,900
I asked Guan Xingxin for your address.

93
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,580
I came to talk to you.

94
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:57,660
Go ahead.

95
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:58,340
What's up?

96
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,328
I've been busy with another
project lately.

97
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:05,170
I just found out
about Gu Yi's situation.

98
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:07,859
How is she?

99
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:10,173
She's much better now.

100
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:11,819
She went back to work today.

101
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,140
So when you asked me
how to care for Gu Yi,

102
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,140
it was because of her mom?

103
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,460
Well, you're her boyfriend now.

104
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,819
This may sound weird

105
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,020
coming out of me,

106
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,059
but thank you.

107
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,020
Thank you for staying by Gu Yi's side
all this while.

108
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:45,819
To be honest,

109
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:48,024
I was a bit biased against you.

110
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,700
I always thought,

111
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,100
how could a robot take care of Gu Yi?

112
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,819
And for some reason,

113
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,299
Gu Yi insisted on dating a robot.

114
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,780
But now I understand.

115
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:01,220
I respect her decision,

116
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:03,499
and I'm okay with it.

117
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:08,499
The way you talk,

118
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,859
you sound like my parents.

119
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,419
Liang Daiwen, you've really evolved.

120
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,379
You've even learned to banter now.

121
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,140
Is your alexithymia

122
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,020
due to a family member's death?

123
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:38,140
My mom passed away

124
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,939
when I was a child.

125
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,660
Although

126
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,299
I don't contact my parents often,

127
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,700
and their presence in my life
is very minimal,

128
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,259
I can't imagine

129
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,580
losing them one day.

130
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:02,220
You had to face this
at such a young age.

131
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:03,540
I think that's really tough.

132
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,939
I can understand your pain.

133
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,340
But

134
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,460
I won't let Gu Yi suffer with you.

135
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,739
Rest assured.

136
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,160
As long as I'm here,

137
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:18,660
that won't happen.

138
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:20,859
Good.

139
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:23,340
I'll take your word for it.

140
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,220
To be honest,

141
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,179
when you kept asking me
how to care for Gu Yi,

142
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:30,540
I couldn't be bothered to respond.

143
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,259
But now, we can speak freely.

144
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:39,460
Liang Daiwen, don't overthink it.

145
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,779
She wants to be loved

146
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,739
the same way she loves you.

147
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,220
You said

148
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,220
we should be friends.

149
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,779
Did you mean it?

150
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,539
What kind of cup is this?

151
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,640
You can't even drink coffee with it.

152
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:22,340
Look at it.

153
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:32,060
Guan Xingxin,

154
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,940
open the door.

155
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,499
Guan Xingxin!

156
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:37,509
(Comments: She's so different...
Which one is the real her?)

157
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,580
(Comments: Once a third wheel,
always a third wheel.)

158
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,220
Do you think hiding in the bathroom

159
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,912
will solve everything?

160
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,619
When will you finally act like an adult?

161
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:48,940
Your eyes were donated
by your adoptive parents.

162
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,464
The hotel video was staged
by Zhang Junjie.

163
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:53,780
(Ruining someone's marriage is immoral.)
Your gigs were arranged by me.

164
00:09:53,784 --> 00:09:54,850
(Not really a homewrecker.)
What have you done?

165
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:56,552
(Who believes that?)
What have you accomplished?

166
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,340
Where's your attitude now?

167
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,340
All this drama over a breakup?

168
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,859
A breakup is nothing.

169
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,220
(And to think I once thought
of her as a victim.)

170
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,798
Now the netizens outside
are in an uproar over you.

171
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,232
(Maybe she was deceived.)
Here you are, wasting away over a man.

172
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,856
(Please don't ruin any more lives.)
Everyone's outside waiting for you!

173
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,739
Guan Xingxin.

174
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:14,580
Guan Xingxin.

175
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,139
Enough.

176
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:16,340
Huang Wenda.

177
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,300
That's enough.

178
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,340
Guan Xingxin,

179
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,180
listen to me carefully.

180
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,259
If you can't handle
this kind of turmoil,

181
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,460
then you'd better quit now.

182
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,180
Forget about everything I said.

183
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,139
I'm back.

184
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,100
What a mess. What are you looking for?

185
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,259
The career guide Jacqueline gave me.

186
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:37,340
I've been looking everywhere
but can't find it.

187
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,340
Next time, just ask me

188
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:43,220
instead of turning the house
upside down

189
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,220
and making a mess.

190
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:58,619
That is

191
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:00,379
a birthday gift from Xu Guanrui.

192
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,591
(Live life boldly. Even in old age,
stay youthful at heart.)

193
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,499
We've known each other for so long.

194
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,779
It seems I've never given you anything.

195
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:23,779
That's not true.

196
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,019
You and Mom

197
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:29,379
have given me my life's most
precious gifts.

198
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,899
You gave me the determination
to love someone

199
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,739
and the patience
to nurture a relationship.

200
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,739
My mom gave me

201
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:44,259
the self-respect and resilience
to stand on my own.

202
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,019
Now I lack nothing.

203
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,659
Now that you mention it,

204
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,019
you've given me a lot too.

205
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:55,060
Like what?

206
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:56,379
For example,

207
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,100
you've given me a lot of motivation.

208
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,539
You turned me from a robot

209
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,019
into a real person.

210
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,980
You even called
ten-year-old Liang Daiwen

211
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,779
and walked him out
of the hospital corridor.

212
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,060
You've also given me many chances.

213
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:17,220
You taught me

214
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:18,940
how to love you.

215
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,539
Liang Daiwen,

216
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,980
be honest,

217
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:37,100
when did you fall in love with me?

218
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,820
I can't really say.

219
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,259
But the first time I saw you,

220
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:52,779
when you were performing stand-up,

221
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,700
I had a strange feeling.

222
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,300
I felt like my life was
about to be ruined.

223
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:02,980
Ruined?

224
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,779
What do you mean by "ruined"?

225
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,820
Cut it out.

226
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,619
Like how I'm ruining you right now.

227
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,539
Fine, I'm sorry.

228
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:17,700
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,259
Ruined yet?

230
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:18,820
Yes.

231
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,970
Do you know what "ruined" means now?

232
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:21,060
Yes, I know what it means.

233
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,739
Now you know?

234
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:22,779
Yes.

235
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,659

What decent man would
call himself "Sexy," right?

293
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,499
Right, "Sexy" is his stage name.

I entered the raffle.

301
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,539
We didn't get chosen to perform today.

302
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,259
Besides, there will be
lots of new talent.

303
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:04,296
If I'd known you weren't performing,
I wouldn't have gotten tickets.

00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:06,620

Hello, everyone.

311
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:31,860
I'm Yu Dule.

312
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,059
Today,

313
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,380
Ounce is reopening.

314
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,259
I'm very happy.

315
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,779
I used to be the honorary manager here.

316
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:39,019
You could say

317
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,019
I

318
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,460
deserve credit

319
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,339
for Ounce's

320
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,900
reopening.

321
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:48,220
If it weren't for me

322
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:49,608
running it into the ground before,

323
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:51,140
it wouldn't have reopened today.

324
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,620
I see today's audience is all locals.

325
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:58,339
Back then, we also had foreigners.

326
00:17:58,504 --> 00:17:59,640
They didn't understand a word,

327
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,920
but they were very cooperative.

328
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,480
The Chinese audience next to them
was very enthusiastic too.

329
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:04,460
After laughing themselves,

330
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:05,579
they would remind them,

331
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:06,660
“Laugh!”

332
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,099
That time,

333
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,900
the foreigners laughed so happily.

334
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:16,620
So I concluded,

335
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,739
that to make

336
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,019
the live atmosphere better,

337
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:19,940
reminding people

338
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,460
is absolutely necessary.

339
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:23,259
Now,

340
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,220
you may applaud.

341
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:30,660
I once

342
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:32,700
worked as a rideshare driver.

343
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,739
I failed on my first attempt.

344
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,299
I got stopped by the police.

345
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,900
He told me,

346
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,299
“Electric bikes

347
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:41,380
can't carry passengers.”

348
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,259
Mr. Huang.

349
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:42,739
I said,

350
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:44,136
“This is a rideshare vehicle!”

351
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:45,128
What brings you here?

352
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,140
He said, “How is an electric bike
a rideshare vehicle?”

353
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,180
Zhang Qingya said

354
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:49,819
stand-up comedy is trending lately.

355
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:52,312
She asked me to come see
if it's worth investing in.

356
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:53,860
I guess

357
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,940
she's not catching any fish in her pond.

358
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:58,579
She must've hit a wall
with that boyfriend of yours

359
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,380
and is looking for someone to help.

360
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:09,180
No wonder Zhang Junjie didn't want you
to have a side gig.

361
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,620
Investing in this?

362
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,180
I might as well do charity instead.

363
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,019
This is false prosperity.

364
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,579
But your friend is kind of interesting.

365
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:23,660
Yu Dule, right?

366
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,380
He's Guan Xingxin's boyfriend.

367
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:29,380
He's a very skilled editor.

368
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,539
Ex-boyfriend, maybe?

369
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,420
Mr. Huang, could you mind your words?

370
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:36,460
They're doing just fine.

371
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:38,900
They don't need an outsider
worrying about them.

372
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,220
Is he your friend or mine?

373
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:42,980
Looks like you don't know yet.

374
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,289
If you don't believe me,
go ask him yourself,

375
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,192
then you'll see how their
relationship is doing.

376
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:48,900
What do you mean?

377
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,819
What else could I mean?

378
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:52,940
Being young is great.

379
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,579
When you're young,

380
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,700
you can act impulsively for love.

381
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:58,460
At my age,

382
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:00,632
I don't even get the chance
to behave irrationally.

383
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:05,380
But, to be honest, if I were
a few years younger,

384
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,220
I might have pursued Guan Xingxin too,

385
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:09,464
regardless of whether she had
a boyfriend or not.

386
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,380
Ms. Zhang and Guan Xingxin were right.

387
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,539
You really are quite annoying.

388
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,579
I spent a long time
explaining it to her.

389
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,059
Duo, bring me a beer.

390
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:37,499
If I go back,

391
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,660
I'll have to drive
for an extra ten minutes.

392
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,620
Excuse me.

393
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,779
Are you Gu Yi?

394
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,620
I am

395
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,339
a comedy agent from Worry Free,

396
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,099
Liu Ran.

397
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,579
Here's my card.

398
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,440
(Liu Ran, Agent)

399
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,900
Can we talk for a moment?

400
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,480
(Worry Free Comedy Club)

401
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,334
(Talent Agency Contract)

402
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,940
He's really something, isn't he?

403
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:07,779
Poaching my talent

404
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:08,980
while I'm busy performing onstage.

405
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:09,700
Is he crazy?

406
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:11,299
I'll reject him outright

407
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,539
and avenge you.

408
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,059
No thanks.

409
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:15,810
There's no need to be impulsive.

410
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,019
I'm just worried

411
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,380
that this isn't a legitimate company.

412
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:22,700
I looked up

413
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,460
their official Weibo account.

414
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:26,339
They have over

415
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:27,299
2 million followers.

416
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:28,539
But

417
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,848
it's mainly reposts and comments.

418
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,320
There's barely any original content.

419
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:32,579
Look at this.

420
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:34,739
This company

421
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,660
was only registered last year.

422
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,099
And judging by its registered capital,

423
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,860
it doesn't seem like

424
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,019
it has strong backing.

425
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,700
So I think,

426
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,860
most likely,

427
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,339
they're just hopping on

428
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,490
the stand-up comedy trend.

429
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:52,499
Do they know

430
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:53,700
about Fuzzy?

431
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:55,739
They do. I told them.

432
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,579
They said it's not a big issue.

433
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,299
They're obligated

434
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:00,539
to protect their stand-up comedians.

435
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:02,860
So they said they'd take some
marketing measures.

436
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,620
Their words make sense.

437
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,099
But whether they can deliver,

438
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,339
that's another story.

439
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,579
I think they seem pretty genuine.

440
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:12,900
Even though it's a new company,

441
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,339
they want to develop their own

442
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,380
stand-up comedians.

443
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:17,180
And if they generate good traffic,

444
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:18,460
they'll even send them on TV shows.

445
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,739
It's not that I'm eager to be famous.

446
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:23,019
It's just

447
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,059
that this might be my only chance

448
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,019
to keep doing stand-up comedy.

449
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,259
Look,

450
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,779
after leaving Ounce,

451
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,299
I have neither connections
nor a fan base.

452
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,380
I can't keep relying on you to get gigs.

453
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:38,380
This Liu Ran is something else.

454
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:41,819
Look at this.

455
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,660
Party A's obligations to Party B.

456
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,420
Just this one.

457
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,019
Provide at least four

458
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:47,579
commercial performance
opportunities a month.

459
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,832
But what about Party B's obligations
to Party A?

460
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:50,980
One,

461
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,059
two,

462
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:53,299
three pages.

463
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:54,900
It's like a mini-essay.

464
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:56,259
I asked them about it.

465
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,819
I said, why are

466
00:22:57,819 --> 00:22:59,299
the rights and obligations
so imbalanced?

467
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,299
They said it's just

468
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:02,819
their company's standard contract.

469
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,460
Apparently, all contracts are like that.

470
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,460
Right?

471
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,019
I...

472
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:14,936
This is also the first time
I've seen a contract like this.

473
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:18,539
But just from intuition,

474
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,019
these are all unfair clauses.

475
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,059
Think about it.

476
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,779
Recently,

477
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,380
stand-up comedy has been really popular.

478
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:31,739
There are so many professional comedians

479
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
waiting to gain exposure,
go on variety shows,

480
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,220
and boost their fame.

481
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:36,584
Isn't that right?

482
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,059
The editing room next door

483
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:39,460
was working on recordings

484
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,700
from a stand-up comedy audition.

485
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:41,860
I took a peek the other day.

486
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,099
My gosh, there were so many
amazing talents.

487
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,099
For amateurs like us,

488
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,620
there's really no chance.

489
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:50,819
My advice is,

490
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:52,059
don't get your hopes up.

491
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,259
But don't lose heart either.

492
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,099
Whether you can make money or not

493
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:02,739
is uncertain,

494
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:03,420
but at least

495
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,940
they're guaranteeing you

496
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:06,739
a chance to perform onstage, right?

497
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,980
After all these years
at Ounce and Fuzzy,

498
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:12,779
we didn't make any money,

499
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,220
but we still enjoyed performing,
didn't we?

500
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:16,299
True.

501
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,380
So,

502
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:19,900
think positively.

503
00:24:20,312 --> 00:24:21,480
No need to rush into signing.

504
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:23,259
Let's discuss it again
in a couple of days.

505
00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:24,180
Alright.

506
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:27,080
Let's go. I need to get back
to the editing room.

507
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:28,152
I'll drop you off on the way.

508
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:29,460
You're going to the editing room again?

509
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,059
Of course, there's a pile
of work waiting.

510
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,380
Wait.

511
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,099
How are things

512
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,339
between you

513
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,620
and Guan Xingxin?

514
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:45,620
Actually,

515
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:46,220
we broke up.

516
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:47,620
For real?

517
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,339
For real.

518
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,819
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

519
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:53,539
There's just so much

520
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:54,460
going on lately.

521
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:56,259
We both need time to adjust,

522
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,140
so

523
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,739
I thought I'd tell you later.

524
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:02,900
Let's go.

525
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,693
(She's decent at first glance,
but repetitive after a while.)

526
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:10,480
(She really has her own style though.)

527
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,440
(So refreshing, a true gem.)

528
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,600
(The princess's job is to
stay happy every day.)

529
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,560
(A girl of beauty and wisdom.)

530
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,492
(She's so warm, so gentle,
so lovely to look at.)

531
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:17,869
(She's amazing.
I love this kind of gorgeous woman.)

532
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,972
(Hands like jade, skin like cream,
neck like a swan, teeth like pearls.)

533
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:20,148
(A straight brow, a charming smile,
mesmerizing eyes.)

534
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:21,720
(The harder you work, the better
you become. You're the best.)

535
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,736
(Her unassuming cuteness is more
beautiful than the sunset.)

536
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:24,920
(I'm a girl, and even I adore her.)

537
00:25:24,952 --> 00:25:26,264
(Could she do a makeup tutorial
when she has time?)

538
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,512
(She's stunningly beautiful.)

539
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,512
(Her unassuming cuteness is more
beautiful than the sunset.)

540
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,560
(I adore her so much
and I truly admire her.)

541
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,768
(She's humble, polite, personable
and well-mannered.)

542
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,120
(She acts well, has good values,
and takes every role seriously.)

543
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:36,299
(She's still young, her future
is full of possibilities.)

544
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,672
(Stanning her is like an investment.)

545
00:25:37,672 --> 00:25:38,970
(It's my best investment. I feel rich!)

546
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,490
(Well done!)

547
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:40,612
(Forging her own path.)

548
00:25:40,612 --> 00:25:43,240
(Living a carefree and fulfilling life.)

549
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,329
(This week's highest-engagement article:
This Is You from the Past)

550
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,620
So?

551
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:52,819
How do you feel?

552
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:55,180
I don't have much to say.

553
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,180
I just used

554
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,099
the simplest, most straightforward way

555
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,059
to resonate emotionally
with the audience.

556
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:04,299
The backend is almost becoming
a wish zone for readers.

557
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,259
I didn't expect the family theme
to have this kind of impact.

558
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,380
Family is a topic

559
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,539
that always evokes
the most emotional impact.

560
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,579
It's expected.

561
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,059
It's definitely better than those

562
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:20,700
overdone topics like fashion, beauty,

563
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,099
or financial self-help.

564
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,660
You've truly found a unique angle.

565
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:27,700
It seems emotionally engaging content

566
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,299
is the way to maintain exposure.

567
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,140
Long-form comics

568
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,099
and interactive articles
are your strengths.

569
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:34,900
Keep digging deeper into those.

570
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,140
Understood.

571
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,832
I'll focus on creating quality content.

572
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,620
By the way,

573
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,900
you'll receive your annual bonus
by the end of the day.

574
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,860
I always keep my word.

575
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:44,339
Also,

576
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,099
please finish the long-form comic series

577
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:47,220
and send it to me.

578
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,010
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

579
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,099
I'll go work on it now.

580
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,779
If you have time, check on Guan Xingxin.

581
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,460
She hasn't been doing well
since breaking up with Yu Dule.

582
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,860
Huang Wenda

583
00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:59,180
is worried her show will flop.

584
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,712
He's been coming to my house every day.

585
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,739
If this keeps up,

586
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,768
I'll have no choice
but to kick Guan Xingxin out.

587
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,019
Gu Yi.

588
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:43,700
What brings you here? Have a seat.

589
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,579
Jacqueline told me

590
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:47,860
you haven't been doing well lately.

591
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:49,059
So I came to check on you.

592
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,499
I'm okay.

593
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:54,579
Work keeps me busy.

594
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,420
How's he doing?

595
00:27:58,819 --> 00:27:59,579
Mr. Yu?

596
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,700
Same as always.

597
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:03,460
He's holed up in the editing room
every day.

598
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,420
I don't really see him much.

599
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,420
Has your family agreed to let you
appear on variety shows?

600
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,080
It doesn't matter anymore.

601
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,019
I've already lost Yu Dule.

602
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:22,819
They can't control me anymore.

603
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,380
You must think

604
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,380
I deserve to lose him

605
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:30,819
because I did not resist my parents,

606
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:32,380
don't you?

607
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:39,299
Before this, you never
resisted either, right?

608
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,019
I tried to resist,

609
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:46,860
but it didn't work.

610
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,660
Mr. and Mrs. Chen were too invested.

611
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,140
My parents

612
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,528
wouldn't allow me to defy them.

613
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,779
Mrs. Chen has always loved me

614
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,900
in a very unhealthy way.

615
00:28:59,099 --> 00:28:59,860
It's suffocating,

616
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
but also pitiable.

617
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:04,380
She's always blamed herself

618
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,900
for her daughter's car accident.

619
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,620
Before she met me,

620
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:10,579
she had nightmares every single day.

621
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:13,099
Maybe

622
00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:14,739
her dedication to me

623
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,579
is her way of atoning
and finding relief.

624
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,499
To be honest,

625
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,660
I can understand their concerns.

626
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:29,860
But I can't understand

627
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,860
why you allowed them to hurt Yu Dule.

628
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:36,888
You didn't even tell him
about going on the variety show.

629
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,980
He's always been honest with you,

630
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,819
and he's always been worthy of you.

631
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,339
I thought,

632
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,819
if I could earn money on my own,

633
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,420
my parents would let go.

634
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,299
Then Yu Dule and I

635
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:55,660
would have no obstacles.

636
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:59,160
He wouldn't have to endure
my parents' attitudes,

637
00:29:59,224 --> 00:30:01,090
and I wouldn't be stuck between them.

638
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,099
At the end of the day,

639
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,539
you're just afraid of trouble.

640
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,180
But Mr. Yu has never run away
from anything.

641
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:20,059
In all the time I've known you,

642
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:21,980
this is the first time
I've seen you so upset.

643
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:25,819
I know how much you care about Mr. Yu,

644
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,660
but does it make any difference?

645
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,700
Gu Yi,

646
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:37,620
I think I made a grave mistake.

647
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:41,220
What should I do?

648
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:44,940
It's your life.

649
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:47,499
If you don't want to lose him,

650
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:49,980
you'll find a way.

651
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,779
What's up? You seem happy.

652
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,180
Dinner is on me today.

653
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,220
How generous of you.

654
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:19,460
Did you strike it rich?

655
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,299
I just got my annual bonus!

656
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,380
No wonder you specifically
chose this restaurant.

657
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:28,050
Are you trying to show off now?

658
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,019
The last time I ate here,

659
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:31,420
I had to mooch off
you and Zhang Qingya's

660
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,140
Christmas couple's set meal.

661
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,220
I wasn't satisfied.

662
00:31:35,304 --> 00:31:36,290
This time, it's my treat.

663
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:37,860
Ms. Gu,

664
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,608
you sure know how to hold a grudge.

665
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,009
It's been so long,

666
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,392
and you're still bringing it up.

667
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,259
What's the matter?

668
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:46,579
Bored with our relationship?

669
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:47,900
Starting to pick faults with me?

670
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,768
If there's anything else
you want to criticize,

671
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:50,728
say it all at once.

672
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,259
I love you.

673
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,700
People might hear us.

674
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:04,819
Alright.

675
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,779
Let's go and eat.

676
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:22,420
Thank you.

677
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,539
Thank you.

678
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:30,330
Everyone else is earning
annual salaries,

679
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:31,420
yet your boss

680
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:33,299
treats you like a cash cow.

681
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,720
She thinks she can buy your talent
with such a paltry sum.

682
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:37,259
Does she respect you

683
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:38,620
or does she look down on you?

684
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,539
Liang Daiwen,

685
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,620
your arrogant comment

686
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,460
just shattered my pride.

687
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,819
Then think of a way

688
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,019
to increase your income.

689
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:52,099
I'd like to, but I need an opportunity.

690
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,019
I've been stuck at the same salary.

691
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,960
You can't just rely on your salary.

692
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,819
Isn't your public account doing well?

693
00:33:01,032 --> 00:33:02,984
You could quit and contribute
paid content instead.

694
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:04,810
Let your boss pay based on
performance metrics.

695
00:33:04,952 --> 00:33:06,250
Your income will double immediately.

696
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:08,019
That makes sense.

697
00:33:08,504 --> 00:33:09,490
Why didn't I think of that?

698
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,779
People like you in the workplace

699
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:14,019
are like docile whales,

700
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,779
easily exploited.

701
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:18,940
Forget it.

702
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:21,499
I'll focus on creating
good content first

703
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:23,779
and think about monetization later.

704
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,009
But right now, I have

705
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,912
an opportunity that's even
riskier than quitting.

706
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,860
I'm not sure if I should go for it.

707
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:33,499
Tell me about it.

708
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
(Talent Agency Contract)

709
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,299
Enjoy your meal.

710
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,560
(3.1 Party A has the right to arrange
and negotiate all...)

711
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:00,499
I discussed it with Mr. Yu.

712
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,980
It's not a big company, for sure.

713
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:06,019
But it's still better than
picking up odd gigs, right?

714
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,740
Besides, now that Zhang Qingya
has taken over Ounce,

715
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,860
I really don't want to go back there.

716
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,099
If I stop performing for too long,

717
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,099
I'll get rusty.

718
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,699
Are you sure the jobs they provide

719
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:20,179
will give you enough creative freedom?

720
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,179
The material you perform

721
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:23,980
will belong entirely to the company.

722
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,019
Scripts have to be reviewed.

723
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,659
You'll have to integrate sponsor plugs.

724
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,659
Do these terms

725
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,539
align with your personal goals?

726
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,780
I don't know.

727
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:39,219
But I really want to give

728
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,499
being a full-time comedian a shot.

729
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:44,420
If you just want to make
some side income,

730
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:45,736
it's worth a try.

731
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:47,900
But if it affects your career path,

732
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:49,740
you should think carefully.

733
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,539
I've never doubted

734
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:54,420
your talent for comedy.

735
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,059
But are you really ready

736
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,619
to be a full-time performer?

737
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:02,940
It's okay.

738
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:04,420
If you've decided,

739
00:35:04,648 --> 00:35:05,260
then go for it.

740
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:06,820
I've got your back.

741
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,699
Let's eat.

742
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,539
Why was that guy

743
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,820
wearing sunglasses indoors at night?

744
00:35:47,499 --> 00:35:48,460
Personal habit, I guess.

745
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,219
For a while,

746
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:51,380
I wore shades all the time.

747
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,659
I was inspired by Guan Xingxin.

748
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,860
She said that when you lose your vision,

749
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:58,499
your other senses are heightened.

750
00:35:58,968 --> 00:36:00,300
But after wearing them for a while,

751
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,312
I didn't feel any difference.

752
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:04,340
How could that be?

753
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:06,019
Try feeling it again.

754
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:08,740
How do I do that?

755
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,780
Close your eyes.

756
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:21,780
I love you.

757
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:46,260
Take it.

758
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,179
It's for you.

759
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,860
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

760
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,460
Don't take it to heart.

761
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,368
I was just looking out for you.

762
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:54,740
Huang Wenda,

763
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:57,579
is this how you usually

764
00:36:57,579 --> 00:36:58,579
apologize to women?

765
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:00,900
What do you mean?

766
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:03,300
If I were a man,

767
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:05,980
would you still throw
money and gifts at me?

768
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,619
What exactly are you trying to say?

769
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,340
I don't need your stuff,

770
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:14,699
and I don't need your apology.

771
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:17,129
After all, I was the one

772
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,488
who delayed the shoot last time.

773
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,099
But next time,

774
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,659
if you feel apologetic,

775
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,980
a simple "I'm sorry"

776
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:25,980
would suffice.

777
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,139
One more thing,

778
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,099
when you give someone something,

779
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:32,900
please don't throw it,
it's disrespectful.

780
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,260
Hand it over properly.

781
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,420
Thank you.

782
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,219
Lately,

783
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,380
I've been reading the online comments.

784
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,099
Since the last episode aired,

785
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:50,260
your reputation has improved a lot.

786
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:52,579
It seems the editing team
is quite skilled.

787
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,059
They know exactly what to cut
and what to keep.

788
00:37:59,219 --> 00:37:59,900
Do you think

789
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,780
I should find out

790
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,980
who that editor is?

791
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,300
Pull some strings

792
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,416
to get you more screen time.

793
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,569
So we can avoid any surprises later

794
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,128
and having to pay
to control the narrative?

795
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,340
Director Peng,

796
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,699
sorry to bother you

797
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,699
this late.

798
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,820
I wanted to ask you something.

799
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,219
Do you know who the editor was

800
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:32,260
for the last episode?

801
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,420
The online feedback has been improving.

802
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,340
I'd like to thank him.

803
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:38,380
I believe the editing was

804
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,820
outsourced to a rough-cut editor.

805
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:41,260
What's his name again...

806
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:43,380
His last name is Yu, I think.

807
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,900
Yu Dule.

808
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:52,019
Got it.

809
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:53,579
Alright, Director Peng.

810
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,340
Thanks a lot.

811
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:55,619
Bye.

812
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,175
(Talent Agency Contract)

813
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:19,179
Ms. Gu.

814
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:20,820
Ms. Gu.

815
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:24,579
I completely understand

816
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,900
if you have concerns.

817
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,940
You might feel

818
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,260
that our club

819
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:33,420
doesn't have the same reach
as other companies.

820
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,820
Of course,

821
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,219
that's true.

822
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:37,940
I won't hide that fact.

823
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:40,579
But I really think you should

824
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,659
give it some serious thought.

825
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:44,219
At those

826
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:45,579
big, established

827
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,260
traffic-driven companies,

828
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,659
the competition among performers

829
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:51,099
must be fierce.

830
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:53,539
For a young performer to get in,

831
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,059
who knows how long they'd have to wait
to get some stage time.

832
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,019
If I were you,

833
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:00,780
I'd rather be the head of a chicken

834
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:02,008
than the tail of a phoenix.

835
00:40:02,728 --> 00:40:03,992
Joining big-name companies

836
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:06,539
would be a waste of your time
and talent.

837
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,780
What you're saying makes sense.

838
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,460
But I...

839
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:16,820
I have

840
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:17,860
one small

841
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,219
concern.

842
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,860
I looked up

843
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,539
your club's official account,

844
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:23,860
and I noticed

845
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,300
there's no promotional activity.

846
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,659
Does that mean you don't have
a marketing plan in place?

847
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:31,780
We're in the off-season right now.

848
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:34,699
Those comedy shows on TV

849
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,099
are trending hard.

850
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,980
They're dominating the hot search list.

851
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:39,340
Right now,

852
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:40,179
spending money

853
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,179
on promotions

854
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,219
and publicity

855
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,059
would be like throwing money away.

856
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,780
We do have promotional material,

857
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:49,740
and it's tailored
to each performer's style.

858
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,579
What's the point of promoting

859
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,860
if the timing isn't right?

860
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:54,900
Don't you agree?

861
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,380
Right now,

862
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:02,699
everyone's focused on

863
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:04,420
those celebrities on variety shows.

864
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,619
But they

865
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,099
all started as small-time performers,
didn't they?

866
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,019
Here at our club,

867
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:14,420
talent and ability is what matters.

868
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,059
Ms. Gu,

869
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:18,699
I fully recognize

870
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:20,940
your talent.

871
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,420
If you sign with us

872
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:25,699
as a resident comedian,

873
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:27,860
you'll be able to refine your routines

874
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,176
through various offline performances.

875
00:41:29,352 --> 00:41:30,740
Before you have that breakout moment,

876
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,019
you need to build a foundation.

877
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:34,659
How long will you keep doing

878
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:36,820
those freelance gigs?

879
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:39,860
Now,

880
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,539
stand-up comedy is gaining
more and more popularity.

881
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:44,940
Comedy clubs

882
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:47,139
will pop up like mushrooms
after a rainstorm.

883
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:48,139
And

884
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,579
the bar for performers

885
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,980
will get lower and lower.

886
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,740
Once capital

887
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,019
gets involved,

888
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,300
opportunities to become
a contract performer

889
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,619
will be even scarcer.

890
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:00,219
To be honest,

891
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,460
I already have

892
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,380
several candidates lined up.

893
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:05,659
I am making your case

894
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:08,260
to my entire company.

895
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:12,699
Ms. Gu,

896
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:15,380
if you don't

897
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,820
decide now,

898
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,579
I'll have to consider someone else.

899
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,139
The performances are already scheduled.

900
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,980
We can't save those slots just for you.

901
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,400
(Party B: Gu Yi)

902
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,399
(Party A: Worry Free Comedy Club,
Liu Ran)

903
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,352
(If Party B breaches the contract,
as per agreement,)

904
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,620
(Party B will be prohibited
from performing in any comedy events.)

905
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:03,539
On behalf

906
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:04,780
of Worry Free,

907
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,019
I welcome you, Ms. Gu.

908
00:43:06,328 --> 00:43:07,528
