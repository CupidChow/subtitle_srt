23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
(Adapted from Douban Read's work
"Smile Code" by Zu Yue)

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,203
=Episode 9=

25
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:52,337
Come on.

26
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,057
I'm sure there's another meeting today.

27
00:01:57,798 --> 00:01:58,497
Morning.

28
00:01:58,837 --> 00:02:00,818
Morning, my little apprentice.

29
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:06,178
Yi, here.

30
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:07,497
Rui.

31
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:09,637
Here. I got these for you.

32
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:10,556
(Hap, Up)

33
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:12,618
What is this?

34
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,357
Someone sent a 24-inch cake to the boss

35
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:18,098
with the words "Happy Breakup".

36
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:21,197
Who would do that?

37
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:22,538
Who would ask that?

38
00:02:23,798 --> 00:02:25,957
Anyway, she told the admin
to share the cake with everyone.

39
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,517
She also threw away the 99 white roses

40
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:28,297
that came with the cake.

41
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:33,538
Gu Yi.

42
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:36,658
Send Ms. Guan off.

43
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:45,243
(Director's Office, Guan Xingxin, Layla)

44
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:48,417
I've finally quit this job.

45
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,400
Once I return my employee card,
I'll have nothing to do with Nextmonday.

46
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:53,577
What are your plans?

47
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:57,818
I'm a free person now.

48
00:02:58,397 --> 00:02:59,378
I'll go back to livestreaming.

49
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:00,977
Layla.

50
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:03,697
Layla is just a name.

51
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:06,357
Back in my previous company,

52
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:08,457
as a virtual livestreamer, I had
the highest follower growth rate.

53
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:10,716
Other than the publicity
my company gave me,

54
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:12,058
it was all about my own hard work.

55
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,098
But, ever since that scandal broke out,

56
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:17,938
carrying that name felt like a sin.

57
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:19,857
My account was banned,

58
00:03:20,437 --> 00:03:22,977
and people started finding faults
with my previous live streams.

59
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:25,658
In fact,
I'm still getting bashed online.

60
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:29,538
Idols are supposed to be perfect.

61
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:32,457
I guess Layla will be shelved
for quite some time.

62
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:35,498
Still, this is probably
the best result for you.

63
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:37,737
That's what Jacqueline said, too.

64
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:40,818
Still, I just had my first taste
of playing the bad girl,

65
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,137
and I need to maintain
my current tag's hype.

66
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:48,258
I wasn't here for long,

67
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,098
but at least I saw a friend in you.

68
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:51,538
I guess it wasn't that boring.

69
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:53,017
Gu Yi.

70
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:54,876
I'm returning the position

71
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:56,058
of director to you.

72
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:58,077
Congratulations in advance.

73
00:03:58,078 --> 00:03:58,737
All the best.

74
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:00,857
Ladies, pardon me for the interruption.

75
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:02,520
Zhi just went out to buy coffee.

76
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,240
He told me to inform you
that we have an editorial meeting now.

77
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,957
Now?

78
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:05,857
Now.

79
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:08,156
It's okay, go ahead. I'll be fine.

80
00:04:08,157 --> 00:04:08,957
Go ahead.

81
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:09,737
I'll send her off.

82
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:11,116
Bye.

83
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,017
Bye.

84
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:13,338
Quit your job?

85
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,060
(Nextmonday)

86
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:22,156
(One,)

87
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:23,156
(beat around the bush.)

88
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:24,356
(Learn about his past)

89
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:25,537
(to find the correct remedy.)

90
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:26,418
(Two,)

91
00:04:26,477 --> 00:04:27,517
(be natural when chatting.)

92
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,777
(Avoid being too direct.)

93
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,437
(If he knows about
your feelings for him,)

94
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,178
(it's most likely game over.)

95
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:33,457
(Three,)

96
00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:36,418
(use a guy's methods to handle a guy.)

97
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:40,897
Brainstorming for new themes?

98
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:55,337
The rules of love for urbanites.

99
00:04:58,078 --> 00:04:59,818
You did a great job
on the Chinese music article.

100
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:02,360
I'll get Penny to work with you

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,720
on an exhibit called "The Aesthetics of
Solitude in Chinese Home Furnishings".

102
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,080
It'll be published in the next issue.

103
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:08,738
Remember to tell Xu Guanrui about it.

104
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:13,877
Also, prepare a supplement

105
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,337
to promote the next issue.

106
00:05:15,337 --> 00:05:16,880
We'll run through it in a meeting
by the end of this month.

107
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,298
All the department heads will be there.

108
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:21,897
A word of reminder.

109
00:05:22,878 --> 00:05:24,858
This meeting may decide the next

110
00:05:25,198 --> 00:05:27,017
person-in-charge of our supplement,

111
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:29,258
as well as the next director.

112
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:31,337
Keep that in mind.

113
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:48,040
Do you have smoked bean curd?

114
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,360
I'll have a potato, eggplant
and sweet pepper stir-fry.

115
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,957
All right. Got it.

116
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,097
Thank you.

117
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,137
What caused
Jacqueline's breakup this time?

118
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:03,457
Enough, it has nothing to do with you.

119
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:05,877
I used to believe
that we had a future together,

120
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:07,557
but then I realized I didn't need it,

121
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:09,017
because that's not love.

122
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:10,197
Understand? Wake up.

123
00:06:10,198 --> 00:06:11,577
It's long over.

124
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:15,858
I don't know.

125
00:06:16,198 --> 00:06:18,097
We don't really gossip about our boss.

126
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:20,978
You're a smart colleague.

127
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:22,178
However, there are some things,

128
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:23,877
that is, her pet peeves,

129
00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:24,938
that you need to know.

130
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:26,777
I'm not gossiping here.

131
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:29,217
Listen carefully,
I'll only say this once.

132
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:31,457
Okay.

133
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:34,818
Jacqueline was raised by her aunt.

134
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:37,097
After graduating
from a teacher's college,

135
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,897
her family insisted that she return home
to find a job and feed the family.

136
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:41,618
It was then

137
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,337
that she ran off to Donghai
with Huang Wenda.

138
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:46,217
She worked and studied
at the same time,

139
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,240
and paid off her college funds
that her family had sponsored.

140
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:50,058
Despite living in hardship and poverty,

141
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:51,897
their relationship only grew stronger.

142
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:53,916
But, just when their careers

143
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,897
were about to take off,

144
00:06:56,118 --> 00:06:57,017
guess what?

145
00:06:57,758 --> 00:06:58,457
They broke up.

146
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:00,337
Yes, they did.

147
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:03,298
The guy who interrupted
our meeting that day was Huang Wenda.

148
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:05,217
The cake you're eating now

149
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:06,858
is probably from him, too.

150
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:09,418
He's probably also
responsible for nurturing

151
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,258
Jacqueline's abilities and ambitions.

152
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:15,378
Where did you get all that juicy gossip?

153
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,317
Back in those years, there was a story

154
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:20,217
called "Da-line's Love Story" on Blogbus

155
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:21,498
that had tens of thousands of shares.

156
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:27,258
Many people were disappointed
at how the story ended.

157
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:29,178
Until today, no one knows

158
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:31,537
why they broke up.

159
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:33,258
The last blog post

160
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:36,178
even had a photo of a young
Huang Wenda and Jacqueline

161
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:37,777
hugging in front of Westminster Abbey.

162
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:40,117
They shared a passionate love

163
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:41,777
that would seem to burn
until the world's end,

164
00:07:42,118 --> 00:07:44,498
but their bad ending came abruptly,
and it was a total crash.

165
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:51,298
Jacqueline always looks so grumpy.

166
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:54,418
I didn't expect her
to have an epic love story.

167
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:55,957
As the saying goes,

168
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,178
what comes up must come down.

169
00:07:57,438 --> 00:08:00,978
A love that burns too passionately
all the time can't last long, but it does leave

170
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:02,498
some fond memories.

171
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,298
It's good to have some fond memories.

172
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,258
It's a big world out there.

173
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:09,596
Not everyone has the chance

174
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:11,337
to reach for the stars.

175
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:13,577
Reach for the stars?

176
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:18,178
Mr. Xu,

177
00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:20,337
can I get your advice on something.

178
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:23,897
Sure, Ms. Gu.

179
00:08:25,357 --> 00:08:28,178
Let's say there's a girl
who really likes you,

180
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,517
but you

181
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:30,938
don't really have any feelings for her.

182
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,097
So,

183
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:34,378
what should she do to make things work?

184
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:35,957
If he's got no feelings for her,

185
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,378
nothing would make things work.

186
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:43,897
Maybe it's not that
you have no feelings for her,

187
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,897
but that you don't know
about your feelings for her.

188
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:49,738
To be precise,

189
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,858
you have no feelings at all
for anything in this world.

190
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:55,897
No feelings for anything in this world?

191
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:59,417
Will you listen to what you just said?

192
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:00,738
Are you in love with a robot?

193
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:05,236
Still, even if he's a robot,

194
00:09:05,237 --> 00:09:06,537
as long as he likes you,

195
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:08,116
even if he feels nothing for
anything else in the world,

196
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:09,840
it's impossible for him
to not have feelings for you.

197
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:13,858
After all, love is an innate ability.
It's not a coded program.

198
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:20,537
Think about it.

199
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:23,397
Here's your food.

200
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:23,797
Okay.

201
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:24,738
Thank you.

202
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:25,836
Smoked bean curd with chilies.

203
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:26,397
Nice.

204
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:27,657
Tomato and egg stir-fry.

205
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,098
Enjoy.

206
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,897
You could have ordered
something fancier.

207
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,060
Where's the potato, eggplant,
and sweet pepper stir-fry?

208
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,157
Right, where's the other stir-fry?

209
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,836
- Potato, eggplant, and sweet peppers?
- Hurry up, lady boss.

210
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:38,858
Coming right up.

211
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:39,817
Let's dig in.

212
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:41,277
Hello, everyone.

213
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,177
I'm Layla.

214
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:45,596
It's sunny today,
and I'm feeling sunny too.

215
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:47,297
I hope you feel the same.

216
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:49,137
Here...

217
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:51,017
You're still watching?

218
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,258
You must have
a surplus of hormones today.

219
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:56,537
I'm preparing for love.

220
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,596
She really looks different

221
00:09:58,597 --> 00:09:59,937
from when she's livestreaming.

222
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:02,378
That's why I need to get to know her.

223
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:08,017
Are you really going
to court Guan Xingxin?

224
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:10,817
Mr. Yu, sorry for what I'm about to say,

225
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:12,858
but you...

226
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,698
Well, you look kind of okay,

227
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:18,858
but Guan Xingxin is
on a totally different level.

228
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,458
You'll struggle just to find a spot
among her queue of suitors.

229
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:24,258
The gap between
the both of you is just too wide.

230
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:26,017
Give it some thought.

231
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:28,218
Not as wide as the gap
between you and Liang Daiwen.

232
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:29,897
Darn you.

233
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:31,557
I'm talking about you.

234
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:32,777
Why mention me?

235
00:10:34,757 --> 00:10:36,817
We're both on our
respective starting lines.

236
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:37,836
When the shots are fired,

237
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,137
we'll be running together.

238
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:40,476
Remember,

239
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:41,716
if you have any tips,

240
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:42,498
share it with me.

241
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:44,858
What tips would I have?

242
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:47,498
Guan Xingxin just told me

243
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:50,378
"to use a guy's methods
to handle a guy".

244
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:54,537
I still don't understand
what that means.

245
00:10:57,438 --> 00:10:58,618
How could you be so dumb?

246
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,596
It means you need to stop
looking like an ugly Betty

247
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:02,858
and start polishing your rough edges.

248
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:04,437
You don't even look that ugly,

249
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:05,177
do you?

250
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,996
Cold beauty, bombshell,
innocent, or cute.

251
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:08,400
You can alternate between these styles.

252
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:09,897
But, most importantly,

253
00:11:10,477 --> 00:11:13,417
you need to give up on being a comedian.

254
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,578
Men are visual creatures, after all.

255
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,177
How tacky.

256
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:22,738
Liang Daiwen is not like you.

257
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:24,716
He's a robot.

258
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,017
He's equipped with a hotspot.

259
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,680
It's up to fate to decide whether
anyone can connect to his network.

260
00:11:29,158 --> 00:11:30,498
Have you?

261
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:33,137
A few times, I guess.

262
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:36,578
But as of now, I'm disconnected.

263
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:38,937
It's okay.

264
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:41,476
If you want to reach for the stars,

265
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:43,537
you need to be prepared
to fall from the sky.

266
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:47,537
Even if I do fall,

267
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:50,218
I'd rather struggle anyway.

268
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,057
Sure.

269
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:53,157
I applaud your courage.

270
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:54,498
Here's wishing you

271
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:55,876
that you'll get your own grave,

272
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:57,017
and that you'll get reincarnated.

273
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,356
If you're free now,
why don't you watch with me?

274
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,937
Give me some tips, will you?

275
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:08,297
My tip is that you should stop watching.

276
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:13,657
It won't do you any good.

277
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,159
(Van Gogh Manor)

278
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,219
(Answer at 20-year-old:
What is your most notable trait?)

279
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,640
(What quality
do you value most in a friend?)

280
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,960
If you don't need your eyes,
you could donate to those who need them.

281
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,177
I'm ordering delivery, want some?

282
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:47,978
Liang Daiwen.

283
00:12:48,597 --> 00:12:50,777
Do you know why your heart is ice-cold?

284
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:54,817
That's because eating plants all the time
will turn you into a plant yourself.

285
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:58,098
Stop eating those cold, soulless food.

286
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,578
I'll cook some noodles for you.

287
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:02,098
You?

288
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:04,476
If you're worried that I'd
burn your house down again,

289
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:06,098
you can sit here and monitor me.

290
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:33,258
Proust questionnaire?

291
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:37,378
This is the first treatment course
I'm designing for you.

292
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:39,378
If you're free later,

293
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:40,618
please answer some questions for me.

294
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:53,578
Do you always order delivery

295
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:55,378
because you don't have friends?

296
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:59,057
All my dad did
was giving me an allowance,

297
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,897
so to save time,

298
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:02,378
I'd just pick the most convenient food.

299
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,177
You're abusing yourself, you know?

300
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:08,836
You still need some carbohydrates

301
00:14:08,837 --> 00:14:09,738
and gutter oil.

302
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,537
You can have it all.

303
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:20,218
How is it?

304
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,200
Tastes like instant noodles.

305
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:29,458
Okay, while you're eating,
please answer some questions.

306
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:31,356
I'll skip the questions

307
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:32,437
related to emotions

308
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,937
since you can't answer them.

309
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:35,897
First question.

310
00:14:36,237 --> 00:14:39,378
What kind of ability
do you desire the most?

311
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:42,137
Empathy.

312
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:49,098
What is your biggest fear?

313
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:53,698
Unable to remember certain things.

314
00:15:00,038 --> 00:15:01,978
What do you dislike
the most about yourself?

315
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:03,657
Having an ice-cold heart.

316
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:10,978
What do you dislike
about your appearance?

317
00:15:11,798 --> 00:15:12,498
Being too handsome.

318
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,578
What is your biggest regret?

319
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:27,177
Hurting some people

320
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:29,698
when I shouldn't be in a relationship.

321
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:39,978
What's your most painful experience?

322
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:49,817
Losing my mother.

323
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,317
If you could choose,

324
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:03,017
what would you bring back?

325
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:05,618
Feelings.

326
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:06,657
Good,

327
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:07,378
bad.

328
00:16:07,997 --> 00:16:08,897
All kinds of feelings.

329
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:20,458
Another question.

330
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,356
What are your takeaways

331
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:25,738
from your previous relationships?

332
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:31,777
Is that in the questionnaire?

333
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:32,817
It's a bonus question.

334
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:33,897
Bonus question.

335
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,978
They'd always
take care of me instinctively,

336
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:40,578
and that makes me uncomfortable.

337
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:43,258
And that's a bad thing?

338
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:45,578
Then, what do you

339
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,258
want them to do instead?

340
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:49,297
Just be themselves.

341
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:53,657
Is that all?

342
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:57,996
This is just the first step
to understanding the patient's situation.

343
00:16:57,997 --> 00:16:59,897
By gathering information,
I can search for a solution.

344
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:06,397
Do you know what's
the first thing Shen did

345
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:07,377
when he took my case?

346
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:08,377
What?

347
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:09,898
Building trust.

348
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:11,658
What do you mean?

349
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:17,658
It means, for every question
that you asked me just now,

350
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:20,057
I also want to know your answers.

351
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:29,658
It's anti-blue light,
good for your eyes.

352
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:40,658
Let's begin.

353
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:43,938
What kind of ability
do you desire the most?

354
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:46,418
Being able to know what you're thinking.

355
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:49,178
What is your biggest fear?

356
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:51,817
Failing after trying my best.

357
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:54,178
What do you dislike
the most about yourself?

358
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:56,297
Having unusually bad luck.

359
00:17:57,797 --> 00:18:00,218
What do you dislike
about your appearance?

360
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:03,057
Looking like a lunatic when I laugh.

361
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:10,898
Not at all.

362
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:12,258
You look good.

363
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,057
What's your biggest regret?

364
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:22,178
I've been doing
stand-up comedy for years,

365
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,097
but I still can't
express myself in full honesty.

366
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:28,938
What's your most painful experience?

367
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,698
Making my mother suffer
when I was a kid.

368
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:40,938
If you could choose,

369
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,617
what would you bring back?

370
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:47,738
Your feelings.

371
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:50,738
Good feelings.

372
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:55,297
Okay,

373
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:57,157
I've answered all the questions.

374
00:18:57,158 --> 00:18:58,738
We've already built trust,

375
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:00,957
so you have to follow

376
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,458
the treatment plans
I've prepared for you.

377
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:04,138
First of all,

378
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:06,898
forget everything
you've learned from TV dramas.

379
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:08,877
Second,

380
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:10,498
you need to learn
how to express yourself.

381
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:12,236
Whatever emotions you feel,

382
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:14,138
you need to describe in detail.

383
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:15,978
Third,

384
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,537
never say no to Ms. Gu's instructions.

385
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:20,297
You have to reply with a smile.

386
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,017
Can we begin now?

387
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:25,157
That's it?

388
00:19:25,158 --> 00:19:26,097
Is that a yes?

389
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:32,418
Liang Daiwen.

390
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,756
You know, when you put on a fake smile,

391
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,680
every part of your face
seem to have their own thoughts.

392
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:50,986
♪You are the best thing on my mind♪

393
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:55,403
♪A total sugar rush♪

394
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,403
♪Oh you make me blush♪

395
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:03,443
♪'Cause now it's more than a crush♪

396
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:07,702
♪The way you caught my eye♪

397
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:10,117
♪It's like we're synchronized♪

398
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:11,738
Remember this feeling.

399
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,777
This is how a smile should be.

400
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,603
♪I guess♪

401
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,779
♪You make me wanna fly to the moon♪

402
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,892
♪You make me wanna dance right here♪

403
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:28,723
♪You make me feel like I should cry♪

404
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:43,938
You're mad?

405
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:17,218
I made this list just for you.

406
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:19,476
While Dr. Shen provides
professional treatment,

407
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,297
I'll introduce some changes
in your daily routine.

408
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:22,437
Starting from tomorrow,

409
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:24,258
you need to complete
one to two tasks every day.

410
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:26,458
Constant dripping wears away the rock.

411
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:28,258
Little strokes fell great oaks.

412
00:21:30,277 --> 00:21:31,498
Is that

413
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:33,218
a kindergarten schedule?

414
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:36,698
Kindergarten years matter, too.

415
00:21:37,277 --> 00:21:39,577
You need to learn
how to open yourself up.

416
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:41,258
Make some friends

417
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:42,597
with a sense of humor

418
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:44,337
and a sunny disposition.

419
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:46,978
Where can I make a friend like that?

420
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:49,857
Someone funny,

421
00:21:50,158 --> 00:21:51,297
humorous,

422
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:52,577
optimistic,

423
00:21:52,757 --> 00:21:53,658
and extroverted.

424
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,258
Do these adjectives

425
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:57,337
remind you of someone?

426
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,178
Yu Dule.

427
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:11,877
It's me. I've been standing in front of you,
putting my happy face on.

428
00:22:11,878 --> 00:22:13,458
How could you think of Yu Dule?

429
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:16,698
"Nurture a sense of humor".

430
00:22:17,077 --> 00:22:18,537
I was joking with you.

431
00:22:30,438 --> 00:22:31,337
Ms. Gu.

432
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:33,097
Is that all for today's lesson?

433
00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:34,857
I need to meet a client.

434
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:37,898
Yes,

435
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:39,138
class dismissed.

436
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,157
What a humorous guy.

437
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:47,817
He should be doing stand-up comedy.

438
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:09,157
What are you looking at?

439
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:10,617
Aren't you going to meet your client?

440
00:23:10,717 --> 00:23:11,498
Go ahead.

441
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:20,777
Bye.

442
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:44,194
(Music, daily sharing,
exercise, meditate)

443
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,559
(What ability do you wish you had?
Answer: Empathy)

444
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,360
(What do you fear the most?
Answer: Forgetting certain things)

445
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:01,178
I told you to use
a guy's methods to handle a guy,

446
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:02,978
and this is how you're handling Liang?

447
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:07,698
He's a tough case to handle.

448
00:24:07,997 --> 00:24:10,537
He even used my tricks back on me.

449
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:11,756
That's great.

450
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:13,458
It shows that he's interested in you.

451
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,458
I wouldn't think that way.

452
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:20,017
So, you couldn't get Liang to open up,

453
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,178
and you need my help

454
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,698
to know more about his ex?

455
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:35,738
I haven't seen her many times.

456
00:24:35,878 --> 00:24:37,837
All I know is that she's a model,

457
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:38,898
and a gorgeous one at that.

458
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,658
They had a dog together.

459
00:24:41,878 --> 00:24:43,276
She felt that

460
00:24:43,277 --> 00:24:44,938
both of them were too independent,

461
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:46,777
so they needed a clingy dog.

462
00:24:47,077 --> 00:24:48,777
She thought that
it would bring them together,

463
00:24:48,838 --> 00:24:50,337
but it didn't.

464
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:53,677
Later on,

465
00:24:53,678 --> 00:24:54,756
she probably got tired

466
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:56,537
of Liang's emotionless state,

467
00:24:57,077 --> 00:24:59,258
and she met a designer

468
00:24:59,277 --> 00:25:01,258
who gave her the opportunity
to work in overseas shows,

469
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:02,157
so

470
00:25:02,158 --> 00:25:03,617
they broke up.

471
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:05,857
Then,

472
00:25:06,198 --> 00:25:07,738
she left the dog to Liang,

473
00:25:08,198 --> 00:25:09,658
but it became depressed,

474
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:11,738
and he had to give it away.

475
00:25:15,838 --> 00:25:17,097
Why do you want to know all that?

476
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:18,337
Doesn't it upset you?

477
00:25:21,997 --> 00:25:23,017
A little,

478
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:24,658
but not a lot.

479
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,178
I do like Liang Daiwen,

480
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,258
but I don't want
to be a stand-in for anyone.

481
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:32,938
His ex-girlfriend is pretty cool.

482
00:25:33,358 --> 00:25:35,537
She's a decisive girl
who's willing to go all out.

483
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,978
It's kind of challenging for me
to slim down to size zero,

484
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:42,218
but I could learn from the way
she handled her love life.

485
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:46,057
There's no point in comparing the past.

486
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:48,076
But, what's cooler than being decisive

487
00:25:48,077 --> 00:25:49,418
is taking the initiative.

488
00:25:50,438 --> 00:25:52,218
Even Cinderella was smart enough

489
00:25:52,477 --> 00:25:54,817
to leave her glass slipper
to create an opportunity for herself.

490
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:57,276
All the more you need
to let your prince know

491
00:25:57,277 --> 00:25:58,337
that you're waiting for him.

492
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:03,658
Yu Dule invited me
to go camping this weekend.

493
00:26:03,757 --> 00:26:04,738
I invited Lu, too.

494
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:06,197
You

495
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,577
should bring Liang Daiwen along.

496
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,003
(Meditate)

497
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,516

498
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:55,218
♪Let me get to know love again, L-O-V-E!♪

00:26:58,277 --> 00:27:00,579

500

501
00:27:06,678 --> 00:27:09,076
Mr. Yu invited us
to go camping this weekend.

502
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:09,978
Want to join?

503
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:11,377
You're going?

504
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:14,777
Sure,

505
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:15,658
let's go.

506
00:27:16,598 --> 00:27:17,178
Great.

507
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:22,316
See?

508
00:27:22,317 --> 00:27:23,476
The figures are straightforward.

509
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:25,577
The music column is performing
better than expected.

510
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:26,996
Penny.

511
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:29,877
You can start handling
all the advertisement offers on hold.

512
00:27:29,878 --> 00:27:31,437
Do your best, show me what you can do.

513
00:27:31,438 --> 00:27:32,577
Any questions?

514
00:27:32,997 --> 00:27:33,716
No problem.

515
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:34,476
Good.

516
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:36,556
We can start scheduling
the next issue's ads and publicity.

517
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:39,076
Gu Yi. Get someone to help you
if things get too hectic.

518
00:27:39,077 --> 00:27:39,857
Dismissed.

519
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:46,857
Jacqueline.

520
00:27:48,598 --> 00:27:49,516
Gu Yi can't possibly

521
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,698
take all the credit for
the music column's success.

522
00:27:56,517 --> 00:27:58,377
Did I give her all the credit?

523
00:28:01,198 --> 00:28:02,658
I do feel

524
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:05,057
that you're favoring Gu Yi.

525
00:28:05,838 --> 00:28:06,898
You see,

526
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,898
She's the one in charge of
all our social media content,

527
00:28:10,358 --> 00:28:11,716
and also

528
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:12,938
Xu Guanrui's column.

529
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,138
Even I have to follow
her instructions now.

530
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:18,537
You know,

531
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:20,297
everyone is secretly saying

532
00:28:20,557 --> 00:28:22,057
that Gu Yi is going
to be the next director?

533
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:24,817
Penny.

534
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:25,996
I used to work on

535
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,377
a TV commercial
for a real estate company.

536
00:28:27,438 --> 00:28:29,397
My proposal got rejected,
and the client literally pointed at my nose,

537
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:30,698
saying that I lack professionalism.

538
00:28:31,438 --> 00:28:33,498
Do you know what professionalism
means in advertising?

539
00:28:33,997 --> 00:28:34,938
Revenue.

540
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:36,857
Money is king in commerce.

541
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:39,138
Content serves as a base for everything.

542
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:42,076
I assigned Gu Yi to Xu Guanrui

543
00:28:42,077 --> 00:28:43,178
to assist him,

544
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,938
and I assigned you
to help with the music column.

545
00:28:46,277 --> 00:28:47,738
If you think I'm playing favorites,

546
00:28:48,118 --> 00:28:49,817
I'd say you benefited
from this assignment.

547
00:28:51,237 --> 00:28:52,418
Don't get the wrong idea.

548
00:28:52,557 --> 00:28:54,097
I'm not trying to insinuate anything.

549
00:28:57,358 --> 00:28:58,978
As for the selection
of the next director,

550
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:01,377
a win-win situation
only involves two parties,

551
00:29:02,037 --> 00:29:03,777
and a mutual win involves more than two.

552
00:29:04,237 --> 00:29:05,537
You're a clever lady.

553
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:06,498
Think about it.

554
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:21,898
Thank you.

555
00:29:24,878 --> 00:29:25,658
Mr. Liang.

556
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:27,698
(Donghai Xinshi HR Services, Headhunter)
How did you know about me?

557
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:31,698
I'll get straight to the point.

558
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:34,698
I'm now an independent designer.

559
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:35,777
Over the past few years,

560
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:37,677
I've been doing charity-based

561
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:38,978
barrier-free design projects.

562
00:29:41,118 --> 00:29:42,738
This is my current focus.

563
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:45,418
I find such projects meaningful,

564
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,097
but the climate isn't there.

565
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:48,837
That's why I hope

566
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:51,057
to introduce real
barrier-free designs to the public,

567
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:53,097
not just basic amenities,

568
00:29:53,557 --> 00:29:54,978
but encompassing daily life.

569
00:29:56,557 --> 00:29:58,898
So, Mr. Liang,

570
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:01,698
what do you want me to do for you?

571
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:03,857
Li Ai.

572
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:05,097
Have you heard of him?

573
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:06,817
I have.

574
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,297
He was the one in charge of the
barrier-free designs in An Residence.

575
00:30:10,918 --> 00:30:12,857
However, he fell into a decline
after a car accident,

576
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:14,840
and he's rarely
showed himself since then.

577
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:17,337
So,

578
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:18,857
you want me

579
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:19,817
to look for him?

580
00:30:21,838 --> 00:30:24,377
There aren't many companies in China
doing barrier-free designs.

581
00:30:24,678 --> 00:30:25,777
I have the basic skills,

582
00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:27,057
but that's about it.

583
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:29,658
I hope you can get him on board.

584
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:37,738
No problem.

585
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,076
It's a well-written piece,

586
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,658
but you didn't list the key points.

587
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:50,316
This is about your promotion.

588
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:51,658
Make it eye-catching.

589
00:30:51,658 --> 00:30:53,280
Catch their eyes
as soon as they read it, got it?

590
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:56,218
You're not just promoting
the supplement, but you yourself.

591
00:30:57,838 --> 00:30:58,617
Jacqueline.

592
00:30:58,797 --> 00:31:00,138
There's an investor
who wants to see you.

593
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:02,197
The investment department is upstairs.

594
00:31:02,198 --> 00:31:03,377
Why look for me?

595
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:05,957
He said he wanted to catch up with you,
and he won't leave until you come.

596
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:06,738
Who's that?

597
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:07,498
What's his name?

598
00:31:08,077 --> 00:31:08,738
Mr. Huang.

599
00:31:08,838 --> 00:31:09,777
Huang Wenda.

600
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:16,138
That's so very sincere of him.

601
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:20,017
Go brew ten cups of
our best Biluochun tea for him.

602
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:22,418
Give him our best show of hospitality
and make him wait.

603
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:23,537
Rewrite this.

604
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,060
(Biluochun Tea)

605
00:31:43,878 --> 00:31:45,258
Are you nuts?

606
00:31:45,918 --> 00:31:47,076
Do you think you're really

607
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:48,698
supposed to brew all that tea?

608
00:31:50,598 --> 00:31:51,597
I guess

609
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:53,297
he's the guy who sent
the "Happy Breakup" cake.

610
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:55,057
He's got the same vibes as the Demoness.

611
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:56,698
I could feel the air pressure dropping.

612
00:31:56,918 --> 00:31:59,138
And you're trying to add fuel to fire?

613
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,577
Have you finished
editing the movie article?

614
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:02,297
What about the poster copyrights?

615
00:32:02,438 --> 00:32:03,556
Relax, I have an assistant.

616
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:04,577
I'll get it done this weekend.

617
00:32:05,077 --> 00:32:07,036
Okay, share the file when you're done.

618
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:07,677
Got it.

619
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:09,337
You can drink all that tea yourself.

620
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:23,458
I'm going home.

621
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:24,698
Mi,

622
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:25,978
let's go home together.

623
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,817
I haven't finished work.

624
00:32:31,477 --> 00:32:32,498
What's that?

625
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:35,117
Zhi asked me to find some posters

626
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:36,418
and contact the copyright holders.

627
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,458
Gu Yi's team claims to be busy,

628
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:40,938
and they think you're free?

629
00:32:41,118 --> 00:32:41,516
Got it,

630
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:43,898
I'll send them
the copyright permissions.

631
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:46,476
Penny,

632
00:32:46,477 --> 00:32:47,516
some items have been permitted,

633
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:48,397
and some haven't.

634
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:49,178
If you mix them up...

635
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:50,498
Did they ask about that?

636
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:53,898
Done.

637
00:32:54,797 --> 00:32:55,658
Time to go home.

638
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:12,978
Honestly,

639
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:15,258
when I saw the words
"nutritional diet" on the board,

640
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,698
I didn't expect to see such food.

641
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:21,837
Sweet food

642
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:23,178
can make you happy.

643
00:33:24,037 --> 00:33:24,597
Spicy food

644
00:33:24,598 --> 00:33:25,898
can relieve stress.

645
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:27,157
Sour food

646
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:28,537
can stimulate you.

647
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:32,097
They say the gut
is responsible for emotions,

648
00:33:32,317 --> 00:33:34,698
which makes the sense of taste
an input valve for emotions.

649
00:33:36,757 --> 00:33:37,297
Spiciness

650
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:38,817
is actually pain,

651
00:33:39,158 --> 00:33:39,938
not a taste.

652
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,017
Do not interrupt your teacher.

653
00:33:45,517 --> 00:33:47,537
Try this. It's really spicy.

654
00:33:47,878 --> 00:33:48,978
It'll trigger a reaction.

655
00:34:13,037 --> 00:34:14,636
That's a good expression!
Remember this feeling.

656
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:15,076
Quick,

657
00:34:15,077 --> 00:34:15,676
come on,

658
00:34:15,677 --> 00:34:16,457
smile!

659
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:24,738
Hey,

660
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,797
I said smile.

661
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,377
A simple smile will do.

662
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,497
Why are you smiling like a puppy?

663
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,457
That looks worse than before.

664
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,005
(Nutritional diet)

665
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:55,360
(Long Play Planet Record Store)

666
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:06,377
Comrade.

667
00:35:08,037 --> 00:35:09,138
Mr. Xu.

668
00:35:09,878 --> 00:35:11,977
Why are you disguising yourself
like you're a celebrity?

669
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:14,738
I had to leave the office for work.

670
00:35:14,837 --> 00:35:16,960
The music industry is small,
and I've got too many acquaintances.

671
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:19,676
Have you watched the TV show

672
00:35:19,677 --> 00:35:20,516
that I shared?

673
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:21,457
Yeah.

674
00:35:21,677 --> 00:35:22,797
The whole program

675
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:25,076
was pretty interesting
from song selection

676
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:26,457
to stage setup.

677
00:35:26,677 --> 00:35:28,837
The instrumentation, choreography,

678
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:30,698
costume, makeup, props, and background

679
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:33,618
were all very practical.

680
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:34,797
They may look complicated,

681
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:36,138
but it's actually minimalistic.

682
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:37,457
Agreed.

683
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:38,937
Nowadays,

684
00:35:39,157 --> 00:35:40,317
there are too many

685
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:41,777
mix-and-match variety shows.

686
00:35:42,597 --> 00:35:43,337
Music,

687
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:45,076
singing groups, rapping,

688
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:46,138
competition,

689
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:48,337
and sometimes even the metaverse.

690
00:35:48,758 --> 00:35:50,076
Mixing all of that together

691
00:35:50,077 --> 00:35:50,937
may look good,

692
00:35:51,197 --> 00:35:52,618
but sounds awful.

693
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,098
For many bands,

694
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:55,476
they just want to sing, but no.

695
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:56,258
Audition first.

696
00:35:56,438 --> 00:35:57,297
That's so weird.

697
00:35:58,238 --> 00:35:59,138
Mr. Xu,

698
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:00,996
sometimes, the way you work

699
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:02,817
resembles Jacqueline's, you know?

700
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:06,018
Very efficient and strict,
with lots of on-point sarcasm.

701
00:36:06,278 --> 00:36:07,178
Of course.

702
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:09,036
She's now relying on me
to get more views.

703
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:10,578
I have a KPI to work for, too.

704
00:36:12,197 --> 00:36:13,337
Let me tell you a secret.

705
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:16,138
What is it?

706
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,218
I'm writing this column

707
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:22,377
simply because
Jacqueline and I are friends.

708
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:24,258
She's also paying well.

709
00:36:24,438 --> 00:36:25,618
To me, it's like my gap year job.

710
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:28,897
But now, I have another goal in mind.

711
00:36:30,677 --> 00:36:32,297
To make more money for you guys.

712
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:37,578
If Jacqueline hears that,

713
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:39,457
she'll extend your contract
immediately, you know?

714
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:41,218
Not for her.

715
00:36:42,798 --> 00:36:45,098
The better our music column performs,

716
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:47,036
the more valuable you are

717
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:48,337
to Jacqueline.

718
00:37:14,878 --> 00:37:16,138
Have you listened to this band before?

719
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:18,138
No.

720
00:37:19,077 --> 00:37:20,258
Allow me to introduce.

721
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:23,777
Rocky Water

722
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:25,538
is an independent music band...

723
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:36,043
(Liang Daiwen)

724
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:00,857
Well...

725
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:02,237
Mr. Xu,

726
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,837
I forgot I'm supposed to meet someone.

727
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:04,897
Can I go now?

728
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:06,417
You seem to be in a rush.

729
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:07,698
Are you meeting the robot?

730
00:38:09,677 --> 00:38:10,738
I'll see you off.

731
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:11,738
Sure.

732
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,817
I'm off, Mr. Xu. Bye.

733
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:19,857
Bye.

734
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:24,397
Sorry,

735
00:38:24,398 --> 00:38:26,258
I'm doing some research with Mr. Xu,

736
00:38:26,398 --> 00:38:28,218
and I forgot our plans.

737
00:38:28,878 --> 00:38:29,578
It's okay.

738
00:38:30,037 --> 00:38:30,837
All I did was driving

739
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:32,258
round and round for a dozen rounds.

740
00:38:32,438 --> 00:38:33,237
I couldn't reach you,

741
00:38:33,238 --> 00:38:34,738
so I'm parking in the basement.

742
00:38:36,677 --> 00:38:39,058
Having an employee like you
is a blessing to your boss.

743
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:41,658
Why are you so sarcastic today?

744
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:50,457
Bye, Mr. Xu.

745
00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:51,618
Bye.

746
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:53,196
Liang Daiwen.

747
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:54,618
Don't be mad.

748
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,018
I'm sorry.

749
00:38:58,117 --> 00:38:59,258
I'm sorry.

750
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:01,658
I'm sorry.

751
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:50,417
Gu Yi.

752
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:52,397
Gu Yi.

753
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:53,337
What?

754
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:54,258
Your phone?

755
00:40:00,074 --> 00:40:02,847
(Meixia the Demon)

756
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,116
Hello, Mom?

757
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:06,897
What is it?

758
00:40:09,278 --> 00:40:10,098
Now?

759
00:40:11,997 --> 00:40:13,297
Just you?

760
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:20,897
Okay, which airport are you at?

761
00:40:23,918 --> 00:40:24,777
Okay.

762
00:40:35,238 --> 00:40:36,178
Liang Daiwen,

763
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,337
I can't go camping with you guys now.

764
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,618
My mom is in Donghai.

765
00:40:40,798 --> 00:40:42,156
She's alone in the airport.

766
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:44,018
I need to pick her up.
She's bad with directions.

767
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:46,058
You...

768
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:48,098
Where are we?

769
00:40:49,798 --> 00:40:51,538
Just drop me off somewhere.

770
00:40:53,557 --> 00:40:56,218
You don't even know where you are,
and you say your mom is bad with directions?

771
00:40:58,238 --> 00:40:59,337
Which airport?

772
00:41:03,637 --> 00:41:04,417
GPS.

773
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,640
(Entrance)

774
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:41,018
You don't have to follow me.

775
00:41:41,037 --> 00:41:42,640
You should join
Guan Xingxin and the others.

776
00:41:42,718 --> 00:41:43,757
When I meet my mom,

777
00:41:43,758 --> 00:41:45,538
I'll just call a cab and bring her home.

778
00:41:46,557 --> 00:41:47,337
We'll see.

779
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:49,738
I didn't bring all my camping equipment,

780
00:41:50,197 --> 00:41:51,138
so I can give it a miss.

781
00:41:51,878 --> 00:41:53,377
What's missing?

782
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:54,658
You.

783
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:56,738
If you're not coming,

784
00:41:57,117 --> 00:41:58,618
I'll have to do double the work.

785
00:42:02,983 --> 00:42:03,996
(Domestic Arrivals)

786
00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:05,698
Why isn't she here yet?

787
00:42:06,637 --> 00:42:07,698
She's not picking up.

788
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:10,297
Didn't she say she'll
meet me at this exit?

789
00:42:11,798 --> 00:42:13,018
Maybe she's waiting for her luggage.

790
00:42:13,918 --> 00:42:14,880
Let's wait a while more.

791
00:42:15,878 --> 00:42:16,618
Over here.

792
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:18,897
Sorry.

793
00:42:19,677 --> 00:42:20,738
I'm okay.

794
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:22,738
Are you alright?

795
00:42:23,077 --> 00:42:24,018
I'm fine.

796
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:30,138
Take a photo and send it to your mom.

797
00:42:30,238 --> 00:42:31,098
Show her where you are.

798
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:33,817
Okay.

799
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,120
(Mum)

800
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:56,297
Hello, Mom?

801
00:42:56,997 --> 00:42:57,817
Gu Yi.

802
00:42:57,878 --> 00:42:59,698
Are you planning to ditch me?

803
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:01,156
I've been waiting for an hour.

804
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:02,658
Where are you?

805
00:43:03,878 --> 00:43:04,596
Where are you?

806
00:43:04,597 --> 00:43:06,497
I'm waiting at the arrivals exit.

807
00:43:11,037 --> 00:43:12,058
It's the wrong airport.

808
00:43:12,597 --> 00:43:13,937
What? What's wrong?

809
00:43:15,197 --> 00:43:16,937
Mom, which airport are you at?

810
00:43:17,197 --> 00:43:18,497
Junyang Airport.

811
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:20,417
Which airport are you at?

812
00:43:20,997 --> 00:43:22,457
Zhaohui Airport.

813
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:26,618
Didn't you say Zhaohui Airport?

814
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:28,636
It's Junyang.

815
00:43:28,637 --> 00:43:30,937
I told you, it's Junyang.

816
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:35,777
She went to the wrong airport.

817
00:43:37,677 --> 00:43:38,538
Well,

818
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:39,658
wait for us.

819
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:41,138
I'm coming.

820
00:43:43,677 --> 00:43:44,457
Let's go.

821
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,098
(Meixia the Demon)
Gu Yi, where are you?

822
00:43:58,157 --> 00:43:59,417
Where are you at?

823
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,058
Have you forgotten
that your mom is waiting?

824
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,723
(Coming.)

825
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:11,317
Yeah, "coming".

826
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:12,076
How much longer?

827
00:44:12,077 --> 00:44:13,457
Are you riding on a wooden horse?

828
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:14,476
Listen,

829
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:15,437
if this were a TV drama,

830
00:44:15,438 --> 00:44:17,218
you'd be missing your mom's funeral!

831
00:44:47,758 --> 00:44:49,098
Liang Daiwen,

832
00:44:49,758 --> 00:44:51,497
you're kind of over the speed limit.

833
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:08,817
Liang Daiwen,

834
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:10,977
you're driving too fast.

835
00:45:13,517 --> 00:45:14,738
Your mom is waiting.

836
00:45:16,157 --> 00:45:17,977
You don't have to drive so fast.

837
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:20,076
She's not that angry.

838
00:45:20,077 --> 00:45:21,538
She just loves to rant.

839
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:22,857
Drive slower.

840
00:45:28,357 --> 00:45:30,636
By the time you reach, even the icy
rivers up north would have melted.

841
00:45:30,637 --> 00:45:31,897
I just booked a hotel room.

842
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,058
Send me your address.

843
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:55,817
Liang Daiwen.

844
00:45:56,997 --> 00:45:58,058
Drive slower.

845
00:46:30,637 --> 00:46:31,977
I don't feel good.

846
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:35,417
Then, let's find a pit stop

847
00:46:35,597 --> 00:46:37,138
