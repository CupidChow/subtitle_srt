(Adapted from Douban Read's work

00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,009
=Episode 22=

25
00:01:58,187 --> 00:01:59,187
Mr. He is here.

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,100
Why didn't you tell me?

27
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:02,307
I could've gone to fetch you.

28
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:03,988
Nonsense, he's about to leave.

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,140
You're leaving already?

30
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:08,587
Go on.

31
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,992
You have a flight to catch, right?

32
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:14,628
Oh, okay.

33
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:16,827
Take care on the way.

34
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:17,867
I will.

35
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:18,707
You two carry on.

36
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:19,867
Yes, sure. Bye-bye, Mr. He.

37
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,188
Okay, be safe.

38
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:21,508
I will.

39
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,147
Alright.

40
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:27,228
Mrs. Meixia.

41
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:29,587
What's up

42
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:30,748
with being all mysterious?

43
00:02:31,228 --> 00:02:32,827
You shoved him out
the moment I came home.

44
00:02:33,147 --> 00:02:34,667
Who's being mysterious?

45
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:35,948
He was about to leave.

46
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,968
He left the things, see?

47
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:38,348
What's that?

48
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:39,448
My health check report.

49
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:40,468
Health check report?

50
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,707
I'm old.

51
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,280
It's not often I get
to come to a big city.

52
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,864
So I grabbed the chance
to check my health.

53
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:49,028
So, is there any problem?

54
00:02:49,147 --> 00:02:49,707
No, I'm fine.

55
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:51,147
Really?

56
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:51,987
Of course.

57
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:56,147
Okay, guess you're pretty smart

58
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:57,827
for getting a health check yourself.

59
00:02:58,028 --> 00:02:58,987
Definitely.

60
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:00,827
Okay, you go on and rest.

61
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,267
I'll go wash up and then sleep.

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,224
Go on then.
Or else you'll start to smell.

63
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:42,908
There will be many big brands
and corporations

64
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:44,547
to cover at the start of the new year.

65
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:46,267
There will be many senior editors

66
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:47,427
doing new media.

67
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:49,028
Art List's official page

68
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,660
has yet to find a suitable writer,

69
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,150
so Gu Yi will handle it
for the time being.

70
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:52,940
Coordinate with Penny

71
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,152
regarding all job arrangements.

72
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,420
For advertising, we've accepted

73
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:57,147
a new company that does events.

74
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:59,267
The client from Hangzhou
will be here in two days.

75
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:01,340
I want everyone to familiarize
yourselves with the info.

76
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:02,468
There could be a focus meeting.

77
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:05,267
As for the job delegations
I previously assigned,

78
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:06,547
they will carry on per usual.

79
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:07,468
Dismissed.

80
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:15,188
That Jacqueline

81
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,428
is not only a workaholic,

82
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:17,387
but also a control freak.

83
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:20,428
You better not be like her.

84
00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:21,944
We're not of the constitution.

85
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,848
I'm not planning
to do any overtime today.

86
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,100
I have a show tonight.

87
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,096
Lovely, I'll go and show support.

88
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:28,707
Zhi can do the work.

89
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:29,628
Sure.

90
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,428
The intern has to work harder.

91
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:32,868
Right.

92
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:51,467
Hello everyone, I am Gu Yi.

93
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:55,188
I grew up

94
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:57,387
in an ordinary family.

95
00:04:57,988 --> 00:04:59,027
But recently, I was offered

96
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:00,428
a high-end job.

97
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:03,499
I was tasked to write
the promo materials

98
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,856
for a residential project overseas.

99
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:06,628
The ad reads,

100
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,707
15 minutes walk from Hyde Park.

101
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:13,108
Experience the culture
of Cambridge University and Oxford.

102
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:15,587
That got me stumped.

103
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:16,948
What did it mean?

104
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:18,548
How am I supposed to promote it?

105
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:21,467
What is so great about the house?

106
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,508
There isn't even a train station nearby.

107
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:25,748
How do people get to work?

108
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,227
I mean,

109
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:29,587
moreover,

110
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:31,147
it wasn't in a school district.

111
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:34,467
The kids are not likely
to go to Cambridge.

112
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:36,027
So what if it's close by?

113
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:39,188
The surrounding amenities
are left wanting.

114
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,027
Lanzhou noodles, Shaxian snacks,
or braised chicken.

115
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:43,907
You should have at least one, right?

116
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:46,347
I'm so annoyed.

117
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,160
Let me share a piece of bad news
with everyone.

118
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:55,267
We...

119
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:59,027
The Ounce stage

120
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:00,668
is coming to an end.

121
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:13,027
Don't cry.

122
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:14,907
It's not closing because of you guys.

123
00:06:20,068 --> 00:06:21,948
It's true that our little club

124
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:23,748
has walked a tough road.

125
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:26,548
The person in charge, Mr. Lu,

126
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,787
often joked about
paying off debts on stage.

127
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:31,068
At first, I thought they were made up.

128
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:32,827
Until one day,

129
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:34,748
he came and asked
to borrow money from me.

130
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:37,628
There's also Yu Dule.

131
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:39,948
When he's not on the stage,

132
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:41,748
he'd be doing odd jobs outside.

133
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:44,907
Most of what he earned was used
on Ounce.

134
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:46,827
He's 30.

135
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:50,387
His only personal asset

136
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:51,787
is an electrical bike.

137
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:55,336
When he confessed his feelings
to his girlfriend,

138
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:56,536
he was immediately rejected.

139
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:57,628
She said,

140
00:06:58,188 --> 00:07:00,387
I'm worried you might sell me off
to save Ounce.

141
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:05,108
As for me? What's more to say?

142
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:06,508
I don't have any money.

143
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:07,748
I don't have a lover.

144
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:09,860
Now, I can't even do
stand-up comedy anymore.

145
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:11,899
I have a day job

146
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,784
all for the sake of finding inspiration
for the show.

147
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,672
Although I've found inspiration,

148
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:17,147
there is no stage.

149
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:27,108
But not having a stage is fine.

150
00:07:27,868 --> 00:07:28,787
Because I still have you guys.

151
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:35,428
But what good do you guys bring?

152
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:38,548
Alright.

153
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:41,467
I'm not trying to buy your sympathy.

154
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:43,868
I just wanted to bid farewell

155
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:44,948
in a witty way.

156
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:47,668
I wish everyone happiness.

157
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:50,467
And I hope you'll have a wonderful night

158
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:53,387
even if it's not at Ounce.

159
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:55,068
Thanks.

160
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:07,628
Thank you all.

161
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:49,428
Just cry if you want to.

162
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:52,328
Haven't we gotten drenched
in a fountain together?

163
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:53,912
You don't have
to feel embarrassed with me.

164
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,107
I performed at Ounce for five years.

165
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,707
Today, it suddenly went bust.

166
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:10,856
I won't be able to do
stand-up comedy anymore.

167
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:12,707
That's okay.

168
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:14,540
Even if you stopped
doing stand-up comedy,

169
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:15,507
in my heart,

170
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:17,188
you're still shining brightly.

171
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:21,308
Thanks, Mr. Xu.

172
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:22,548
What?

173
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:24,107
Are you friend-zoning me right now?

174
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:25,948
I'm not.

175
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:30,627
I just sincerely want to thank you.

176
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:34,388
Thanks for being by my side
this whole time,

177
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:35,948
chatting with me,

178
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:38,388
and doing silly things with me.

179
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:43,340
You don't have to say thanks.

180
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,747
If you really want to thank me,

181
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:49,867
then be my girlfriend.

182
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:58,308
I'm not going to give you time to think.

183
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:00,827
Because if you think too much,

184
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:02,347
you'll probably say no.

185
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:06,632
I don't want to take the risk.

186
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:09,268
So,

187
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:10,587
I'll be blunt

188
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:13,068
and say this outright.

189
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:15,188
Gu Yi.

190
00:10:16,668 --> 00:10:17,747
Will you be my girlfriend?

191
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:27,268
No.

193
00:10:46,493 --> 00:10:49,920
♪The dark sky lights up♪

♪How could I ever let you fall so fast?♪

♪Though there are twists and turns♪

196
00:10:58,188 --> 00:10:58,987
No, she can't.

197

♪The glow shines brightly♪

198
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:11,680
♪Because love truly exists♪

199
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:16,827
Why are you here?

200
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:19,747
I'm back.

201
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:21,627
You can't accept his feelings.

202
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:25,507
So you're back

203
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:27,240
and somehow you thought of me again.

204
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,428
Liang Daiwen.

205
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:32,948
You're the one who pushed me away.

206
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:34,627
You're the one who left without a word.

207
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,707
Now, you suddenly turn up.

208
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:39,428
How can you be so thoughtless?

209
00:11:39,428 --> 00:11:41,308
Did I give you
an immunity card or something?

210
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:45,388
Gu Yi.

211
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:47,587
I came back because of you.

212
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:48,587
That's enough.

213
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:52,068
Did you forget what I said
at the airport?

214
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:53,960
I don't ever want to see you again.

215
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:55,908
Gu Yi.

216
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,827
You come and go as you please.

217
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,860
I've been keeping watch over Gu Yi
during this time

218
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:03,740
not so you could come back
and ruin everything.

219
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:08,467
I can feel some things now.

220
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:09,428
It's not much,

221
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,268
but I can differentiate basic emotions.

222
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:14,120
The first thing I did
after coming back

223
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:15,827
was to come and find you.

224
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:19,227
Gu Yi, I'd like...

225
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:20,028
Liang Daiwen.

226
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:25,428
Snacks will expire
if you leave it out for too long.

227
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,948
What made you think
that human affection won't change?

228
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:39,467
It's your own business
if you wish to stay in the past.

229
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:43,620
But I'm not obliged to wait for you
in the same place.

230
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:33,388
What's wrong?

231
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:34,968
Did someone steal your soul?

232
00:13:39,908 --> 00:13:40,987
I'm writing a proposal, Mom.

233
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,840
(Two, Compensation amount)

234
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,407
(Three, Dispute resolution)

235
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,818
(The amount of compensation
is 1,200,000 yuan)

236
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,840
(HF Design Company, HR Department)

237
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,830

of contract by designer Liang Daiwen)

238
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,080

None of it is needed, thank you)

(Madam Meixia)

244
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:22,028
Hello, Mdm. Wang.

245
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:23,827
Hey, Liang.

246
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:25,347
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

247
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:28,548
Are you at home?

248
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:30,068
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,507
I just came back to Donghai.

250
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:33,308
What a coincidence. I just got back too.

251
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:34,668
Umm,

252
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:36,788
can we set a time to meet up?

253
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:38,587
Sure.

254
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:43,707
Is Gu Yi...

255
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:45,347
doing alright?

256
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:49,388
I'm not going to intrude
on you two's affairs.

257
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:51,308
The fact is,

258
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:52,948
Gu Yi stayed at your house
for some time.

259
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,507
You even vacated your room
when I went to visit.

260
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,788
It's only right for us
to return the kindness.

261
00:15:58,347 --> 00:15:58,707
Am I right?

262
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:01,428
You're welcome, ma'am.

263
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:03,308
Feel free to drop by any time.

264
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:05,668
Alright.

265
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,336
By the way,

266
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:08,827
don't tell Gu Yi anything.

267
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:12,068
Okay.

268
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:57,347
Yi.

269
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:58,600
I've been made permanent.

270
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:00,068
Congratulations.

271
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,208
I'll buy you coffee tomorrow.

272
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,024
Thank you.

273
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:04,547
Right, Yi.

274
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:06,108
What do permanent employees do?

275
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:07,747
Nothing much.

276
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:10,619
That is, planning,
proposing, interviewing,

277
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,896
writing, revising, taking the blame,

278
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:13,560
communicating, designing,
connecting with customers,

279
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,700
pleasing the client, and being
mentally controlled by the boss.

280
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:18,188
In conclusion, if the boss points left,
you can't go right.

281
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:19,787
Whatever the boss says, you do.

282
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:22,507
Why does it feel like I've sold my soul?

283
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:25,787
Good luck.

284
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:26,948
I have an appointment,

285
00:17:27,388 --> 00:17:28,547
to sell my soul.

286
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:33,428
Sell my soul...

287
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,113
(Goodie Design)

288
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:57,908
My business partner has mobility issues

289
00:17:58,307 --> 00:17:59,267
so he requires an assistant.

290
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:02,828
I see that
you studied design at Harvard.

291
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,108
Are you sure you want this job?

292
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,507
Does my resume not fit the criteria?

293
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:11,828
My education, language
and drawing skills?

294
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,668
You're well-qualified.

295
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:15,188
But as you can see,

296
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:16,987
this is a small company.

297
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,868
There won't be any progression for you.

298
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:21,428
I see it.

299
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:23,707
So, am I hired?

300
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:33,467
Okay.

301
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,528
The partner will arrive in two days.

302
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,792
You can pick your desk first.

303
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:38,348
Okay.

304
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:46,707
Daiwen.

305
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,747
What a cute hobby you have.

306
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:50,568
It totally doesn't match your vibe.

307
00:18:50,707 --> 00:18:51,348
Can I have it?

308
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:53,388
Please put it down.

309
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,227
Come on.

310
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:57,467
What a cheapskate.

311
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:05,227
You seem to treasure it.

312
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:07,032
Gift from your girlfriend?

313
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:10,868
Is that related to work?

314
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,547
The way you talk to women,

315
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:16,264
I wonder if you can woo
the girl you like.

316
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:21,148
I could tell right away
you're no good with women.

317
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:23,348
Let me guess.

318
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,588
Was she the one to make the first move

319
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:27,868
but you kept turning her down?

320
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:30,108
So now she's lost heart,

321
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:31,267
but you want her back.

322
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:34,388
Tell me.

323
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:35,628
I'm a woman too.

324
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:36,868
Who knows, maybe I can help you.

325
00:19:45,628 --> 00:19:47,027
It was given by someone I like.

326
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:49,108
But maybe...

327
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:51,987
Maybe it's due to my personality.

328
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:54,027
She's really mad at me right now.

329
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,148
Got it.

330
00:19:58,588 --> 00:19:59,868
I can help you win her back.

331
00:20:00,828 --> 00:20:01,828
On one condition.

332
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,388
If she explicitly rejects you,

333
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,307
then would you consider dating me?

334
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:14,267
My methods are fail-proof.

335
00:20:16,628 --> 00:20:18,188
Tell me, how are you going to help?

336
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:21,747
Cater to her preferences.

337
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:23,588
Do you use TikTok?

Seriously,

what does the song even mean?

343
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:02,948
I don't get it at all.

344
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,840
You don't have to get it.

345
00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:06,108
This is the edgy oriental style

346
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:08,067
popular with youngsters these days.

347
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:09,948
It's a debut custom-made

348
00:21:09,948 --> 00:21:10,987
for your girlfriend's debut.

349
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:13,560
I can't wait to record
the voice of the imperial lady.

350
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:14,628
When can we formally start?

351
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:16,067
Do I have to sign the contract first?

352
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:18,067
Xu Guanrui is busy visiting
the sites these days.

353
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:19,948
Familiarize yourself
with the demo first.

354
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:21,547
Once the groundwork is ready,

355
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,552
he'll talk to you in detail.

356
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:25,507
Thanks, Ms. Gu.

357
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,048
Let me tell you guys something.

358
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:40,148
Liang Daiwen is back.

359
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:45,428
You met him? How did it go?

360
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:47,188
How did it go?

361
00:21:47,628 --> 00:21:48,908
You knew he came back?

362
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:51,707
I was the one who told him
you were at Ounce.

363
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,108
He went straight there from the airport.

364
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:56,027
Where did you two meet?

365
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:57,707
At the back entrance.

366
00:21:59,227 --> 00:22:01,428
While Xu Guanrui was confessing
his feelings to me...

367
00:22:04,027 --> 00:22:05,267
My gosh, Gu Yi.

368
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:07,507
You better not be too ruthless.

369
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:10,787
Our dear Liang is just a baby humanoid.

370
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:13,547
So did the baby humanoid

371
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:14,868
come back from abroad

372
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:17,067
to propose to Ms. Gu?

373
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:20,027
That I don't know.

374
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,507
All I know is that Liang came back

375
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,868
the moment he wrapped up his job there.

376
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:26,020
He didn't finish the counseling therapy.

377
00:22:26,948 --> 00:22:30,108
Shen said it's because he has anxiety
from being away from Gu Yi.

378
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,148
What did he say to you?

379
00:22:37,828 --> 00:22:38,348
Ms. Gu.

380
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:40,188
As a friend,

381
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:41,747
I have a duty to remind you.

382
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,027
You almost died
from the fever that time.

383
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:46,828
So, better to be cautious
when reversing.

384
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:49,428
Can you have more faith in me?

385
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:52,148
Am I the kind of woman
who revolves around Liang Daiwen?

386
00:22:52,148 --> 00:22:53,507
But that's exactly what you are.

387
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:06,747
Who is it?

388
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:10,908
It's Liang.

389
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:13,148
Just read it.

390
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:15,148
Even the accused has a chance
to defend himself.

391
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:32,668
Is he cosplaying?

392
00:23:34,388 --> 00:23:37,348
Seems like Liang's had an epiphany
after the system update.

393
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:39,707
This is VIP-locked content.

394
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:41,227
Forward it to me.

395
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:43,588
What VIP?

396
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:45,067
Looks more like harassment to me.

397
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:46,507
It's okay, I'll delete it for you.

398
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:49,507
No need, I can do it myself.

399
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:52,787
I have to make a move first.

400
00:23:52,868 --> 00:23:53,219
Okay.

401
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,832
You guys chat.

402
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:54,787
Remember to delete it.

403
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,227
For sure.

404
00:23:56,948 --> 00:23:57,699
Bye-bye.

405
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,344
"For sure" my foot.

406
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,700
I know better.

407
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,448
I bet she'll save it in her hard drive

408
00:24:01,448 --> 00:24:02,456

434

Mdm. Wang.

435
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:38,668
Come on.

436
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:48,227
Here.

437
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:49,668
Let us eat.

438
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:55,987
I didn't know what you liked,

439
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:57,348
so I cooked what Gu Yi prefers.

440
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:58,747
These are the dishes.

441
00:26:59,588 --> 00:26:59,987
Dig in.

442
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:04,428
Thanks, ma'am.

443
00:27:05,668 --> 00:27:06,188
Eat up.

444
00:27:07,547 --> 00:27:08,148
Try it.

445
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:20,388
How is it?

446
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:24,747
Not to your taste?

447
00:27:28,388 --> 00:27:28,908
No.

448
00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:33,148
My mom cooked this dish before.

449
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,067
But it wasn't as good as yours.

450
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:38,868
You annoying boy.

451
00:27:39,828 --> 00:27:40,628
When you're comparing

452
00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:42,188
your mom to other moms,

453
00:27:43,188 --> 00:27:44,668
you should praise your own mom.

454
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:51,388
My mom was wheelchair-bound.

455
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,628
She rarely cooked for me,

456
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,507
so she wasn't very good.

457
00:27:57,428 --> 00:27:59,067
She passed away when I was young.

458
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:01,747
I was immature then.

459
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:05,016
I should've complimented her
on her cooking.

460
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:14,108
Liang,

461
00:28:15,148 --> 00:28:16,188
have you ever told Gu Yi

462
00:28:16,348 --> 00:28:17,348
about your family?

463
00:28:20,507 --> 00:28:21,267
A little bit,

464
00:28:23,348 --> 00:28:24,027
not much.

465
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,720
Why didn't you tell her?

466
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:30,227
Is it because she might not get it,

467
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:31,908
or you feel there's no need to tell her?

468
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,628
I'm a mother myself.

469
00:28:40,507 --> 00:28:42,428
When I see Gu Yi hurt because of you,

470
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,067
in all honesty, I feel even worse.

471
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:47,019
When I saw your face just now,

472
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,520
I had wanted so much to reprimand you.

473
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:52,027
But after hearing what you just said,

474
00:28:52,668 --> 00:28:55,067
I don't think you're an immature child.

475
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:58,948
I'm sure you have your reason
to not tell her.

476
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,328
But Gu Yi wouldn't know it
if you didn't tell her.

477
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:04,948
When two persons come together

478
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:06,547
and you don't talk or communicate,

479
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,428
that's how misunderstandings arise.

480
00:29:09,507 --> 00:29:11,908
Am I right? Why do we have mouths?

481
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:12,948
So we can talk.

482
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:15,220
Otherwise, what's the use of the mouth?

483
00:29:15,307 --> 00:29:16,188
Might as well donate it.

484
00:29:20,707 --> 00:29:21,828
I know my mistake, ma'am.

485
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:24,307
But my feelings for Gu Yi are true.

486
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:34,428
Just be honest with me.

487
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:36,467
What's your deal?

488
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:38,507
How did you fall into Gu Yi's hands?

489
00:29:44,747 --> 00:29:46,707
Is alexithymia considered a problem?

490
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,824
What does that mean?

491
00:29:51,348 --> 00:29:53,787
Simply put, it's a lack of emotion,

492
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,912
unable to express oneself properly.

493
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:59,208
It gives off a feeling of indifference,

494
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:00,348
as if

495
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:02,908
it's a robot without emotions.

496
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:06,267
After my mom passed away,

497
00:30:06,428 --> 00:30:07,267
I became this way.

498
00:30:08,868 --> 00:30:09,787
But don't worry.

499
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:12,408
I've been undergoing treatment
diligently for the past years.

500
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:14,188
I'm getting better.

501
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:28,628
After your mom passed,

502
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,188
you must have suffered a lot.

503
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:39,828
Alright, don't feel down.

504
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,664
Your birth mother may be gone,

505
00:30:44,507 --> 00:30:45,348
but this mother is here.

506
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:51,948
Ma'am,

507
00:30:53,307 --> 00:30:54,227
are you okay with it?

508
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:57,668
It's fine with me.

509
00:30:58,108 --> 00:30:59,348
As long as Gu Yi wants it,

510
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:01,307
I'm fine with anything.

511
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:06,948
Okay.

512
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,632
Pick up your chopsticks.

513
00:31:09,588 --> 00:31:10,828
Eat more.

514
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:13,707
But, ma'am...

515
00:31:14,428 --> 00:31:15,588
Gu Yi doesn't want it.

516
00:31:16,747 --> 00:31:17,267
She...

517
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:18,987
is still angry with me.

518
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:22,908
I don't blame her.

519
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:24,868
Let's be real.

520
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:27,388
On this matter,
you are the one at fault.

521
00:31:28,108 --> 00:31:29,227
I'm not biased.

522
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:35,668
Alright,

523
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:36,668
go ahead and eat.

524
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:41,067
Eat up.

525
00:32:05,027 --> 00:32:05,467
Speak.

526
00:32:07,148 --> 00:32:08,307
Why did you suddenly come back?

527
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:12,707
Speak.

528
00:32:13,908 --> 00:32:14,828
Are you running away again?

529
00:32:15,547 --> 00:32:16,507
Going abroad again?

530
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:24,428
Liang Daiwen.

531
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:28,707
This time,

532
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:31,668
are you being serious?

533
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:53,067
The virtual band performance this time

534
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:55,027
is going to smash what we know

535
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:56,588
about traditional band performances.

536
00:32:56,747 --> 00:32:59,507
Especially how the audience
can experience it offline,

537
00:32:59,507 --> 00:33:00,428
making them center stage.

538
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:02,908
As for items

539
00:33:02,908 --> 00:33:03,987
like virtual reality glasses

540
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,868
and tablet computers,

541
00:33:05,908 --> 00:33:07,148
I think we need

542
00:33:07,348 --> 00:33:09,428
to discuss them with the advertisers.

543
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:11,948
Offline advertising has always
been done independently.

544
00:33:12,307 --> 00:33:13,307
The budget this time

545
00:33:13,348 --> 00:33:15,108
will be included
in the annual PR budget.

546
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,868
The job of inviting

547
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:19,227
local virtual bands to participate
in the event

548
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:20,267
will be handled by Xu Guanrui.

549
00:33:21,348 --> 00:33:22,908
Once the bands sign the contract,

550
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,348
the editorial will be released
using interviews.

551
00:33:26,227 --> 00:33:26,828
Take note.

552
00:33:27,348 --> 00:33:28,227
The interviews

553
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:30,027
should not use virtual bands

554
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:31,307
as a gimmick.

555
00:33:31,787 --> 00:33:33,868
What we want is in-depth content.

556
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:36,179
The bands' performance format

557
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,224
after going virtual...

558
00:33:37,256 --> 00:33:38,340
I'm going to get the coffee.

559
00:33:38,388 --> 00:33:39,747
Will change a lot.

560
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:42,588
We'll need to pay close attention

561
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:43,428
to the data

562
00:33:43,428 --> 00:33:44,707
on the online fan growth rate

563
00:33:44,707 --> 00:33:46,027
during the online streaming.

564
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,120
Make sure you check with the advertisers

565
00:33:48,168 --> 00:33:49,020
on the increase of fans.

566
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:49,467
Gu Yi.

567
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:50,067
Thanks.

568
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:51,588
There have to be clear divisions.

569
00:33:51,588 --> 00:33:52,348
Just two?

570
00:33:53,027 --> 00:33:54,547
There's a message. Hold on.

571
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,976
Liaise with the advertisers.

572
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:56,504
Gu Yi.

573
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:58,707
One is watermelon.

574
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:00,547
One is honeydew melon.

575
00:34:00,868 --> 00:34:02,828
You are my dumb, little melon.

576
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:11,620
As for traditional
media advertising...

577
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:14,467
Liang Daiwen.

578
00:34:24,547 --> 00:34:25,147
Gu Yi.

579
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:26,308
One is pork.

580
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:27,507
One is beef.

581
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:28,388
You are my...

582
00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:30,228
my heart.

583
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:31,107
Gu Yi.

584
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:32,828
This one is omelet rice.

585
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:34,467
This one is egg-fried rice.

586
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:35,908
You are the...

587
00:34:36,547 --> 00:34:37,948
fried egg that completes my rice.

588
00:34:38,428 --> 00:34:39,268
This is mashed potato.

589
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:40,627
This is sweet corn.

590
00:34:41,187 --> 00:34:42,228
Don't forget that I love you.

591
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,700
(Gu Yi calling)

592
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:18,107
Liang Daiwen.

593
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:19,507
Are you trying to be funny?

594
00:35:21,268 --> 00:35:21,948
What did I do?

595
00:35:22,147 --> 00:35:23,147
What did you do?

596
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:25,948
First, stop sending me takeouts.

597
00:35:26,987 --> 00:35:28,308
Now, how come I've never noticed

598
00:35:28,308 --> 00:35:29,308
how thick-skinned you are.

599
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:31,348
I just wanted to get you snacks.

600
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:33,467
I couldn't send them to your house

601
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:34,908
because it's rude.

602
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:36,268
Is it not rude

603
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:38,027
to spew cringe adulation
in the office then?

604
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:38,828
Bro,

605
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:41,467
we were having a meeting
with the client.

606
00:35:42,388 --> 00:35:43,268
Stop eating.

607
00:35:44,424 --> 00:35:46,552
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you were in a meeting.

608
00:35:48,507 --> 00:35:49,948
It's because you were ignoring me.

609
00:35:50,587 --> 00:35:51,547
Yeah, sure.

610
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,216
Are you unhinged because
you just recovered from a grave illness?

611
00:35:56,547 --> 00:35:57,507
I'm not sick.

612
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:59,348
Alexithymia is just a personality type.

613
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:01,587
You want me to leave you?

614
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:03,748
I can't do it.

615
00:36:04,147 --> 00:36:06,428
Just shut your mouth.

616
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:08,428
One more word
and I'm going to block you.

617
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:10,248
I'll shut up after one more sentence.

618
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:13,948
Can I...

619
00:36:16,828 --> 00:36:17,748
Can I go and see you?

620
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:18,667
No, you can't.

621
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:23,788
Send me your address. I'll go to you.

622
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:28,467
Zhi, you.

623
00:36:28,868 --> 00:36:29,908
Spit it out. Spit it out!

624
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:31,187
I'm giving all these back.

625
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,240
(Goodie Design)

626
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:29,416
I'm returning everything as is.

627
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:30,440
No more next time.

628
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:30,948
I'm off.

629
00:37:31,987 --> 00:37:32,788
Gu Yi.

630
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,740
Why won't you reply to my texts
and even block me?

631
00:37:39,348 --> 00:37:40,107
You won't see me,

632
00:37:40,627 --> 00:37:41,708
and you're being so cold.

633
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,748
I'm just treating you
how you treated me before.

634
00:37:47,388 --> 00:37:47,828
Why?

635
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:48,908
Feels bad?

636
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:57,868
What can I do to make you forgive me?

637
00:37:58,788 --> 00:37:59,788
I promise I'll do it.

638
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:02,107
Gu Yi.

639
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:04,748
As long as you don't ignore me,

640
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:06,467
I'm willing to do anything.

641
00:38:35,987 --> 00:38:36,667
Daiwen,

642
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:37,748
did you change the screen...

643
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:52,587
Daiwen.

644
00:38:53,507 --> 00:38:54,828
Is this the girl you fancy?

645
00:38:55,547 --> 00:38:55,868
Yes.

646
00:38:58,948 --> 00:39:00,308
She is the studio's new assistant.

647
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,944
She just came back from Harvard.

648
00:39:04,187 --> 00:39:05,308
A graduate from Harvard

649
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:07,147
has to start
from the assistant position too?

650
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:09,228
To be honest,

651
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:10,147
there are better offers.

652
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:12,348
But I'm only interested in Liang Daiwen.

653
00:39:12,504 --> 00:39:14,072
Since I'm not strapped for money,

654
00:39:14,088 --> 00:39:15,672
I'm fine with being the assistant.

655
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:20,936
You don't have to look at him.

656
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:22,828
I told him honestly
during the interview.

657
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:24,667
But he only has eyes for you.

658
00:39:25,627 --> 00:39:27,107
I don't care for fickle-minded men.

659
00:39:27,987 --> 00:39:29,027
So for the sake of efficiency,

660
00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:31,067
I agreed to help him win you back.

661
00:39:31,587 --> 00:39:32,547
But if you don't agree,

662
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,420
I'm going to start
a relationship with him.

663
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,432
I didn't agree with that.

664
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,067
Whatever you two have agreed on,

665
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,024
I don't care.

666
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:44,428
But Liang Daiwen
is not a bargaining chip.

667
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:46,948
Also, we will handle our own matters.

668
00:39:47,547 --> 00:39:48,987
I'm not giving up on him either.

669
00:39:50,987 --> 00:39:51,627
Gu Yi.

670
00:39:53,948 --> 00:39:54,908
Daiwen.

671
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,792
No need to see me out.

672
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:57,388
See you.

673
00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:05,348
Did she say...

674
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:08,348
she isn't giving up on me?

675
00:40:11,948 --> 00:40:12,987
Does that mean...

676
00:40:14,507 --> 00:40:15,348
she still likes me?

677
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:17,748
Maybe.

678
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:27,587
Let's go.

679
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:29,748
This is for you. Just take it.

680
00:40:29,788 --> 00:40:30,828
I don't want your money.

681
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:31,987
I have money.

682
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:35,908
Just take it.

683
00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:36,908
I don't want your money.

684
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:38,667
I have money. Just keep it for yourself.

685
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:39,948
What's the fuss?

686
00:40:41,788 --> 00:40:43,868
Mr. He, I thought you went back.

687
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:45,699
It's cold outside.

688
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,112
Why are you two
having a date at the door?

689
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:47,928
You annoying girl!

690
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:49,667
Okay.

691
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:50,987
Let me talk to He alone.

692
00:40:51,228 --> 00:40:51,868
You go ahead.

693
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:53,828
You two can talk inside.

694
00:40:53,908 --> 00:40:54,908
What are you, underage lovers?

695
00:40:55,308 --> 00:40:56,708
Just go in.

696
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:57,187
Okay, okay.

697
00:40:57,348 --> 00:40:58,748
Mr. He, come up for a chat, okay?

698
00:40:59,027 --> 00:40:59,467
Okay.

699
00:40:59,547 --> 00:41:00,348
Whoopee!

700
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:08,708
You can't keep it from her for long.

701
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,908
When she finds out later...

702
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:15,748
It's not the right time.

703
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:18,067
Okay, you should go.

704
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:20,748
Go on.

705
00:41:35,555 --> 00:41:36,336
(Gu Yi's preferences)

706
00:41:36,337 --> 00:41:37,948
(Feed her: Returned)
Eat.

707
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:39,661
(Go for drinks: Low alcohol tolerance)
Drink.

708
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:41,360
(Go out and play: She's still angry)
Play.

709
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:42,920
(Stand-up comedy: Ounce closed down)
Fun.

710
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,868
(Provocation: Bury her with money)

711
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:45,627
Provocation.

712
00:41:46,348 --> 00:41:47,268
Bury her with money?

713
00:41:54,828 --> 00:41:56,308
What children's essay are you writing?

714
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,048
You said I should cater
to her preferences.

715
00:41:59,348 --> 00:42:00,147
So I'm planning how.

716
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:02,868
Boss,

717
00:42:03,348 --> 00:42:05,467
have you heard of Sternberg's
theory of love?

718
00:42:06,187 --> 00:42:07,507
There are three components to love,

719
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:09,187
passion, intimacy and commitment.

720
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,268
Passion is in the first place.

721
00:42:12,467 --> 00:42:14,507
Do you know when a man
with a self-abstinence buff

722
00:42:14,507 --> 00:42:15,708
is most attractive?

723
00:42:16,547 --> 00:42:18,828
It's when you unleash
your primal hormones.

724
00:42:19,547 --> 00:42:20,467
Be wild.

725
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,467
Be sexy.

726
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:25,220
I don't think that's a good idea.

727
00:42:26,187 --> 00:42:26,507
Okay.

728
00:42:26,948 --> 00:42:27,868
Then you take your time.

729
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:30,187
Wait three to five years
for her to cool down,

730
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:31,748
then you guys can live

731
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:32,788
happily ever after.

732
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:34,388
That is

733
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:35,828
if she hasn't been
taken by someone else.

734
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:44,027
Do you have any better ideas then?

735
00:42:46,027 --> 00:42:47,428
Gu Yi, what's going on over there?

736
00:42:48,507 --> 00:42:49,627
I'm doing the laundry.

737
00:42:50,187 --> 00:42:50,868
What's up?

738
00:42:51,032 --> 00:42:53,420
Liang's studio will give its
first round of presentations tomorrow.

739
00:42:53,547 --> 00:42:55,428
They asked for our attendance,
so you have to go.

740
00:42:57,268 --> 00:42:59,547
You can stop creating chances for us.

741
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,832
He'll be fine with one less admirer.

742
00:43:02,187 --> 00:43:02,828
You jest.

743
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,147
Liang is serious.

744
00:43:04,388 --> 00:43:05,428
He wants you.

745
00:43:05,987 --> 00:43:08,228
Well, he sure underwent a huge change.

746
00:43:08,788 --> 00:43:11,228
Now he's become more sensitive,

747
00:43:11,627 --> 00:43:13,348
and able to emote better.

748
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:16,059
When I first met him,

749
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,304
he was like a primary school kid.

750
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:19,147
Now he's at least middle school level.

751
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,667
Perhaps he'll be a professor
soon enough.

752
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:24,708
Liang finally evolved into a new version

753
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:25,587
and you're complaining?

754
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:26,920
Are you a masochist or something?

755
00:43:28,348 --> 00:43:31,228
It doesn't matter to me
what version he has become.

756
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,467
I've long moved on.

757
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:34,547
Okay then.

758
00:43:34,948 --> 00:43:35,788
I have to stream now.

759
00:43:36,308 --> 00:43:37,788
If you've really moved on,

760
00:43:37,788 --> 00:43:38,667
then you should

761
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:41,027
set things straight with Liang.

762
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:42,779
If things drag on like this,

763
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,296
you might even lose him as a friend.

764
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,672
I'm sure you don't want that, right?

765
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:58,868
This person who called me shameless.

766
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:01,147
I checked out your page just now.

767
00:44:02,428 --> 00:44:03,948
Why does a young guy
detest women so much?

768
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,587
Didn't your family educate you?

769
00:44:06,828 --> 00:44:07,268
Also,

770
00:44:08,107 --> 00:44:10,388
you wondered how I got a boyfriend
with such an ugly face.

771
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:11,708
Even Internet trolls like you

772
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:12,948
are given identification cards.

773
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,432
Society nowadays is compassionate.

774
00:44:15,788 --> 00:44:16,667
But I'm not your family,

775
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,088
so I don't have to coddle you.

776
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,308
I'll consider teaching you a lesson

777
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,384
on behalf of your family
as doing charity.

778
00:44:24,147 --> 00:44:25,467
Just because you're behind the screen,

779
00:44:25,544 --> 00:44:27,352
doesn't mean you get
to criticize others.

780
00:44:27,788 --> 00:44:28,587
Xin.

781
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:31,748
Xin.

782
00:44:33,748 --> 00:44:34,748
You are...

783
00:44:35,224 --> 00:44:36,940
Count yourself lucky
that it's me you met.

784
00:44:37,547 --> 00:44:38,748
I don't keep scores with trolls,

785
00:44:38,748 --> 00:44:39,467
you know that right?

786
00:44:39,828 --> 00:44:40,308
Unless you...

787
00:44:40,987 --> 00:44:41,547
are...

788
00:44:42,748 --> 00:44:43,428
Where is Xin?

789
00:44:44,828 --> 00:44:46,067
Who are you guys?

790
00:44:48,067 --> 00:44:48,868
I'm her mother.

791
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:58,587
Dad.

792
00:44:59,748 --> 00:45:00,308
Mom.

793
00:45:01,107 --> 00:45:01,987
What are you doing here?

794
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:06,908
Mom's missed you.

795
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:09,107
We decided to drop by
since we have a break.

796
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:16,627
Hello, sir, ma'am.

797
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:18,708
I am Xin's boyfriend.

798
00:45:19,147 --> 00:45:19,948
My name is Yu Dule.

799
00:45:20,828 --> 00:45:22,547
I didn't know you guys were coming,

800
00:45:22,547 --> 00:45:24,228
so I didn't prepare anything.

801
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:33,187
Xin,

802
00:45:33,256 --> 00:45:34,824
please ask the outsider to step away.

803
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,448
I want to talk to you in private.

804
00:45:44,948 --> 00:45:46,268
Okay, I'll step outside.

805
00:45:46,507 --> 00:45:47,547
You guys go ahead.
