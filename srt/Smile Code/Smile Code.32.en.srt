(from a friend.)

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,699
(Their fans are bought.)

29
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:54,059
(They don't even have a real
operations team,)

30
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:57,180
(a fake out wanting
to make a fast buck.)

31
00:01:57,779 --> 00:01:58,540
(You must be careful)

32
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,699
(about signing the contract.)

00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:02,460
(Especially if Liu Ran
says things like,)

35
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,260
(I'll sign someone else
if you won't do it now.)

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,419
(Do not fall for such crap.)

37
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,980
Mr. Liu,

38
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,419
I'm at the office's door right now.

39
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,288
Where are you?

40
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,019
Didn't we agree to meet?

41
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:29,139
Apologies, Ms. Gu.

42
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,060
I had a last-minute appointment come up.

43
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,220
Is it urgent?

44
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,019
We can talk over the phone.

45
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,060
But we agreed to talk face-to-face.

46
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,739
Anyway,

47
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:42,060
in the contract, it states

48
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,619
that I'd have four chances to perform
each month.

49
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:45,780
I'd like to ask,

50
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,660
what kind of shows are we talking about?

51
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,312
Could you provide me with
some references?

52
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,500
Oh, it's a little hard to explain here.

53
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,820
There are many types
of commercial performances.

54
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,459
The company will delegate as necessary.

55
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,299
If it's not for commercial purposes,

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,859
we'll do our best to arrange
for tryouts.

57
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,260
When the popularity goes up,

58
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,899
that's how we'll attract
more partnerships.

59
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:07,699
Don't you all

60
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,220
have a fixed fan base?

61
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:12,540
Ms. Gu,

62
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,899
we're just a middle-man platform.

63
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:16,179
When the artist becomes known,

64
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,739
the platform gains popularity with it.

65
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,699
You share half the responsibility

66
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,459
in whether or not
we have a fixed fan base.

67
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,540
I...

68
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,820
I have to share responsibility?

69
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,459
I checked your company's website

70
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,820
and it's as good as dead!

71
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,220
What am I supposed to do?

72
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,540
Conjure traffic out of nowhere?

73
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,139
I can at least get 200 doing side gigs.

74
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,260
This is worse than doing a gig.

75
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,980
You can still make money doing shows.

76
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,100
Promote yourself

77
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,380
through your own socials.

78
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:45,380
After all,

79
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,500
an artist who has enough experience
under their belt

80
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,380
needs to build their own traffic.

81
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:52,459
Ms. Gu,

82
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,179
we're not stopping you from performing.

83
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:57,739
But it's stated in our contract.

84
00:03:58,179 --> 00:04:00,579
All performances
have to go through the company.

85
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,299
This is so that I can better establish

86
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,859
a connection with the client.

87
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,260
How is this any different

88
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,139
from a scam?

89
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,660
How could you think like that?

90
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,260
We're all working towards the same goal.

91
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,419
Why must you victimize yourself?

92
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,140
A signed artist

93
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:20,700
should put in a little effort
for the company, no?

94
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:22,100
If no one wants to do anything,

95
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,499
how will the company grow?

96
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,819
Okay, fine.

97
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:26,819
I won't argue with you.

98
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,580
Just answer me one thing.

99
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,100
If I accept a job without
going through the company,

100
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,208
what will happen?

101
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,460
Well, that's a breach of contract.

102
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,660
And the consequence?

103
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,100
According to the contract,

104
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:43,100
you'll be banned worldwide.

105
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,619
Gu Yi.

106
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:06,220
Liang Daiwen.

107
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:08,179
If you do that again,

108
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:09,340
I'm going to remove the camera.

109
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,700
Where were you?

110
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:11,540
It's very late.

111
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,179
I've been looking for you.

112
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,780
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

113
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,939
I called Yu Dule
but he had no idea either.

114
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,780
From my limited deductions,

115
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:32,900
you're definitely
in some sort of trouble.

116
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:34,499
And,

117
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,700
it's the kind you won't tell me about.

118
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,140
Otherwise, you wouldn't be so sneaky.

119
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,499
Who's sneaky?

120
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:44,939
Did something go wrong
with the Worry Free contract?

121
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,179
Be honest.

122
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,299
Did you sign the contract

123
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:49,100
with Worry Free?

124
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:50,100
I didn't.

125
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,299
No?

126
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,340
Gu Yi.

127
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,859
Look at me.

128
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,100
Okay.

129
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:05,140
I know you cautioned me about it.

130
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,100
But I got impatient
and signed it anyway.

131
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:11,780
And I think I got scammed.

132
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,460
I'm not surprised.

133
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,299
Do you want to hear a good response

134
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,700
or a bad one?

135
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,819
You don't have to say anything.

136
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,939
I'll take care of this myself.

137
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:23,580
Even if I got scammed,

138
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,980
I'll find a solution.

139
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,660
So don't scold me.

140
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:29,140
Alright.

141
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,739
I won't say anything.

142
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:32,100
Go on in.

143
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,739
I'm on my way back.

144
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,140
Hang on.

145
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,220
What about words of comfort?

146
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:43,220
You could use your own way

147
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,819
to cheer me up.

148
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:49,140
Using my own way?

149
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:51,499
Okay.

150
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,179
Well...

151
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,379
Ms. Gu,

152
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,859
how much does your brain weigh?

153
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,059
Forget it. Just go.

154
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,900
Don't come back.

155
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,580
Door unlocked.

156
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:49,780
Did something happen?

157
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:54,499
Yu Dule.

158
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,259
Have you

159
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:00,900
been editing my program?

160
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:05,259
Yes.

161
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,819
Why didn't you tell me?

162
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,580
I thought

163
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:14,819
there wasn't a need to.

164
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:16,980
Just like you going on the show,

165
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:19,819
this is just a job I accepted.

166
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,780
That's all.

167
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,819
Are you

168
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,540
still angry with me?

169
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,859
I was never angry with you.

170
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,779
I'm just...

171
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,259
Just purely disappointed.

172
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,220
It's late.

173
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:56,739
If there's nothing else,

174
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,100
I won't ask you to come in.

175
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:16,139
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,859
I was wrong.

177
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,580
Guan Xingxin.

178
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,700
I didn't know you'd
admit you were wrong.

179
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,340
Gu Yi was right.

180
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,580
I...

181
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,220
quietly allowed my parents to hurt you.

182
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,539
I didn't consider your feelings.

183
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,779
I know you love me,

184
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,779
that's why I expected you

185
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,180
to understand me.

186
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,859
But,

187
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:06,340
love

188
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:08,779
should never be taken for granted.

189
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:15,980
I've been too arrogant.

190
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,259
Dule.

191
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,300
Could we start over?

192
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,779
I've been in the rut these days.

193
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,379
Shen said I was clueless
about love before.

194
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,539
Even now, I can't be sure if I learned.

195
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,619
But one thing is for sure.

196
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,420
I don't want to lose you.

197
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,499
You should go.

198
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,060
I'm tired.

199
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,659
Hello?

200
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:19,659
(Complaint Materials)

201
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:20,259
How did it go?

202
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,779
The talk broke down.

203
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,060
It turned ugly
the moment I signed the contract.

204
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:26,180
They were beating around the bush
over the phone.

205
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:27,736
I want to terminate the contract.

206
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,779
That's good.

207
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,010
It's an entertainment
agency contract, right?

208
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,580
For this special contract

209
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,100
between agency and entrustment,

210
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,580
when the artist wants to terminate,

211
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,139
it usually plays out.

212
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,820
But did you get the details?

213
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,600
Is there a termination fee?

214
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,420
I don't see one.

215
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,539
But one clause stated a worldwide ban,

216
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,379
which is over the top.

217
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,060
It's as if I'm some global superstar.

218
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:52,778
(Xu Guanrui)

219
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,739
I bet the company
doesn't have the financial means

220
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,980
for any monetary liabilities.

221
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,940
Instead, they get a handle
on the artists

222
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,060
by threatening a ban.

223
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:01,379
For you guys,

224
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,730
not being able to perform
is the best constraint.

225
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:06,420
I'm going to terminate even if it means

226
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
I won't get to perform again.

227
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:09,739
Moreover, I got in touch

228
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,019
with other artists on Weibo.

229
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,769
A female artist

230
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,760
was sexually harassed during
a commercial performance.

231
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,619
That's just low.

232
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,528
I'm going to start a joint termination.

233
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,832
You guys were taken advantage of.

234
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:21,659
But it's nothing major.

235
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,960
Direct arbitration
should do the trick.

236
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,340
Agreed.

237
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,200
We'll file for arbitration tomorrow.

238
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,820
When did you two get along so well?

239
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:31,019
By the way,

240
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:33,304
we should make a Weibo post
before the arbitration

241
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,180
to promote them.

242
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:35,739
This kind of company

243
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,820
fears getting exposed.

244
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,019
Liang Daiwen,

245
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,619
you can be so cruel.

246
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,100
Why show the enemy any mercy?

247
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,899
It's fine if I'm the victim.

248
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:46,499
But I won't allow

249
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,700
you to be bullied.

250
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:49,940
Let me know if you need help.

251
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,820
Okay.

252
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:52,739
Thank you.

253
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:54,980
You should sleep.

254
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,779
Do you know

255
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,420
how to file for arbitration?

256
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,180
I...

257
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,300
am looking it up, aren't I?

258
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:23,700
Here.

259
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:24,859
I'll file it for you.

260
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,184
You write the Weibo post.

261
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,060
We'll post it tonight.

262
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:29,820
Okay.

263
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,770
(Donghai City's
Worry Free Comedy Club)

264
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,920
(accused of deceiving others into
signing non-compliant contracts)

265
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,379
I was wondering why your long-form comic

266
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:48,779
can't seem to get a pass.

267
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,624
I suppose you're not looking
to be promoted,

268
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,779
but to be fired.

269
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:55,499
It's not that, Ms. Zhang.

270
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,580
You

271
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:57,980
are being a little harsh.

272
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
I wanted to make some extra money
to pay my rent.

273
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,700
But I got scammed
so I have to voice out.

274
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:04,440
Are you that strapped for money?

275
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:06,180
I gave you my word, didn't I?

276
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,539
When Art List's back-end data
reaches 500,000,

277
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,580
I will increase your pay,
and give you a promotion.

278
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,859
It's only at 170,000 right now.

279
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,460
You might as well tell me
to pay for the followers.

280
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,019
You didn't think twice
about signing a comedy agency contract.

281
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,779
I won't be surprised
if you do buy followers.

282
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,019
You do stand-up comedy
to find creative inspiration.

283
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,100
That's fine.

284
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:33,619
But from a professional standpoint,
I have to remind you.

285
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,460
You posted this on your personal
Weibo account.

286
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:38,980
And you're employed at Nextmonday.

287
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,379
All incidents that cause public exposure

288
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,019
are related to the company.

289
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,220
Is it because
I've been too lenient with you?

290
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,499
You've enjoyed too much freedom

291
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,940
that you're slacking now?

292
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,619
Ms. Zhang, when did I ever slack?

293
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,739
Every day, I work diligently

294
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:58,779
for eight hours.

295
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:01,019
After work,
I go and do something I like.

296
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:02,499
What is wrong with that?

297
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,659
You can't expect everyone
to be like you,

298
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,180
treating your full-time job as fun.

299
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:10,100
I like creating content
as well as doing comedy.

300
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,619
I signed the contract
without breaking any company rules.

301
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:15,192
And I'm not asking the company
to back me up in this instance.

302
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:16,499
Yet you're gaslighting me?

303
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:20,859
Careful what you say.

304
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,779
Who am I?

305
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,619
Where are we at?

306
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:23,899
Am I your girlfriend?

307
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,180
You say I'm gaslighting you?

308
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,180
Think properly.

309
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,420
Can you afford to quit?

310
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:33,940
If you do comedy full-time,

311
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,400
will you last till the end of the month?

312
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,859
Focus on Art List.

313
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,100
Jobs without any payout

314
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:45,144
are detrimental to your self-confidence.

315
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,739
Your fragile heart can't take it.

316
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
(Looking for a fight)

317
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,139
Aside from the approved
business content,

318
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,940
there are also the materials
submitted by the fans.

319
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,340
There should be about
50 original articles.

320
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,220
Long-form comics and interviews
will be published separately.

321
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,499
Interviews with content, depth

322
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,860
and humor will be posted alternately.

323
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:13,560
Ms. Zhang has to approve them first.

324
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,620
Got it.

325
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,180
Back-end followers are still increasing.

326
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:22,136
We're also getting more submissions
through the newly opened section.

327
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,019
We've also received suggestions

328
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,940
on who we should interview.

329
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,819
The most requested is Guan Xingxin,

330
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:31,464
who's currently enjoying the limelight
after doing the relationship show.

331
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,512
We can interview Guan Xingxin.

332
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,140
But not with a relationship show angle.

333
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,819
Then what should we do?

334
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:43,288
We can't talk about her
being a mistress...

335
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,620
Have some morals.

336
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,499
Go and get me a coffee.
I need a pick-me-up.

337
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,940
Let me think of some ideas.

338
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:51,739
Alright.

339
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,099
Rui.

340
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,779
Zhi.

341
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:58,700
Ms. Gu, express delivery for you.

342
00:17:59,059 --> 00:17:59,739
What is it?

343
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:01,380
If my guess is correct,

344
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:03,819
it's probably an official ban

345
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,019
on stand-up comedian Gu Yi.

346
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,900
I haven't even challenged them
to a court appearance

347
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,180
and they sent me a ban?

348
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,059
There you go.

349
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,900
What a joke.

350
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,220
Great, I have new content for my show.

351
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,819
I think

352
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,539
your Weibo post worked.

353
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,888
Liang Daiwen is right.

354
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,240
Compared to an arbitration,
they're more afraid of being exposed.

355
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,739
My Weibo only has a handful of reposts.

356
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,140
How did they come across it?

357
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,408
It's too much of a coincidence.

358
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,220
That's not important anyway.

359
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:38,339
Do you have all the materials
for the arbitration?

360
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:41,739
Don't worry. I'm a pro at writing.

361
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,660
In addition to the voice recordings

362
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:46,380
and screenshots the artists gave me,

363
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,539
it should be good enough.

364
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,660
You said

365
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,099
you want to do a joint termination.

366
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,579
I think you should reconsider it.

367
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,099
It'd be better
to settle your own case first.

368
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,048
It's hard to stay united
when there's a crowd.

369
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,620
I worry you're taking on too much.

370
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,460
I'm not being an alarmist.

371
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:04,770
When you're in this circle too long,

372
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,944
you'll see all sorts of people.

373
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,019
Don't be too naive.

374
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:10,220
As your comrade,

375
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:11,700
I wanted to remind you.

376
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:13,180
If it was anyone else,

377
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,700
I would've just wished them

378
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,660
good luck.

379
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:17,256
Tell them "all the best"
and that's that.

380
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:19,940
Understood.

381
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:21,259
Thanks, Mr. Xu.

382
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,056
You're welcome.

383
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,339
Alright, if you need anything,

384
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:24,900
let me know.

385
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,940
I'm more experienced

386
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,536
in such matters
compared to Liang Daiwen.

387
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,019
Let me see.

388
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,380

389
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:40,980
I'm off.

390
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:41,660
Bye-bye.

391
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,220

(Notice on the ban of contracted

410
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:48,739
This is not what we've discussed.

411
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:50,620
You only told me

412
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,019
to sign Gu Yi so she could be reined in.

413
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:55,660
You mentioned nothing about
how adamant she is.

414
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,819
I can look past the arbitration.

415
00:20:58,339 --> 00:20:59,860
But getting called out online

416
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,019
is too much to handle.

417

Whether you choose arbitration
or termination with Gu Yi,

422
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:10,180
it's up to you.

423
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:12,700
It's no longer
about terminating her or not.

424
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,940
You suppress one,

425
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,180
and she'll just post another.

426
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,299

to drag this out with her.

00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,660
you sure took a long detour

441
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,099
just to get me banned

442
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:04,620
so you won't have to see me again.

443
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,499
Yes, I didn't think this through.

444
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:14,940

to take our personal beef

445

Ms. Zhang,

458
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,860
this isn't the first time

459
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,220
you've manipulated online opinion.

460
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,380
When Liang Daiwen experienced
cyberbullying,

461
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:00,019
you weren't as anxious.

462
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,499
Could it be that Liang Daiwen
is less important

463
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,180
than Liu Ran?

464
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:08,810
What is it you want then?

465
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:09,700
Just say it.

466
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,579
I just want you to know

467
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:13,099
about Liang Daiwen's current situation.

468
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,499
If you commit a crime in reality,

469
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,420
you will be punished according to law

470
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,739
and principles.

471
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,900
But when you judge
someone on the Internet,

472
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,860
you're not accountable.

473
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,140
Words can kill.

474
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:26,420
The Internet isn't without memory.

475
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,380
You accused Liang Daiwen of plagiarism

476
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:32,380
and he'll forever bear the label.

477
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:39,700
You are his senior

478
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:40,940
and his benefactor.

479
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:43,019
He's grateful to you.

480
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,819
As to why he didn't fight back

481
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:47,980
is because he didn't want

482
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,499
to hurt you the way you treated him.

483
00:23:56,456 --> 00:23:57,816
I will terminate the contract

484
00:23:58,779 --> 00:23:59,779
and delete the Weibo post.

485
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:02,940
But on the condition

486
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,539
that you rectify
Liang Daiwen's false accusation.

487
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:22,539
I've explained it many times.

488
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:24,660
We're not making a specific
disability version.

489
00:24:24,904 --> 00:24:26,490
Rather, we're covering the needs
of both groups

490
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,819
within the same app.

491
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:29,980
Creating two versions of the same app

492
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:31,700
requires more costs and labor.

493
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,900
Is it necessary?

494
00:24:33,544 --> 00:24:35,380
Are the needs of ordinary people
and disabled people

495
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,632
for mobile phones so different?

496
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:38,579
Is it necessary to make

497
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:39,860
a less targeted version?

498
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
Sorry, I can't do that.

499
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,620
What happened?

500
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,499
What got you so riled up
from a phone call?

501
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:01,980
It's nothing.

502
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,579
I'm not mad at you.

503
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:04,980
I know.

504
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,460
Go and sleep.

505
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,140
I have to edit the proposal.

506
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:15,579
I'll stay with you for a while longer.

507
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:21,660
But,

508
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,380
I think

509
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:26,499
you might have been too harsh.

510
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,499
You're already known for being difficult

511
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,059

512
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,140
My name has long been tarnished.

513
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,579
It doesn't bother me.

514
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,339
All I want now is to focus on work,

515
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,099
and eliminate obstacles for my team.

516
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,339
I have no more energy
to pretend to be nice.

518
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,539
Are you

519
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:59,539
still bothered by
the plagiarism accusation online?

520
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,019
A few days ago,

521
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:13,499
I did an interview with a blogger.

522
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,980
It went well at first.

523
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,299
Then,

524
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:20,739
he started asking me
about the plagiarism incident.

525
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,380
He said

526
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,860
the fans wanted to know.

527
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,220
It happened so long ago.

528
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:29,752
But it doesn't seem
to be going away any time soon.

529
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,499
Can you promise me this?

530
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,259
If Zhang Qingya agrees
to rectify it and apologize,

531
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:47,099
don't say no.

532
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:52,620
Did you speak with her?

533
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,099
She wanted to speak with me.

534
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,819
Obviously, she had something to do

535
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,099
with what happened with Liu Ran.

536
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,420
You were nice to her,

537
00:27:03,592 --> 00:27:05,272
but she turned around and stabbed you.

538
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,299
That really makes me mad.

539
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:07,220
I was furious

540
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,339
and so I had to do something.

541
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:09,579
I wanted her to pay for it.

542
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,460
You are my robot,

543
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:17,739

I've spoken to the designer from Fenqi.

He will help to clarify
the misunderstanding.

547

00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,299
this has nothing to do with Gu Yi.

554
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,180
I don't hate you
for the plagiarism incident.

555
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,099
If not because

556
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,779
it's affecting my current team,

557
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:41,779
I wouldn't have paid any heed.

558
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,860
What really hurt me

559
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,380
is the method in which you used on me.

560
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,220
Liang Daiwen.

561
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,460
Then do you think

562
00:28:57,259 --> 00:28:58,380
you did me no wrong?

563
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,339
I know.

564
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:05,779
I am where I am today

565
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,499
because of your mentorship.

566
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:11,608
You brought me into the circle,

567
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,700
and handled everything
from big to small.

568
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:17,900
You protected me over the years.

569
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,860
I know it.

570
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,819
But right now, I want

571
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,980
to do the things I'm meant to do.

572
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,420
That's my freedom.

573
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,900
Is freedom all you want?

574
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,339
Liang Daiwen, what did I do

575
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,860
to make you avoid me like the plague?

576
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,420
After being together for so long,

577
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,460
I had thought

578
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:58,259
I had a special place in your heart.

579
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,860
I thought if we took things slow,

580
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:03,140
it would blossom into something good.

581
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,579
I thought by treating you nice

582
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:08,140
and making sacrifices for you,

583
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,019
you'd be at least a little bit touched.

584
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,460
But how did you treat me?

585
00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:18,460
After receiving the kindness I gave you,

586
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,144
you turned around
and stabbed me in the back.

587
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,059
If you insist that terminating
the contract is a betrayal,

588
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,299
I have nothing more to say.

589
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:31,620
For all those years,

590
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,460
I do owe you a thank you.

591
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:38,019
I trust you,

592
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,099
and I'm grateful to you.

593
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,220
In my heart, you are forever my senior.

594
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:50,099
But the one I love is Gu Yi.

595
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:54,579
I'm sorry.

596
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,499
After all those years,

597
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:07,779
I can't believe this is how we end up.

598
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:18,660
Qingya.

599
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,579
I'm doing well now.

600
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:25,224
I hope it's the same for you.

601
00:31:38,904 --> 00:31:40,140
(Qingya, Happy birthday. Liang Daiwen)

602
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,819
This is the design you won with.

603
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,940
I've kept it all this while.

604
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,860
It's more precious
than my own winning design.

605
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,380
I'm giving it back to you.

606
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,299
I'm also returning the termination fee.

607
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,900
From now on,

608
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,739
we're even.

609
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,819
Without you,

610
00:32:21,336 --> 00:32:23,420
the Liang Daiwen from back then
wouldn't have existed.

611
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:29,180
Keep it.

612
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:32,568
You don't have
to return the termination fee.

613
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,019
But I want Ounce back.

614
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:46,739
Okay.

615
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,019
Here, congrats!

616
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:05,739
We have

617
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,220
to thank the organizer.

618
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,380
No, I should thank you guys.

619
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:09,980
Congratulations.

620
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:14,860
Let's drink.

621
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:16,860
Mr. Lu.

622
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:21,579
When did you get back?

623
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,420
Just.

624
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:23,700
We

625
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,980
prepared a surprise for you.

626
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:26,620
What surprise?

627
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,380
I officially declare

628
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,140
that Ounce is ours now.

629
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:35,499
I took it back from Zhang Qingya.

630
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,432
This will once again
be your watering hole.

631
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:39,339
Surprised?

632
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,900
The paperwork is all done.

633
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,864
I can vouch for it.

634
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,140
The contract is signed and stamped.

635
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:45,900
We are now stakeholders of Ounce.

636
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:47,779
Looks like we're comrades
at Ounce too.

637
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:52,220
My studio doesn't have
enough ready cash,

638
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,019
so

639
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:55,208
I asked everyone to pitch in
as stakeholders.

640
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:17,019
Thank you, guys!

641
00:34:17,499 --> 00:34:18,219
You're welcome.

642
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,579
Cheers!

643
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:47,579
Take this.

644
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:52,860
This is

645
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,460
the savings
the Great Meixia left for me.

646
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,420
She had performed at Ounce too.

647
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:02,179
Take this as her share.

648
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,699
Are you sure?

649
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:10,900
Yes.

650
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,820
If Meixia was here,

651
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,059
she'd do this.

652
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:18,340
Our Meixia has more than enough money.

653
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:31,139
Dear Meixia.

654
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:37,980
Are you coming back to Ounce
to watch me perform?

655
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,420
She will.

656
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,579
Did I get this right?

657
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:03,619
You said you want
to stop the publication?

658
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,340
Yes.

659
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,260
You've read this.

660
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,340
Art List's offline losses

661
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,499
are clearly written.

662
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:10,659
If we don't stop now,

663
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:11,699
it will be stopped later.

664
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:14,619
Nextmonday is the company's main brand.

665
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,619
It can fill in the gaps
for three to five years.

666
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,179
But can it do so for 30 or 50 years?

667
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,579
I'm sure you don't want

668
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,059
to see the Nextmonday brand

669
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,980
get dragged down together, right?

670
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,740
If it was going to be stopped,

671
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,328
why did I bother
merging the publications?

672
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:30,049
After the acquisition,
you tell me it can't be done.

673
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,560
You think I've got nothing better to do?

674
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,900
At the time, the biggest reason
for a merger

675
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:35,820
was that Art List is an established
magazine name.

676
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:37,980
We can still retain the brand.

677
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,689
Nowadays, there is pretty much
no difference

678
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,184
between online and offline publications.

679
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:44,179
Profit and sentiment
are not contradictory.

680
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:46,659
Stop the bleeding before it's too late.

681
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:48,499
You know this better than me.

682
00:36:54,664 --> 00:36:55,900
We can stop the physical publication.

683
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,179
But we can't simply stop it
without reason.

684
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:01,740
As for how far
the online publication can go,

685
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,900
I need to see the numbers.

686
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:06,300
Don't worry.

687
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,659
I've delegated

688
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,420
the online operation to Gu Yi.

689
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,179
She will do a good job.

690
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:38,420
Good luck.

691
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,340
All good.

692
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:41,272
You go entertain them.

693
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:42,420
Me?

694
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:42,980
Yeah, you.

695
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,490
You're the organizer
so of course you should go.

696
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:45,340
I'm not going.

697
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,019
You're Boss Yu.

698
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,460
Well, you're Boss Gu.

699
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,139
I mean, you're Mrs. Lady Boss Liang.

700
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:51,619
Right?

701
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,900
Was that a tongue twister?

702
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:54,340
Okay, okay. No tongue twisters.

703
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:55,059
I'll go.

704
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,420
Boss Lu will handle it, okay?

705
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:56,860
Okay.

706
00:37:58,499 --> 00:37:59,619
Leave the drink.

707
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,860
Hello everyone.

708
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,099
I'm the host for tonight, Lu Ming.

709
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:18,420
My friends call me Mr. Lu.

710
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:20,260
I'm honestly

711
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:21,300
really happy

712
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,820
because I can stand
on this stage once again

713
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,340
to chat with you guys.

714
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,499
This year, Ounce had gone through
ups and downs.

715
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:29,460
We experienced a lot.

716
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,219
Today, we're officially
making a comeback.

717
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,499
Nice!

718
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:39,179
I'm glad

719
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,699
it ultimately returned

720
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:42,019
to those

721
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,912
who love both stand-up comedy
and life.

722
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,420
Thank you all for your company
and support.

723
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,380
Moving forward,

724
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,340
we, the bosses,

725
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:51,019
will take the lessons from the past

726
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,260
to create better content,

727
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:53,380
avoid trouble,

728
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:54,699
make more money,

729
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:55,900
and keep to ourselves.

730
00:38:56,659 --> 00:38:57,980
Please continue supporting us.

731
00:38:58,579 --> 00:38:59,179
Nice one!

732
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,179
Okay, that's enough.

733
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,619
Next up is a pretty lady

734
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:07,699
named Liu Ming.

735
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:08,900
Let's see

736
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,539
if she can leave her mark on Ounce.

737
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,059
A round of applause.

738
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:24,219
Hello everyone, I am Liu Ming.

739
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:26,460
Nice!

740
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,059
You've probably guessed it.

741
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,139
I was in an accident.

742
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,179
But save your pity.

743
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:35,740
No need to toss money onto the stage.

744
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,460
That's too chaotic.

745
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,460
See,

746
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,780
I have a payment code.

747
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:42,860
All donations received

748
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,420
will be donated in my name

749
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:45,499
to myself.

750
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,699
I was in an accident five years ago.

751
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:52,219
Now, I move around in a wheelchair.

752
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:54,579
I have no senses in my lower body.

753
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:57,219
So my legs now are, how can I say it,

754
00:39:57,579 --> 00:39:58,579
long and slender.

755
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,340
I even went to Disney World alone.

756
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,740
But I was told,

757
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:05,940
why bother going to Disney
in your state?

758
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,179
What state exactly?

759
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,579
I think I'm in a great state.

760
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:09,768
I'm not only going to have fun,

761
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,499
I'm going to have the best fun ever.

762
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,740
That day,

763
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,099
I sat on the merry-go-round

764
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:15,380
for the whole day.

765
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,619
Because no one carried me down.

766
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,420
Nice!

767
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:20,579
Nice one!

768
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,139
I hope you guys won't hold back

769
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:27,139
on the laughter

770
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,179
because I'm disabled.

771
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:29,019
For a comedian

772
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:30,539
with a disability,

773
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:31,179
your laughter

774
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,619
is the biggest respect you can give us.

775
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,059
The next performer

776
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,059
best not think I'm guilt-tripping.

777
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:37,820
I can't help having the prerequisite.

778
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:41,219
My life currently is pretty good.

779
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,579
I have a boyfriend and we're very close.

780
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,099
We would take walks together.

781
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,820
When we were strolling,

782
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,699
I'd always tell him.

783
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,300
I'd say, stop pushing.

784
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:51,460
He'd say,

785
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:53,019
it's okay, babe. I'm not tired.

786
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,820
I'd say, this is
an electronic wheelchair.

787
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,900
You're going too slow.

788
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:57,980
It's true.

789
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,420
Here's the thing.

790
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,980
His walking speed

791
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:02,460
is 4 kilometers an hour.

792
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:04,099
The speed of my wheelchair

793
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:05,460
is 8 kilometers an hour.

794
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,699
Whenever we go for a walk,

795
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,900
I am particularly restless.

796
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,300
At last, I couldn't stand it anymore.

797
00:41:11,848 --> 00:41:13,528
So I bought him his own
electronic wheelchair.

798
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:15,460
Nice!

799
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:22,499
From then on,
I started jogging every day.

800
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,699
Until my girlfriend

801
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,099
bought me an electronic wheelchair.

802
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,219
Okay, that's all I have for today.

803
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:30,980
I am Daodao.

804
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,219
Now, let's welcome

805
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:33,499
the last artist for the day.

806
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,659
What's going on?

807
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,820
Why is he up there?

808
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:43,820
Just watch.

809
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:45,219
Hello, I am Liang Daiwen.

810
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:49,219
I

811
00:41:49,659 --> 00:41:51,099
am diagnosed with alexithymia.

812
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,539
Simply put,

813
00:41:53,499 --> 00:41:55,219
I am unable to express emotions.

814
00:41:58,856 --> 00:42:00,744
Like I said,
I can't properly express emotions.

815
00:42:01,448 --> 00:42:03,192
When I came here for shows in the past,

816
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:04,340
the comedians would ask

817
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,499
why I didn't laugh.

818
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,619
Was I trying to build them up?

819
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:09,740
And so I taught them.

820
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,539
I told them all about my condition.

821
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,340
After they heard it,

822
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,460
they became more curious.

823
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:17,219
They began tickling my armpits,

824
00:42:17,592 --> 00:42:18,968
and tickled the soles of my feet.

825
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,099
I laughed,

826
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:21,300
but they called me bluff.

827
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,900
I explained that I lack emotions,

828
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,820
but I still have my reflexes.

829
00:42:25,992 --> 00:42:26,900
If you don't believe me,

830
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,099
go ahead and hit my knee.

831
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:30,420
So Gu Yi

832
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:31,780
jumped up to hit my kneecap.

833
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:33,340
But she missed.

834
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,019
Actually,

835
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,139
I never thought

836
00:42:39,176 --> 00:42:40,584
I'd be doing stand-up comedy.

837
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,219
I'm standing here today

838
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:43,860
without registering.

839
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,340
It's kind of a surprise.

840
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,499
Because

841
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:49,780
I am now one of Ounce's bosses.

842
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:51,300
Nice!

843
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:55,940
I'm sure they wouldn't object.

844
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,579
I asked Liu Ming
before coming on stage just now.

845
00:42:59,059 --> 00:42:59,699
I said,

846
00:43:00,008 --> 00:43:01,160
do you have any comments?

847
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,219
If you do,

848
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:03,139
then stand up.

849
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,260
She did not.

850
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:07,820
I know

851
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:08,980
you all might think

852
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:10,940
I'm bragging by saying all these.

853
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,139
Indeed.

854
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,260
I am bragging.

855
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,059
I also have a girlfriend,

856
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:16,260
a pretty one.

857
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:20,900
Although

858
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,219
she missed hitting my kneecap,

859
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,380
she did succeed

860
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,980
in knocking open my heart.

861
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:35,699
Gu Yi!

862
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,619
Are you listening?

863
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,019
I have something to say.

864
00:44:23,499 --> 00:44:24,219
Ms. Gu Yi.

865
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,139
Are you willing

866
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:28,940
to love me forever?

867
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,900
Never to switch me out?

868
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,380
Stay with me forever

869
00:44:39,688 --> 00:44:41,672
and fight to the death
for the rest of your life?

870
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:52,820
