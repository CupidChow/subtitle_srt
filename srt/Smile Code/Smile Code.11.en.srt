00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600

"Smile Code" by Zu Yue)

=Episode 11=

25
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,619
Don't move now.

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,300
No way.

27
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,796
(Gu Yi: Did you send me home yesterday?)

28
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:46,352
(I didn't do anything weird, did I?)

29
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:06,800
(Liang Daiwen: Well, no.)

30
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:15,222
(Will poor young people
give everything for love?)

31
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,580
That's exaggerated.

32
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,580
Shouldn't love be equal?

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,140
Whether it's your star sign,
blood type, personality, or temper,

34
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:38,860
only true compatibility
can make love last.

35
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:41,518
Compatibility?

36
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,819
What's this, finding an organ donor?

37
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,700
Young people should pursue equality,

38
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,719
but love cannot be measured in figures,

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,020
and it definitely
isn't about statistics.

40
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,059
That's politically correct,

41
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,899
but do you think people are interested

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,700
in your fancy chicken-soup bullspit?

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,518
I know our articles

44
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,700
should target mainstream thoughts

45
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,140
so that our readers will share them.

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,038
Women should also be more independent

47
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,460
and be more cautious
when choosing a partner.

48
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,540
That's correct.

49
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,719
But if our magazine

50
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,638
keeps offering the same,

51
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,819
monotonous views,

52
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,439
and when young people find themselves

53
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,599
in a relationship

54
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,740
where not everything is equal,

55
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,819
that would end the relationship
before it could even begin.

56
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,220
For example, in Titanic,

57
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,180
when Rose met Jack, if she told him,

58
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,078
"You're too poor,

59
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,540
you're beneath me.

60
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,340
You don't even have
a logo on your shirt."

61
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,860
The movie would have
ended in 10 minutes.

62
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:35,939
That's enough.

63
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,900
Both of you have good points,
but not strong enough.

64
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,999
"Poor young people"
are usually around 30 years old.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,599
They feel left out, they desire love.

66
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,900
It's the same, tacky, old trope.

67
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,720
If you can't write something good,
you might as well not write it.

68
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:48,919
Gu Yi.

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,980
Have you imagined how
you'd look like in your 30's?

70
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,679
You've never even thought

71
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,838
about how you'd be in your 30's.

72
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,100
What do you expect to write?

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,780
A mock-up debate?

74
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,540
When you're in your 30's,
you might still be earning little,

75
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,640
yet your health may be getting weaker
after years of strenuous work.

76
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,699
You may have a lot of dreams,

77
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,420
but none of them are about love

78
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,139
because you're constantly
under work pressure.

79
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:14,320
Even having a relationship
feels like eating fast food.

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,119
It's neither good nor bad,

81
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,059
but you're stuck in between.

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,278
When you reach a certain stage,

83
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,499
it's not that you feel left out,

84
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,278
but you find it hard

85
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,300
to advance in life.

86
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,119
"We die at the age of 40 from a bullet

87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,718
that we shot into our hearts
at the age of 20."

88
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:29,260
It's an experience
that many people go through.

89
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,819
However, not everyone in their 30's

90
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,100
have to surrender to life.

91
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,059
That's what Gu Yi meant, right?

92
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:41,619
That sounds

93
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,740
very radical.

94
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,300
If we publish that,

95
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,019
we might get criticized by our readers.

96
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,420
Still, it'd pique their curiosity

97
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,939
and prompt more people
to click the link.

98
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,059
Now that's an effective
point of sharing.

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,100
Write the article based on
what Xu Guanrui just said.

100
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,259
Dismissed.

101
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,379
Gu Yi, stay here.

102
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,439
Ever since you joined Nextmonday,

103
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,198
you've been observing our content.

104
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,740
Have you not learned
how to select a good topic?

105
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,278
Do you think that love

106
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,939
is a topic that can generate hype today?

107
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,819
Ms. Zhang.

108
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,679
I don't get it. If tabloid news

109
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,999
and idol shipping can generate hype,

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,980
why can't love?

111
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,059
Do you even understand love?

112
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,958
Don't tell me you're feeling pissed

113
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,139
because I deducted your salary.

114
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,679
Xu Guanrui even came to your rescue.

115
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,019
Was he targeting Penny, or me?

116
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,420
That's not what he meant.

117
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,518
Got it,

118
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,420
I'll rewrite the article.

119
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,220
Love is complicated.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,479
It's not something that you can explain

121
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,579
with a few cheeky quotes.

122
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,980
In fact, Xu Guanrui's
interpretation of the topic

123
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,619
was a very strong point.

124
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:11,780
He's smarter than you.

125
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,420
Even you don't understand the topic.

126
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
How do you expect the readers to share?

127
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,019
Got it.

128
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,180
I'll try to understand.

129
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,278
That's enough.

130
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,139
Leave that article aside.

131
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,139
We'll ditch the article for this issue.

132
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,379
Focus on

133
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,980
optimizing the supplement's proposal.

134
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,019
Go.

135
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,640
(Yuji Restaurant)

136
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,100
What's wrong?

137
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,100
You're at loggerheads with Jacqueline?

138
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,980
Is it still because of
the poster licensing issue?

139
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,100
No.

140
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,660
Besides, that's already over.

141
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,420
Not really.

142
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,718
It's just that Jacqueline

143
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,100
hasn't pursued this matter yet.

144
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,939
What do you mean?

145
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,420
Listen.

146
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,980
When Jacqueline just
took over Nextmonday,

147
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,819
printed media's influence
has already dwindled.

148
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,158
She was bold enough

149
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,860
to collaborate with
celebrities to increase sales

150
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
while focusing on content
to build a good reputation.

151
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,180
Meanwhile, she placed all advertisements
under the new media.

152
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,780
It's her pure grit

153
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,119
and true abilities

154
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,180
that made her who she is now.

155
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,900
You think she doesn't know

156
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,599
whether anyone

157
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,620
is pulling any tricks?

158
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,859
As for the position of deputy director,

159
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,380
you should get prepared mentally.

160
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,099
Jacqueline does
pay a lot of attention to you.

161
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,200
After all, she's in charge
of the magazine's content.

162
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,180
Still,

163
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:51,180
she needs the content
to build the magazine's brand.

164
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,620
When the content is good,

165
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,579
we can attract more commercials.

166
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,459
Now that you're in charge of content,

167
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:58,660
who's in charge of commercials?

168
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,500
Penny.

169
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,739
And that's that.

170
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,000
Many aspects will be evaluated
before choosing a new deputy director.

171
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,300
Honestly,

172
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,620
you don't have an advantage.

173
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,500
That's not it.

174
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,579
Jacqueline gives it all
when it comes to work.

175
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,660
Getting her attention

176
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,579
feels better than
defeating Penny 10 times.

177
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,579
I believe she can see my value.

178
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,099
My dear comrade.

179
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,339
I do hope everything goes well for you.

180
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,819
I know.

181
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,380
Anyway, that aside,

182
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,079
I have a performance tonight,

183
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,020
want to come?

184
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,420
It's my comeback performance.

185
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,739
Sure.

186
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:43,660
Now, eat up and get back to work.

187
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:49,602
(Gu Yi)

188
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,020
Hello, I'm Gu Yi.

189
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,300
Hi!

190
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,359
Long time no see.

191
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,339
Long time no see.

192
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,819
It's been a while
since I performed in Ounce

193
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,260
mainly because

194
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,420
I'm in love recently.

195
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,579
What?

196
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,278
Why are you so excited to hear that?

197
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,540
Are you all married?

198
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,380
No.

199
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,579
But.

200
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,099
But.

201
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,939
It's a one-sided love.

202
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,438
Mutual love is so boring.

203
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:27,939
I prefer being in
a one-sided relationship.

204
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,999
If I manage to snag a guy

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,300
in less than a month,

206
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,099
I'd probably ditch him

207
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,939
because I don't like guys
who don't take things seriously.

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,020
Actually, my mother
plays a huge role in shaping

209
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,780
my expectations in love.

210
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:50,140
My mother is literally a naughty old girl,
especially in her relationships.

211
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,939
When she was young, she was bold enough

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,859
to elope

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,180
and follow unorthodox trends.

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,180
She even renounced her family,

215
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,859
but not her family's wealth.

216
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,219
She probably knew

217
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,420
that love without money is meaningless.

218
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,359
When my mother

219
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,398
was young,

220
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,319
my father bought her some bananas,

221
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,660
and that actually won her heart.

222
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,300
Then, they had me,

223
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,819
and then a divorce,

224
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,719
or should I say,

225
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,979
a banana split.

226
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:24,660
Now,

227
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,620
my mother loves dancing
in the public plaza.

228
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,939
She dances in the plaza the whole day
with a bunch of old guys.

229
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,900
She got to pick

230
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,180
any guy she wanted.

231
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,240
If things don't work out,
it's out the door for them.

232
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,599
Now,

233
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,620
several years have passed,

234
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,440
and there's a long line
in front of her door.

235
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,459
There's something about my mom
that impresses me.

236
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,219
She's fearless.

237
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,339
Ever since I could remember,

238
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,739
I lived in poverty

239
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,900
because my dad
squandered off the family's money.

240
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,918
Even my allowance
that I hid under my bed,

241
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,380
he took it and went gambling.

242
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,500
Finally, my mom had enough.

243
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,719
She dragged my dad out

244
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,620
and got a divorce.

245
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,020
As soon as she came back,

246
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,140
she took all her savings

247
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,699
and bought a TV,
which she had been eyeing on.

248
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,260
She told me,

249
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,819
"My daughter,

250
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,819
I just sold your dad off

251
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,180
to buy this TV.

252
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:23,859
You like it?

253
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,880
It's better than
having a man, isn't it?"

254
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,119
Back then, I was still

255
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,260
a young and dumb kid.

256
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,260
I replied,

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,660
"Mom,

258
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,020
can you sell yourself off too?

259
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,339
I want a computer."

260
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,300
Nice!

261
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,140
Nice!

262
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,900
I've been in a one-sided relationship,

263
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,500
so I asked for

264
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:46,620
my mother's advice.

265
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,678
"When I hit 50,

266
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,579
would I still look
as charming as you are?"

267
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,140
My mother said something
very philosophical.

268
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:55,300
She said,

269
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,500
"When a door closes,

270
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,699
another window

271
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,979
will open for you."

272
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,620
I finally understood.

273
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,099
I thought long and hard.

274
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,900
It's been so many years,

275
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,500
and I guess that window

276
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,099
is equipped with blinds,

277
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,199
because that guy

278
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,300
has been blind to my feelings.

279
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,579
And the door

280
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,739
that didn't open for me

281
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,699
must be square instead of rectangular,

282
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,300
because I always
find myself back to square one.

283
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,339
Okay.

284
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,859
Encore!

285
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,219
No encores.

286
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,739
Save it for the next performer.

287
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,038
Thank you, I'm Gu Yi!

288
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,339
Have a great night at Ounce!

289
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,900
Nice!

290
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,219
You're calling me?

291
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,739
No, I'm calling my mother.

292
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,599
I wonder where

293
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,819
she went after the show.

294
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,380
She's not picking up.

295
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,579
Your mom is here?

296
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,140
I saw Liang Daiwen
leaving with an older lady.

297
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,380
Maybe that's her?

298
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,660
Gu Yi,

299
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,620
what took you so long?

300
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,380
I told you, I just wanted to see you.

301
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,739
You didn't have to send me off.

302
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,359
Okay,

303
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,380
I'm almost there.

304
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:04,699
All right.

305
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,380
I knew you're not the cleaner.

306
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,780
So, who are you?

307
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,140
I'm Gu Yi's friend.
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,079
Those pills on the shelves

309
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,579
are even more organized
than the pharmacist's.

310
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,219
Gu Yi isn't that tidy.

311
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,260
It's your house, isn't it?

312
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,859
Why take so many pills
when you're so young?

313
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,939
Are you ill?

314
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,739
No.

315
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,660
Then, you've probably

316
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,260
suffered a lot.

317
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,459
Anyway, it's not good
to take too many painkillers.

318
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,699
I'm saying this on behalf of your mom.

319
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,660
If Gu Yi had to take so many pills,

320
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,020
I'd be so worried.

321
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,219
Me,

322
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:04,620
I've been having gastric pain,

323
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,500
but I try to avoid pills.

324
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,319
They say food is the best medicine,

325
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,059
you know?

326
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,059
That's why I made you some good food.

327
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,540
You guys

328
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,380
can share.

329
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,540
Call me if there's no more.
I'll send more over.

330
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:16,699
Okay?

331
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,020
You're the guy Gu Yi
mentioned in her jokes, right?

332
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,059
Her one-sided love?

333
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,380
You don't have to tell me.
I know it's you.

334
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,099
Gu Yi may be bad at a lot of things,

335
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,900
but she knows how
to identify a good catch.

336
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,660
When she was a rebellious teenager,
I beat her up for the first time

337
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,640
because she wrote a love letter
to the most popular guy in school.

338
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,819
Do you like Gu Yi?

339
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,099
No?

340
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,020
I...

341
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:05,979
I don't know.

342
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,459
It's okay if you don't know.

343
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,820
Take your time to think.

344
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,420
There's nothing wrong with being slow.

345
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:17,820
Once you've made your mind up,

346
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:19,259
just stick with it.

347
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,539
You're back.

348
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,420
Your mom has boarded her flight.

349
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,620
She was in a rush,

350
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,100
so she didn't message you.

351
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,699
Thank you.

352
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,259
Sit down.

353
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,180
My mom made all these foods.

354
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,520
You've probably never had them.

355
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,219
Are these

356
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:14,620
part of the "nutritional diet" plan?

357
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:18,580
You just reminded me.

358
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:20,100
Where's my whiteboard?

359
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,979
I kept it somewhere.

360
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,319
Your mom said it looked like
a kid scribbled on it,

361
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,299
so she wiped it clean.

362
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:27,900
Fine.

363
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,939
Come on, let's eat.

364
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,299
Your mom

365
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,779
is pretty cute.

366
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,580
Do you know why

367
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,219
my mom came to Donghai
without telling me?

368
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,979
My parents

369
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,599
saw a video of me

370
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,660
joking about my roommate.

371
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,678
Someone commented

372
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,979
that I've become someone's mistress.

373
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,459
My dad called my mom and scolded her,

374
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:17,060
asking why she didn't raise me up well.

375
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,739
My dad believes

376
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,699
that a girl should stay
with her parents,

377
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,958
find a casual job,

378
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,180
and marry an honest man.

379
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,499
But, my mom believes

380
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,119
that I should go out and see the world,

381
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,140
whether I'm a boy or a girl.

382
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:34,660
They've got conflicting views.

383
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,459
If I knew my mom would leave so quickly,

384
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,699
I'd have spent more time with her.

385
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,699
For some reason,

386
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,779
I can be vulnerable and
slack off in front of everyone,

387
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,060
but with my mother,

388
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,660
I'd always show my tough side.

389
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:57,559
She told me

390
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,759
that I need to love myself

391
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,979
and be independent,

392
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,459
and that I shouldn't
pin my hopes on anyone else.

393
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:09,779
Yesterday,

394
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,420
I watched Ounce's video again,

395
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,219
and I saw my mother

396
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,420
replying to those netizens.

397
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:22,739
"Do you know what kind
of person Gu Yi is?

398
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,060
Do you even understand her?"

399
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:29,580
I felt

400
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,739
upset when I saw that.

401
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,660
Done eating?

402
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,960
Let me take you to your bedroom.

403
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,900
That's not a good idea.

404
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:10,319
(I'm in a bad mood now.)

405
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,340
(I'm having trouble
upholding my moral standards.)

406
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,539
(Hang on.)

407
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,939
(I'm giving in.)

408
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,180
Did I ask you to sleep on the bed?

409
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,140
It's under the bed.

410
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,699
Go down.

411
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,539
It's clean.

412
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,939
Belly up.

413
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:18,100
Here are the stars I promised.

414
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,660
Are you

415
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,939
trying to make me happy?

416
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,459
Are you happy now?

417
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,820
What made you want to do this?

418
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,259
I had a dream when I was a kid.

419
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,019
I dreamed that I was on the moon.

420
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,100
There were children wearing
white dresses that glowed in the dark,

421
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:57,620
holding brooms and sweeping everywhere.

422
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,900
That's why

423
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,060
the moon wanes and waxes.

424
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,499
Those children kept sweeping.

425
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:09,499
As they grew up, they left the moon,

426
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,340
and new ones would replace them,

427
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,539
bringing their brooms with them.

428
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,718
They were actually the stars

429
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:21,420
that lit up the sky.

430
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,459
That's why we can see

431
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,820
stars in this world.

432
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,180
It's not because the stars can shine.

433
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,478
It's because there will always be

434
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,979
children who can dream.

435
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:43,739
How old

436
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,820
were you?

437
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,259
Ten.

438
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,459
Since then,

439
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,660
I've never dreamed about stars anymore.

00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:05,180

don't set your standards too high.

507
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:58,620

00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,799
Exactly.

509
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,158
Young ladies nowadays

510
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:02,918
are already getting picky

511
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:04,779

how much they're really worth.

00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,820

Ma'am,

515
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:10,718
I'm actually too weak

516
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:11,979
to conceive a child.

517
00:29:11,979 --> 00:29:14,380
If I marry a single father, I can get
a husband and kids at the same time.

518
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,238
Come on, add me in.

519
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:16,860
Come on.

520
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,638
You're too weak to conceive, miss?

521
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:21,319
You should take care of your health.

522
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,580
Don't waste our time.

523
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:32,539
Hello?

524
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,140
Gu Yi, are you busy?

525
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,699
I'm looking for blind dates.

526
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:37,779
Blind dates?

527
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,420
All the more you should join me.

528
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,380
Come, let's meet Xu Guanrui now.

529
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,459
Huh?

530
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:43,638
Don't worry.

531
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:44,459
It's for work.

532
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:45,718
He resembles me too much.

533
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:46,559
Things might get heated,

534
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,060
so I don't want to meet him alone.

535
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,580
Fine.

536
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,100
Where should we start today?

537
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,860
Anywhere.

538
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,420
Then, let's talk about

539
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:13,900
that unlicensed psychiatrist
in your house.

540
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,900
How's her "daily routine treatment plan"

541
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,180
working on you?

542
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,779
Pretty good.

543
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,519
Have you forgotten

544
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,660
how to write your emotion diary?

545
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,979
"My hand hurts.

546
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,299
I'm losing sleep even more.

547
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:37,620
My house almost got flooded."

548
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,100
And that's working?

549
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:44,900
Liang Daiwen.

550
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,820
Have you realized that,

551
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,039
even though Gu Yi's treatment plan

552
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,140
is elementary at best,

553
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,879
and she's always

554
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,140
messing everything up,

555
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,259
you're still willing to cooperate?

556
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,180
If it were anyone else,

557
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,459
you'd have kicked them away.

558
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,660
That's not what I think.

559
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,979
It's just that seeing her

560
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,820
doing weird stuff every day

561
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,660
feels

562
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:17,779
kind of fun.

563
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:19,100
It's also

564
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,779
pretty cute.

565
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:34,979
Do you know what I'm going to say?

566
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,140
I shouldn't have brought her home.

567
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,979
On the contrary.

568
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,939
In fact, I think

569
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:55,739
that letting her stay

570
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,060
was a good decision on your part.

571
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:00,060
After all these years,

572
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:03,060
there's finally someone
who can create trouble for you.

573
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,060
But,

574
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,019
please stop her treatment plan,

575
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,420
or else my reputation will be at stake.

576
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,269
(Long Play Planet)

577
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:38,860
I have a voice actress friend

578
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:41,140
who occasionally does livestreaming
with a virtual avatar.

579
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,580
Virtual avatar livestreaming
is a new industry in China.

580
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,259
You do look attractive,

581
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,720
so it shouldn't be hard for you
to sign up with a company.

582
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,398
I've been to a few interviews
at companies

583
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,100
specializing in virtual avatars.

584
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,660
It's obvious that
their contracts are scams.

585
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,219
I'm too scared to sign up
with any of them.

586
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,299
I understand.

587
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:02,900
If that's your concern,

588
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,499
I can get my friend to ask around.

589
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,918
Given your skills,

590
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:09,060
you'll have a following
as soon as you attract interest.

591
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,958
(Hunan Normal University)
But once you do that,

592
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,440
they'll start checking your background.

593
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,019
Think carefully.

594
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,939
I know.

595
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:18,998
I can never hide away
from Layla's scandal.

596
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:20,980
I have a clear conscience, though.
They can do their research.

597
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,699
Okay.

598
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,299
Send me your resume.

599
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:28,799
My friend

600
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,438
has a

601
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:30,158
virtual band,

602
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,158
and he's planning to hold

603
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,459
a VR holographic concert.

604
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:33,718
I will be covering the event,

605
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:34,979
and I can let you join them.

606
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,779
A virtual band?

607
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,739
A girl group?

608
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,559
I'm bad at singing and dancing.

609
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,060
Why should I go?

610
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,100
Girl groups are all the rage now.

611
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,060
Virtual industries are
getting more developed.

612
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,779
You should follow the trend first.

613
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,299
That sounds good.

614
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,299
You'll foot the bill?

615
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:56,939
Sure.

616
00:34:01,235 --> 00:34:02,535
(Edit: Children's information)

617
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,066
(Your child's marital status?: Single)

618
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,739
What are you looking at?

619
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:14,379
I'm filling out this form
for a matchmaking app.

620
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:20,060
She's making you
research topics on blind dates?

621
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,958
Is Jacqueline trying

622
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:23,478
to train you

623
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,620
or make you miserable?

624
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:27,199
Writing what the boss wants

625
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,980
is my job as a copywriter.

626
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,739
I'm your boss, too.

627
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,080
You don't care when you
slack off in front of me.

628
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,819
She asked me to tag along.

629
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,859
Anyway, you two...

630
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,398
You...

631
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:40,259
I only

632
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,899
added her on WeChat

633
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,339
on the day she quit.

634
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,100
She said she wanted to ask me something.

635
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,739
Besides, she's your friend.

636
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,360
Helping her means helping you.

637
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,679
You're so nice to everyone.

638
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,419
No.

639
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,940
You're special to me.

640
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,940
How am I special?

641
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:02,339
(Comparing him to a human
is such a huge letdown.)

642
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,760
Let's play a script murder
game this afternoon.

643
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,518
Lu wrote the script.

644
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,940
I invited Guan Xingxin, too.

645
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,918
I'm too busy trying to hit my KPI.

646
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:24,060
You guys have fun.

647
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,660
It's a romance script.

648
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,940
Besides,

649
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:32,500
Liang Daiwen is coming.

650
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:33,899
Think about it.

651
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:38,140
(Fine, you win.)

652
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,438
Sure.

653
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,580
See you.

654
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,478
I'm joining a script murder game
with my friends later.

655
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:49,958
Want to join?

656
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:50,620
Sure.

657
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,020
Great.

658
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,020
We should restock the Macallans.

659
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,319
Sure.

660
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,759
Ten bottles, then.

661
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,299
No problem.

662
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,060
This tastes good.

663
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:10,819
This...

664
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:21,660
Gu Yi.

665
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,339
Have you realized yet?

666
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,739
Lu seems to be paying his debt off,

667
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,779
but he's actually just passing time.

668
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,259
Fuzzy and Ounce
are renting the same building.

669
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,660
It's usually a bar,

670
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,279
but when they're free,

671
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,359
they rent their space
to drama enthusiasts

672
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,540
for script reading.

673
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,180
It's a small circle.

674
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,100
They mostly stage Lu's scripts.

675
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,859
Today's show

676
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,620
is probably meant for you.

677
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,500
To prevent miracles from happening,

678
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:52,180
I'm prepared to kill myself.

679
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:56,299
I'm willing to work
day and night for you.

680
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:57,779
I'm willing to sacrifice

681
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,500
my reputation for you.

682
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,239
But,

683
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,339
a man

684
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,719
should never sacrifice
his own reputation.

685
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,998
And yet, thousands of women

686
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:08,100
have sacrificed
their reputation for men.

687
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,060
What you're thinking in your mind
and what you're saying now...

688
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,859
Gu Yi.

689
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:15,759
You're like a stupid child!

690
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,419
What kind of person is Yu Dule?

691
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,460
He...

692
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:23,980
He loves to joke around.

693
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,100
He's got a weird mind,

694
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:28,180
but he's very talented.

695
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,620
I met him at the TV station.

696
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:32,819
He's like a mentor to me.

697
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,500
He taught me how to edit videos.

698
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:38,339
But, since the TV station is
a government-authorized organization,

699
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,180
he was only paid

700
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,180
around 6000 yuan a month,

701
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,100
and he still couldn't
make a name for himself.

702
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,918
Due to his work's nature,

703
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:49,899
he wasn't interested in
producing variety shows.

704
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,759
That's why he's been
helping Lu running the bar

705
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,620
until now.

706
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,940
He's pretty popular
with the ladies, though.

707
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,580
He even has a nickname

708
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,500
called

709
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,060
Sexy Yu.

710
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:08,660
Yeah, he is pretty sexy.

711
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,219
But,

712
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,859
to me,

713
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,299
he's a big boy with
no complicated thoughts.

714
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:20,100
What about Lu?

715
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,460
Lu?

716
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,060
Lu...

717
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,038
Lu is an artistic, handsome guy.

718
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,620
He's also trustworthy.

719
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,020
But,

720
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,660
when a guy has kids

721
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,460
and fail to get their custody
after a divorce,

722
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,140
he can be obsessed about it.

723
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,060
Better not go too near him.

724
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:41,679
I think

725
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,379
both of them fancy you.

726
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,699
Is that so?

727
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,078
They didn't say anything.

728
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:50,739
Really?

729
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,620
How much is a bottle?

730
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,100
So I don't know anything.

731
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,100
You seem to have let go of the past.

732
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,980
Both Layla and Nala

733
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,460
are willing to waste their time on love,

734
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:13,299
but not me,

735
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,020
even though I'd love to.

736
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,020
Still, if you have

737
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,779
so many eligible suitors,

738
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,379
there's no time for heartbreak.

739
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:43,219
You're all here.

740
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,020
I thought you wouldn't be
interested in script murders.

741
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,940
I thought you're having
an open mic today.

742
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,478
The script we're reading today

743
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,100
is titled The Smile Seeker.

744
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,580
I wrote it myself.

745
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,940
It's a story of two girls who were
recipients of a cornea donation.

746
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,799
They grew up in a loving family,

747
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,199
but they got tired of life

748
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,159
and lost their smiles.

749
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,060
Eventually, they decided
to escape and hide.

750
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,679
Before we begin,

751
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,998
can someone introduce

752
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:19,940
this handsome guy here?

753
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,478
I'm Xu Guanrui.

754
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:23,438
I'm Gu Yi's colleague.

755
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:24,699
I'm a columnist in Nextmonday.

756
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,118
Xu Guanrui.

757
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:27,779
Xu Guanrui.

758
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,038
How old are you? Single?

759
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:29,998
How are you

760
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:30,779
related to Ms. Gu?

761
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:32,199
Mr. Yu, watch your words.

762
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,359
He's my boss too.

763
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,319
Yeah, and so am I.

764
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,839
You're...

765
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,739
I'm single.

766
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,419
Gu Yi is a comrade to me.

767
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:38,880
A revolutionary friendship.

768
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,779
I can vouch for him.

769
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,779
Xu Guanrui was helping me
this afternoon,

770
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,379
and I dragged Gu Yi all the way
from the marriage market.

771
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:49,219
Why were you at the marriage market?

772
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,478
Jacqueline made me.

773
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:55,339
She wanted me to experience love
as part of my work,

774
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,859
so she arranged me to go on blind dates.

775
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,319
When I went to the park today,

776
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,980
I was surrounded by
a bunch of old people.

777
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,319
I didn't know what to do.

778
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,339
An old lady even asked me

779
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,540
how much I was earning,

780
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:05,899
and I said, 50,000 yuan.

781
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,859
The old guy beside her was shocked.

782
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,739
"How do you earn 50,000 a month?"

783
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,060
I said, I'd just lie on the road,
get run over by cars,

784
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,699
and get compensated.

785
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:19,140
That's a good joke.

786
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:22,259
(Gu Yi.)

787
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:25,219
(Your crush is getting jealous.)

788
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,660
(How could you tell a joke
in front of him?)

789
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,620
Is that the punchline?

790
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,719
Okay, okay.

791
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,540
Let's read the script.

792
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:40,239
Lu, assign the roles.

793
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,379
I'll do it.

794
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:42,438
Gu,

795
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:43,859
you'll be one of the girls.

796
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,779
You can be her online date
who's about to ditch her in real life.

797
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,819
You'll be the other girl.

798
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,679
Yu.

799
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,259
You'll be her unreliable boyfriend

800
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,180
in the bar.

801
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:53,899
You have more lines,

802
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,580
so we can both play

803
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,980
her final partner, okay?

804
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,980
No.

805
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:00,100
This is awful.

806
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,140
Why should I act as
the unreliable boyfriend?

807
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,859
No way.

808
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:03,540
I want another role.

809
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:04,739
I'm not changing.

810
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,020
I'll take yours.

811
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,580
I haven't read the script.

812
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:09,699
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

813
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,620
Ms. Gu,

814
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:15,580
do you want to change your role?

815
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,899
(If we're bound to separate,)

816
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:22,140
(this will be my
desensitization practice.)

817
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:25,419
Shall we begin?

818
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:26,819
Let's start.

819
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,940
Are you there?

820
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:28,620
Yeah.

821
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:30,140
I've been waiting for you.

822
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,140
Why didn't you come?

823
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,699
I got held up.

824
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:33,859
I don't believe you.

825
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:35,819
Did I do anything wrong?

826
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,118
Ever since I sent you my photo,

827
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:39,500
you've been giving me the cold shoulder.

828
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,739
I ran out just to meet you,

829
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,819
but you didn't show up.

830
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,699
I think we're not compatible.

831
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,460
Let's not meet again.

832
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:51,819
Why?

833
00:42:52,919 --> 00:42:54,180
Because you're too ordinary.

834
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,899
I don't have feelings for you.

835
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,500
Stop.

836
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:10,960
She's supposed to be a girl

837
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,998
who's been pinning her life's hopes
on her online boyfriend,

838
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:16,038
yet got ditched because of her looks.

839
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:16,779
Lu.

840
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:19,118
That's such a lowly old trope.

841
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,799
You should let them continue.

842
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,078
There's a plot twist after that.

843
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,159
Twist what, their heads off?

844
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,518
Must you write such an awful script?

845
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,398
Awful?

846
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:26,558
No matter how dumb Gu Yi is,

847
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:27,779
you shouldn't let her play this role.

848
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,379
Yeah.

849
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:32,779
In fact, Liang's role
suits him too well.

850
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,460
He does look like a horrible man now.

851
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,739
Change her role.

852
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,980
(Liang Daiwen.)

853
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,060
(If you ever)

854
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,620
(recover your cognitive
and emotional abilities,)

855
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:45,299
(and see how ordinary I am,)

856
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,259
(would you)

857
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,540
(reject me like that too?)

858
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,359
I love you.

859
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,500
Stop.

860
00:43:59,280 --> 00:43:59,980
Well...

861
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:02,580
That line sounds so awkward.

862
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,918
You're not okay with everything.

863
00:44:03,919 --> 00:44:05,699
How is "I love you" awkward?

864
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:06,899
I...

865
00:44:07,959 --> 00:44:09,819
How about this, Guan Xingxin?

866
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,779
You can exchange scripts with Gu Yi.

867
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,620
It'll give you a fresh change, too.
Follow me.

868
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,500
I'm okay with it.

869
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:20,419
What about Liang?

870
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,000
(The Smile Seeker)

871
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,299
I love you.

872
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,100
Can you think of other important things?

873
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,219
No.

874
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,580
All I can think about is loving you

875
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:41,620
and missing you.

876
00:44:42,439 --> 00:44:43,500
I'm afraid of losing you.

877
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,980
You're crazy.

878
00:44:46,919 --> 00:44:48,799
I'm just a random stranger

879
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,180
who walked into this bar.

880
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,500
We just met.

881
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,060
But, when I laid my eyes on you,

882
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,379
I had this wonderful, strange feeling.

883
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:00,540
I feel like drinking
some strong booze for you.

884
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:08,998
What?

885
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:11,140
What are you doing?

886
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,660
Are you okay?

887
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:15,819
I'm fine.

888
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,940
Trying to grab her face, are you?

889
00:45:19,399 --> 00:45:20,259
Liang,

890
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,219
you're supposed to act as
a heartless boyfriend.

891
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,819
Now that Gu Yi is playing a new role,

892
00:45:24,999 --> 00:45:26,419
you're getting
protective of her instead?

893
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:28,100
Yeah.

894
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,078
She just...

895
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:29,998
Xu Guanrui

896
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:31,219
was doing a good job.

897
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,060
You literally yanked Gu Yi like a cat.

898
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:36,379
What's that hissing for?

899
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,078
That's enough.

900
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,339
Let's stop.

901
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,580
If we don't get serious,

902
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,060
Lu is going to regret
having us read his script.

903
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,620
Lu.

904
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:50,839
To be honest.

905
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,940
This kind of millennial love story

906
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,980
is not for you.

907
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:54,879
Come back.

908
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,339
Go back to writing jokes, okay?

909
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:58,660
Writing scripts is my expertise, okay?

910
00:45:59,160 --> 00:45:59,839
My ex-wife and I

911
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,540
met in a script writing class.

912
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,359
If not for our divorce,

913
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,540
I'd still be writing today.

914
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,239
I've always wanted to write

915
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,379
a script about young people.

916
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:11,859
After listening to
Guan Xingxin's experience,

917
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:12,859
I got some inspiration

918
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,299
and wrote the script.

919
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:15,398
To be honest,

920
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:16,500
even I felt embarrassed

921
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,339
after finishing the script.

922
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:21,779
But when I saw Xu Guanrui's acting,

923
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:22,940
I thought it was pretty nice.

924
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:25,299
No, you mean just nice.

925
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:27,899
After all,

926
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,819
love is a bizarre story

927
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:31,940
about charging in
without caring the consequences.

928
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,899
The only thing trapped
in reality is my current self.

929
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,100
My script can be even more childish.

930
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,940
Actually, I was planning

931
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:46,699
to close the theater for good

932
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,460
because

933
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:55,199
the rent here

934
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,339
is kind of a luxury

935
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,219
for a debt-ridden guy like me.

936
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,020
But, I just realized

937
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,580
that I could

938
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,140
always try to earn money.

939
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,140
As long as you'll all stay,

940
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,699
everything will be worth it.

941
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,100
People often tell me

942
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:17,440
that when you're in your middle age,
everything will start to go downhill.

943
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,500
I didn't understand,

944
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,020
and I didn't want to.

945
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:23,899
But now, I'm starting to understand

946
00:47:24,959 --> 00:47:26,859
that going downhill means

947
00:47:27,399 --> 00:47:29,799
that your energy and gusto

948
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,460
will be drained little by little.

949
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,419
Everything you once owned

950
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,779
will begin to fade.

951
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,460
Take me as an example.

952
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:41,219
I'm broke.

953
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:42,699
Debt-ridden.

954
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:44,859
Homeless.

955
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,819
Everyone looks down on me.

956
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,580
All I do is running this theater
to interact with the youngsters.

957
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,540
I think it's good, though.

958
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:56,319
Being able to hang out

959
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,100
with you guys

960
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,699
is enough.

961
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,140
Lu.

962
00:48:05,919 --> 00:48:06,739
How about this?

963
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,180
Gu Yi and I

964
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,899
will make a promise.

965
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:10,980
From now on,

966
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,020
we'll keep telling jokes

967
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,699
to keep Ounce afloat,

968
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,660
okay?

969
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,879
You can die alone.

970
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,739
Don't drag me down.

971
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,219
You're running away?

972
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:23,859
Well,

973
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,140
that's enough for today.

974
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,020
I guess we can't continue reading now.

975
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,219
Dismissed.

976
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,199
Return your scripts.

977
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,799
It's still pretty well-written,

978
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,319
right?

979
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:37,118
Xu Guanrui, let's talk.

980
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,899
Yu Dule.

981
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:40,339
