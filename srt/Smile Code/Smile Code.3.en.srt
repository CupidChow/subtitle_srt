00:05:16,672 --> 00:05:19,121

00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:09,802

00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:00,881
How did I end up
spending the night here?

78
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:05,001
Don't tell me you blacked out?

79
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,641
I didn't.

80
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:07,791
You, I, and Mr. Lu

81
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:08,962
were drinking over there.

82
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,911
You even won 800 yuan
through a lottery ticket, right?

83
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:11,521
That's right.

84
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,190

85
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:14,681
when they're related to money, huh?

86
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:17,480
If so, do you still remember
the incident with your housemates?

87
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:18,991
I do.

88
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,761
I drove two of them crazy.

89
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:22,070
As for the other one,

90
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:23,282
it's a long story.

91
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:26,201
It's no wonder

92
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:28,070
Liang Daiwen sent you back here

93
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:29,402
after sending you back home.

94
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:31,922
What are you saying? Stop joking.

95
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:35,242
You...

96
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,281
Don't tell me you blacked out for real?

97
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:38,962
What do you mean by that?

98
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:40,401
You know what I mean.

99
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:42,630
Yesterday, the three of us

100
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:43,630
were drinking over there.

101
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:44,900
When we left the door after drinking,

102
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,471
we encountered
Liang Daiwen doing his night jog.

103
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:47,602
You said nothing

104
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,082
and threw yourself at his feet.

105
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:50,030
After that,

106
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:50,670
Liang Daiwen

107
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:51,910
asked me for your address.

108
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:52,921
He sent you home.

109
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:56,001
After that, he sent you back here.
He said you should move out.

110
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:01,041
Don't tell me you forgot about it?

111
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:08,482
My goodness.

112
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,641
Are you the living Liang Daiwen?

113
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:12,720
Have you seen
a dead Liang Daiwen before?

114
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:14,521
Since fate has led us to each other,

115
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,962
I'll join you for your night jog!

116
00:09:29,072 --> 00:09:30,362
I'm done for!

117
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,281
What do you mean?

118
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:42,962
It's not that back.

119
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:44,442
I do think

120
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,482
that he's interested in you.

121
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:50,480
He was already kind enough
to give you a ride home.

122
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,720
After that, he reminded you
that your housemate was problematic.

123
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,121
He's concerned about you,
don't you think? That's great.

124
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,881
Yu Dule,

125
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:00,442
can you let me be dignified for once?

126
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:02,322
Just once is enough.

127
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:04,471
He already thought

128
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:05,761
that my jokes weren't funny.

129
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:07,001
Now,

130
00:10:07,671 --> 00:10:09,521
I'm utterly embarrassed.

131
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:13,682
It's not that bad,

132
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:14,761
So,

133
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:16,322
we should get to work first.

134
00:10:58,232 --> 00:10:59,281
Gu Yi.

135
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:01,801
What's wrong?

136
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:03,362
Are you sick?

137
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:05,202
Morning, Director.

138
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,442
Morning, Director.

139
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,401
We have a meeting at 6 P.M.

140
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:12,920
Would it be convenient for me to discuss
this topic with you in advance?

141
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:15,362
I'm new here. I'm not familiar
with the procedures yet.

142
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:16,921
Why don't you ask Ms. Zhang directly?

143
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:19,082
Ms. Zhang has a client to meet today.

144
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:21,881
Gu Yi, you should join us.

145
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:26,202
Gu Yi still has revisions to make
on the trend color draft.

146
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:28,602
She has to send it to our client
before 3 P.M.

147
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:30,362
3 P.M.?

148
00:11:31,352 --> 00:11:32,442
Wasn't it 5 P.M.?

149
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,041
The automatic office system
updated the time.

150
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:35,242
What?

151
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,362
So, you have time to do a talk show,

152
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,202
but you don't have time
to amend the draft?

153
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:44,161
How did you find out as well?

154
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:55,962
Yi,

155
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:57,842
you actually do talk shows after work?

156
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:00,362
Can you please don't bring this up
in the office?

157
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:01,790
There's no one else here.

158
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,121
Everyone in the world
knows about it now.

159
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:04,521
I'll stop, then.

160
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:05,242
Fine.

161
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:06,351
If you wish to come,

162
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,161
I'll reserve two tickets for you.

163
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:09,150
Miss.

164
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:10,602
Why should you employ me?

165
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,041
And now, my rate is
much higher than before.

166
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:17,080
You also know that Nextmonday
has been trying online integration

167
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,202
for the past few years.

168
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,591
Currently, magazines
can't feature anything

169
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:22,322
other than ads and promotions.

170
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:24,202
As for print media,
the purity is too high.

171
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:25,231
When there's a new trend,

172
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:26,521
it'll jeopardize our progress.

173
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:28,881
I agree.

174
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,401
But you haven't answered
my question yet.

175
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:35,440
Haven't music variety shows been popular
for the past few years?

176
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,831
I wish to create a column

177
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:38,082
for music.

178
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:39,921
Readership numbers don't matter.

179
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,191
What matters is

180
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:42,881
the synergy of omni-media channels
in the future.

181
00:12:43,072 --> 00:12:43,831
Understood.

182
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,482
That means I'll be the key
to your views.

183
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:47,082
You should consider it.

184
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:50,440
Actually, the terms are free
and easy for contributing writers such as you.

185
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,801
You don't need to come up with scripts.
The content department will help you out with that.

186
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,722
But you have to attend all events.

187
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,121
The content department?

188
00:12:57,992 --> 00:12:59,602
Last time, there was a person
who interviewed me.

189
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:00,311
That's Gu Yi.

190
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,041
Gu Yi, huh?

191
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,071
That's right. That's her.

192
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,602
Rest assured about
the quality of the script.

193
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:05,800
She's doing multiple jobs
at the same time, huh?

194
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,761
She'll perish under such pressure,
you know?

195
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,641
You don't understand her at all.

196
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:14,082
Look at her.

197
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:16,801
Does she look like
she's perishing under pressure?

198
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:20,161
You see, a female housemate of mine

199
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:23,442
likes to put sand in her room.

200
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:27,281
She said she wanted to take a sand bath
plus perform hot yoga at home.

201
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:48,851
(Liang Daiwen)

202
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:53,842
(Home Design, To Feel Good Than Look Good
Interviewer: Gu Yi)

203
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:03,801
Gu Yi,

204
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:05,951
how did you come up

205
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:07,921
with such exciting jokes?

206
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:10,202
You're

207
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:11,682
so intelligent!

208
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,001
Why didn't you go home?

209
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,362
Did Yu Dule tell you to move out?

210
00:15:31,952 --> 00:15:32,881
He did.

211
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:35,001
He even told me

212
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:38,362
that you sent me home
and sent me back to Ounce again.

213
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,041
It was a risk transfer.

214
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:44,641
I...

215
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:48,362
I didn't do anything strange to you,
right?

216
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:51,921
You suddenly jumped onto my back

217
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,722
and recite your jokes
when I was sending you home.

218
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:07,041
Was it that embarrassing
for me to send you home after you got drunk?

219
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:10,921
That's not it.

220
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:12,801
It's not too bad.

221
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:15,001
I'm glad to hear that.

222
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:23,641
I came here to collect materials.

223
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:25,521
What are you doing here?

224
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,150
You mentioned this garden in your jokes.

225
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:29,159
I came here to take a look.

226
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:30,921
I didn't expect

227
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:32,281
to encounter you again.

228
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:35,962
Sounds like you don't like
to encounter me.

229
00:16:36,631 --> 00:16:37,682
You can leave, then.

230
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:40,921
Goodbye.

231
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:44,991
Sorry about that.

232
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:46,001
Sorry about that.

233
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:55,390

However, you have

how to be hot and cold?

260
00:18:19,071 --> 00:18:19,922
From

261
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:21,682
TV dramas.

262
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:31,001
Let's go.

263
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:55,151
Actually,

264
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:56,922
you didn't need to send me home.

266
00:18:59,232 --> 00:19:01,202
He won't do anything to me.

267
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,281
I think the lamp is broken.

268
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:13,041
Why aren't you singing?

269
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,162
Singing? What do you mean?

270
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,162
Woohoo!

271
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:23,521
How did you know about that?

272
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:25,281
You sang it before.

273
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:27,081
There's one more song.

274
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:29,030
So, I've arrived home.

275
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:30,882
I'll head upstairs first.

276
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:42,321
Door unlocked.

277
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:46,680
You still know
that this is your home, huh?

278
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:47,911
This is none of your business.

279
00:19:47,912 --> 00:19:49,242
How is this none of my business?

280
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:52,242
That guy who carried you
back home last night, who is he to you?

281
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:55,722
If I must say,

282
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:57,841
we should confirm our relationship
as soon as possible.

283
00:19:57,952 --> 00:19:58,911
This way, those scoundrels

284
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:00,561
wouldn't dare to harass you.

285
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:01,402
Am I right?

286
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:02,962
Mind your actions.

287
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:05,162
It's you again?

288
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:07,722
What? Are you not done
taking advantage of her?

289
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:09,841
You carried her back again, huh?

290
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:11,521
What? Are you her mount?

291
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:15,122
We have evidence of
the person taking advantage of her now.

292
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:17,280
She won't be living here in the future.

293
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:18,940
If you keep this up,
I'll call the cops on you.

294
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:20,830
What are you saying?

295
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:21,790
We're a family.

296
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,242
Tell him. Aren't we a family?

297
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:24,191
Hey, you...

298
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:24,871
Go away.

299
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:26,122
What do you mean by that?

300
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,911
Why are you bringing him inside?

301
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:29,122
This is our home, you know? You...

302
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:30,521
Open the door!

303
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:32,482
You shouldn't bring outsiders
to our home!

304
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:36,001
Operation failed.

305
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:42,321
You...

306
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:56,482
Liang Daiwen.

307
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:00,521
Don't you have anything to say to me?

308
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:05,202
Your house is messier than I thought.

309
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:11,671
The customs
should've confiscated your mouth

310
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,041
when they were checking you.

311
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,202
You dare to say
that he was trash-talking?

312
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:17,790
You announced
that I would be moving out.

313
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:18,722
What did you mean by that?

314
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:21,231
Which part of me made you think
I've got enough money

315
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:22,442
to move?

316
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:23,442
I...

317
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,081
I can tell that you can't.

318
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,321
Did you see that hospital?

319
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:41,202
If you do infuriate me to death,

320
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:43,521
remember to call 120
so that they can collect my body.

321
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:56,521
Your cactus is actually dying.

322
00:21:56,751 --> 00:21:59,242
Can't you tell that I'm dying as well?

323
00:22:02,192 --> 00:22:03,041
Did you see this?

324
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:06,642
This was supposed to be the perfect day
for me to get promoted and move.

325
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:08,841
But now, my promotion is jeopardized.

326
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:10,720
A salary increase
is out of the question as well.

327
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:12,922
How can I move when I'm penniless?

328
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:15,801
Do you think I'm willing
to stay in such a crappy unit?

329
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:21,001
Sorry.

330
00:22:21,351 --> 00:22:22,962
Maybe I'm being nosy over here.

331
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:25,122
But if you continue to stay here,

332
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:27,281
you'll only expose yourself
to more danger.

333
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:30,601
So, you're concerned about me, huh?

334
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:34,962
Maybe.

335
00:22:40,872 --> 00:22:42,682
I'm not forcing you to make a choice.

336
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:45,922
However, your housemates
are pretty weird.

337
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:48,922
Avoiding them alone
won't resolve your issues.

338
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,482
Getting a promotion
and a salary increase

339
00:22:50,632 --> 00:22:52,202
aren't as important
as your personal safety.

340
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,922
I also know that avoiding them alone
won't resolve my issues.

341
00:22:57,591 --> 00:22:59,361
But now, I'm in too much debt.

342
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:01,070
Moving to another place

343
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,081
is as tough as taking on
a Level Nine Fire Phoenix.

344
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:05,841
I understand.

345
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:08,240
A fallen phoenix
is worse than a chicken, right?

346
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,642
There's a whetstone in the kitchen.

347
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:14,761
I should use it to shut you up.

348
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,122
Is it a burden?

349
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:24,151
Burden?

350
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,231
Is that the only thing you know?

351
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:27,001
I don't have that much burden.

352
00:23:27,392 --> 00:23:28,510
You think it's a burden to me.

353
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:30,801
But I'm the one suffering here.

354
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,801
How can I still
live in this unit after this?

355
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:37,560
(Say goodbye to shared rental)
What if Liu Qingchun comes back?

356
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:41,242
This is so infuriating.

357
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:44,202
Just let me die.

358
00:23:46,031 --> 00:23:48,402
This is so annoying!

359
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,561
You need a place to stay, huh?

360
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:04,561
You don't say?

361
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,321
Why don't you stay at my house?

362
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:18,361
You...

363
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:19,722
Are you serious?

364
00:24:22,952 --> 00:24:24,431
You said the best thing to give a friend

My house will do.

Of course, this is just a suggestion.

Don't take outsiders home!

That's not it.

Why are you helping me out?

424
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:58,402
I analyzed your situation.

00:28:59,192 --> 00:29:01,122
I realize
that you need help at this moment.

426
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:03,841
Is that all?

427
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:05,442
That is all.

428
00:29:06,551 --> 00:29:07,761
I only analyze reality.

429
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:09,162
I never act with emotions.

430
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:11,202
Mr. Liang,

431
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:14,442
is your brain made out of chips?

432
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:22,162
You wouldn't want to know
what my brain was made of.

433
00:29:57,192 --> 00:29:58,122
1402.

434
00:29:58,271 --> 00:29:59,841
The password is 001402.

435
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:01,480
Head upstairs and unlock the door first.

436
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:03,482
You want me to head upstairs first?

437
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,482
You want to move them all by yourself?

438
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:07,122
That'd be too embarrassing for me.

439
00:30:07,312 --> 00:30:08,962
I'm not telling you
to head upstairs empty-handed.

440
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:12,122
Take your stuff while you're at it.

441
00:30:33,992 --> 00:30:35,202
Now, I have new materials

442
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:37,281

443
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,041
Remember to tell me the jokes.

444
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:42,962
Mr. Liang,

445
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:45,590
are you interested in stand-up comedy?

446
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:47,402
Or are you merely interested
in my jokes?

447
00:30:48,351 --> 00:30:50,001
I'm interested in the slogan
of the comedy club,

448
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:52,001
"The human soul only weighs one ounce."

449
00:30:53,712 --> 00:30:55,521
I think I have an ounce of soul as well.

450
00:30:56,351 --> 00:30:57,722
I need to find it myself.

451
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:06,001

Why are you blushing?

457
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,310
I'm radiating with vigor.

458
00:32:54,311 --> 00:32:56,882
(Why are you trying to be funny now?)

459
00:32:56,992 --> 00:32:59,191
(Female comedians
don't deserve love at all.)

460
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:00,162
Is that a burden to you?

461
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:04,761
Sorry about that.

462
00:33:04,872 --> 00:33:06,242
It was a conditioned reflex.

463
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:46,510
Your hobbies

464
00:33:46,511 --> 00:33:48,001
are quite unique.

465
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:51,310
My friend said that keeping pets

466
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:53,962
helps with mental health
and can also cultivate one's character.

467
00:33:58,392 --> 00:34:00,561
By pets, I think your friend

468
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:02,682
was referring to them.

469
00:34:09,912 --> 00:34:12,122
Were you the one who launched
a sneak attack at me?

470
00:34:13,872 --> 00:34:15,881
I thought of keeping
a South American spider.

471
00:34:16,151 --> 00:34:18,002
But I gave up when I knew
I had to feed it with cockroaches.

472
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:20,361
They were wandering nearby.

473
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:21,602
That's why I brought them back.

474
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:24,002
Just like how you brought me back.

475
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:27,562
I was joking.

476
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:28,722
Do they have names?

477
00:34:30,912 --> 00:34:31,801
Daju.

478
00:34:31,872 --> 00:34:32,801
Erju.

479
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:34,082
Sanju.

480
00:34:34,111 --> 00:34:34,921
Siju.

481
00:34:35,952 --> 00:34:36,642
Wuju.

482
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:40,522
There's only one orange cat.

483
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:43,002
Why is the name orange
in all of their names?

484
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:45,042
I reared a dog before this.

485
00:34:45,312 --> 00:34:46,481
It had orange in its name too.

486
00:34:48,031 --> 00:34:49,242
But it got depressed.

487
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:51,042
Someone else adopted it.

488
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:54,401
We're kindred spirits.

489
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:56,110
The cactus I kept

490
00:34:56,111 --> 00:34:57,961
was barely surviving.

491
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:07,522
Daju, Eeju, Sanju, Siju,

492
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:08,921
Wuju,

493
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:10,522
nice to meet you guys.

494
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:11,682
I'm a part of the family now.

495
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,961
Let's get along in the future.

496
00:35:32,832 --> 00:35:33,722
Mr. Liang,

497
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:36,110
do you have OCD when it comes

498
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:37,682
to arranging the cat bowls?

499
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,082
Red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo, violet.

500
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:43,961
The first five colors of the rainbow

501
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:45,082
is easy to remember.

502
00:35:45,832 --> 00:35:47,682
If so, I need an indigo bowl.

503
00:35:59,392 --> 00:36:00,361
That's another burden.

504
00:36:14,151 --> 00:36:15,722
The company rented this unit for me.

505
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:16,921
I've already paid the deposit.

506
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:18,881
No dismantling,
smashing, or modifications.

507
00:36:19,631 --> 00:36:20,961
I rarely cook usually.

508
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:22,281
There's nothing in the refrigerator.

509
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:23,841
You can order for food delivery

510
00:36:24,071 --> 00:36:25,522
or get your takeaways.

511
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:27,042
Just dispose of the rubbish on time.

512
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:29,881
Both the washing machine
and dryer are inside the bathroom.

513
00:36:29,912 --> 00:36:31,122
I've cleaned up the room for you.

514
00:36:31,392 --> 00:36:32,841
The new bedding set is in the wardrobe.

515
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:34,700
The housekeeper will
clean them periodically.

516
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:37,122
I can just sleep on the sofa.

517
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:39,321
Your cats are sleeping on the sofa too.

518
00:36:40,671 --> 00:36:42,162
The study room is also my workshop.

519
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:43,481
I'm used to locking it up.

520
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:44,441
Don't mind it.

521
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,440
I've set the air conditioner
to a constant temperature. Don't adjust it.

522
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:48,642
Okay.

523
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:49,682
Don't worry.

524
00:36:50,111 --> 00:36:52,361
I'll thrive wildly while
following the regulations.

525
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,361
Leave the kittens to me as well.

526
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:58,002
Make yourself at home.

527
00:36:58,352 --> 00:36:59,321
I'll make a move first.

528
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:31,682
This design

529
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:34,002
doesn't make sense at all.

530
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:13,761
I wonder if the robot can sleep well

531
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:16,202
after moving to another charging port?

532
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:30,162
Erju.

533
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:34,602
A stray cat like me has a home now!

535
00:41:34,511 --> 00:41:36,682
What clients are featured
in next week's headline?

536
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:39,841
The domestic beauty brand
Radiance Series,

537
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,110
a smart desk lamp brand,

538
00:41:41,111 --> 00:41:42,230
and a reading APP.

539
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:44,202
They'll be featured between
Tuesday and Friday.

540
00:41:44,591 --> 00:41:47,642
On Monday, there will be a post
related to youth.

541
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,441
It'll serve to attract
potential customers.

542
00:41:50,432 --> 00:41:51,961
What is the theme of the post?

543
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,321
The initial draft is...

544
00:41:55,832 --> 00:41:57,841
The new consumption mindset
of current youths.

545
00:41:58,191 --> 00:41:58,791
That's lame.

546
00:41:58,792 --> 00:41:59,881
It's not memorable at all.

547
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:02,550
There are plenty of magazines in the company
that bypass the "wall" every month.

548
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:03,871
You guys are also allowed
to gather materials outside.

549
00:42:03,872 --> 00:42:04,871
How come you guys are still
only capable of coming up

550
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:05,791
with topics
that only outline the basics?

551
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:07,602
I have nothing to say to you.

552
00:42:11,272 --> 00:42:12,471
The main thing here is the ability
to deliver news with passion.

553
00:42:12,472 --> 00:42:13,361
Stay there and don't move.

554
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:14,481
What do the readers desire?

555
00:42:14,551 --> 00:42:15,642
What do our clients desire?

556
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:17,881
That's the true goal we're after.

557
00:42:19,952 --> 00:42:20,751
Sorry about this.

558
00:42:20,752 --> 00:42:21,961
I need to head out for a second.

559
00:42:24,031 --> 00:42:24,841
Go ahead.

560
00:42:28,872 --> 00:42:30,002
Let's continue.

561
00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:34,481
Welcome.

562
00:42:39,752 --> 00:42:41,070
I was talking about my divorce with her.

563
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:43,361
I just didn't expect to see you here.

564
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:44,841
Listen to me.

565
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:46,880
I'll call the cops on you
if you keep this up!

566
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,122
Baby, it's my fault.

567
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,202
I'm begging you.

568
00:42:49,752 --> 00:42:52,361
I always wanted to tell you about her.

569
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:53,550
We got married

570
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:55,002
after going on a blind date.

571
00:42:55,151 --> 00:42:55,951
We have no children.

572
00:42:55,952 --> 00:42:56,881
We don't love each other.

573
00:42:57,591 --> 00:42:58,670
I truly have feelings for you.

574
00:42:58,671 --> 00:42:59,431
Chen Yijin,

575
00:42:59,432 --> 00:43:00,921
can you be a decent human for once?

576
00:43:00,952 --> 00:43:02,801
Although you have no shame,
I still have my dignity.

577
00:43:03,472 --> 00:43:04,841
We've been together for a long time.

578
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:06,230
Must you break up with me?

579
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:08,002
I've already broken up with you.

580
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:10,281
I kept your dignity intact
because I felt sorry for your wife.

581
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:12,960
If you have the time to find me, why don't you
ead back and console her instead?

582
00:43:13,711 --> 00:43:15,791
Don't tell me you think
that you're a victim?

583
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:17,082
You must've lost your mind!

584
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:20,761
Guan Xingxin, you better cherish
the respect I'm showing you here.

585
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,162
Let me put it this way.

586
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:24,642
If news of

587
00:43:24,832 --> 00:43:25,871
our relationship gets out,

588
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:27,881
do you think any of us
can escape unscathed?

589
00:43:32,352 --> 00:43:33,670
Are you crazy?

590
00:43:33,671 --> 00:43:35,642
I'll show you crazy
if you dare to come here again!

591
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:43,202
That crazy woman.

592
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:22,401
Why did you press the doorbell
before coming inside?

593
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:23,590
Did you forget your password

594
00:44:23,591 --> 00:44:24,841
after going out?

595
00:44:25,352 --> 00:44:26,961
I came back to take some clothes.

596
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,000
I was worried
that the timing might be inappropriate.

597
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,722
Liang Daiwen!

598
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,242
It's fine.

599
00:44:53,551 --> 00:44:55,361
I often roll off the sofa as well.

600
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:57,722
Why don't you...

601
00:44:59,231 --> 00:45:00,441
You should

602
00:45:00,472 --> 00:45:01,401
move back

603
00:45:01,472 --> 00:45:02,921
and live here together with me.

604
00:45:06,551 --> 00:45:07,562
You don't mind

605
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:09,361
living together with me?

606
00:45:10,671 --> 00:45:11,921
I don't.

607
00:45:12,272 --> 00:45:13,871
I've been to your office before.

608
00:45:13,872 --> 00:45:15,281
Your sofa was quite small.

609
00:45:15,551 --> 00:45:17,642
The size is too small for you.

610
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:21,321
Good friends have to be understanding
with each other.

611
00:45:21,432 --> 00:45:23,441
Don't let me presence
affect your daily life.

612
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:28,761
Alright.

613
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:30,522
I'll go and get changed first.

614
00:45:40,432 --> 00:45:43,642
(We're living together!)

615
00:45:54,732 --> 00:45:56,348
(Layla, the mistress)

616
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:57,608
(Layla, the mistress)

617
00:45:57,609 --> 00:45:59,084
(Layla is actually a mistress)

618
00:45:59,095 --> 00:46:01,267
(The actress, Layla,
is actually a mistress?)

619
00:46:01,268 --> 00:46:03,518
(Layla, the cheating mistress.)

620
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:05,643
(Layla got to her position by
having an affair. Shameless woman.)

621
00:46:05,644 --> 00:46:07,094
(I didn't expect her to be like this.
Shameless woman. Let's expose her deed.)

622
00:46:07,095 --> 00:46:10,545
(Women like her have
to ruin other people's families.)

623
00:46:12,215 --> 00:46:14,425
(The all-evil mistress.)

624
00:46:14,812 --> 00:46:16,654
(I'm Chen Yijin's wife.
I know that I'm not perfect.)

625
00:46:16,655 --> 00:46:19,160
(I'm past my prime, and I've lost
both my husband and child.)

626
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,011
(My goodness. She harmed
other people's child as a mistress.)

627
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,229
(She's so evil.)
