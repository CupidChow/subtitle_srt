(Gu Yi, female, 27 years old.)

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,071
(Graduated from Journalism and
Communication at Donghai University.)

27
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,470
(I'm a senior copywriter
in Nextmonday fashion magazine)

28
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:23,430
(with five years of experience.)

29
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,391
(I'm open-minded,)

30
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,551
(have a sharp perspective,)

31
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,671
(full of passion,)

32
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,111
(able to plan a special topic
independently,)

33
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,030
(compose my own articles,)

34
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,232
(capable of making excellent proposals,
and have good communication skills.)

(Emotionally stable)

36
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:00,470
(and vengeful.)

37
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:07,750
Mi,

38
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,351
proceed with the apparel proposal
for the advertisement.

39
00:03:10,351 --> 00:03:10,991
All right.

40
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,750
The topic of the meeting.

41
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:17,111
Gu Yi.

42
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,870
You're going to send a parcel?

43
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:20,271
Right. Thank you so much.

44
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,448
It's fine. You're welcome.

45
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,271
Mi,

46
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:27,951
I'll verify it with Ms. Zhang.

47
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:28,710
Okay.

48
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,231
She's working too hard.

49
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:37,791
Harder than the superior.

50
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,630
Is something good happening to her?

51
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,030
Why is she so pumped up?

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,960
(Director's Office, Jacqueline)

53
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:03,736
You've done your work very well,

54
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:05,190
but your condition is bad.

55
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,671
I won't ask you

56
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,271
to be heartless like me.

57
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:15,271
Everyone feels down

58
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,630
and faces hardships.

59
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,696
But if you push yourself to be efficient

60
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:20,150
just because you're heartbroken,

61
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,471
that seems more unstable

62
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:23,430
than the last strength
before dying to me.

63
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:28,551
I'm good.

64
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:29,950
I'm not heartbroken.

65
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,870
I'm not upset.

66
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,671
I'm calm.

67
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,591
Penny said you rejected
writing for Boya.

68
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:37,950
The client insists

69
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,351
so she decides to get someone
to write it

70
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:40,671
under your name.

71
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:42,151
No.

72
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,031
Didn't you say you're calm?

73
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:46,136
Why are you so worked up?

74
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:52,031
I know I can't intervene
with the company's decision,

75
00:04:52,911 --> 00:04:54,950
but if the Deputy Director insists,

76
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:56,471
I'll hand in my notice.

77
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,510
You want to resign?

78
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,711
Is it because of the script
or the man?

79
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,711
Neither.

80
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,510
I can't go against my own will.

81
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:07,911
When Guan Xingxin was attacked
by malicious comments,

82
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:08,791
you said

83
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:11,031
it wasn't the heretics who were burned

84
00:05:11,031 --> 00:05:12,551
but the one who started the fire.

85
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,111
I don't want to rub it in.

86
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,111
The Liang Daiwen I know

87
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,351
would never commit plagiarism.

88
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:23,288
You can turn down the script,

89
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:24,510
but don't resign.

90
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,551
Penny thought she had mastered
the media game

91
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:32,430
and wanted to please the client
with this momentum.

92
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:35,990
She also knows the first to take action
will pay the price,

93
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:37,270
but she aims for too much

94
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,551
and wants to take the chance.

95
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:39,830
Well, I'll let her try.

96
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:41,470
Anyway, Nextmonday has never gone wrong

97
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,791
under my charge.

98
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,630
You're my people.

99
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,671
Stay out of this trouble.

100
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,430
Are you saying

101
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,471
that I don't have to write,

102
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,870
and Penny can't use my name either?

103
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,551
You'll get used to it
after seeing many conflicts.

104
00:05:57,551 --> 00:06:00,430
Zhang Qingya found your weakness,

105
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,430
and that's Liang Daiwen.

106
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,190
Before you can

107
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,630
keep your emotions in check,

108
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:06,991
you'll only remain a senior copywriter.

109
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:08,430
All right.

110
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:09,551
As for now,

111
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,991
you'll work from home

112
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:12,591
to stall Penny.

113
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,991
Tell her you're helping out
Xu Guanrui with his interview.

114
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:16,991
Talk to Xu Guanrui yourself.

115
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:21,750
All right.

116
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:24,390
Thank you.

117
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:25,911
Thank me for what?

118
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,390
You should thank

119
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,151
your conscience.

120
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,830
Let me remind you.

121
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,510
You're working from home,

122
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:37,991
not on holiday.

123
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:38,630
By the way,

124
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,152
the advertisement quota

125
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:42,150
for Art List's bypass
social media account is still open.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,360
Boost the followers to 500,000

127
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,791
before the merger.

128
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:47,031
Afterward,

129
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,791
I'll promote you to Deputy Director.

130
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,551
500,000?

131
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,070
It seems like
you're giving me false hope.

132
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:56,791
I'm motivating you.

133
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,351
Love, like a roaring flood,

134
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:00,510
is a disaster.

135
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,310
Only a small dose of love is a panacea.

136
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,991
Focus on your work,

137
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,711
and leave everything to time.

138
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:08,952
Bear this in mind:

139
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:10,671
Do your best,

140
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:12,750
and let destiny decide.

141
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:19,630
Mr. Huang,

142
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,031
can you not ask to meet me
on such short notice?

143
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,870
The time you gave me

144
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:25,551
only allowed me to wash my face.

145
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,471
You still look pretty

146
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:28,392
without makeup.

147
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:30,950
I just came by

148
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,111
to say a few words.

149
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:36,872
I don't drink sugary drinks.

150
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:40,911
I heard you've been trying out

151
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,351
many virtual live-streaming companies.

152
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,016
It's useless to go back
to the same old path.

153
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,712
Do you have your own self-media account?

154
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,231
Create one if not.

155
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:51,351
The key is

156
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,471
to live stream with your real identity.

157
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:54,696
You can do anything you want

158
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,911
as long as you show your true self.

159
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:58,310
Using my own image?

160
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,911
Don't you know
what happened to me before?

161
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:03,750
Do you think I'm not embarrassed enough?

162
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,351
Why don't you just parade me around?

163
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,630
You did nothing wrong.
Why are you afraid?

164
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,056
Those netizens wouldn't care about
who's right or wrong.

165
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,591
That's easy for you to say.

166
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:14,104
I still have my dignity,
even if you don't.

167
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:27,911
Guan Xingxin,

168
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:29,991
listen up.

169
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,390
Zhang Junjie can talk to me that way,

170
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:33,991
but you

171
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:35,831
are not in the same position.

172
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,591
I'm your superior,

173
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:40,711
understand?

174
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,951
I won't waste my effort

175
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:45,030
on an artist who only plays
as a virtual performer.

176
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:48,030
PR is only a backup plan for you.

177
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,351
I need to see how far you can go.

178
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:52,952
Otherwise, if something unpleasant
happens in the future,

179
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:54,030
you can slip off easily.

180
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,510
I still need to survive
in this industry.

181
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,550
Sorry,

182
00:08:57,672 --> 00:08:58,472
I won't do anything

183
00:08:58,552 --> 00:08:59,768
that would ruin my reputation.

184
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:02,351
Speaking of which,

185
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:05,030
when you were the Deputy Director
at Nextmonday,

186
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,200
you didn't feel ashamed of that.

187
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,030
You just wanted to be

188
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:09,590
the center of attention, didn't you?

189
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,951
You won't succeed
unless you're tough enough.

190
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,071
Xu Guanrui said you were prepared.

191
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,750
It seems you didn't tell him honestly.

192
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:22,351
I'm prepared,

193
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:23,471
but I can't always tie myself

194
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:24,591
to scandals.

195
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,351
It's that man who should be ashamed,

196
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:27,711
not you.

197
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,111
But if I show up now,

198
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,471
people still think I'm a homewrecker.

199
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,150
Get over yourself.

200
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:41,711
The Internet

201
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,510
is bombarded with all kinds of news
every day.

202
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,990
Those who've trended on social media

203
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:47,951
are more than Layla's followers.

204
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,471
The netizens

205
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:50,870
are busy.

206
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,111
Your scandal is trivial. Don't worry.

207
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,231
No one will remember it forever.

208
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,191
Do you have to be so obnoxious?

209
00:09:57,191 --> 00:09:59,030
As long as you remember what I say.

210
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:04,552
Do the live streaming tonight.

211
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,064
If anything goes wrong,
I'll terminate it.

212
00:10:23,351 --> 00:10:24,111
Remember.

213
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,030
Be Guan Xingxin.

214
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,111
No disguise.

215
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,991
I think it's fine.

216
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:53,816
Hand it to Jacqueline for review.

217
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:54,951
All right.

218
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:57,030
One more thing.

219
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:00,431
Ms. Zhang suggested

220
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,231
that I apply to work from home for now.

221
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:05,064
The reason for the request
is to assist you with your interview.

222
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,471
Understood.

223
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,390
Make sure we tell the same story.

224
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:13,390
Why didn't you ask me why?

225
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:15,688
It's because of Liang Daiwen,

226
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:16,030
right?

227
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:20,870
I understand.

228
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,030
Though I don't quite approve

229
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:24,510
of him,

230
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,111
I believe he wouldn't commit plagiarism.

231
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:29,951
Boya wants you to write an article.

232
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
Perhaps they have something in mind.

233
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:33,831
Jacqueline is protecting you.

234
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,630
I know.

235
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,191
Gu Yi,

236
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,064
are you all right?

237
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,111
I'm good.

238
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:47,144
Tell me the truth.

239
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:52,390
Well, the truth...

240
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:55,550
The truth is

241
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:56,951
I feel relieved.

242
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:00,431
I told you,

243
00:12:01,231 --> 00:12:02,351
liking Liang Daiwen

244
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,831
was like picking a star.

245
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:07,071
Since I was a kid,

246
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,550
I've always had to give my utmost effort

247
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,390
to get what I wanted.

248
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,790
I've never been lucky,

249
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:16,431
so I knew

250
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,790
nothing would happen
between Liang Daiwen and me.

251
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,991
Good things

252
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,670
just don't happen to me.

253
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,831
Don't think like that.

254
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,790
It's not your fault.

255
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:35,390
Love is about timing.

256
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:36,870
If the timing is wrong,

257
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:38,390
both sides get hurt.

258
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:43,790
Comrade,

259
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:46,711
let go,

260
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,670
and you'll see a full sky of stars.

261
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,831
Perhaps one of them

262
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,790
is coming your way.

263
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:57,951
All right. Go have fun.

264
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,030
Thanks.

265
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,591
Let me answer the questions
from the friends in the live stream.

266
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:23,270
That's right. I'm Layla.

267
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,150
"You're surprisingly pretty."

268
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,311
Thank you.

269
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:30,951
Well,

270
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:33,410
I don't sell products, explain myself,
or engage in any explicit content.

271
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,190
A netizen called "Drop Dead" says,

272
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:38,150
"When I saw you,

273
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,231
I'd planned where to bury
after passing."

274
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,390
Sorry.

275
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:43,510
I bring bad luck to men.

276
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,991
I plan to scatter my ashes in the sea.

277
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,351
A netizen who rewarded a rocket,

278
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,870
named "Heartbroken 20 Days"

279
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,191
says,

280
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:55,270
"I don't get why my ugly boyfriend

281
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,071
(A netizen called "Drop Dead" says,)
cheats on me."

282
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:57,948
("When I first saw you, I've already)
Why even think about it?

283
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:58,550
(planned where to bury after passing.)

284
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,111
(Sorry. I bring bad luck to men.)
Appearance doesn't matter in love.

285
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,910
(I plan to scatter my ashes in the sea.)
Give handsome guys a chance.

286
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,110
It's not necessarily true
that ugly boyfriends are more loyal.

287
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:08,591
All right.

288
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:10,750
That's all for today's live streaming.

289
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,870
Let's meet again

290
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,750
if you want to talk to me.

291
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:14,790
Bye.

292
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:21,591
Drink this. I only have this.

293
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,030
No thanks.

294
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:25,991
Why did you suddenly start doing this?

295
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,870
Huang Wenda wanted me to give it a try.

296
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:30,270
He's now working with Xu Guanrui

297
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,910
on my matter.

298
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,030
I guess Jacqueline made this happen.

299
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,750
This PR guy is acting like my manager.

300
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,550
Anyway, he does make some sense.

301
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,311
Enough about him.

302
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,550
Are you

303
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,270
all right?

304
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,630
I...

305
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,270
Pretty good.

306
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:56,951
People always say

307
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:58,191
it won't feel good after a breakup,

308
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,431
but I think I'm doing pretty good.

309
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,150
When I saw him

310
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:07,231
holding a ticket to Dalian
at the airport,

311
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,191
I was truly furious.

312
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:12,231
But after a while, I got over it.

313
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:15,191
He lied to me,

314
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:17,870
so I don't feel as obsessed anymore.

315
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:25,951
There's something

316
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,670
I want to tell you.

317
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:31,951
Shen told me

318
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,150
not to tell anyone,

319
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,111
but I think

320
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,870
it's different from patient privacy.

321
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:38,431
It's fine to tell you this.

322
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,870
What happened to him?

323
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:44,591
Has his condition worsened?

324
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,510
Or something went wrong
with his new job?

325
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:51,390
Liang didn't get the job.

326
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,550
Someone purposely spread
the plagiarism issue

327
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,870
to Souxun,

328
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,550
and his resume was blocked
at headquarters.

329
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:03,630
Liang went back to his hometown, Dalian,

330
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,231
because his dad
had a cerebral infarction.

331
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,111
He rushed back

332
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:09,870
to see his dad for the last time.

333
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,030
Luckily, his dad was rescued.

334
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:16,750
I heard Liang has been in the hospital

335
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:18,471
these days.

336
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,071
His condition is bad.

337
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,630
He can't eat

338
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:23,390
and only relies on painkillers.

339
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:26,951
I think

340
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:28,471
he didn't mean to hide it from you.

341
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,711
It's just that

342
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:32,510
his robotic brain must've broken down

343
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,150
after going through so much

344
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,191
all of a sudden.

345
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:47,670
Hey.

346
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:50,191
Look at her. She looks silly.

347
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,510
Isn't it the same as Liang Daiwen?

348
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,591
No.

349
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,991
Liang Daiwen doesn't laugh.

350
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:58,584
She's on the brink of losing it.

351
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:02,711
Ms. Gu,

352
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,030
I know

353
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:05,711
that being heartbroken

354
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,951
takes away one's creativity,

355
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,911
but I think

356
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:11,191
you need to do an Open Mic now.

357
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,991
If this doesn't work,

358
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:15,231
you can try writing scripts

359
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,070
for stand-up comedy
variety shows, right?

360
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,911
Don't let such precious material

361
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,030
go to waste.

362
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:21,151
Yu Dule,

363
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:21,991
shut up.

364
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,631
Mr. Yu,

365
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,110
can I borrow your scooter?

366
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,350
Why?

367
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:31,350
I want to go for a ride.

368
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:45,464
Don't do silly things.

369
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,431
Thanks.

370
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:48,711
Be careful.

371
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,080
(ID, Name: Gu Yi)

372
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:14,911
It's you again.

373
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,431
Why are you speeding

374
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,631

Me?

00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,471
I'm talking to you.

378
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:22,712
Don't try to slip off.

379
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,110
Mind you.

380
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:23,871
Listen up,

00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:24,830
you won't get away.

382
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,752
Turn off the scooter

383
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,312

even though you're busy with work,

404
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:54,190
you should spend time

She's been down these days.

00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:02,191
She was crying so sadly just now.

I'm so sorry for troubling you.

419
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:32,590
I didn't dare call Yu Dule.

420
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:35,270

So awkward.

427
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,711
Say something.

428
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:01,991
I've been arguing with Huang Wenda

429
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:03,110
over

430
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,024

Mr. Huang

432
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:09,631
wants her to show
her true self to the public.

433
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:11,750
Isn't that the typical
image-reversing trick?

434
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,991
If it weren't for Jacqueline,

435
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:16,070
I would've called him out.

436
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,830
That's reckless,

437
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:18,590
right?

438
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,310
Say something funny.

439
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:26,191
Funny?

440
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,191
Okay.

441
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,550
Gossip time.

442
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,471
I heard

443
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,191
Huang Wenda

444
00:20:32,504 --> 00:20:34,390
is trying to get back
together with Jacqueline,

445
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:37,310
but she's ignoring him.

446
00:20:38,151 --> 00:20:38,871
So, Mr. Huang

447
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,231
sits at the cafe downstairs every day

448
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,471
to wait for her.

449
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,110
One day,

450
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,871
Jacqueline showed up.

451
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,270
Just when she came in, she saw Mr. Huang

452
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:51,911
paying for a young lady he had just met.

453
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,750
It was

454
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,750
so embarrassing.

455
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,871
Mr. Huang was going to cry.

456
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,030
I was right beside them.

457
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,830
Here we are.

458
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,830
Just watch from here.

459
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,710
I've been wanting to try this
since I was a kid.

460
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,510
Let me try.

461
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,270
Liang Daiwen,

462
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,830
you dumb goose.

463
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,671
You could've told me
that your dad is sick.

464
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:56,510
After leaving you,

465
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,391
my time has frozen.

466
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,631
I don't want to talk to anyone

467
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,830
or socialize.

468
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:09,711
I used to hate endless work,

469
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,671
but now I'm working harder
than my superior.

470
00:24:15,191 --> 00:24:17,711
Jacqueline says my efficiency
has improved a lot.

471
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:23,070
Did you work like this

472
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,310
to cope with your feelings before?

473
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:33,431
No wonder you didn't pick up
on my signals.

474
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:42,151
Look.

475
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:44,991
I got my teeth fixed.

476
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,191
You know what?

477
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:52,471
The dental curing light is painful.

478
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,911
It's hard to imagine, right?

479
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:58,191
Thanks to you,

480
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:01,431
I have this life experience now.

481
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:09,631
Am I

482
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:11,471
a new experience for you as well?

483
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:18,270
Sounds like I'm bargaining.

484
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,550
When I moved out of your place,

485
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:28,310
I felt like

486
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:30,711
I was defeated in a war,

487
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:33,288
but now the feelings have gone away.

488
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:36,871
You're the winner.

489
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:45,310
Lately,

490
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,790
everyone has been comforting me.

491
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,750
Only Yu Dule told me

492
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,711
to tell jokes about my breakup.

493
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,391
If I get famous,

494
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:56,110
I'll become a famous stand-up comedian

495
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,310
when we meet next time.

496
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:02,871
But I don't want to do that.

497
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,671
I don't want to go back to Ounce.

498
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,871
I don't want to go back to places
that are related to you.

499
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,350
Seeing anything about you

500
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:19,471
reminds me

501
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,951
that you've already left.

502
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,510
Why am I saying this
like one of us has died?

503
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,711
But maybe

504
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:40,510
the real breakup I feel

505
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:43,350
is in every moment I think about you

506
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,991
after you left.

507
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:50,631
I keep thinking about you,

508
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,200
then stopping myself
from thinking about you.

509
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:02,070

00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,431
I'm heading home

I'm worried

527
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,750
he might not be able to call out

528
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:08,510
if he feels uncomfortable.

529
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:51,871
You're here.

530
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,871
They told me

531
00:29:56,151 --> 00:29:57,270
you've been outside

532
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,991
these few days.

533
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,711

I'll leave once she's back.

535

After all these years,

536
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:22,510
you still refuse to see me.

538
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,750
It's miserable

539
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,750
but relaxed.

540
00:30:49,951 --> 00:30:51,030
Also,

541
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:54,671
I can't really feel much else.

542
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,590
Guan Xingxin told me

543
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:05,951
it felt like sleep paralysis.

544
00:31:07,128 --> 00:31:08,904
She tried to burn charcoal
to kill herself,

545
00:31:09,672 --> 00:31:10,710
and she was rescued at last.

546
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,469
I still remember

547
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,104
how she described
her near-death experience.

548
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:18,711
Mom had difficulty walking.

549
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,030
I guess she felt more intensely
at the time.

550
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:37,550
I was there when the doctors
were rescuing her.

551
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,030
I was waiting for her in the corridor.

552
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:46,510
She was sent in,

553
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:49,310
and then the doctor came out

554
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,711
and said, "I'm sorry for your loss."

555
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,030
I was ten that year,

556
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:03,191
and I didn't know what that meant.

557
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:08,270
I miss her, too.

Shen told me

559
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:17,391
everyone tends to seal off
painful memories.

560
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:21,951
It's as if they can
pretend nothing ever happens

561
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:26,471
if they block their memories.

562
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:30,030
Perhaps my alexithymia is helping me.

563
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:33,711
I managed to

564
00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:35,191
forget many things over the years.

565
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,631
However, I always remember your face
at that time.

566
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,350
You were very calm.

567
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,750
It's as if you predicted this.

568
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:01,510
Liang Xun,

569
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,631
if you really miss my mom,

570
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,030
tell me honestly

571
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,310
how she died.

572
00:33:25,991 --> 00:33:27,310
I'm having a serious fever.

573
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,968
I didn't have medicine at home,

574
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,632
so I'm getting an IV
at the hospital now.

575
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:32,030
What about you?

576
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:34,790
My condition isn't any better.

577
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:37,590
Mr. Xu,

578
00:33:38,631 --> 00:33:40,750
rest well.

579
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,151
I'm so sorry.

580
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,631
Bye-bye.

581
00:33:46,431 --> 00:33:47,030
Bye-bye.

582
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,671
Here, Ms. Gu,

583
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,110
drink some warm water.

584
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,391
Thank you.

585
00:33:58,711 --> 00:33:59,631
You're welcome.

586
00:34:10,328 --> 00:34:11,430
I haven't seen you in a day,

587
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,630
and you look better now.

588
00:34:15,271 --> 00:34:15,951
Yu Dule,

589
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,351
teasing a patient is evil.

590
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:21,831
I wouldn't dare make fun of love, right?

591
00:34:21,912 --> 00:34:22,792
I wouldn't dare.

592
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:26,550
I want to eat crab stew pot.

593
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,030
Sure.

594
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,590
Do I look like a crab stew pot?

595
00:34:31,831 --> 00:34:33,030
What's wrong with you?

596
00:34:33,751 --> 00:34:35,590
All I ask for is a crab stew pot.

597
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,471
Shouldn't good friends

598
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,550
eat junk food together?

599
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:42,030
Fine.

600
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:44,590
I'll buy it for you, okay?

601
00:34:45,311 --> 00:34:45,831
Sure.

602
00:34:46,391 --> 00:34:47,710
I want to drink as well.

603
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,390
I guess I owe you in a past life.

604
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:55,710
Thank you.

605
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:56,510
You are welcome!

606
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,471
Do you think people might think

607
00:35:17,351 --> 00:35:19,471
you're trying to kill me for money
when they see this?

608
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:22,110
What are you on about?

609
00:35:22,568 --> 00:35:23,870
Alcohol is also one kind of water.

610
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,271
It helps you rehydrate, right?

611
00:35:26,351 --> 00:35:27,791
There's a science to this.

612
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,710
I'm trying to help you recover.

613
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:33,271
How did you get over

614
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,590
your breakup?

615
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,271
I don't really remember.

616
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:41,471
I just know it was a tough year.

617
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,590
During that time,

618
00:35:43,736 --> 00:35:45,699
I was so desperate
to occupy myself with work

619
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,112
so I could stop thinking about her.

620
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,911
As for how I got through it,

621
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,070
I forgot.

622
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:53,190
You're indeed heartless.

623
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,391
Everyone should be heartless,

624
00:35:56,751 --> 00:35:57,110
right?

625
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,751
Our genes don't allow us to
be too obsessed with relationships.

626
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,951
It's bad for our health.

627
00:36:02,471 --> 00:36:04,070
Whether your heart is torn apart

628
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,630
or aching,

629
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,070
it's all right. Leave it to time.

630
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,110
Leave everything to time.

631
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:10,831
Time is the antidote to everything.

632
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:12,630
Once you get through it

633
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,351
and look back, you realize

634
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:15,830
everything becomes clear.

635
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:17,230
Everything has passed,

636
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,871
right?

637
00:36:18,351 --> 00:36:19,911
Life goes on,

638
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,150
and the sun rises as usual.

639
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,871
A breakup is nothing but a fever.

640
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:23,951
It'll pass sooner or later.

641
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:25,992
Kong Yunlong once said,
(A cross-talk performer)

642
00:36:26,008 --> 00:36:26,344
right?

643
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,110
Not many live up to their seventies.

644
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:30,190
Ten years in tender age,
another ten years in ripe old age,

645
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:31,431
and fifty years remain.

646
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,991
Divide that into daytime and nighttime,

647
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,152
hence only twenty-five years left.

648
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:35,710
Aside from harsh weather,

649
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:36,616
disasters, and sickness,

650
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:37,750
how many good days do we have?

651
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:38,110
Right?

652
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,270
Whether we live in joy or sorrow,

653
00:36:40,391 --> 00:36:41,791
it's just another day passing.

654
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,030
So why don't you be happy instead?

655
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:43,751
Right?

656
00:36:44,056 --> 00:36:44,920
As the Buddha says,

657
00:36:44,951 --> 00:36:46,951
"The splendor of the world
passes in the snap of a finger.

658

00:41:55,736 --> 00:41:56,270
Besides,

744
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,869
Liang Daiwen wouldn't want to see

745
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,656
you standing up for him
for something pointless like this.

746
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,110
Understood.

747
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,630
I'll continue drawing...

748
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:06,150
Writing the script.

749
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,431
The comic is good.

750
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:09,871
Stay on it.

751
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,951
500,000 followers
for a Deputy Director position.

752
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,590
You have my word.

753
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,471
Yi,

754
00:42:30,911 --> 00:42:31,991
have you read the comic?

755
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:34,550
Regarding Liang Daiwen's plagiarism,

756
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,271
everyone is saying it was a setup.

757
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:38,630
No idea.

758
00:42:38,712 --> 00:42:39,800
I know nothing about it.

759
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:41,831
I wonder

760
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,670
which expert made that comic.

761
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:45,391
How did they get so much insider news?

762
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:49,070
Yi,

763
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:50,751
you were there

764
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,040
during the interview, weren't you?

765
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,150
I've already used up five different IDs

766
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,311
just to register company accounts.

767
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,751
There were so many media people
that day,

768
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:01,469
but you suspect me,

769
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,128
who has been working myself
to the bone every day?

770
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,871
I'm just asking.

771
00:43:08,431 --> 00:43:09,351
Even if it were you,

772
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:10,871
I wouldn't tell anyone.

773
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,150
It's not me.

774
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:14,871
No.

775
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,150
Absolutely not.

776
00:43:19,751 --> 00:43:21,070
By the way, Yi, have you heard about it?

777
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:23,510
Art List is merging with us.

778
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:51,110
Come.

779
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:52,230
Have some.

780
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,808
I'll take this.

781
00:43:52,951 --> 00:43:53,351
Go ahead.

782
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:00,110
Yuji Restaurant closed after my fever.

783
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:02,568
If I had known they were going back
for Chinese New Year,

784
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,070
I would've packed up some food
and kept it in the freezer.

785
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:06,991
It's understandable.

786
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:07,871
It's Chinese New Year.

787
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:10,230
No one would work overtime
like our company.

788
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:16,550
He took one.

789
00:44:19,871 --> 00:44:20,630
It's gotten cold.

790
00:44:21,144 --> 00:44:22,350
The cheese isn't stretchy anymore.

791
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:22,791
Yeah.

792
00:44:29,368 --> 00:44:30,590
I'm meeting Huang Wenda later.

793
00:44:31,431 --> 00:44:32,510
Enjoy yourself.

794
00:44:33,831 --> 00:44:34,831
Warm it up in the microwave.

795
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,800
I should get going.

796
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:36,271
Bye.

797
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,230
Why did you hide it?

798
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:14,670
It's interesting.

799
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,630
I re-posted the comic, too.

800
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:22,271
Mr. Huang,

801
00:45:22,911 --> 00:45:24,590
Mr. Xu is waiting for you
in the meeting room.

802
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:27,431
Why are you nervous?

803
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:29,911
I won't tell Zhang Junjie.

804
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:31,311
Young lady,

805
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,351
if you need PR service, come to me.

806
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:35,271

807
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:37,590
