25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,660
(Van Gogh Manor)

26
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:57,927
Where's my blackboard?

27
00:01:59,347 --> 00:02:00,168
I confiscated it.

28
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,048
How could a student confiscate
his teacher's teaching tool?

29
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:07,007
Shen begged me to confiscate it.

30
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,488
Dr. Shen found out, huh?

31
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:10,727
Was he angry at me?

32
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:11,968
That's not it.

33
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,466
He said that his years of effort
would go to waste

34
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,248
if you continued the treatment.

35
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:10,688
Are you

36
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:11,767
upset?

37
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:13,688
That's not it.

38
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,648
I was just thinking

39
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:20,167
that my efforts were actually in vain.

40
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:21,887
I did the opposite
instead of helping you.

41
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:23,928
I feel pretty bad.

42
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:27,466
Before this, I said I could
treat your condition.

43
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:28,808
I was just bragging.

44
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:31,327
I'll stop causing trouble
for Dr. Shen in the future.

45
00:03:31,908 --> 00:03:33,007
That's not what he meant.

46
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:34,847
And,

47
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,488
you've helped me out quite a lot.

48
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:37,968
It wasn't all bad.

49
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:40,447
Really?

50
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,208
Can you give me an example, then?

51
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:45,408
For example...

52
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:48,607
For example...

53
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:51,287
For example...

54
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:54,248
Enough already.

55
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,047
I know you're saying that
out of courtesy.

56
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:10,128
Liang Daiwen,

57
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:11,507
this time,

58
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:13,248
both of us have dropped out.

59
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,128
We can give it another try next time

60
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:17,767
when I find a better solution.

61
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:42,567
For example,

62
00:04:44,388 --> 00:04:45,887
you made me realize

63
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:48,288
that living together with someone else

64
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:50,527
is much more interesting
than living alone.

65
00:04:56,685 --> 00:05:02,451
(Robot)

66
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,397
(Today's steps)

67
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:39,087
Liang Daiwen,

68
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:40,608
don't move.

69
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,207
Ms. Gu,

70
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:53,168
how long do you intend to hug me?

71
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:00,608
You...

72
00:08:01,508 --> 00:08:03,168
You weren't sleepwalking, huh?

73
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,647
I'm just going to get some water.

74
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:15,128
Did you do this

75
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:17,048
whenever I was sleepwalking?

76
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:19,368
Did you tell me to stop

77
00:08:20,787 --> 00:08:21,808
and...

78
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:25,848
Go and get your water.

79
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:57,248
Liang Daiwen,

80
00:08:58,028 --> 00:08:59,368
why are you taking medicine?

81
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:00,927
Do you feel unwell?

82
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:02,386
That's not it.

83
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:03,328
I'm taking my vitamins.

84
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:05,907
In the middle of the night?

85
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:07,407
You do care about your wellness, huh?

86
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:11,448
You're working overtime
in the middle of the night.

87
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:12,848
You don't care about
your wellness at all.

88
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:18,128
Tomorrow, our firm will select
a deputy director

89
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:20,287
and the editor-in-chief
for its branch publications.

90
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:22,527
I have a rival.

91
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:24,287
I'm pretty worried about it.

92
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:36,927
Seems like you've made
adequate preparations.

93
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,007
Why are you still worried?

94
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,047
Jacqueline proofread it for me.

95
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,466
If I mess up,

96
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,968
I'll be letting her down.

97
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:47,427
This is my first time
doing a presentation

98
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:49,287
in front of all the
company's major figures.

99
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:50,687
I feel pretty unconfident.

100
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:52,647
And, this concerns my promotion.

101
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:54,887
I've already lost once before this.

102
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:56,887
I don't wish to lose again.

103
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:01,927
If you're worried,

104
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:04,328
you can do the presentation
in front of me first.

105
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:06,968
In front of you?

106
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,647
I may not be able to provide you
with professional suggestions,

107
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,287
but I've attended several

108
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:13,488
promotion meetings in HF Design Company.

109
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,167
I've seen some beginners
with stage fright.

110
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:17,128
Messing up in front of me

111
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:18,746
is at least better than

112
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:20,007
messing up in front of your boss, right?

113
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,248
You won't tease me for it, right?

114
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:25,927
I...

115
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:33,608
Unless you deliver a punchline
during your promotion presentation.

116
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:35,626
(As if you can understand me)

117
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:36,927
(if I deliver the punchline.)

118
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:39,128
(You could never get the punchline.)

119
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:42,088
You encountered
your first defeat in HF Design Company.

120
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:45,248
I know how important
this event is for you.

121
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,328
This is what I plan to do tomorrow.

122
00:10:58,507 --> 00:10:59,267
First, I'll enter the room

123
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:00,947
and greet all the superiors.

124
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:02,208
I'll say this...

125
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:38,787
(Don't be afraid.
May everything proceed smoothly.)

126
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:47,407
Ms. Zhang,

127
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:50,407
the person together with Mr. Liang
yesterday was Gu Yi.

128
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:52,047
She's a senior editor at Nextmonday.

129
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:54,007
She did the interview with Mr. Liang.

130
00:12:54,627 --> 00:12:56,088
She was also

131
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:57,968
a comedian who went viral before.

132
00:12:58,627 --> 00:12:59,887
A comedian?

133
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:06,407
Qingya,

134
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,866
a friend of mine is a comedian.

135
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,167
She needs an opportunity to perform.

136
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:15,807
No wonder.

137
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:17,608
Does Jacqueline know about it?

138
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:19,027
I'm not sure about that.

139
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:19,866
But many of her colleagues

140
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,328
at Nextmonday
knew about her side hustle.

141
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,368
I don't think it's a secret.

142
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,147
If so, go and find out

143
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:26,767
whether or not she has done
some special performances.

144
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:28,568
I did my research.

145
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:30,667
She usually does
offline shows at a venue

146
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:31,527
called Ounce.

147
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:33,586
She usually jokes about being penniless

148
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:34,746
and single.

149
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,047
It's nothing special.

150
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:37,586
However, there have been
some recent rumors

151
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:39,007
saying that she found a sugar daddy.

152
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,007
Were they referring to Liang Daiwen?

153
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:43,568
I don't think so.

154
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:44,927
I told the chauffeur to tail her.

155
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:47,368
However, she's indeed
staying with Mr. Liang.

156
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:00,287
Call Jacqueline.

157
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,047
Tell her that I'm free
to attend the interview

158
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:03,448
she mentioned last time this afternoon.

159
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:05,626
Notify Liang Daiwen
to join me for dinner.

160
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,527
Order the same
Christmas couple set as before.

161
00:14:07,707 --> 00:14:08,488
Understood.

162
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:22,386
We will feature special contributors
through reports,

163
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:23,386
live interviews,

164
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:24,807
and organize joint activities

165
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:27,407
to increase the reach
of the public account

166
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:29,506
as well as enhance

167
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:31,827
the influence and authority
of our company

168
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:32,927
within the industry.

169
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:35,067
It'll bring us more opportunities

170
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:36,608
for brand collaborations
and sponsorship.

171
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:38,466
Due to that,

172
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:41,167
in addition to directing traffic
to our mainstream publications,

173
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,226
it should also be a new platform

174
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:44,208
for us to explore new frontiers.

175
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,307
We should use it
to explore more possibilities

176
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:47,927
in content and media channels.

177
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,527
That's all for my general idea.

178
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:51,848
Thank you, everyone.

179
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:07,187
Dear leaders,

180
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:08,088
nice to meet you all.

181
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:10,448
For Nextmonday's column,

182
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:13,167
I've outlined the following
development directions.

183
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:14,386
Firstly,

184
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:15,608
it's about original content.

185
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:18,088
We can invest more in original content

186
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:19,887
and launch pieces with depth.

187
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:25,706
I'll cut to the chase.

188
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:26,647
The presentation is over.

189
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:27,827
Regarding the selection of the
planning department's deputy director

190
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,287
and the person in charge
of the branch publications,

191
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,208
I wish to hear your opinions.

192
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:37,208
Each has their own strength.

193
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:39,728
But from a professional perspective,

194
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:41,448
Gu Yi is more outstanding.

195
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:44,248
I'll cut to the chase too.

196
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:45,807
I've decided

197
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:47,568
to promote Pan Ni.

198
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:51,907
If so, I need to give my subordinates

199
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:53,248
a logical explanation.

200
00:15:53,627 --> 00:15:54,346
After all,

201
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:56,047
Gu Yi's proposal

202
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,368
is better.

203
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,608
Gu Yi's proposal is indeed better.

204
00:16:00,188 --> 00:16:01,368
However,

205
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:03,128
it doesn't seem like she did it herself.

206
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:09,608
I don't get what you mean.

207
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:14,527
I heard that she does comedy shows

208
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,608
in bars usually.

209
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:19,147
Although the company has no right

210
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:20,368
to interfere with
one's personal affairs,

211
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,527
her ways of managing time

212
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:25,128
made me develop doubts

213
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:27,047
regarding her work ethic.

214
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:29,728
If I'm not mistaken,

215
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:31,027
the last authorization mistake,

216
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:33,208
which led to a recall
of a batch of printed materials,

217
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:35,007
was related to her as well.

218
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:37,248
But it seemed like

219
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:39,368
you didn't give her a notice at all.

220
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:41,887
She was already fined
according to the company's regulations.

221
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:43,568
The finance department
should've reported it to you.

222
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:44,907
If we

223
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,887
investigate the matter further,

224
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:49,807
I'm afraid she wouldn't be the only one
who should be punished.

225
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:52,448
I know you like Gu Yi.

226
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:53,728
You intend to nurture her.

227
00:16:55,107 --> 00:16:56,248
But Nextmonday

228
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:57,647
isn't a youth magazine.

229
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:00,167
We just need one person who understands
the content, which is you.

230
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:02,407
The deputy director

231
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:03,767
is in charge of
taking care of the company.

232
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:05,447
I would prefer someone ambitious

233
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:07,207
who has the intention
to expand our territory.

234
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,647
Currently, Gu Yi
is handling my music column.

235
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,447
If I can't keep her around,

236
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:17,008
I'm afraid I can't keep
Pan Ni around as well.

237
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:25,768
You had your eyes on Nextmonday

238
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:27,328
for a long time, hadn't you?

239
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,647
Actually,

240
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,727
I've been thinking about

241
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:34,288
Nextmonday's M&A for a long time.

242
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,687
Now, the conditions are ripe.

243
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:40,048
It all depends on your thoughts.

244
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,008
You'll have plenty of chances

245
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:45,008
to keep your candidate of choice here

246
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:46,568
as long as you proceed with
the M&A, you know?

247
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,128
You're very intelligent.

248
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:55,288
There are certain sentences

249
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:56,528
I do not need to finish.

250
00:17:57,548 --> 00:17:58,768
I'll give you an account,

251
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,008
and you can give
your subordinates an account.

252
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:04,167
You're fine with that, right?

253
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,128
I suppose we've reached
a consensus, then.

254
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:20,608
Ms. Zhang, let me
congratulate you in advance

255
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,088
on acquiring Nextmonday.

256
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:38,647
Ms. Zhang, over here, please.

257
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:40,267
Lately, many people

258
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:41,626
have recommended
your music column to me.

259
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:43,048
You did a great job
by employing Xu Guanrui.

260
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:45,626
I wonder what's the theme
for the next issue.

261
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:46,707
Are there any available ad space

262
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,887
that we can use for our ads?

263
00:18:48,347 --> 00:18:49,887
Of course it's available.
It's you we're talking about.

264
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:52,128
However, we signed
a contract with Xu Guanrui.

265
00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:54,128
I'm not sure if this issue
has been finalized.

266
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,346
By the way,

267
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:57,487
I'll make an appointment
for you and Mr. Xu next time.

268
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,647
No need for that.

269
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,008
Gu Yi

270
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,687
came up with the script, right?

271
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:07,586
Although Gu Yi is our senior editor,

272
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:08,666
Mr. Xu

273
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,167
can scrunch up a script
like nobody's business.

274
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:11,386
Gu Yi,

275
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:12,528
see Ms. Zhang off.

276
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:14,727
You can also introduce our column
on Mr. Xu's behalf.

277
00:19:15,427 --> 00:19:16,167
Understood.

278
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:17,848
Ms. Zhang.

279
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:34,647
I don't know if you still remember,

280
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,768
but we once encountered
each other here downstairs.

281
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:39,447
I do.

282
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:41,647
Liang Daiwen even introduced you to me.

283
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:44,247
He said you were
his senior and benefactor.

284
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:47,848
Seems like you two are very close now.

285
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:50,647
Great.

286
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:52,626
Daiwen will pick you up
for dinner later.

287
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:53,887
Don't make him wait too long.

288
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:56,146
There's no rush regarding
the column and scripts.

289
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:57,146
I've already spoken with your director.

290
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:58,368
She won't urge you.

291
00:19:58,748 --> 00:19:59,227
Don't worry.

292
00:19:59,228 --> 00:20:00,727
We'll definitely place our ads here.

293
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:05,307
Please tell Daiwen that I'm not free

294
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:06,467
to attend the dinner tonight.

295
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:07,768
Tell him that I'll make it up
to him next time.

296
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,647
Safe trip.

297
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:30,808
Safe trip.

298
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:32,967
You're actually here?

299
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:35,307
Zhang Qingya came
to Nextmonday for a meeting.

300
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,967
She said you would
pick me up for dinner.

301
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,167
She even said

302
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:40,447
that she couldn't attend the dinner

303
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:41,808
and that she would
make it up to you next time.

304
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:44,088
I know.

305
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:45,808
Her assistant already notified me.

306
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:48,027
So, you were supposed

307
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:49,568
to have dinner with her, right?

308
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,687
Not really.

309
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:54,887
We'll have a meal together every year.

310
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,128
Now, there are only the two of us.

311
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,368
Does this count as a date, then?

312
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:22,967
Love of Rose.

313
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:25,048
Heart-to-heart.

314
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:26,048
Please enjoy your drinks.

315
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:30,167
Wait.

316
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:32,887
Why are there only two sets?

317
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:35,887
Mister, you booked the couple set.

318
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:37,008
What do you mean?

319
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:39,288
A couple set is only meant for two.

320
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:42,927
It's all my fault.

321
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:44,647
I didn't know that you guys
ordered the couple set.

322
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:45,946
Liang told me to come.

323
00:21:45,947 --> 00:21:46,967
I told Yu Dule to come.

324
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:49,088
I told Uncle Lu to come.

325
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:52,207
Since all of us are here,
let's make another order.

326
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:53,568
My treat.

327
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:55,848
What do you guys want?

328
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,008
I'll have what Gu Yi is having.

329
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,146
Why are you having the same thing as me?

330
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:01,608
This is a couple set, you know?

331
00:22:02,427 --> 00:22:03,328
I know.

332
00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:04,687
Zhang Qingya made the booking.

333
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:11,386
If so, do you know

334
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:12,608
what ordering a couple set means?

335
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:14,128
The dishes are the same,

336
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:16,447
but ordering the set is 30% cheaper
than ordering them a la carte.

337
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,447
That does make sense.

338
00:22:24,308 --> 00:22:27,008
But who is this Zhang Qingya?

339
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:29,407
She's the boss of the company.

340
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,008
She's also my senior.

341
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:32,866
Your boss

342
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:33,727
and your senior, huh?

343
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:35,547
No matter which identity she assumes,

344
00:22:35,548 --> 00:22:37,128
it doesn't sound like

345
00:22:37,468 --> 00:22:39,528
you guys will be
enjoying a couple set together.

346
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:42,447
Not only can they enjoy a couple set,

347
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:44,568
but they can also enjoy it every year.

348
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,247
This year's the last time.

349
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:49,048
I'm going to resign.

350
00:22:53,347 --> 00:22:54,727
Why are you resigning all of a sudden?

351
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,528
The contract is up.

352
00:22:57,228 --> 00:22:58,528
Why aren't you extending it, then?

353
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,167
Did Zhang Qingya put you on the spot?

354
00:23:02,268 --> 00:23:03,048
That's not it.

355
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,247
I just wish to do my own things.

356
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:09,288
I'll focus on doing accessible designs.

357
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:12,328
To be honest with you guys,

358
00:23:14,548 --> 00:23:15,768
I have a disability as well.

359
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:18,008
I have alexithymia.

360
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:20,008
That's why

361
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,207
I feel like doing something for them.

362
00:23:24,387 --> 00:23:25,247
Excuse me.

363
00:23:25,347 --> 00:23:28,528
What does alexithymia mean?

364
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:32,768
You can understand it

365
00:23:32,988 --> 00:23:34,167
as emotional blindness.

366
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:35,848
To put it simply,

367
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:38,487
I don't experience as many emotions
as a typical person.

368
00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:40,608

00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,847
I don't think your failure
in your choice of career alone

557
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:57,008
will result in such a major change.

558
00:38:57,387 --> 00:38:58,647
There must be another reason.

559
00:38:58,947 --> 00:38:59,807
Was it your relationship?

560
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:02,448
Do you know about

561
00:39:02,748 --> 00:39:05,807
last year's most popular
mystery variety show?

562
00:39:06,628 --> 00:39:07,827
Its executive producer

563
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:10,167
was my girlfriend when I was
still working in the TV station.

564
00:39:10,987 --> 00:39:11,546
Back then,

565
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:13,408
we intended to get married.

566
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:16,048
But her parents thought
that I was too young.

567
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,386
They thought my career was unstable too.

568
00:39:17,387 --> 00:39:18,687
Therefore, they didn't agree
to our relationship.

569
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:22,327
I couldn't bear to see her
torn between two sides.

570
00:39:22,788 --> 00:39:23,767
Therefore,

571
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,167
I deserted her.

572
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:28,088
After that,

573
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:29,066
she left Donghai.

574
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,647
She gradually reached
where she is today.

575
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:31,647
We never contacted each other

576
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:32,928
for six years.

577
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:36,167
A six-year hiatus, huh?

578
00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:38,528
You do idolize her, huh?

579
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:42,088
But I don't think you gave up on it
entirely because of her.

580
00:39:43,947 --> 00:39:44,888
Of course.

581
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:46,287
My parents didn't agree

582
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,367
with our relationship too.

583
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:50,287
They thought that it was hard
for us to establish a family in Donghai

584
00:39:50,427 --> 00:39:51,488
since we didn't have a foothold there.

585
00:39:51,628 --> 00:39:52,568
It sounds stupid, right?

586
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:55,167
Do you still like her?

587
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:57,727
How do I put it?

588
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:00,448
I realized something
after the relationship.

589
00:40:01,228 --> 00:40:03,448
For a very long time,

590
00:40:03,588 --> 00:40:05,287
I couldn't tell whether

591
00:40:05,828 --> 00:40:07,048
I loved her or I was

592
00:40:07,228 --> 00:40:08,327
just obsessed with the relationship.

593
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:10,928
But after I got to know you,

594
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:12,367
I could finally tell.

595
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:15,088
Love is exclusive.

596
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:17,287
When you fall for someone else,

597
00:40:17,387 --> 00:40:19,488
that means you've already
bade farewell to the past.

598
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:23,408
What I mean is,

599
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,247
the current person I fancy

600
00:40:25,308 --> 00:40:26,207
is you.

601
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:29,707
It was supposed to be romantic,

602
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:30,888
but you made it sound so direct.

603
00:40:31,268 --> 00:40:31,928
That's right.

604
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,426
That's how I always do things.

605
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:35,287
I'm honest.

606
00:40:37,628 --> 00:40:39,647
How have you been lately?

607
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,128
I'm not as deeply conflicted as you.

608
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:46,528
I forgot about Chen Yijin
after I figured out

609
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:48,167
the kind of person he is.

610
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:53,528
Let's eat.

611
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,528
Send me home when we're done here.

612
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,880
(Today's steps)

613
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,048
Liang Daiwen.

614
00:41:37,268 --> 00:41:38,767
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

615
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:40,587
Come.

616
00:41:40,588 --> 00:41:42,128
Let's go back to sleep.

617
00:41:48,228 --> 00:41:49,207
Let's go.

618
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:05,287
Turn around.

619
00:42:16,347 --> 00:42:17,287
Lie down.

620
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:24,847
Follow my lead.

621
00:42:27,268 --> 00:42:28,408
Follow my lead.

622
00:42:33,108 --> 00:42:33,928
Lie flat.

623
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:35,327
Like this.

624
00:42:38,828 --> 00:42:39,608
Lie on your side.

625
00:42:40,828 --> 00:42:41,568
Like this.

626
00:42:43,108 --> 00:42:44,008
The pillow,

627
00:42:45,547 --> 00:42:46,767
and the bed is ready.

628
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:47,687
This is a pillow.

629
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:49,488
Put your head on it.

630
00:42:49,628 --> 00:42:50,767
Ms. Gu.

631
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,008
You...

632
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:57,408
Are you training a dog here?

633
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:10,327
Wait, you're awake?

634
00:43:11,467 --> 00:43:12,807
So, it was a trap all along?

635
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,386
I'm heading to Beijing
for a business trip.

636
00:43:19,387 --> 00:43:20,488
I need to catch the early flight.

637
00:43:21,347 --> 00:43:23,408
You dragged me back
when I reached the kitchen.

638
00:43:23,947 --> 00:43:25,167
I thought you were

639
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:26,928
going to do something to me.

640
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:29,767
I...

641
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:36,528
What's with the sudden business trip?

642
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:38,888
Isn't tomorrow our annual meeting?

643
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:40,847
It's just a performance.

644
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:42,167
Just don't be late.

645
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,048
Do I have to head there myself?

646
00:43:46,228 --> 00:43:47,066
I'll send you
the admin's contact information

647
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:48,207
through WeChat.

648
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:49,647
I'll tell her to pick you up.

649
00:43:58,188 --> 00:43:59,048
So,

650
00:44:02,987 --> 00:44:03,928
I'll be going now.

651
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:15,847
You're sweating.

652
00:44:44,668 --> 00:44:45,426
Ms. Gu Yi.

653
00:44:45,427 --> 00:44:46,207
Nice to meet you.

654
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,386
I'm HF Design Company's admin.

655
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:48,787
Ms. Zhang instructed me to receive you.

656
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:49,986
Let me take you inside.

657
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,267
There's no need to alarm Ms. Zhang.

658
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:52,787
I can take a look around by myself.

659
00:44:52,788 --> 00:44:53,506
It's fine.

660
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:54,627
Usually, Ms. Zhang

661
00:44:54,628 --> 00:44:56,408
will help Mr. Liang out
with his affairs.

662
00:44:56,547 --> 00:44:58,008
He's used to being alone.

663
00:44:58,108 --> 00:44:59,528
We can only contact him through emails.

664
00:44:59,588 --> 00:45:01,227
Ms. Zhang is in charge of handling

665
00:45:01,228 --> 00:45:03,247
all of his affairs.

666
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,448
Many people thought
that they were a couple.

667
00:45:05,628 --> 00:45:06,647
Plenty of companies

668
00:45:06,668 --> 00:45:08,986
had failed to headhunt Mr. Liang
all these years

669
00:45:08,987 --> 00:45:10,488
all because of Ms. Zhang's presence.

670
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:12,568
Come. Over here, please.

671
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:19,488
Please wait here.

672
00:45:19,507 --> 00:45:20,147
Okay.

673
00:45:20,148 --> 00:45:21,466
I'll look for you when it's time.

674
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:22,066
Alright.

675
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:23,128
Sorry for the trouble.

676
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:41,227
Kiss!

677
00:45:41,228 --> 00:45:43,088
Do it again!

678
00:46:07,588 --> 00:46:11,647
