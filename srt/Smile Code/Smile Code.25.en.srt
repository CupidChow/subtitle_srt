25
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:47,440
Are you sure there's no traffic?

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,232
Not even a little bit?

27
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:51,026
Welcome back.

28
00:01:56,786 --> 00:01:57,465
Mdm. Wang.

29
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,226
Your daughter's back?

30
00:01:59,306 --> 00:01:59,745
Yes.

31
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:01,706
And is that a new son?

32
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:02,745
Of course.

33
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:04,345
Are these all your mother's friends?

34
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:05,385
Don't ask.

35
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:07,185
It's just my mom's social etiquette.

36
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,546
She'll chat with anyone
like they're family.

37
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:15,345
You two hurry up and head home.

38
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,586
I'll make you a hearty feast.

39
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:18,426
All right.

40
00:02:21,945 --> 00:02:24,026
Mom, isn't this too much Sichuan pepper?

41
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:24,945
Don't add too much.

42
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:26,744
It's not too much.

43
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:27,426
All right.

44
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:29,146
Can I add the eggs?

45
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:31,546
Not yet. Wait a bit longer.

46
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:34,580
It still needs to simmer.

47
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:36,745
Look, the water's almost gone.

48
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:37,945
It needs to thicken.

49
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,065
Am I good or what?

50
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:41,706
Are you teaching me to cook?

51
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,785
No, just offering a tiny suggestion.

52
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:54,986
Get out.

53
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:56,826
All right.

54
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,065
But I won't.

55
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:01,146
Get out.

56
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:02,706
Out, out, out.

57
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:03,426
All right...

58
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:12,546
What are you looking at?

59
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,465
I'm looking at your childhood photos,

60
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:18,266
but I don't see your dad.

61
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:22,106
My dad?

62
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:23,945
There's not much to see.

63
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:29,386
My parents divorced
when I was very young.

64
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:32,146
My dad remarried in no time
and had another child.

65
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,026
All these years,

66
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:35,866
he hasn't paid a cent in child support.

67
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:39,706
But strangely enough,

68
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,465
whenever he gets drunk,

69
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:42,546
he calls my mom

70
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:44,026
to blame her

71
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:44,945
for not taking good care

72
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:45,745
of me.

73
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:49,546
I don't know how he manages

74
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:51,065
to climb up onto that moral high ground.

75
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,866
Clearly, he's long forgotten about me.

76
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,465
What's the matter?

77
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:07,505
Feeling sorry for me?

78
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:12,345
Don't.

79
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:15,345
Having just my mom is enough for me.

80
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:21,425
Did you put something in your hair?

81
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:28,865
Oyster sauce.

82
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,380
If you want to go to the kitchen,

83
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:32,152
my mom definitely won't kick you out.

84
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,740
You seem to have some trouble
expressing your feelings too.

85
00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:39,665
You clearly love your mom

86
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:42,386
but always speak to her
in a sarcastic way.

87
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:47,865
My mom and I have
a mutual understanding.

88
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:50,626
I got hit more by her when I was a kid

89
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:52,345
than you've eaten meals.

90
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,626
Feather dusters,

91
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,266
billiard cues,

92
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:58,225
mop handles,

93
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,746
you name it.

94
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,380
If she could swing it,
she wouldn't talk.

95
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:08,386
Time to eat.

96
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,544
Come help set up the table.

97
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:13,146
Is it ready yet, Mom?

98
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:15,905
Set the table first.

99
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:18,626
Set the table.

100
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:20,465
Where's the table?

101
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:21,626
Behind the door.

102
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:22,620
I'll get the utensils.

103
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:29,425
Come, come.

104
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:31,105
Try my cooking.

105
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,186
Just a few home-cooked dishes.
Don't be picky.

106
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:36,266
Our little family of three
will have a little drink together.

107
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:37,465
Our family of three?

108
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,186
Three of us, right?

109
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:41,624
Don't you know how to count?

110
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,066
Mom, I just got back,
and you're already drinking?

111
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:46,665
Not going to watch your health?

112
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:49,105
At my age,
being happy is watching my health.

113
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:51,305
My son-in-law is here.

114
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:52,456
How can I not have a drink?

115
00:05:52,826 --> 00:05:53,225
Here.

116
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:55,146
Don't look at her.

117
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:55,785
Drink up.

118
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:05,186
That's it?

119
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:06,305
Right.

120
00:06:06,456 --> 00:06:07,340
Who are you fooling?

121
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:08,026
Bottoms up.

122
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:10,026
Bottoms up?

123
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:10,665
Hold on.

124
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,696
Aren't you going to say a few words?

125
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:14,746
Say...

126
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:16,386
Say what, ma'am?

127
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:17,785
Anything.

128
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:19,425
I'll love whatever you say.

129
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,979
When I'm stressed, I sleepwalk.

130
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,280
I think I inherited it from my dad.

131
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:45,146
When he was a prison guard,

132
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:46,626
he'd sleepwalk

133
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:49,425
and chase escapees.

134
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:51,545
Scared me half to death as a kid.

135
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:54,225
My mom couldn't move well,

136
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:55,865
so,

137
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:58,586
she bought an aluminum basin
and put it by the bed.

138
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,586
Whenever my dad sleepwalked,

139
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:03,186
she'd bang the basin.

140
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:04,425
One bang was deafening.

141
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:10,946
Now I get

142
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:12,985
why you chose Gu Yi.

143
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:16,105
You and your dad are both masochists.

144
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:18,785
What do you mean by that, Mom?

145
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,465
It's fine.

146
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:20,700
I'll let you torture me.

147
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:21,506
Shut up.

148
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:26,345
See?

149
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:28,266
This kind of chat is nice.

150
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,826
In life,

151
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:31,225
it's just the little things.

152
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,780
You can't always have serious matters

153
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,186
to talk about.

154
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:36,066
Trivial matters are what bring you

155
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:37,345
closer to each other.

156
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:38,785
Liang,

157
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:40,066
you should learn from Gu Yi.

158
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:41,105
Look at her.

159
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,465
So chatty.

160
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:43,826
Talking at home isn't enough

161
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:44,626
for her.

162
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,992
She has to go out to do stand-up.

163
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:47,545
If you two combined,

164
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:48,746
you'd be perfect.

165
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:51,386
Mom, there's a difference between
being chatty and telling jokes,

166
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:51,826
okay?

167
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,586
And what I say isn't just chatter.

168
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:54,905
It's called

169
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:57,386
sharing.

170
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:58,905
All right.

171
00:07:59,225 --> 00:07:59,865
Sharing.

172
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:02,225
Then share more with Liang.

173
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:03,266
Hurry and eat.

174
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,496
After dinner, clean out your room
so he can stay there.

175
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:09,386
My room? Then where will I stay?

176
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:10,506
I'm not sharing with him.

177
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,506
Dream on.

178
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,380
You're staying with me.

179
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:14,985
Here.

180
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:18,026
You're drinking more?

181
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:20,586
Eat.

182
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:25,186
Try my cooking.

183
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:28,946
It's delicious.

184
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:32,785
Is it? Let me try.

185
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:35,746
I got some chili too.

186
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:37,466
Spicy!

187
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:39,945
Drink some spirit to wash it down.

188
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:41,185
Here.

189
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:42,425
Cheers.

190
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:45,905
To happy days!

191
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:13,425
You scared me!

192
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:18,700
What are you looking at?

193
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,425
Never seen me work before?

194
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:23,866
For someone so good at cleaning,

195
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:26,065
how's your rental so messy?

196
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:28,420
Say one more thing,
and I'll kick you out.

197
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:30,945
Liang.

198
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:32,580
Here's a razor I bought for you.

199
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:34,185
Original import, only 299.

200
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:36,386
If it's more than 35,

201
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:37,665
I'll refund you 299.

202
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:40,585
35 wouldn't even cover shipping.

203
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:42,500
It's definitely an original import.

204
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:43,226
Use it.

205
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:43,905
299.

206
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:47,785
Thanks, Mdm. Wang.

207
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:50,226
It's definitely not more than 35.

208
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,346
Trust me.

209
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:53,585
My mom's like that.

210
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:55,746
She's known
as the Northeast Bargain Queen.

211
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:57,480
Doesn't matter
if they want to sell or not,

212
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:59,226
she goes in for the kill.

213
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:01,026
Whether it's 300 or 500,

214
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:03,466
she slashes it to 30 or 50.

215
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:04,785
Then she runs off.

216
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:06,785
If one way doesn't work,

217
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:08,026
she'll try another.

218
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:09,866
But you know,

219
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:10,940
this tactic actually works.

220
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,780
It's just something cheap.

221
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:16,504
You don't have to use it
if you don't like it.

222
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:17,425
I'll use it.

223
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:33,346
Thank you.

224
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:36,460
And thank Mdm. Wang too.

225
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,420
Were you celebrating a birthday
in this photo?

226
00:10:58,146 --> 00:10:59,185
This one's staged.

227
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:01,659
In my last year of elementary school,

228
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,880
I told my mom I wanted to go camping.

229
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:03,960
That old lady found a park

230
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:05,466
to make do for me.

231
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:09,545
It probably wasn't to make do.

232
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:15,825
Maybe she didn't know

233
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,665
what real camping was,

234
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:20,026
so she did her best

235
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:21,026
within her abilities.

236
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:24,346
She picked the prettiest park

237
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:26,945
and dressed you in your nicest clothes.

238
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:29,545
Look.

239
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:32,065
She's so happy in this picture.

240
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,106
Liang Daiwen,

241
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:40,346
your tone just now sounded

242
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,226
a lot like my mom's best friend.

243
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:50,626
Gu Yi,

244
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:54,425
let's take your mom camping.

245
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:11,665
The scenery is beautiful here.

246
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:14,146
Let me post this on social media.

247
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:15,736
What do you think, Mom?

248
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:17,626
Not bad, right?

249
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:19,626
How could it not be?

250
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:21,592
You practically moved
the whole house out here.

251
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:25,305
When I was little, you took me
to a park to make do as camping.

252
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:28,185
Didn't expect this field
near our house to be so nice.

253
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:30,346
Mdm. Wang,

254
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:32,305
is there anything else we need?

255
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,065
I don't think so.

256
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:36,226
Oh, wait.

257
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:37,266
Gu Yi,

258
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:38,780
go home and grab some fruit.

259
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:39,705
Go.

260
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:40,386
Run.

261
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:41,146
Yes!

262
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:50,065
Gu Yi,

263
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:52,386
how many times
have you tripped on flat ground?

264
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:54,346
Maybe you should

265
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:55,585
get your cerebellum checked.

266
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:00,185
She ought to check more than that.

267
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,824
When she gets her marriage checkup,
it should be comprehensive.

268
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:03,665
Mom!

269
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:06,065
Even in a blended family,
there's a hierarchy!

270
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,785
Are you my mom or his?

271
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:08,386
She's our mom.

272
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:09,266
Shut up.

273
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:48,185
Stop watching.

274
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:50,026
Gu Yi is bathing and scrubbing herself.

275
00:13:50,104 --> 00:13:50,980
It'll take two hours.

276
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:54,346
Mdm. Wang,

277
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:55,746
should I go pick her up?

278
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:59,386
Chase too closely, and she'll slip away.

279
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:00,540
Come here.

280
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:02,026
Sit with me.

281
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,272
Let's talk about something serious.

282
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,266
Get a pen and paper.

283
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:08,506
Okay.

284
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:17,705
Let's talk about Gu Yi.

285
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:19,305
Go ahead.

286
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,112
She doesn't like cilantro.

287
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,140
She loves meat.

288
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,888
Since she was a kid, she's been afraid
of sharp-beaked animals.

289
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:29,026
Seeing Chicken heads and duck heads,

290
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,984
she'd jump ten feet in the air
at the sight of them.

291
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:32,746
Actually,

292
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:34,106
she's not that picky.

293
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:35,980
She likes everything
on the table over there.

294
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:39,305
And,

295
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,024
Gu Yi has always had
a bit of a weak constitution.

296
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:43,048
She's allergic to dust mites

297
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:43,785
and has rhinitis.

298
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:47,752
Whenever she gets a fever,
she breaks out in a rash.

299
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:50,152
Try to avoid anti-inflammatory medicine.

300
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,704
She has a chronic allergy to penicillin.

301
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:54,425
If she ever gets pregnant

302
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:56,026
and the doctor asks,

303
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:57,480
you should know these things.

304
00:14:59,185 --> 00:14:59,585
Got it.

305
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:00,888
Oh, one more thing.

306
00:15:02,216 --> 00:15:02,780
Gu Yi gets

307
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,065
really bad cramps

308
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,288
on the first day of her period.

309
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:07,266
You'll need to have

310
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:07,825
a heating pad

311
00:15:07,986 --> 00:15:08,626
and

312
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:09,386
ginger tea ready.

313
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:11,026
If possible...

314
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:14,146
Understand?

315
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:21,785
That's all I can think of

316
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,386
for now.

317
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:25,460
I'll tell you more
if I remember anything else.

318
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:26,905
Okay.

319
00:15:27,736 --> 00:15:28,456
All right then.

320
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:30,825
Now, let's talk about your family.

321
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:32,705
My family?

322
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:35,785
You silly boy.

323
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:37,466
You know Gu Yi inside out now,

324
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:37,866
but

325
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:39,945
I don't even know
what my future in-laws do.

326
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:48,300
My dad is a prison guard
who turned into an engineer.

327
00:15:49,425 --> 00:15:49,986
My mom...

328
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,425
When she was around,
she was an accountant.

329
00:15:56,185 --> 00:15:57,146
After she passed,

330
00:15:57,785 --> 00:15:58,945
my dad remarried soon after.

331
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:02,705
We've never been close over the years.

332
00:16:04,305 --> 00:16:05,506
The last time I saw him

333
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:07,825
was when he had a stroke.

334
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:09,866
I rushed back to Dalian.

335
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:13,506
After he was out of danger,

336
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,760
I stayed with him in the hospital.

337
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:16,866
Out of nowhere,

338
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:20,466
he told me that he missed my mom.

339
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:25,785
Mdm. Wang,

340
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:31,106
humans are weird.

341
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,900
Did your mother pass away

342
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:37,785
from illness too?

343
00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:43,945
She had a thoracic spinal cord lesion

344
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:45,466
that caused paralysis.

345
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:47,940
Then, a tumor worsened her condition.

346
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:51,106
Her treatment was excruciating.

347
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:54,665
When no one was around,

348
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,688
she took her own life with medication.

349
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:04,145
Before she took her life,
she showed clear signs of depression.

350
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:09,105
But I was too young to notice

351
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:12,145
at the time.

352
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:22,545
No mother

353
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:25,226
willingly leaves her child

354
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:28,986
unless she's at her wit's end.

355
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:32,380
It's not your fault,

356
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:35,026
nor your mother's.

357
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,065
I understand.

358
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:43,706
I don't blame her.

359
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:47,266
I just...

360
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,785
I just need more time to understand.

361
00:17:56,746 --> 00:17:57,666
I understand.

362
00:17:58,426 --> 00:17:59,506
I'm a mother too.

363
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:02,986
Gu Yi has been through

364
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:05,746
a lot with me.

365
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:08,466
When she was in elementary school,

366
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:09,625
I divorced her father.

367
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:12,585
Then, soon after, I lost my job.

368
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:15,305
I struggled to find work
while raising her.

369
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:19,545
I sold cold noodles,
boxed lunches, and cassette tapes,

370
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:20,865
and took up odd jobs.

371
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:22,186
There was nothing I wouldn't do.

372
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:24,026
It was tough.

373
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:27,226
I learned something

374
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:28,620
through a lifetime of hardship.

375
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:30,226
For us,

376
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:32,420
nothing is a big deal

377
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,266
except death.

378
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,145
Your mom never imagined

379
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:47,785
she'd leave you in that way.

380
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,585
Those who are gone are gone.

381
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:53,906
The ones left behind
have to keep living,

382
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:56,986
and live well,

383
00:18:58,105 --> 00:18:58,466
right?

384
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:04,865
You and Gu Yi are both good kids.

385
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:10,065
But it's not easy to stay together

386
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,186
for a lifetime.

387
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:15,706
Love alone

388
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:17,706
isn't nearly enough.

389
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:22,385
You need to take care
of yourselves first,

390
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:25,865
to be able to support each other.

391
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:30,426
Right?

392
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:36,825
Why are you looking at me like that?

393
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:39,906
Nothing.

394
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:20,426
You're sneaking a drink.

395
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,625
I'm being filial.

396
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:24,585
If I drink her liquor,
she won't have any left.

397
00:20:28,305 --> 00:20:29,906
Why can't you learn
something good from my mom?

398
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:30,986
No more drinking.

399
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:44,026
How long

400
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,345
are you planning to stay here?

401
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,266
Being idle
while just starting a business

402
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:50,186
doesn't seem right.

403
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:52,345
I'm the boss.

404
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:53,545
Shut up.

405
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:03,065
Running on love alone has no meaning.

406
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:05,746
Your accomplishments were achieved
under Nextmonday.

407
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:07,706
The traffic belongs to the brand.

408
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,832
You haven't personally
gained much in terms of resources.

409
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:12,785
The media industry's salary cap is high.

410
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:14,345
If your income drops,

411
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:16,226
so does your perspective.

412
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:18,625
To gain independent control
over content creation,

413
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:20,026
talent alone isn't enough.

414
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:22,266
You need to create
innovative business value

415
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:23,906
to be indispensable.

416
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:29,785
Why are you telling me all this

417
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:31,785
out of the blue?

418
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:36,186
When you missed your last promotion,

419
00:21:37,105 --> 00:21:38,065
I wanted to tell you this.

420
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,385
But back then,

421
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:43,624
I didn't know how to put it into words.

422
00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:52,545
Liang Daiwen,

423
00:21:53,706 --> 00:21:55,619
how did my mom manage to flip

424
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,080
that "communication switch" of yours on?

425
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:01,466
I'm not sure either.

426
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:05,506
I took the Toronto Dyslexia Scale.

427
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:08,426
My data only reached 20%
of a normal person's level.

428
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:11,946
So I find it hard
to understand a lot of things.

429
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:13,746
These past years,

430
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:16,906
drawing has been
my only way of expressing myself.

431
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:18,940
But you and your mom are different.

432
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:20,785
You make me feel

433
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,105
that language

434
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,065
is simpler than composition.

435
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:25,506
Even though

436
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,585
my vocabulary is limited

437
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:29,624
and I often say the wrong things,

438
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:32,379
you still listen carefully

439
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,464
and respond thoughtfully.

440
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:35,848
This kind of interaction,
where you lower yourself to my level,

441
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:37,545
makes me feel safe.

442
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:39,825
It's like

443
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:42,946
being back in kindergarten.

444
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:46,506
You're a fast learner, huh?

445
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:49,592
Before, you wouldn't say a single word
more than necessary,

446
00:22:49,946 --> 00:22:50,825
but now,

447
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:52,168
you're coming up with a whole essay.

448
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:57,585
Gu Yi,

449
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:00,706
in my eyes, you shine.

450
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,460
You have a unique spirit

451
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:04,305
and great ideas,

452
00:23:05,336 --> 00:23:07,400
but you've been suppressed
and become too cautious.

453
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,105
Don't be afraid.

454
00:23:09,912 --> 00:23:11,260
Take the risk if you want to.

455
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:15,065
I'll be by your side.

456
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,700
You're going to kiss and just leave?

457
00:23:36,946 --> 00:23:38,746
Then what do you want?

458
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:42,648
This time, you're the one
who isn't being honest.

459
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:43,706
You have two options.

460
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:44,585
First,

461
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:45,820
be my girlfriend.

462
00:23:45,944 --> 00:23:46,780
The second one.

463
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,380
I pick the second option.

464
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:49,426
Second,

465
00:23:52,145 --> 00:23:52,906
let me kiss you back.

All right, Ms. Gu Yi.

481
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,305
From now on, this is your place.

482
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:47,026
Get started.

483
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:48,420
Get started with what?

484
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,528
What do you mean, "with what"?

485
00:24:50,186 --> 00:24:51,145
Property transfer.

486
00:24:51,368 --> 00:24:52,792
Did you think you could just move in?

487
00:24:52,946 --> 00:24:55,065
Shouldn't you be checking
the water, electricity, gas,

488
00:24:55,065 --> 00:24:56,385
valves, and solar panels?

489
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,420
And that's not all.

490
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,706
The bathroom faucet is broken.

491
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:06,906
Better get that fixed.

492
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:10,545
You saved
a whole list of repairs for me?

493
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:12,506
I just got back,
and I'm already being put to work.

494
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:14,728
All I'm asking is for you to fix things,
not build a house.

495
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:15,340
Is it that hard?

496
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:16,986
I used to handle all of this.

497
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:18,865
Now it's your turn.

498
00:25:22,305 --> 00:25:23,145
What are you looking at?

499
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:24,139
Hurry up and fix it.

500
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,848
And then you still need
to make us dinner.

501
00:25:26,385 --> 00:25:27,266
Get going.

502
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:29,545
Okay.

503
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:42,105
Mdm. Wang,

504
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:42,946
I'll go help her.

505
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:45,419
It's just a faucet.

506
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,696
She's not going to flood the place.

507
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,585
Gu Yi almost set my place
on fire last time.

508
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:24,746
Heat up the oil

509
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:26,666
and fry until 70% cooked.

510
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:28,865
Pour some oil for me.

511
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:33,380
What are you waiting for?

512
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:35,145
Waiting for me to call out, "Action!"?

513
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,160
I'm waiting for you
to turn on the stove.

514
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,544
I'm waiting for you to pour the oil
so I can turn on the stove.

515
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,656
I'm waiting for you to turn on the stove
so I can pour the oil.

516
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:43,000
That's enough. Get out of the kitchen.

517
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,940
I'll starve if I have
to wait for you two to cook.

518
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:46,065
Get out of here.

519
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:48,545
What are you staring at? Get out.

520
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:52,426
Fine, I'm going to rest.

521
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:53,986
You get out too.

522
00:26:55,585 --> 00:26:56,466
Let me help you.

523
00:26:57,305 --> 00:26:58,026
Forget it.

524
00:26:58,746 --> 00:26:59,666
If you really want to stay,

525
00:27:00,026 --> 00:27:00,906
then talk to me.

526
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:03,506
Well?

527
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:04,585
Made any progress?

528
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:09,065
A little.

529
00:27:10,026 --> 00:27:11,145
What are you waiting for, then?

530
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:12,466
Strike while the iron is hot.

531
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:14,706
Ever heard of
"the slow bird flies first"?

532
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,426
"The slow bird flies first"?

533
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:28,800

534
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,515

(723 steps)

538
00:29:52,345 --> 00:29:53,466
What on earth

539
00:29:54,785 --> 00:29:55,545
are you two doing?

540
00:29:56,145 --> 00:29:57,706
One of you not sleeping

541
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,785
and the other acting
like a ghost sleepwalking.

542
00:30:03,946 --> 00:30:05,906
My back hurt,
so I came out to sit for a bit.

543
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:08,226
How was I supposed to know
he'd be sleepwalking?

544
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:13,746
Liang Daiwen,

545
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:14,506
you...

546
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:15,865
Don't try to give me puppy eyes.

in the middle of night again,

548
00:30:19,946 --> 00:30:21,026
I'll get the aluminum basin

549
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:21,906
and knock you out.

550
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:29,785
You pretended to sleepwalk

551
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:30,986
just to get her attention?

552
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:33,825
Mdm. Wang,

553
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:35,944
you told me
that the slow bird had to fly first

554
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:36,825
this afternoon.

555
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:40,226

Gu Yi.

567
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:38,706
Wake up.

568
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:41,026
Gu Yi.

569
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:47,305
Mom, it's cold!

570
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:47,825
Get up.

571
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:49,426
Up!

Where's the hairdryer?

575
00:32:26,065 --> 00:32:26,785
Looking for this?

576
00:32:30,746 --> 00:32:31,426
Let me help.

577
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,016
Watch out for electrical leakage.

578
00:32:34,105 --> 00:32:34,666
No need.

579
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:35,706
I can do it myself.

580
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:52,706
I just want to stay by your side.

581
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:54,426
I used

582
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:56,266
to let you down,

583
00:32:57,466 --> 00:32:58,266
but now,

584
00:33:00,785 --> 00:33:01,986
I'm trying to open up.

585
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:10,226
Why are you so cold?

586
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,380
What are you trying to do now?

587
00:33:19,226 --> 00:33:20,506
Are you some kind of weirdo?

588
00:33:21,288 --> 00:33:22,800
Do you like me being sharp-tongued?

589
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:45,145
Don't...

590
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:46,506
Don't mess around.

591
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:48,585

Why did you bite me?

597
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:37,545
What am I? A piece of meat?

598
00:34:44,906 --> 00:34:46,386
I'm your canine boyfriend.

599
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:54,225
You're not some canine boyfriend.

600
00:34:54,986 --> 00:34:56,065
You're just a dog.

601
00:34:57,426 --> 00:34:57,826
Move.

602
00:34:58,065 --> 00:34:59,346
I'm going to get a rabies shot.

603
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:00,306
Let me take you.

604
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:01,946
No, no, no...

605
00:35:03,346 --> 00:35:04,585
Liang Daiwen, put me down!

606
00:35:04,946 --> 00:35:06,105
Just... legs...

607

What other moves do you have?

608
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:16,346
Go ahead and use them.

on the first day of her period.

611
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:23,786
You'll need to have

612
00:35:23,866 --> 00:35:25,185
a heating pad

613
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:25,986
and ginger tea ready.

614

615
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:33,585
Cycle?

616
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:35,745
Menstrual cycle.

617
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:37,786
Your period.

618
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:38,986

619
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:41,986

is it really okay for us
to just come in like this?

644
00:37:29,866 --> 00:37:32,145
What's there to worry about?
Mr. He has already arranged everything.

645

00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:44,145
ever watched Errenzhuan?

00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:47,265
don't really remember.

658
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:56,826

Balancing the accounts?

673
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:58,386
Although I trust Mr. He's character,

674
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:01,265
if you want a prenuptial agreement,

675
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:02,665
I'm all for it.

676
00:40:03,145 --> 00:40:04,585
What are you talking about?

677
00:40:07,786 --> 00:40:08,625
All this is for you.

678
00:40:10,466 --> 00:40:12,145
This is all I've got in this life.

679
00:40:12,386 --> 00:40:13,826
A house and two savings accounts.

680
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:15,145
All for you.

681
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:17,386
Why are you giving it to me?

682
00:40:17,986 --> 00:40:19,105
Keep it for yourself.

683
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:20,625
Consider it part of your dowry.

684
00:40:21,906 --> 00:40:22,946
Do I even need a dowry?

685
00:40:23,826 --> 00:40:25,786
Mr. He's already getting a deal
by marrying me.

686
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:28,026
It's you who need it.

687
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:31,306
If it can be used as a dowry, great.

688
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:32,225
If not,

689
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:33,592
it'll be break-up compensation.

690
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:35,185
If anyone dares to bully us,

691
00:40:35,745 --> 00:40:36,466
we've got the money

692
00:40:37,026 --> 00:40:37,946
to make them go away.

693
00:40:38,745 --> 00:40:40,625
I don't need
any "break-up compensation."

694
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:44,065
Can we not act like
we're splitting assets?

695
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,816
I'm not even married, and you're already
planning on abandoning me.

696
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:49,386
Do I even need to?

697
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,940
Your heart's already
with Liang Daiwen, isn't it?

698
00:40:53,386 --> 00:40:54,625
Me? No way!

699
00:40:56,065 --> 00:40:56,745
You're one to talk.

700
00:40:57,426 --> 00:40:58,466
You're so good to him.

701
00:40:58,488 --> 00:41:00,152
You're almost treating him
like an honorary son.

702
00:41:00,346 --> 00:41:01,506
You ungrateful kid.

703
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:03,026
Why would I be good to him

704
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:05,105
if it weren't for you liking him?

705
00:41:05,745 --> 00:41:07,065
I figured that if I treated him well,

706
00:41:07,144 --> 00:41:08,380
he'd treat my daughter even better.

707
00:41:10,545 --> 00:41:11,585
But all jokes aside,

708
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:14,346
Liang is a good boy.

709
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:16,466
He has a good character

710
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:17,786
and he's honest.

711
00:41:18,426 --> 00:41:20,105
Even if he's not the sharpest,

712
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:22,346
you can't love someone

713
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:24,745
only for their strengths,

714
00:41:25,145 --> 00:41:25,625
right?

715
00:41:27,545 --> 00:41:29,545
Someone who's honest
might seem a bit clumsy,

716
00:41:29,624 --> 00:41:30,660
and someone who's reserved

717
00:41:31,065 --> 00:41:31,946
might come off as cold.

718
00:41:32,745 --> 00:41:33,625
No one's perfect.

719
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:35,346
Take you, for example.

720
00:41:36,265 --> 00:41:38,065
Your mind may not be the sharpest,

721
00:41:38,826 --> 00:41:39,705
but it's endearing.

722
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:42,506
Are you complimenting me
or insulting me?

723
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:43,866
I'm lecturing you.

724
00:41:44,665 --> 00:41:45,745
I worry about you.

725
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:50,625
You don't need to worry about me.

726
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:53,545
As long as you and Mr. He

727
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:55,386
live happily ever after,

728
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:56,986
I'll be content.

729
00:42:03,866 --> 00:42:04,466
Gu Yi,

730
00:42:06,506 --> 00:42:08,745
no matter what, remember my words.

731
00:42:09,386 --> 00:42:11,585
Never simply believe anyone's promises,

732
00:42:12,986 --> 00:42:14,065
and never change

733
00:42:14,105 --> 00:42:15,906
your life plans for anyone.

734
00:42:18,466 --> 00:42:20,466
Finding a good partner

735
00:42:20,466 --> 00:42:21,426
is a blessing.

736
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,386
But

737
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,140
you also need to rely on yourself.

738
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:29,745
Only on yourself.

739
00:42:32,065 --> 00:42:33,786
Whether it's Liang's good traits

740
00:42:33,866 --> 00:42:34,625
or his flaws,

741
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:36,745
they're just part of who he is.

742
00:42:38,185 --> 00:42:39,826
Don't think you can change him.

743
00:42:40,585 --> 00:42:41,506
You can't.

744
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:45,386
It's not easy for two people

745
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:46,306
to come together.

746
00:42:47,745 --> 00:42:48,346
Cherish it.

747
00:42:50,386 --> 00:42:52,346
Getting along takes time and effort.

748
00:42:54,545 --> 00:42:55,866
If you can make it work, great.

749
00:42:56,665 --> 00:42:57,506
If not,

750
00:42:58,065 --> 00:42:59,265
don't compromise.

751
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,500
Take care of yourself above all.

752
00:43:07,386 --> 00:43:07,826
Mom,

753
00:43:08,265 --> 00:43:10,185
it's weird hearing you talk like this.

754
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:12,026
Well...

755
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,104
What's weird about what I said?

756
00:43:14,545 --> 00:43:15,346
What's wrong?

757
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,620
Did you have a fight with Mr. He?

758
00:43:18,745 --> 00:43:20,585
What would we have to fight about?

759
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,620
He's even planning to go

760
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,225
to Donghai with us tomorrow.

761
00:43:24,145 --> 00:43:24,745
What?

762
00:43:25,288 --> 00:43:26,940
Aren't you two
getting your marriage certificate?

763
00:43:28,026 --> 00:43:30,225
Then why did I come all this way back?
