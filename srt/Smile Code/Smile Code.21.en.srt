Meixia!

27
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:02,984
Gu Yi!

28
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:16,143
Let me take those.

29
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:16,784
Take them.

30
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:19,023
You've brought loads.

31
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:19,944
That's right.

32
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:21,984
You're all made up,

33
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:23,344
like a New Year poster doll.

34
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:24,664
It's the New Year.

35
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:26,023
Of course I'll have to look good

36
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:27,224
visiting my child in the big city.

37
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:27,984
How is everything?

38
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,664
Ah,

39
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:29,623
so many eggs.

40
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:30,784
I won't be able to finish them.

41
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,504
I made sure to bring lots for you.

42
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,143
Here, Mom.

43
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:39,064
This is the house.

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,537
(Prosperity)

45
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:42,703
Quick, give me a hand.

46
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:43,143
Coming.

47
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:43,784
You're back.

48
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:46,064
I'll do it.

49
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:47,544
Hello, Mdm. Wang.

50
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:49,544
I am Gu Yi's friend.

51
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:50,583
My name is Guan Xingxin.

52
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,784
Ms. Guan.

53
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:53,623
I've heard about you from Gu Yi.

54
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,792
You're as elegant as described.

55
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:56,064
Look at that.

56
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:57,183
Not only is she pretty,

57
00:02:57,272 --> 00:02:58,060
but she's also so sweet,

58
00:02:58,143 --> 00:02:58,703
unlike you,

59
00:02:58,824 --> 00:02:59,824
who have nothing good to say.

60
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:01,743
Hey, demeaning others is rude.

61
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:02,784
I'm just stating facts.

62
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:04,183
It's a reasonable comparison.

63
00:03:04,423 --> 00:03:05,183
Stay around.

64
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:06,344
I'll cook dinner for everyone.

65
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:06,784
Sure thing.

66
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:07,179
Okay.

67
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,008
Change into slippers.

68
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:12,143
Here you go.

69
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:13,303
The last dish is ready.

70
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:14,863
We can start eating.

71
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:16,104
You cooked so much.

72
00:03:16,423 --> 00:03:16,703
Okay.

73
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,544
Mom, you should've made
a spread of dumplings.

74
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:20,824
Are you kidding?

75
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,648
Just having dumplings
isn't enough for the New Year.

76
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,620
I had to cook more dishes

77
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:24,984
in case you people think

78
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:25,944
I'm a lousy cook.

79
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:27,064
Here, come.

80
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:28,143
Drink some wine.

81
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:29,743
Come on.

82
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:31,104
It's the New Year.

83
00:03:31,703 --> 00:03:34,143
Wishing us happiness.

84
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:34,703
Good one.

85
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:36,623
Drink! Happy New Year!

86
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:40,944
That burned.

87
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:43,344
I can't drink this.

88
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:44,504
My gosh.

89
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:46,303
It's not cheap buying liquor here.

90
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,264
One bottle

91
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:48,728
is enough to cover one week's worth

92
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:49,504
back home.

93
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:51,260
Living in the city is tough,

94
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,504
but you guys still chose to work here.

95
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:54,583
Why is that?
Are you addicted to poverty?

96
00:03:58,423 --> 00:04:00,544
Yu Dule, the inspiration
came from my mom.

97
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:01,784
Is it copyrighted?

98
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:04,423
Mdm. Wang...

99
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:06,784
What is this about inspiration?

100
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:07,344
Come now.

101
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:08,143
Eat the food.

102
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:09,023
Try my cooking.

103
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:10,344
Listen, the pot-fried pork

104
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:11,784
is a really hard dish to make.

105
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:13,224
You have to try it. Go on.

106
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:15,544
Try it.

107
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:16,823
I spent a lot of time on it.

108
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:17,704
Here.

109
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,760
(Xu Guanrui: Happy New Year.)

110
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,544
It's a New Year.

111
00:04:22,544 --> 00:04:23,423
Any New Year resolutions?

112
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:24,580
Come on.

113
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,464
Let me hear it.

114
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,700
(Gu Yi: Same to you, Mr. Xu.
Hope you're eating lots of good food.)

115
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:27,303
You go first.

116
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,560
(Xu Guanrui: I'm alone, making do
with very slow food delivery.)

117
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:30,704
Make more money, do less work.

118
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:32,863
Ms. Guan?

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,665
(Gu Yi: Do you want to come to my house?
My mom and friends are here.)

120
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,440
(Xu Guanrui: Be right there.)
Let me think of one.

121
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:40,344
Find a man who truly loves me
and dotes on me.

122
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,896
We have the same thought.

123
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:44,823
But I'm luckier.

124
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:45,743
I've already found him.

125
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:47,623
Gu Yi.

126
00:04:48,263 --> 00:04:49,823
I want to be able to eat well
and sleep well.

127
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:52,544
What's wrong with that?

128
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:54,144
Nothing.

129
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:56,784
Later, a friend

130
00:04:56,784 --> 00:04:58,383
is coming to join us.

131
00:04:58,943 --> 00:04:59,303
Alright.

132
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,312
Sure.

133
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:00,904
Who?

134
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:02,584
Xu Guanrui.

135
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:06,544
Okay.

136
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:07,256
He's welcome.

137
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:07,943
Continue.

138
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:09,144
Come.

139
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:10,303
A toast.

140
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:17,544
Two Pairs.

141
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:20,544
Do it.

142
00:05:23,263 --> 00:05:23,664
Again.

143
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:29,863
Drink up.

144
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:33,224
After meeting your mom,

145
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:34,904
I get why you fought so much with Liang.

146
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:36,263
Ruthlessness is hereditary.

147
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,104
I'll get the door.

148
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:46,623
Hello.

149
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:48,823
Happy New Year.

150
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:51,024
What took you so long? Come in.

151
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:54,503
Change into slippers.

152
00:05:54,943 --> 00:05:55,503
Hi, Madam.

153
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:57,024
Happy New Year.

154
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:57,823
Happy New Year.

155
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,263
Mom, this is my colleague, Xu Guanrui.

156
00:05:59,544 --> 00:05:59,904
My mom,

157
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:00,664
the Great Meixia.

158
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:02,183
Mdm. Wang.

159
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:02,704
Hello.

160
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:03,423
You look so young.

161
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:04,423
Come, sit down.

162
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:04,984
Okay.

163
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:10,144
Are all the dishes here?

164
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:11,383
Yes, yes.

165
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,224
Xu.

166
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,700
These are simple home-cooked food.

167
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:14,584
Hope you don't mind.

168
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:16,224
The dishes look amazing, Mdm. Wang.

169
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:17,863
All good.

170
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:19,620
We waited a long time.

171
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:20,464
How come you came so late?

172
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:22,344
I went to buy some things.

173
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:23,943
It's my first time meeting you,

174
00:06:24,024 --> 00:06:25,303
I wasn't sure what you'd like,

175
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,784
so I simply bought some stuff.

176
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:28,464
Some stuff?

177
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:30,144
Looks more like you emptied
the whole supermarket.

178
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,560
No need to bring anything the next time.

179
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:32,408
Just bring yourself.

180
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:33,608
It's New Year, Mdm. Wang. It's courtesy.

181
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:35,263
Go on and eat.

182
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:37,743
I can make more if you like them.

183
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:38,183
Okay.

184
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:39,784
Gu Yi, make a toast on my behalf.

185
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:40,503
Thanks.

186
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:41,503
Come.

187
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:43,464
Let me drink to you on behalf of my mom.

188
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:44,383
Thank you.

189
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,060
- Thanks, Mdm. Wang.
- Happy New Year.

190
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:46,863
Happy New Year.

191
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:52,984
Xu.

192
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:55,063
It's pretty late to be eating.

193
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:56,863
Is your family not from Donghai?

194
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:58,383
My family is overseas.

195
00:06:58,743 --> 00:06:59,544
I'm here by myself.

196
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:01,984
Gu Yi always boasted about your cooking.

197
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:03,743
So I came to try it today.

198
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:05,503
I see.

199
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:06,904
You are welcome anytime.

200
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:07,943
Whatever you like,

201
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:09,344
tell me and I'll make it for you,

202
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,360
as long as you don't mind.

203
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:11,460
Not at all, it's really good.

204
00:07:16,423 --> 00:07:16,943
Xu.

205
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,224
Aren't you old enough to be married?

206
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:20,544
Mom.

207
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,672
I guess there's someone
if you're not yet married.

208
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:26,423
Hey.

209
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:29,823
Why are you pushing for marriage
on New Year's Eve?

210
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:31,743
Am I pushing for marriage?

211
00:07:32,623 --> 00:07:33,464
Why would I do that?

212
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:34,823
What's the point of marriage?

213
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,384
Eating meals, kissing,
and cleaning house?

214
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,100
Nothing wrong with that.

215
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:40,863
Right?

216
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:41,704
Hence,

217
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:43,720
what's the point of getting married?

218
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,232
Usually, whoever said that didn't
have a bit of sophistication.

219
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:47,700
That's true, you've lived over 50 years,

220
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:49,383
and you've never
taken anything to heart.

221
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,020
Mdm. Wang, it's the New Year.

222
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:53,544
No need to protect her.

223
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:55,263
This is normal for us.
She always gets hit.

224
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:58,664
I'm almost 30.
You need to stop hitting me.

225
00:07:58,776 --> 00:07:59,736
What's the matter?

226
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,080
You're still my child
no matter your age.

227
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:02,220
I can hit you any time.

228
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:04,144
The point is,
there are other people here.

229
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:04,904
That's right.

230
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:06,423
Let me have another drink.

231
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:06,784
Go on.

232
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:07,704
Have another glass.

233
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:09,144
Eat what you like.

234
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,303
Go on.

235
00:08:11,432 --> 00:08:12,020
Happy New Year.

236
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:12,743
Best wishes.

237
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:36,424
It's good.

238
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:42,300
It's your favorite sauerkraut stuffing.

239
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:46,143
Have some more.

240
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,863
I'm still chewing.

241
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:52,903
Okay?

242
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,194
(Today's steps)

243
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:30,704
Happy New Year.

244
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:16,663
Mom.

245
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,064
Happy New Year.

246
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:23,984
(If you really cared about my mom,)

247
00:10:26,424 --> 00:10:27,543
then tell me the truth.

248
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:31,704
How did she die?

249
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:33,143
She fell ill and took her own life.

250
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,663
The treatment during
the later stages was brutal.

251
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:41,783
She didn't want to hold us back.

252
00:10:56,344 --> 00:10:57,224
That's impossible.

253
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:00,344
She...

254
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:02,543
She was fine the day before.

255
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:06,300
She was so happy when she heard
you were coming back

256
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:08,280
and even asked me to pick you up
at the airport.

257
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
She didn't want us to see her go.

258
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:14,903
When a person is determined to die,

259
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:18,464
they won't say goodbye.

260
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:24,104
Nor could we keep them.

261
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:16,984
Gu Yi is right.

262
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:20,543
After you left,

263
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:24,224
time for me stopped.

264
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:29,344
Mom,

265
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:34,143
I no longer want to stay put.

266
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:38,543
I want to move forward.

267
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:22,263
My mom asked you
if there was anything fun yesterday

268
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:23,640
and you said you'd take care of it.

269
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:24,540
This is it?

270
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:25,743
What?

271
00:13:26,743 --> 00:13:27,543
I'm pretty sure

272
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:28,623
Mdm. Wang would enjoy it.

273
00:13:29,783 --> 00:13:31,424
Look, this is an immersive experience.

274
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:32,824
Its selling point is feeling at home.

275
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:33,304
Besides,

276
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:35,584
this is the most popular,
horror secret room right now

277
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,100
with real-life NPCs in a haunted house.

278
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:37,743
What's the problem?

279
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:40,543
Stop arguing you two.

280
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:41,944
I'm ready to go.

281
00:13:42,383 --> 00:13:43,143
Let's start.

282
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,023
I think someone's here.

283
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
(Yang Juan)

284
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
(Zhou Lan)

285
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,120
(Kang Yun)

286
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:54,387
(Zhu Sisi)

287
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:58,184
There are numerous secret doors
within the house.

288
00:13:59,143 --> 00:14:00,263
If you're ready,

289
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:01,663
please remove the blinder.

290
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:07,184
Head toward the study.

291
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,503
Please head to the study.

292
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,143
Mom, Mom...

293
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,743
It's okay, don't be scared.

294
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,344
Don't look.

295
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,520
♪Yes, I can give up my life♪

296
00:14:56,308 --> 00:15:07,267
♪Yes, I can give up my life, for love♪

297
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:08,623
Can you not be so jumpy?

298
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:11,623
It was too sudden, so I got scared.

299
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:15,383
Mom! Mom!

300
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:18,263
Gu Yi, Gu Yi...

301
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:19,464
Don't be scared.

302
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:20,623
Mommy is here.

303
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:21,984
Don't be scared.

304
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,903
Madam Kang Yun.

305
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:27,783
Follow me.

306
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,787
(Kang Yun)

307
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:35,104
Gu Yi.

308
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:36,424
Go be with Yu Dule.

309
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:39,064
Wait, Mom. Don't go.

310
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:40,824
It's too scary. Will you be okay?

311
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:43,344
What's so scary? They're just actors.

312
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:44,863
Okay.

313
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:53,344
Your... Mdm. Wang
doesn't seem fazed at all.

314
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:56,344
Who knows what she's thinking?

315
00:15:57,263 --> 00:15:58,304
We should continue.

316
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,863
You guys go ahead.

317
00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:00,663
You lead.

318
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:01,783
Me?

319
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:11,184
You go... You go!

320
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,824
I'm not going...

321
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:24,623
Kang Yun.

322
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:26,023
Come forward.

323
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:27,743
Take a seat.

324
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:49,623
Your surname is Liang?

325
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:54,104
You know you don't have
long to live, right?

326
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:57,903
Yes.

327
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:00,263
Kang Yun,

328
00:17:01,263 --> 00:17:03,224
as the mistress of the mansion,

329
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:06,343
do you have anything to confess?

330
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:11,023
You look a lot like someone I know.

331
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:13,384
Are you him?

332
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:15,783
Madam,

333
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,343
didn't you read the script?

334
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,664
What script?

335
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:22,624
As per the rules,

336
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:24,424
we can't divulge the plot.

337
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:25,984
So I'll be brief.

338
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:28,023
You are the mistress of the mansion.

339
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:30,864
You married into the household

340
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,264
by getting rid of Mr. Zhou's fiance.

341
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:33,103
Yang Jun

342
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:35,424
is the daughter you lost.

343
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:38,023
Right now, you're terminally ill.

344
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:40,184
Your one regret
is regarding your daughter.

345
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:41,664
Also,

346
00:17:42,343 --> 00:17:43,424
my surname is not Liang.

347
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:45,384
I see.

348
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:48,864
Go on then.

349
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:52,224
Kang Yun,

350
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:54,783
before you die,

351
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:57,263
do you have anything to confess?

352
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:11,904
I feel bad about my daughter.

353
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:16,664
In the first half of my life,
I spent all my time making a living.

354
00:18:18,023 --> 00:18:19,343
I didn't pay her enough attention.

355
00:18:22,464 --> 00:18:25,063
In the later years,
I finally have more time.

356
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:27,823
But she's grown up.

357
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:32,464
She went to university, and left home.

358
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:35,704
She found work in another city
after graduating.

359
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,543
I can pretty much count the days

360
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,184
we spent together with my fingers.

361
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:47,704
They say children are a debt.

362
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:51,823
I'm afraid

363
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:55,560
I won't be able to pay it back
in this life.

364
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:02,503
Then,

365
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:04,263
do you have any other wish?

366
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:09,904
My wish is I hope

367
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:12,543
that the person my daughter likes
could come back soon.

368
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:35,944
How many times have I sleepwalked?

369
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,312
How long have we been here?

370
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:39,144
A week.

371
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:41,904
So it's the seventh time.

372
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:48,103
Why is it getting worse?

373
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:50,743
Don't scare yourself.

374
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,144
Your condition right now

375
00:19:53,144 --> 00:19:54,984
is more akin to separation anxiety.

376
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:56,743
The counseling therapy

377
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:58,343
seems to be working so far.

378
00:19:58,504 --> 00:20:00,504
Previously, your subconscious
was fighting it.

379
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:01,743
But now it's different.

380
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:03,384
You need to persist on it.

381
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:05,263
Do your best to give Gu Yi

382
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:06,583
a perfect Liang Daiwen.

383
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:11,503
Separation anxiety?

384
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:17,583
I'm not a kid.

385
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:18,864
Nor am I an animal.

386
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:22,384
You're behaving

387
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:23,944
more like a human now.

388
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,984
You know how to miss someone.

389
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:29,944
Not bad.

390
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:36,743
Relax.

391
00:20:51,103 --> 00:20:51,624
Yu,

392
00:20:52,343 --> 00:20:53,503
the secret room was a great idea.

393
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:54,984
Thank you so much.

394
00:20:55,624 --> 00:20:56,864
No need to thank me.

395
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:59,384
Gu Yi and I are like siblings
from a different mother.

396
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,184
As the brother,

397
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:01,743
this plan turned out great.

398
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,263
Right.

399
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:04,224
Next time, remember to invite me again.

400
00:21:04,224 --> 00:21:05,103
Definitely.

401
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:05,783
Good.

402
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:07,704
Duoduo.

403
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:10,664
Madam, follow that girl.

404
00:21:10,823 --> 00:21:12,343
I asked her
to save the best seat for you.

405
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:12,944
That means

406
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:14,464
you'll be able
to experience it up close.

407
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:15,864
Okay, thank you.

408
00:21:15,944 --> 00:21:16,664
Don't mention it.

409
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:17,384
You go on, Mom.

410
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:18,023
All the best.

411
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:18,459
Careful.

412
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,048
Watch the steps.

413
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,700
Careful.

414
00:21:28,063 --> 00:21:28,743
What is it?

415
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,696
Let's have a drink.

416
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:33,424
Okay.

417
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:34,224
Let's go.

418
00:21:38,503 --> 00:21:39,624
My girlfriend is

419
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:40,944
a very emotionally stable person.

420
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:43,063
She's always annoyed.

421
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,984
She is angry when I go out.

422
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:48,823
She is angry when I play games.

423
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:50,783
She is angry when I drink.

424
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,303
I think

425
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,343
she is angry whenever I'm happy.

426
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:57,704
Excuse me, your drinks.

427
00:21:58,103 --> 00:21:58,664
Thanks.

428
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:10,263
What's the matter, Mr. Yu?

429
00:22:13,704 --> 00:22:14,624
Ounce is closing shop.

430
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:18,783
What do you mean?

431
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:24,632
The boss is not going
to renew the lease.

432
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,660
It's losing too much money.

433
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:31,660
Lu can no longer plug the holes.

434
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:34,344
It's closing down after the New Year

435
00:22:34,904 --> 00:22:35,664
at the earliest.

436
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,464
You're not joking, are you?

437
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:43,063
I was going to tell you

438
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:44,464
the last time I went to your house.

439
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:46,984
But you were having a bad fever.

440
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:48,424
I didn't have the heart to tell you.

441
00:22:50,224 --> 00:22:51,664
I asked the boss many times.

442
00:22:53,343 --> 00:22:54,063
There's no saving it.

443
00:22:54,783 --> 00:22:55,543
The stand-up comedy

444
00:22:56,384 --> 00:22:57,583
will surely be cut.

445
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:05,864
Does Mr. Lu know?

446
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:07,624
Yes, he knows.

447
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:08,464
But...

448
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:10,823
so what if he knows?

449
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:14,184
You've not seen Ounce's books.

450
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:15,864
This place

451
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,743
costs 120,000 yuan monthly to rent.

452
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,103
That's not counting the labor,
utilities, and damages.

453
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,368
Depending on liquor sales alone

454
00:23:23,544 --> 00:23:24,500
won't cover the costs.

455
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:27,503
It's basically a bottomless pit.

456
00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:30,224
Even if Lu

457
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:31,743
wants to help,

458
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:34,424
he can't keep burning money like this.

459
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:43,704
How could this be?

460
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:46,904
Ounce is practically my home.

461
00:23:48,263 --> 00:23:49,503
How could it just close?

462
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,424
Yeah.

463
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,583
Since leaving the TV station,

464
00:24:02,664 --> 00:24:03,583
I've been here.

465
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:06,740
In the blink of an eye,

466
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:11,343
many years have passed.

467
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:15,103
But I can't help it.

468
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,140
This is a business after all.

469
00:24:18,464 --> 00:24:19,624
They're paying the money.

470
00:24:19,783 --> 00:24:20,384
Whereas

471
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:22,184
we're just the actors on stage.

472
00:24:23,704 --> 00:24:24,743
We have no right to object.

473
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:27,063
All we can do is quietly

474
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:28,743
acknowledge the fact

475
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:30,144
and accept it.

476
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:38,424
Ms. Gu.

477
00:24:41,528 --> 00:24:42,740
There's only moving forward.

478
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:50,743
It's a New Year,

479
00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:52,904
but there's nothing left.

480
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:56,823
Ounce may be gone,

481
00:24:57,976 --> 00:24:58,900
but we're still here.

482
00:25:14,023 --> 00:25:15,664
Anyway, I'm no longer
answering their calls.

483
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:18,624
What matters is your own frame of mind.

484
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:20,904
I know.

485
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:23,823
By the way, Liang, how have you been?

486
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:28,379
Since coming here,

487
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,912
I've been continuing
with my counseling therapy.

488
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:30,503
I'm better.

489
00:25:31,543 --> 00:25:31,944
Bro,

490
00:25:32,343 --> 00:25:33,743
does that mean
you won't sleepwalk tonight?

491
00:25:35,944 --> 00:25:36,543
I'll do my best.

492
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:37,583
Good luck.

493
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:39,424
Liang,

494
00:25:39,984 --> 00:25:41,704
you should hurry back
once you finish the treatment.

495
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:43,823
Guan Guan.

496
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:45,419
If there's nothing else,

497
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,280
we'll talk next time.

498
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,020
Don't talk nonsense.

499
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,984
I'd like to sleep tonight,
thank you very much.

500
00:25:49,992 --> 00:25:50,540
Don't mind it.

501
00:25:50,743 --> 00:25:51,263
Hang on.

502
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:54,224
Whatever.

503
00:25:54,823 --> 00:25:55,944
Liang, come back quickly.

504
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:57,063
If you don't come back,

505
00:25:57,184 --> 00:25:58,583
Gu Yi's going to end up with Xu Guanrui.

506
00:26:02,783 --> 00:26:03,823
I heard nothing.

507
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:05,904
This is just alarmist talk.

508
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:29,743
Dear Meixia.

509
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:31,583
Eating oranges?

510
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:41,303
Mrs. Meixia.

511
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:43,503
When

512
00:26:44,664 --> 00:26:45,743
are you planning to leave?

513
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:48,408
Are you kicking your mom out?

514
00:26:49,023 --> 00:26:50,023
I'm not kicking you out.

515
00:26:50,072 --> 00:26:52,456
I reckon your long-distance relationship
has gone on long enough.

516
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:53,944
Hasn't Mr. He said anything?

517
00:26:55,368 --> 00:26:57,656
What does he have to say about
my visiting my daughter?

518
00:26:57,752 --> 00:26:59,256
He better not get ahead of himself.

519
00:27:00,783 --> 00:27:02,583
Didn't you complain
about me being annoying?

520
00:27:03,184 --> 00:27:04,424
How come now you're the one pestering?

521
00:27:06,568 --> 00:27:08,904
Am I not allowed to pester you
because you don't pester me?

522
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,904
What's that about?

523
00:27:10,624 --> 00:27:11,464
You annoying girl.

524
00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:16,144
Gu Yi.

525
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,864
Do you think Xu Guanrui likes you?

526
00:27:24,063 --> 00:27:25,103
I don't know.

527
00:27:27,224 --> 00:27:27,984
Are you acting dumb?

528
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:37,624
Listen to me.

529
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,624
Xu Guanrui is no good.

530
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:41,192
He's too considerate.

531
00:27:44,144 --> 00:27:45,864
Why is being considerate a flaw?

532
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,200
Being overly considerate is a flaw.

533
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:51,704
Although Liang

534
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:52,944
is a little moody...

535
00:27:55,303 --> 00:27:56,303
Like a moody gourd.

536
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:57,900
What do you people call it?

537
00:27:58,103 --> 00:27:58,823
Passive aggressive?

538
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:00,864
I guess you could say that.

539
00:28:01,704 --> 00:28:02,743
But he's not a bad person.

540
00:28:07,624 --> 00:28:09,664
Liang and I have no chance.

541
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:16,783
Do you remember,

542
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,263
when I was seven,

543
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:20,624
you got all made up

544
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:21,583
one day?

545
00:28:22,103 --> 00:28:24,343
You left the house
wearing your red leather shoes.

546
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:25,784
You said you had to go somewhere

547
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,140
and told me to go play at grandma's.

548
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:30,503
When I got home,

549
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:32,424
all of Dad's things were gone.

550
00:28:34,783 --> 00:28:37,023
That's when I found out
the reason you dressed up.

551
00:28:38,023 --> 00:28:39,464
You went to get divorced.

552
00:28:41,624 --> 00:28:42,503
At first,

553
00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:44,743
I didn't understand
why you were so determined.

554
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:47,944
Now I do.

555
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:50,936
It wasn't because
you lost the affection,

556
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,424
you had lost the trust.

557
00:28:55,224 --> 00:28:56,783
From when Dad lied
to you again and again

558
00:28:56,823 --> 00:28:58,303
about going to social events,

559
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:00,864
and you saw him dancing away in clubs

560
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,343
time and time again.

561
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,208
That's when you stopped
trusting him, right?

562
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:10,296
It's the same with me and Liang Daiwen.

563
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:11,704
He lied to me,

564
00:29:11,944 --> 00:29:13,224
so I'm not believing him again.

565
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:16,360
Those are two different matters.

566
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:17,688
There's no comparison to be made.

567
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:24,063
Well, who knows
if he's coming back or not?

568
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:26,088
Forget it.

569
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:27,384
Let it be.

570
00:29:55,343 --> 00:29:56,103
It's this way.

571
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:13,743
Mr. Li Ai.

572
00:30:24,944 --> 00:30:25,743
I recently saw

573
00:30:26,103 --> 00:30:27,583
some news about you.

574
00:30:28,944 --> 00:30:29,944
It feels a little jarring.

575
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:32,783
Actually,

576
00:30:33,823 --> 00:30:35,144
I've looked into your work.

577
00:30:36,023 --> 00:30:37,823
If you had wanted to copy the designs,

578
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:40,263
I doubt you'd do it in such a dumb way.

579
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:42,103
So...

580
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:44,900
it was a false accusation, wasn't it?

581
00:30:47,664 --> 00:30:49,384
I didn't come to see you
over the plagiarism.

582
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:53,823
I know what you came for.

583
00:30:55,224 --> 00:30:56,704
Someone came to see me before.

584
00:30:57,664 --> 00:31:00,583
I was told that you're very interested
in accessible design.

585
00:31:01,144 --> 00:31:02,500
And you're looking for a partner.

586
00:31:05,303 --> 00:31:06,743
But later I heard

587
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:09,103
that you went
for a job interview overseas.

588
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:12,224
Is that true?

589
00:31:14,904 --> 00:31:15,704
It's all true.

590
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:17,263
I did the interview

591
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:20,328
because I wanted
to terminate the contract.

592
00:31:20,472 --> 00:31:22,580
I didn't want my former company
to know about you so quickly.

593
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:26,384
Then should I

594
00:31:27,103 --> 00:31:28,023
feel flattered?

595
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:31,823
Turns out, you went the long route

596
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:33,384
because of me.

597
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:38,823
That's right.

598
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,664
I hope you'll go back
to Donghai with me.

599
00:31:44,224 --> 00:31:44,864
Donghai?

600
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:47,303
Go back for what?

601
00:31:48,263 --> 00:31:49,944
I lost my legs in Donghai.

602
00:31:50,904 --> 00:31:53,823
I lost them on the way
to build accessible designs.

603
00:31:58,624 --> 00:31:59,864
Ironic, isn't it?

604
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,579
I have been committed

605
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,544
to improving the plight of people
with disabilities.

606
00:32:03,864 --> 00:32:04,704
But in the end,

607
00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:09,624
I became one of them.

608
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:18,624
My mom was also disabled.

609
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:20,583
For as long as I can remember,

610
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:22,743
she was always in a wheelchair.

611
00:32:25,184 --> 00:32:26,583
To her,

612
00:32:27,464 --> 00:32:28,904
every step in life was a challenge.

613
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:30,864
At last, it became unbearable

614
00:32:31,864 --> 00:32:33,180
and she chose to take her own life.

615
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:35,424
After she died, I kept thinking.

616
00:32:36,103 --> 00:32:37,303
If I could turn back time,

617
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:41,424
what could I have done
to keep her from dying?

618
00:32:44,344 --> 00:32:46,380
The only thing I could think
of was accessible design.

619
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:48,464
If she could be independent

620
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:50,664
and lived the way she wanted,

621
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,184
perhaps she wouldn't
have felt like a burden.

622
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:04,063
Mr. Li Ai,

623
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,424
what I'm trying to say is,

624
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:08,979
I believe that every

625
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,776
person has the right
to live with dignity.

626
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:20,184
But I don't have to be in China

627
00:33:21,023 --> 00:33:22,624
to work on accessible design.

628
00:33:23,783 --> 00:33:24,503
Perhaps

629
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,103
the conditions abroad are better.

630
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:39,904
I have to go back.

631
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:43,904
Donghai has my everything.

632
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:59,063
Why are you drinking
so early in the day?

633
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:01,023
It's a nice day today.

634
00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:02,144
We should go out.

635
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:05,583
Is Yu Dule

636
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,904
planning to confess to me tonight?

637
00:34:09,784 --> 00:34:11,023
Is he?

638
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:13,063
I have no idea.

639
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:15,543
You can stop the act.

640
00:34:16,143 --> 00:34:17,824
The flower shop called this morning.

641
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:18,703
They said,

642
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:20,703
thank you, Mr. Yu, for the big order.

643
00:34:22,344 --> 00:34:23,424
That idiot.

644
00:34:25,384 --> 00:34:26,304
Okay.

645
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:28,143
He asked me to get you out of the house

646
00:34:28,143 --> 00:34:29,464
until nighttime.

647
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:32,623
Now that you know,

648
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:34,260
what is your thought on it?

649
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:39,344
Gu Yi,

650
00:34:40,223 --> 00:34:41,824
let me tell you about my childhood.

651
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:47,424
During the period when I couldn't see,

652
00:34:48,056 --> 00:34:50,120
I'd go to the market
with my mom to sell wool.

653
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:52,063
There was a woman

654
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:53,824
who often visited our stall.

655
00:34:54,503 --> 00:34:56,304
She'd grab onto me
and tell me all sorts of things.

656
00:34:58,103 --> 00:34:59,344
I later found out

657
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,539
that she had wanted to donate

658
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,640
her late daughter's cornea.

659
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:04,984
A cost-free donation.

660
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:07,703
The only condition

661
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:10,304
was that I'd take her as my godmom.

662
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:13,063
This was her wish.

663
00:35:14,944 --> 00:35:16,503
Her own daughter

664
00:35:16,904 --> 00:35:18,904
got into an accident
on the way to school

665
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:21,264
and died on the spot.

666
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:23,663
It almost drove her mad.

667
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:28,703
Until she chanced upon me at the market,

668
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:30,663
a girl who looked like her daughter.

669
00:35:35,623 --> 00:35:36,304
Later,

670
00:35:36,864 --> 00:35:37,784
the surgery was a success.

671
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,264
I took Mr. and Mrs. Chen
as my godparents,

672
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:42,424
and their son as my older brother.

673
00:35:44,063 --> 00:35:45,223
They got me

674
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:46,384
to learn music,

675
00:35:46,663 --> 00:35:47,384
dance,

676
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,136
and provided me
with a private education.

677
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:51,464
I got my master's degree.

678
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:53,984
They bought me a house,

679
00:35:54,864 --> 00:35:55,784
and got me a job.

680
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,223
All the money and effort
they spent on me

681
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:00,464
didn't bother them at all.

682
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:04,384
But gradually,

683
00:36:07,023 --> 00:36:08,304
they became more controlling of me.

684
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:11,344
They wanted me to keep my hair long,

685
00:36:12,824 --> 00:36:13,703
to wear dresses,

686
00:36:14,663 --> 00:36:15,503
and to be a good girl.

687
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:20,183
When I started to become wary
of the rules,

688
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:22,143
that's when I slowly realized.

689
00:36:26,864 --> 00:36:28,183
I could no longer leave them.

690
00:36:30,744 --> 00:36:31,864
I'd miss the people,

691
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:34,503
and miss

692
00:36:34,904 --> 00:36:35,904
the comfortable life.

693
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:40,023
As long as I have these eyes,

694
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,344
they'll love me unconditionally.

695
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:52,944
How does it feel

696
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:54,824
to have two sets of parents?

697
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:58,464
It's very complicated.

698
00:37:00,424 --> 00:37:01,103
They

699
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:02,304
love me dearly.

700
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,344
But

701
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:06,264
they only love the impression of me.

702
00:37:08,384 --> 00:37:10,143
Losing my eyesight, rebelling,
going against them,

703
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:11,503
those were all deductions.

704
00:37:12,904 --> 00:37:15,183
I'm like a humanoid they built.

705
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:18,023
I'll never be able to be my real self.

706
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,063
Does Mr. Yu know about this?

707
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:34,464
I don't dare tell him.

708
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:39,503
Gu Yi,

709
00:37:40,264 --> 00:37:41,103
do you remember

710
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:42,543
I said I envied you?

711
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:45,103
I meant it.

712
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,503
I envy you

713
00:37:48,103 --> 00:37:49,744
because you're free to like
whomever you like,

714
00:37:50,623 --> 00:37:51,824
and live the life you want.

715
00:37:54,464 --> 00:37:55,143
I dare not do that.

716
00:37:57,784 --> 00:37:59,864
The way my godparents raised me

717
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:02,063
is the way

718
00:38:02,103 --> 00:38:03,864
they weren't able to do
for their own daughter.

719
00:38:05,904 --> 00:38:07,984
So my living as the dead girl

720
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:12,103
is the only way I can repay them.

721
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:19,223
Let's go.

722
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:21,424
We'll give Mr. Yu his chance.

723
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:23,103
Anyway,

724
00:38:23,864 --> 00:38:25,023
I'd like to take you somewhere.

725
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:26,583
Let me get changed.

726
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:45,623
Why did you bring me here?

727
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,223
When Liang resigned,

728
00:38:49,503 --> 00:38:50,944
Zhang Qingya forced him to move out.

729
00:38:52,023 --> 00:38:53,583
He had wanted
to purchase the house then,

730
00:38:54,424 --> 00:38:56,183
but the owner lied and said
it was already sold.

731
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:57,503
That's why

732
00:38:57,663 --> 00:38:58,824
he had to move upstairs.

733
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,703
This time, when he went to Dalian
to care for his dad,

734
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,784
Mr. Liang asked him about that one time

735
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:06,344
when you signed
for the birthday present.

736
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:08,380
That's how he found out about you two.

737
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:11,583
He specifically asked someone
to buy this property back.

738
00:39:16,424 --> 00:39:17,720
You know the passcode, right?

739
00:39:34,824 --> 00:39:35,744

Why so late?

750
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,520
♪One day, you will also bravely♪

751
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,840
♪Overcome those rough patches♪

752
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,480
♪I guess one part of the story♪

753
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:43,877
♪Meets its awakened moment♪

754
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:50,280
♪Can I love you more♪

755
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:54,423
♪Can I love you more♪

756
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:56,183
Liang asked me to look after his place.

757
00:40:57,304 --> 00:40:59,304
He said if you're in a pickle,

758
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:01,103
you can stay here any time.

759
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:09,663
Is he alright?

760
00:41:14,424 --> 00:41:14,904
Not really.

761
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:19,023
Shen went with him overseas
for his treatment.

762
00:41:20,264 --> 00:41:22,944
I heard Liang has been
sleepwalking at night,

763
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,744
knocking on doors.

764
00:41:24,543 --> 00:41:25,784
Shen hasn't had time to sleep,

765
00:41:26,143 --> 00:41:26,904
busy counseling him.

766
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:57,503
Stop pressing.

767
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,320
The electricity tripped.

768
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:17,944
You planned all that to get me away

769
00:42:18,072 --> 00:42:19,704
and a cake is all you prepared?

770
00:42:21,344 --> 00:42:21,824
I

771
00:42:22,223 --> 00:42:23,744
spent the whole afternoon
to fix the power.

772
00:42:23,984 --> 00:42:25,503
I didn't have time to prepare.

773
00:42:25,904 --> 00:42:26,703
Please understand.

774
00:42:28,183 --> 00:42:29,063
Can it be fixed?

775
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:30,984
I'll do my best.

776
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,460
Hang on a minute.

777
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:37,543
Why don't we eat first?

778
00:42:38,143 --> 00:42:39,023
We can cut the cake later.

779
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,900
Is there anymore liquor in the fridge?

780
00:42:42,304 --> 00:42:42,744
Yes.

781
00:42:43,264 --> 00:42:44,583
There's only Baileys Irish Cream though.

782
00:42:45,344 --> 00:42:46,464
What...

783
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,623
would you like?

784
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,800
I've been thinking
about the past few days.

785
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:00,384
What kind of surprises

786
00:43:00,384 --> 00:43:01,183
would please you?

787
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,780
But no matter what I come up with,

788
00:43:09,944 --> 00:43:10,703
it feels inadequate.

789
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:24,744
You had told me

790
00:43:25,663 --> 00:43:26,663
how you're sick of people.

791
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,000
You didn't know
how to love someone else.

792
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:31,744
You were in one too many
weird relationships.

793
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,984
Every attraction
was because you were bored.

794
00:43:36,304 --> 00:43:37,023
Sure, I get it.

795
00:43:38,023 --> 00:43:39,023
You told me all that

796
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:40,984
because you wanted me to give up.

797
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:43,503
But after hearing that,
I actually found you

798
00:43:44,223 --> 00:43:45,023
more adorable.

799
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:51,424
I like you.

800
00:43:55,143 --> 00:43:55,784
Very much.

801
00:44:00,503 --> 00:44:01,583
I like the things you say,

802
00:44:02,824 --> 00:44:04,023
and like the things you do.

803
00:44:06,023 --> 00:44:07,264
Whatever kind of person you are,

804
00:44:07,944 --> 00:44:08,864
it doesn't matter to me.

805
00:44:10,744 --> 00:44:11,944
You think I'm not what love is.

806
00:44:12,944 --> 00:44:13,984
That's fine.

807
00:44:14,872 --> 00:44:16,220
Anyway, I will always care for you,

808
00:44:16,944 --> 00:44:17,503
protect you,

809
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:18,784
worry about you,

810
00:44:19,144 --> 00:44:20,248
and care for you.

811
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:31,063
I think I said "care for you" twice.

812
00:44:36,304 --> 00:44:36,904
This afternoon...

813
00:44:36,904 --> 00:44:38,543
Memorizing the lines this afternoon
went well.

814
00:44:38,824 --> 00:44:40,384
I didn't mean to...

815
00:44:41,744 --> 00:44:42,744
Yu Dule.

816
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:46,103
When you're doing stand-up comedy,

817
00:44:46,543 --> 00:44:47,583
you have a lot of punchlines.

818
00:44:48,623 --> 00:44:50,744
But this time,
your lines are pretty bland.

819
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:52,424
How about I tell you a skit?

820
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:54,103
Something I've not performed yet.

821
00:44:54,864 --> 00:44:55,223
No, don't.

822
00:44:55,384 --> 00:44:55,744
Shut it.

823
00:44:57,623 --> 00:44:59,103
The mood is totally romantic now.

824
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:00,063
Keeping my mouth shut

825
00:45:00,623 --> 00:45:01,864
will just make it awkward.

826
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:03,304
Besides, you...

827
00:45:03,944 --> 00:45:05,183
haven't answered me about...

828
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:57,264
Liang Daiwen.

829
00:45:58,063 --> 00:45:58,864
Don't think I don't know

830
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:00,023
you're spying on me.

831
00:46:01,264 --> 00:46:02,063
I'll let you know.

832
00:46:02,944 --> 00:46:04,464
My popularity soared after you left.

833
00:46:05,223 --> 00:46:07,344
The line of men interested in me
goes all the way to New York.

834
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:10,223
I thank you for leaving
without a goodbye.

835
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:11,824
Thanks for walking away.

836
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,183
I'm in a good mood today,

837
00:46:14,312 --> 00:46:16,072
so I'll stay and chat with you.

838
00:46:18,464 --> 00:46:20,503
No one's going to hang around
waiting for you.

839
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:22,264
Me included.

840
00:46:23,063 --> 00:46:24,183
From now on,

841
00:46:24,183 --> 00:46:25,623
I'm going to start living a new life.
