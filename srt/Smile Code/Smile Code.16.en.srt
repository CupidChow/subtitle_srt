23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
(Adapted from Douban Read's work
"Smile Code" by Zu Yue)

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,140
=Episode 16=

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,680
How is this any different

26
00:02:11,752 --> 00:02:12,776
from the layout downstairs?

27
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,310
If you don't wish to move out,

28
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:16,233
you could've just bought Unit 1402.

29
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:19,270
I tried it before.

30
00:02:19,768 --> 00:02:20,696
It was already sold out.

31
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:23,912
So,

32
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:26,152
you wish to replicate the unit.

33
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,953
You think you can return to the past

34
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,456
by just moving everything upstairs.

35
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:34,752
That's not it.

36
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,760
The company was in a hurry
to take the unit back.

37
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:39,528
I moved everything upstairs

38
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:41,048
because I was already used to it.

39
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:44,312
Is that so?

40
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:47,472
Or are you just used
to Gu Yi's presence?

41
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,312
Lately,

42
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:02,513
I have no appetite.

43
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:05,192
That's normal.

44
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:06,750
When you have alexithymia,

45
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,336
you cannot distinguish between
emotional and physical sensations.

46
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:10,752
All these years,

47
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:12,513
you've been taking your medicine on time

48
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:14,056
and visiting the hospital regularly.

49
00:03:15,273 --> 00:03:16,872
You maintained
a regular diet and routine

50
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:18,712
in order to control your emotions.

51
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,553
Now,

52
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:22,192
after being triggered by Gu Yi,

53
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:24,104
it's normal for you
not to have any appetite.

54
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:31,032
Since Gu Yi has moved out,

55
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:33,192
you should have some time alone.

56
00:03:34,073 --> 00:03:34,993
Calming down

57
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,273
is beneficial to both of you.

58
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:38,872
Speaking of which,

59
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:40,353
telling you to watch a stand-up comedy

60
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:41,793
was my idea.

61
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:44,353
I didn't expect it to turn out this way.

62
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:45,768
I'm partly responsible too.

63
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:48,568
This has nothing to do with you guys.

64
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:52,752
From a psychiatrist's perspective,

65
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:54,993
I understand you completely.

66
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:58,152
But from Gu Yi's perspective,

67
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,192
you can't just expect her

68
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,310
to wait for you unconditionally
all the time.

69
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:09,656
Now, I just wish
to distance myself from her.

70
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,192
My mind is a complete mess right now.

71
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:16,072
I told you this before.

72
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:18,272
A relationship concerns two people.

73
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,832
If distancing yourself from each other
doesn't work out,

74
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:23,312
you should

75
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:24,752
try the opposite.

76
00:04:28,432 --> 00:04:29,233
Try the opposite?

77
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:33,632
If it's excruciating for you

78
00:04:34,153 --> 00:04:35,272
to part ways with her,

79
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,390
you should try to be together with her.

80
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:50,630
Since you were in a hurry

81
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:51,952
to move out,

82
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:54,190
I suppose Zhang Qingya has agreed
to let you leave, huh?

83
00:04:57,312 --> 00:04:57,832
No.

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,264
I need to submit one last design sketch.

85
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,673
But she wanted it urgently.

86
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,744
She wants me to refer
to the client's suggestions

87
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:08,056
and come up with a draft.

88
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,696
So, you think something's wrong?

89
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:16,072
It should be fine without a signature.

90
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,256
But if I have to put my signature,

91
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,368
it'll complicate things
even if it's just a draft.

92
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,033
All these years,

93
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:28,568
I suppose Zhang Qingya was considered
a bosom friend of yours.

94
00:05:30,392 --> 00:05:32,593
If she truly wanted to let you go,

95
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:35,304
I don't think it's as simple
as merely taking the unit back.

96
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:37,713
You have to be careful.

97
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:10,264
Do you need something?

98
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:14,952
Ms. Zhang,

99
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:18,072
last time,

100
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:19,392
I was too emotional.

101
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:20,832
I was harsh with my words.

102
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:24,072
No matter what was the result,

103
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,590
you were the one who led me
when I did the proposal.

104
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:28,750
I know you've devoted
a lot of effort to it.

105
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:30,310
I'm truly grateful to you.

106
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:35,592
You've come up with
plenty of scripts for Art List as well.

107
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,829
(Art List)

108
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,944
Tell me about your thoughts.

109
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,710
Now that you've calmed down,

110
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,944
let's talk about business.

111
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:46,353
I need to tell you a secret.

112
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:48,673
Roger wishes to purchase Art List.

113
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,280
I wish to manage it together with you.

114
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:52,713
If you head

115
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:54,752
to Art List,

116
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,312
what will happen...

117
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,512
What will happen to Nextmonday?

118
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:00,312
I took over

119
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,648
Nextmonday when it was
at its lowest moment.

120
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:04,080
Of course I feel a sense of achievement

121
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:05,256
after achieving such a result.

122
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:06,752
But it's too stable.

123
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:08,552
I don't even have
a sense of presence here.

124
00:07:10,984 --> 00:07:12,072
It's the same for you.

125
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:14,473
The Supplement Editor
and the Deputy Director

126
00:07:14,553 --> 00:07:15,632
have to focus on Nextmonday.

127
00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:18,113
Now, Penny is the Deputy Director.

128
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:20,376
Even if I do appoint you
as the Supplement Editor,

129
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:21,870
how much freedom will you have?

130
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,312
If you're doing this for the money,

131
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:26,248
Penny's position is the best you can do.

132
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,728
But this is different.

133
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,952
I'm going to give you a brand.

134
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:32,232
A personal brand.

135
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,928
It's not just a magazine firm.

136
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,153
What do I need to do?

137
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:42,550
You need to grasp Art List fully.

138
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:44,832
From content to data to users,

139
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,288
you need to implement every detail
thoroughly in all aspects.

140
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:49,989
Understood.

141
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,112
I'll do it as fast as possible.

142
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,976
There's no rush.

143
00:07:52,184 --> 00:07:53,720
You should finish
the current issue first.

144
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:54,920
I've read your initial draft.

145
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:56,472
There were plenty of fancy words.

146
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,552
But this isn't just any
street interview essay.

147
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,470
There's no resonance
if you don't hit the nail on the head.

148
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:04,680
Did you go on a blind date
when I told you to?

149
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:06,993
I did.

150
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:09,233
My self-awareness
has significantly increased.

151
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:11,632
Jesus...

152
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,064
I didn't send you on a blind date
for you to assess your value.

153
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,510
The subject of a blind date is essential
in a relationship between men and women.

154
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:21,673
You can't afford to be narrow-minded.

155
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:22,789
Since you've experienced it,

156
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,568
you need to think out of the box
when you write.

157
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:25,673
Leave now.

158
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,064
Submit it to me after correcting it.

159
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:39,993
(Her goals are clear,)

160
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:41,350
(and her actions are decisive.)

161
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,032
(She's not shaken by any rumors,)

162
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:45,064
(and she doesn't plunder
her subordinates' resources.)

163
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:47,750
(Although she's suspected of
mind-controlling people sometimes,)

164
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:50,713
(she's still a versatile fighter.)

165
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:52,593
(She's the perfect boss.)

166
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:11,430

Huang Wenda.

168
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,650
(Linda Group)
In the PR industry.

169
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,440
You tried to collaborate
with Xu Guanrui before this, right?

170
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:17,736
Here is the thing.

171
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:20,008
It's risky for you to be
on Nextmonday's cover.

172
00:09:20,024 --> 00:09:20,840
They can't handle it.

173
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,456
That's why they requested me
to take over.

174
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:25,152
How did you get to know Zhang Junjie?

175
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:26,792
We're friends.

176
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:27,704
What about you?

177
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:28,872
Friends, huh?

178
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:31,400
Zhang Junjie actually has friends, huh?

179
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:37,233
You see,

180
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:38,584
I'm her ex-boyfriend.

181
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:39,433
Back then,

182
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:41,032
I introduced her to the industry.

183
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,576
Domestic media was booming
in those years.

184
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
I worked in the PR department

185
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,810
while she was
in the advertising department.

186
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,910
We made quite a lot of money.

187
00:09:47,313 --> 00:09:48,752
She learned all those PR techniques

188
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:49,833
from me.

189
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,216
I was the one who reconstructed
her worldview as well.

190
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:53,632
But in the end,

191
00:09:54,713 --> 00:09:56,073
I didn't expect her to abandon me.

192
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:58,193
She joined my rival company.

193
00:09:58,296 --> 00:09:59,368
Do you dare to imagine that?

194
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:01,390
She was less than
30 years old back then,

195
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,850
but she proved herself in front of men.

196
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:03,512
Her goal

197
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:04,752
was to be equal with me.

198
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:05,710
Isn't it hilarious?

199
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:08,392
I cannot imagine

200
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:09,870
that you still despise her until now.

201
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:12,593
Young girl,

202
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:14,833
you don't know anything at this age.

203
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:17,432
Public relations isn't
as easy as you think.

204
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,750
It's either you take the blame
and clean up the mess

205
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,464
or get yourself involved in
power struggles.

206
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,329
One breadwinner
in the family is more than enough.

207
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,069
How can we live well

208
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,710
if everyone in the family
does the same job?

209
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:26,993
Didn't she leave you long ago?

210
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:29,670
I suppose you still
wanted to control her

211
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,968
even after you guys broke up, right?

212
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,069
I exposed myself online once.

213
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,376
I think you should know about it.

214
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:36,433
I'm sure a vulgar man like you

215
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:37,736
has watched it before.

216
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:40,392
That was the biggest crisis
I encountered in life.

217
00:10:40,952 --> 00:10:43,064
Jacqueline was the one
who resolved the dispute for me.

218
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,833
That woman who you always despised

219
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,064
has become independent long ago.

220
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:49,632
You should stop
discriminating against women.

221
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:56,200
Aren't we here
to talk about business today?

222
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:56,830
Let's get to it.

223
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:13,833
Zhang Junjie,

224
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:15,833
are you old for real?

225
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,953
You have excellent taste, don't you?

226
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:19,792
That Guan Xingxin you found,

227
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:22,392
she's useless except for her good looks.

228
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:24,824
She's even worse than you
when you were young.

229
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,361

Find Xu Guanrui for your deals.)

You like antique shops, huh?

234
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:57,073
I thought to myself

235
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,710
that I would want to open
an oddity store

236
00:11:58,713 --> 00:11:59,672
if I had the chance.

237
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,392
It'll only open after midnight.

238
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:04,792
I'll sell all kinds of antiques,

239
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:05,593
tales of the past,

240
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:06,872
childhood memories and so on.

241
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:09,433
If a customer likes a certain item

242
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:10,752
and can't afford it,

243
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:12,353
they can exchange it

244
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:13,313
with their wish.

245
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:16,230
What wish do you have, then?

246
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:28,113
Smile.

247
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,064
Are you thinking of Liang Daiwen again?

248
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:11,713
Who said so?

249
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:13,350
Stop lying to me.

250
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:14,984
There are butterflies in your stomach.

251
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:16,752
Is it that obvious?

252
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,073
Liang texted me.

253
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:20,632
He told me to look after you.

254
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:22,752
I think

255
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:24,792
you two still have a chance.

256
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:26,512
What do you mean by that?

257
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:28,193
I've already suffered defeat.

258
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:30,630
There's no victory or loss
when it comes to love.

259
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,990
You can still text him
even if you've suffered defeat.

260
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,568
You two didn't sever your ties.

261
00:13:35,593 --> 00:13:36,433
I won't text him.

262
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,210
Are you worried
that he might not reply to you?

263
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:44,712
If so, I'll create a group chat.

264
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,531
(Chat Group)

265
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:51,040

Aren't you being too direct?

268
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:01,040
I know you're curious about
what he's doing lately.

269
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:02,888
I've asked him. Just wait for his reply.

270
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:05,032
I'm not curious about it at all.

(@Liang Daiwen What are you doing?)

272
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,953
Who's this boring fellow?

273
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:22,233
I guess it's Yu Dule.

274
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:24,073
Yu Dule isn't boring at all.

275
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:27,073
It's the man whom
I went on a blind date with.

276
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:29,912
Blind date?

277
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,150
Since when did you go on a blind date?

278
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:34,632
Just a few days ago.

279
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:36,392
My mother arranged for it.

280
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:39,592
He graduated from a famous college
and secured a stable job.

281
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:41,272
He's nothing

282
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:42,872
short of perfect.

283
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,993
But he watched
my hotel scandal video in private.

284
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:50,280
He took pictures of me in secret and
sent them to his group chat when we met.

285
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,950
He did it so that he could mock me

286
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:53,152
together with his friends.

287
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:59,313
He wasn't interested
in the blind date at all.

288
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:01,272
He was only interested

289
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:04,233
in the scandalous girl who was involved

290
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,113
in the video.

291
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:07,713
Maybe

292
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,312
he wishes to verify something
for himself

293
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:11,833
or he has some other motives.

294
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:13,816
I couldn't care less.

295
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:20,113
Can't you just tell your family

296
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:21,433
about Yu Dule directly?

297
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:25,073
A stand-up comedian.

298
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:26,473
A bar manager.

299
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,110
Which of these two positions

300
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,590
do you think my parents
will be happy with?

301
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:32,433
Yu Dule's parents

302
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:34,280
are obsessed with
organizational structure.

303
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:36,710
My parents are
more conservative than them

304
00:15:37,113 --> 00:15:37,993
when it comes to that.

305
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,833
If so, were your parents
happy with the ex-boyfriends

306
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:41,953
you had?

307
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:44,032
Of course not.

308
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:46,752
Ever since the scandal blew up,

309
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:48,233
they almost severed their ties with me.

310
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,233
The blind date was an out for us

311
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:51,593
to break the ice.

312
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,320
If I didn't go on the blind date,

313
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:55,593
they would've come to Donghai

314
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:56,752
and kidnap me.

315
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,552
Are you sure you're not interested

316
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:05,152
in Mr. Yu?

317
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,473
What about you?

318
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,792
Aren't you interested

319
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:13,353
in Mr. Liang?

320
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:17,912
Of course I am.

323

All the kissing scenes are
at least filmed by eight cameras.

324
00:16:23,288 --> 00:16:24,590
Since you imagined something like that,

325
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,233
you should go for something wilder.

326
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:28,193
Liang Daiwen is a man.

327
00:16:28,912 --> 00:16:30,392
Can't you imagine a scene

328
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:32,552
where he pushes you to the ground

329
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:34,593
and rip your tie apart?

330
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:38,629
No way!

331
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,056
I can't imagine something like that.

332
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,152
This is infuriating.

333
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:43,032
I need to view some units now.

334
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:46,433
Independent women like us
need to be self-sufficient.

335
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:48,272
We need to lead great lives

336
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:49,713
in our own units.

337
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:53,193
Alright now.

338
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:54,750
I'm thankful to Liang Daiwen

339
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,629
for letting me sponge off him.

340
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,580

and three months' rent.

343

I'm pretty envious of you.

344
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:14,193
Me?

345
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,433
Why are you envious of me?

346
00:17:46,552 --> 00:17:47,673
Why did I wear

347
00:17:47,673 --> 00:17:49,312
a fancy red dress today?

348
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,193
Am I desperate for fame?

349
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:54,233
Indeed.

350
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,473
My red dress is too eye-catching.

351
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:00,193

00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:15,072
(are you sleepwalking again?)

368
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:21,512
How did you get alexithymia, then?

369
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:29,112
What are you

370
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:31,233
stressed out about, then?

371
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:34,193
(Liang Daiwen,)

372
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:36,233
(so,)

373
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:38,456
(you were stressed out
because of me, huh?)

374
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:56,193
The feedback from video placements
on Douyin and Weibo

375
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:57,048
has been very good.

376
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:59,032
We had millions of views.

377
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,193
Digitaling published
a topic discussion that night,

378
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:04,673
and it was also screenshotted

379
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,816
by various female influencers.

380
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:06,953
It was highly discussed.

381
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,600
Have you done a follow-up
with the brands?

382
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:11,272
I'm discussing a deal
with several outdoor sports brands.

383
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,150
We plan to create an issue
that focuses

384
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,824
on the power of women
through collaboration.

385
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,952
This can also align with
Mr. Xu's upcoming music column

386
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,048
on virtual girl groups.

387
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,709
The business trip proposed by Xu Guanrui

388
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,000
will be implemented in a few more days.

389
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,392
You'll take the lead for the brands.

390
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:25,312
Understood.

391
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,072
But regarding the scripts...

392
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:31,512
Gu Yi isn't done with

393
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,710
the cosmetics project yet, right?

394
00:21:33,473 --> 00:21:35,473
The client has set a four-week schedule

395
00:21:36,032 --> 00:21:37,352
and requires each interview

396
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:39,752
to be written from
a different female perspective.

397
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:41,576
She has to submit a lot of scripts.

398
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:44,233
Won't she be overwhelmed?

399
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:46,673
Not at all.

400
00:21:47,592 --> 00:21:49,153
I can hand the script to you

401
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:50,952
and Deputy Director before work is over.

402
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:51,673
Good.

403
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,072
Gu Yi's topic on blind dates
was quite excellent.

404
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:57,153
She has set an example for all of us.

405
00:21:57,993 --> 00:21:59,792
To turn a cliché topic into a viral hit,

406
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,990
(Zhi: Who asked her)
you must break away

407
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,568
(about the cosmetics project?)
from the tone of traditional media.

408
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:04,104
(I can't stand her.)
Exposure equals data,

409
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:06,873
and data equals advertising.

410
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,112
Therefore, for your programs
that focus on women,

411
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:11,393
I think they should
be combined with new media.

412
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,713
(What is Gu Yi doing?)
You need to make sure all brands

413
00:22:14,153 --> 00:22:14,993
are taken care of as well.

414
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:15,829
Understood.

415
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,910
(I'm reviewing the blind dates.)
Advertisers are intelligent too.

416
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,952
They only focus on the data.

417
00:22:19,193 --> 00:22:20,112
Therefore, our data

418
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:21,713
must be complete.

419
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:23,072
It must be very complete.

420
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,590
(Robot: Why did you)
Understood. Please don't worry.

421
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,430
(go on blind dates again?)

422
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:27,816
Okay.

423
00:22:27,832 --> 00:22:29,590
Sign the potential contracts
and submit them to me

424
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:30,153
after this.

425
00:22:30,673 --> 00:22:31,112
Alright.

426
00:22:35,552 --> 00:22:35,913
And,

427
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:37,928
how was the follow-up
with the product brands last time?

428
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:39,832
We've already signed

429
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:41,433
most of the contracts.

430
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,792
Hello, everyone. I'm Daodao.

431
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,512
I majored in Chemistry in college.

432
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:50,536
Beef offal noodles.

433
00:22:50,752 --> 00:22:51,272
Eat up.

434
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,110
You should tell me
what's going on first.

435
00:23:00,393 --> 00:23:01,673
I'm afraid that you'll poison the food.

436
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,193
You see,

437
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:12,312
it's been a long time
since I was chosen for the show.

438
00:23:13,752 --> 00:23:14,913
Why don't you select me in secret?

439
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:18,670
That won't do.

440
00:23:19,384 --> 00:23:20,670
Return the noodles to me, then.

441
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:21,640
This is the last time.

442
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:27,633
Lately,

443
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:29,352
the bar's operations have been adjusted.

444
00:23:29,832 --> 00:23:30,953
I have to check the accounts.

445
00:23:31,752 --> 00:23:32,473
If not,

446
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,470
even Lu can't deal with it

447
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:34,710
if we keep incurring losses.

448
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,008
The bar will close eventually.

449
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,072
You should arrange for me
to perform more, then.

450
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:41,032
At least I can attract some customers.

451
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:43,552
You?

452
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:44,953
Forget about it.

453
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:51,873
What kind of style is this?

454
00:23:51,873 --> 00:23:53,032
This is a decent bar, you know?

455
00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:58,112
I'm wearing
Guan Xingxin's dress, you know?

456
00:23:58,713 --> 00:23:59,233
Beautiful.

457
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:00,430
It's super beautiful.

458
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,592
I'm sure Liang Daiwen
will fall for you if he sees you.

459
00:24:04,072 --> 00:24:05,873
Just look at you.

460
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:11,433
Has Liang Daiwen managed
to win a ticket today?

461
00:24:12,872 --> 00:24:14,568
I was wondering
who you were wearing this for.

462
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:17,393
What a shame.

463
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:19,393
He's been unlucky lately.

464
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:27,233
You don't need to be so dejected.

465
00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:29,312
You see,

466
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:31,592
Mr. Xu, the one with the big bike,
did win one ticket.

467
00:24:33,864 --> 00:24:35,030
He fancies you too, right?

468
00:24:37,473 --> 00:24:38,433
Stop joking around.

469
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:40,953
I'm not blind, you know?

470
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:49,953
What is this?

471
00:24:50,512 --> 00:24:51,913
A Jägerbomb.

472
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:54,776
You're drinking this
when it's this early?

473
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:56,873
Gu Yi,

474
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:59,512
I need to edit a video
through the night.

475
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:01,433
What else should I take, then?

476
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:02,913
Cefalexin with Jägermeister?

477
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,032
Mr. Yu,

478
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,713
have you not considered
getting a proper job before?

479
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,768
The kind with five social insurances
and a housing fund.

480
00:25:17,873 --> 00:25:18,393
I have.

481
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:20,870
What's the matter?

482
00:25:20,873 --> 00:25:21,592
Does Nextmonday

483
00:25:21,873 --> 00:25:22,832
lack a boss?

484
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,752
I can cope with that.

485
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:26,433
I'm not joking.

486
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:28,552
Let me ask you this.

487
00:25:29,752 --> 00:25:30,552
Why do you think

488
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:32,993
I suffered a terrible defeat
against Liang Daiwen?

489
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:35,792
What terrible defeat?

490
00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:38,312
I'm serious!

491
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:42,673
I suffered defeat

492
00:25:43,072 --> 00:25:44,393
against him

493
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:46,792
because we weren't equal in value.

494
00:25:47,272 --> 00:25:47,913
Do you understand?

495
00:25:48,873 --> 00:25:49,752
I do.

496
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:51,670
Anyway, your taste has been terrible

497
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:53,433
since you fell for him.

498
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:01,633
That's all I'm going to say.

499
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:04,872
I'll be performing now.

500
00:26:05,153 --> 00:26:05,752
See yourself off.

501
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:23,913
Unequal in value, huh?

502
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:36,752
Hello, everyone. I'm Gu Yi.

503
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,633
I wore high heels today.

504
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:44,913
Can you guys tell?

505
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,193
Yeah.

506
00:26:46,752 --> 00:26:47,792
I'm at least 1.6m tall now.

507
00:26:48,752 --> 00:26:49,473
Surprise.

508
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,953
What should I talk about today?

509
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,936
I wish to fall in love.

510
00:26:58,112 --> 00:26:58,752
I...

511
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,512
I truly wish to fall in love.

512
00:27:01,832 --> 00:27:03,393
Me too.

513
00:27:04,184 --> 00:27:05,432
Why don't you fall for me?

514
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:06,030
Okay.

515
00:27:06,072 --> 00:27:06,512
Sure.

516
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:08,393
But you see,

517
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,953
men are too complex.

518
00:27:11,512 --> 00:27:13,792
They're just like philosophy,
which is difficult to comprehend.

519
00:27:15,512 --> 00:27:16,153
Who are you?

520
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:18,512
Where did you come from?

521
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:21,433
Where are you going?

522
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:23,752
Don't leave.

523
00:27:27,352 --> 00:27:29,433
People say
that a woman's sixth sense is accurate.

524
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,473
But it's not accurate

525
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:32,390
when it comes to love.

526
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,993
You see, girls like me

527
00:27:35,713 --> 00:27:37,072
are just like a compass.

528
00:27:37,784 --> 00:27:40,120
We cannot get our bearings
when we see someone good-looking.

529
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:43,633
Scums like to deceive me
by using that against me.

530
00:27:44,673 --> 00:27:45,549
But don't think

531
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,384
that I have no idea
you're trying to deceive me.

532
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:49,832
I just can't help myself.

533
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,072
Help.

534
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:03,592
This won't do.

535
00:28:17,832 --> 00:28:19,433
What kind of lousy shoes are these?

536
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:29,153
Mr. Xu?

537
00:28:29,913 --> 00:28:30,473
What's wrong?

538
00:28:30,952 --> 00:28:32,584
Are you disappointed to see me?

539
00:28:33,953 --> 00:28:34,633
Not at all.

540
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:35,816
How could that be?

541
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:37,096
I bought some medicine for you.

542
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:39,832
Here.

543
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,160
Let me help you out.

544
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:42,952
No need for that.

545
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:44,993
It's fine.

546
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,464
I can do it myself. Give it to me.

547
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:03,433
You're in an awkward position.

548
00:29:04,272 --> 00:29:04,752
I'll do it.

549
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:39,352
I knew that something was off

550
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:40,664
when you got off the stage.

551
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,272
Next time, when you put on high heels,

552
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,496
you should shift
your center of gravity forward.

553
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,496
This way, it won't cut your heels.

554
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,008
You do have high EQ indeed.

555
00:29:50,473 --> 00:29:52,592
If Mr. Yu were here, he would say this,

556
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:53,832
"Gu Yi,

557
00:29:53,832 --> 00:29:55,993
you shouldn't steal other people's shoes
even when you're poor."

558
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:01,304
You don't need
to doll yourself up, you know?

559
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,840
You're already pretty enough.

560
00:30:08,488 --> 00:30:09,950
You'll only suffer if you cut your feet

561
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:12,633
to fit in shoes that don't fit you.

562
00:30:17,352 --> 00:30:17,873
All done.

563
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:27,880
You should change into slippers.

564
00:30:33,713 --> 00:30:34,352
Thank you.

565
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:41,633
Thank you.

566
00:30:48,873 --> 00:30:49,473
Did you two argue?

567
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:52,470
What's with the question?

568
00:30:54,473 --> 00:30:56,752
I thought you looked pitiful
when you told us

569
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:58,600
about the joke with the scum.

570
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:02,633
Gu Yi,

571
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:05,552
you kept saying

572
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,048
that you wanted to be a star-chaser.

573
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:10,150
But you didn't realize that you were
shining like a star yourself, right?

574
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:16,112
Although my friends aren't
playboys or scums,

575
00:31:16,873 --> 00:31:17,953
I can empathize

576
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:19,272
with a man's mindset.

577
00:31:21,032 --> 00:31:22,913
They have plenty of ways to reject you.

578
00:31:24,153 --> 00:31:24,993
But in the end,

579
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:26,633
it's all because

580
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:30,312
they love themselves more and they
aren't willing to take the risk for you.

581
00:31:31,128 --> 00:31:32,920
Actually, there aren't
that many bitter reasons.

582
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:39,633
He...

583
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:45,032
He just has
a weaker sense of perception.

584
00:31:46,552 --> 00:31:47,752
He still needs to grow.

585
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:51,993
If so, are you sure
that he'll give you the answer

586
00:31:52,473 --> 00:31:53,312
you desire

587
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:55,433
after growing?

588
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:05,950
I need to go now.

589
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:07,032
I have a flight to catch.

590
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:09,953
You can keep the medicine.

591
00:32:11,272 --> 00:32:11,792
Okay.

592
00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:14,153
The weather forecast said
it would rain today.

593
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,040
I left you an umbrella
at the front desk.

594
00:32:16,592 --> 00:32:17,433
Remember to retrieve it.

Enjoy Your Night Here)

598
00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:47,433
See you.

599
00:32:47,713 --> 00:32:48,272
Goodbye.

600
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:51,433
Goodbye.

601
00:33:24,473 --> 00:33:25,633
It's not raining.

(HF Design Company)

604
00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:03,032
Greetings, Ms. Zhang.

605
00:35:21,192 --> 00:35:22,152
See if you like it.

606
00:35:22,993 --> 00:35:24,793
I noticed that your drawing tablet
was quite outdated.

607
00:35:25,353 --> 00:35:26,273
I bought you a new one.

608
00:35:28,232 --> 00:35:28,592
Thanks.

609
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:32,753
The design

610
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:34,273
I told you about before this,

611
00:35:34,296 --> 00:35:35,110
are you still doing it?

612
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:35,870
Is everything okay?

613
00:35:36,248 --> 00:35:37,544
I came up with the draft.

614
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,232
But the style reference is too obvious.

615
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:42,392
It can only serve
as a concept image for the client.

616
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:43,473
It should be marked as

617
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:45,320
"Not for commercial use,
Cannot be disclosed."

618
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,288
I need to make major adjustments
to the final design.

619
00:35:48,152 --> 00:35:48,632
Of course.

620
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:49,784
Let me take a look.

621
00:35:57,793 --> 00:35:58,632
It's quite complete.

622
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,360
It doesn't resemble
the reference art too much.

623
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,416
The design is okay too.

624
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:02,873
Send it to me first.

625
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:03,873
I'll show it to my client.

626
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:04,833
Sign here.

627
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:11,112
There's no need

628
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:13,152
to show our client this
without your signature.

629
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:17,993
Dong,

630
00:36:18,313 --> 00:36:19,873
do something for me personally.

631
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,112
Ms. Zhang, please go ahead.

632
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:22,753
Before Liang Daiwen's contract expires,

633
00:36:22,824 --> 00:36:24,110
make sure all of his design drafts,

634
00:36:24,313 --> 00:36:25,232
including this one,

635
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,376
are registered for copyright.

636
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:28,230
File the draft copyright registration

637
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:29,032
and keep a record.

638
00:36:49,352 --> 00:36:50,376
What do you think?

639
00:36:50,592 --> 00:36:52,473
I rented a four-man unit for myself.

640
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:54,793
Excellent.

641
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,720
From sharing the rent with three
other people to paying it yourself,

642
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:59,110
I guess you're something else now.

643
00:36:59,896 --> 00:37:01,448
I was just lucky
to stumble upon this unit.

644
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,630
Teach me how to be
as lucky as you, then.

645
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:11,753
Take your keys.

646
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,273
All of your strange housemates

647
00:37:13,496 --> 00:37:14,440
have already moved out.

648
00:37:14,488 --> 00:37:15,496
Are you happy now?

649
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:16,232
I am.

650
00:37:16,753 --> 00:37:18,152
Asking for a bike is too much

651
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:20,296
when the rent is this cheap,
don't you agree?

652
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:21,830
Alright now.

653
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,552
I'll be going now.

654
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:22,993
Goodbye.

655
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:23,473
Goodbye.

656
00:37:30,473 --> 00:37:30,993
Guan.

657
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:32,232
Put your work aside.

658
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,632
Are you hungry?

659
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,744
Let's order some food.

660
00:37:34,873 --> 00:37:35,192
Sure.

661
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:35,993
Sure.

662
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:37,592
How about

663
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:39,313
inviting Uncle Lu and Liang as well?

664
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:40,792
We'll hold a housewarming party for you.

665
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:45,873
Lu is definitely busy.

666
00:37:46,313 --> 00:37:47,793
He's keeping his daughter company.

667
00:37:48,712 --> 00:37:50,273
As for Liang Daiwen,

668
00:37:50,993 --> 00:37:51,993
he's too embarrassed to come.

669
00:37:53,192 --> 00:37:53,753
Shut up.

670
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,473
Go and see
if there's anything else in the car.

671
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:57,793
Alright.

672
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:05,393
Now that you guys are my pets,

673
00:38:05,672 --> 00:38:06,993
you guys might not be able

674
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,433
to have luxurious food in the future.

675
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:13,192
Will you guys miss him, then?

676
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:17,310
You guys are not allowed to miss him.

677
00:38:18,512 --> 00:38:19,793
He abandoned us, you know?

678

(Virtual artists)

679
00:38:26,552 --> 00:38:27,552
(have fake bodies)

680
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:29,149
(but real souls.)

(HF Design Company Group Annual Party)

682
00:38:30,456 --> 00:38:31,670
(You have a real body)

683
00:38:32,592 --> 00:38:33,552
(with an empty soul.)

684
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,950
I'm only interested in the quote
Ounce has quoted,

685
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:39,672
which is
"A Human Soul Weighs Only One Ounce."

686
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,152
I think I have an ounce of soul as well.

687
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:45,070
I need to find it myself.

688
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:58,630
Mr. Yu, I wish to ask you something.

689
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,608
He didn't win a ticket.

690
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:00,953
It's been so many times.

691
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,313
Who said I was asking you that?

692
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:06,833
I wanted to ask you

693
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:10,032
what you mean by the quote
you came up with

694
00:39:10,712 --> 00:39:11,313
for Ounce.

695
00:39:13,192 --> 00:39:14,433
Guess how long I didn't sleep

696
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:17,270
just so I could
answer this mystical question of yours?

697
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,272
Do you know that I can drop dead
at any moment now?

698
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:19,910
I'm begging you.

699
00:39:20,273 --> 00:39:21,473
Please answer me first.

700
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:23,353
I promise I won't bother you again.

701
00:39:24,273 --> 00:39:25,632
One ounce of soul

702
00:39:25,913 --> 00:39:27,833
refers to the amygdala of the brain.

703
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:29,072
It manages

704
00:39:29,072 --> 00:39:30,393
one's joy, anger, sorrow, fear,

705
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:31,273
and so on.

706
00:39:31,473 --> 00:39:32,669
All humans have flaws.

707
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,576
If you find that ounce,

708
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:34,910
you'll find your complete self.

709
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:36,408
What a dramatic person.

710
00:39:36,552 --> 00:39:37,544
I'll hang up now.

711
00:39:43,512 --> 00:39:45,433
(How much does a robot)

712
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,632

to wait for their owner)

(to find them back.)

716
00:39:55,753 --> 00:39:57,232
(But to you,)

717
00:39:58,112 --> 00:39:59,592
(abandoning a stray cat)

718
00:40:00,152 --> 00:40:01,632
(is merely wiping away your memories)

719
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:04,056
(and returning to the starting point.)

720

Hello?

721
00:40:27,913 --> 00:40:29,873
Is this the ten-year-old Liang Daiwen?

722
00:40:51,512 --> 00:40:51,993
Hello?

723
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:55,232
I'm the 29-year-old Liang Daiwen.

724
00:40:59,032 --> 00:41:00,990
I suppose I've never told you
what it felt like

725
00:41:03,032 --> 00:41:04,632
to have alexithymia.

726
00:41:06,512 --> 00:41:07,192
I do get upset.

727
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:09,793
I do feel pain.

728
00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:13,712
Doctors said it wasn't
a mental disorder.

729
00:41:14,993 --> 00:41:16,672
They said it was just a trait.

730
00:41:19,273 --> 00:41:20,592
But I'm still perplexed.

731
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,313
If it wasn't a disorder,

732
00:41:24,993 --> 00:41:25,829
how come my senses

733
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,400
have gotten weaker over the years?

734
00:41:31,336 --> 00:41:33,110
When I first saw
your performance at Ounce,

735
