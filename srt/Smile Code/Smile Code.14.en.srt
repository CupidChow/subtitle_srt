00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:50,536
Alright. Up next, let's welcome

27
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:52,056
Gu Yi, a stand-up comedian.

28
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:54,252
She shall perform
stand-up comedy for us.

29
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:57,702
(HF Annual Group Meeting)

30
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:02,756
Hi, everyone. I'm Gu Yi.

31
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:06,277
I'm a stand-up comedian.

32
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:08,157
So, what's a stand-up comedian?

33
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:10,816
It's the kind of comedian
who works hard to make everyone laugh

34
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:13,076
without using any flashy tricks.

35
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:16,117
But today's a pretty good day.

36
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:18,615
I know all of you guys
will be on holiday

37
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,356
after today's annual party, right?

38
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:22,416
You guys can even laugh

39
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:24,517
even when I yawn on stage, right?

40
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,656
Last time,

41
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:37,837
I attended the annual party
of an internet firm.

42
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:40,076
It was a high-end event.

43
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:44,517
Their performances were even
reviewed by program directors.

44
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,277
A skit actor said this,

45
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:48,717
"Director,

46
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:51,916
can I drink baijiu on stage?
Is that considered a performance?"

47
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:53,677
The director said this,

48
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:57,936
"Buddy,

49
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:59,076
this is a live stream."

50
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:06,316
That's right.

51
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:07,717
It has a negative impact.

52
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:10,036
But HF Design Company
is a smart company.

53
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:11,717
We don't do live streams here.

54
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:14,316
We do something even more exciting.

55
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:19,997
Do you guys know what's
electric drill headbanging?

56
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:25,557
You guys haven't seen it before, right?
I'll do a demo.

57
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:39,277
Did you guys see that?

58
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:42,916
This is what we call
a threat-based applause.

59
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,717
It's what I learned from last year.

60
00:03:52,937 --> 00:03:54,876
Today, I came to the right place.

61
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:57,936
I know that your design
and art circle...

62
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,600
It's considered a part
of the art circle, right?

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,277
I know that the design and art circle
values entertainment.

64
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:04,636
Just like the game
you guys played just now.

65
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:05,916
It was very high-end.

66
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:07,316
It may seem like

67
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:09,997
there wasn't any physical contact
during the interaction,

68
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:11,397
but I'm sure you guys

69
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:13,237
know better.

70
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:16,837
All of the bosses down there
were smiling happily.

71
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,317
Being knowledgeable
does make a difference.

72
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:21,436
Compared to stand-up comedians like us,

73
00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:23,596
we earn too little.

74
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,476
You see, regarding your games,

75
00:04:25,537 --> 00:04:26,456
we don't know

76
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:29,157
what's so fun about your little game.

77
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:30,815
When it comes to offending people,

78
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:32,476
you guys are the best.

79
00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:54,796
Okay. Thank you.

80
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:57,717
Thank you for the amazing performance.

81
00:04:57,857 --> 00:04:58,576
Next,

82
00:04:58,577 --> 00:04:59,957
let's have a change of mood.

83
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,495
Let's welcome the next performance,

84
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:02,837

85
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:04,077
Beautiful Nature.

86
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:20,556
It's our turn!

87
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:54,317
How did you come here?

88
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:55,436
I took a cab.

89
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:57,397
Wait.

90
00:05:57,897 --> 00:05:58,757
I mean,

91
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,397
what are you doing here?

92
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:03,116
I was afraid that you might mess up.

93
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:08,556
Mr. Liang, it's our turn.

94
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:10,957
Coming.

(looks out of place.)

101
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:37,596
Liang Daiwen.

102
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:40,295
Are you going to be fired

103
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:41,757
after finishing this bottle of water?

104
00:07:45,777 --> 00:07:47,116
You still want to deliver a punchline?

105
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:51,517
I just wanted to ask you

106
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:53,236
why you rushed all the way here.

107
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:55,517
I was too bored.

108
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:12,116
I argued with my client
after my flight landed.

109
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:13,596
My schedule became empty

110
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:14,717
after he complained about me.

111
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:16,300
I was worried
that nobody would respond to you.

112
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:18,080
I was thinking
that I could cheer for you.

113
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:20,520
Then I witnessed
your amazing performance

114
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,360
as you imitated an electric drill.

115
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,240
Let me ask you something.

116
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:25,717
How long is your
stand-up comedy session?

117
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,077
Five minutes.

118
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,880
How long did it take
for you to prepare the script?

119
00:08:34,136 --> 00:08:35,157
One week.

120
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:37,316
How long did it take
to deliver your last joke?

121
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:40,357
30 seconds.

122
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:43,277
You're pretty bold, aren't you?

123
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:46,216
I never expected them

124
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:48,196
to play such borderline games
before coming here.

125
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:49,716
I couldn't help myself.

126
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:53,520
You can choose not to perform
if you dislike it.

127
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:55,316
I gave you an opportunity to perform

128
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:57,157
just to help you out.

129
00:08:58,136 --> 00:08:59,477
I'm not trying to add to your troubles.

130
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:02,997
You can choose not to do it
if you dislike it.

131
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,117
What's the matter?

132
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:16,976
I'm fine.

133
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:17,956
It's just a minor sprain.

134
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:20,316
Where's Dong?

135
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:21,597
She went to retrieve the car.

136
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,716
Gu Yi,

137
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:25,637
I'm sorry about this.

138
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:28,556
They did go overboard
with the game they played.

139
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:30,856
Daiwen told me

140
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:32,415
that you needed
an opportunity to perform.

141
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,716
I didn't expect it to end up like this.

142
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:37,216
If you're short on cash, some of my friends
haven't held their annual parties yet.

143
00:09:37,217 --> 00:09:38,436
I can contact them for you.

144
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:42,076
That's not it, Ms. Zhang.

145
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:45,216
My jokes were too lame.

146
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,397
I've spoiled everyone's mood.

147
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:48,597
Please don't trouble yourself.

148
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:49,735
It's the end of the year now.

149
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:51,240
I haven't finished
processing your interview.

150
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,316
I have no time to waste.

151
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:53,716
That'll do too.

152
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:55,597
I do like your style.

153
00:09:55,776 --> 00:09:57,237
I'll support you at Ounce next time.

154
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,597
Sure. Thanks.

155
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:01,117
Where do you live, then?
Let me send you back.

156
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:02,277
No need for that.

157
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:03,637
I'll send her back.

158
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:08,757
If so, Ms. Zhang...

159
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:09,816
It's fine.

160
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,956
You guys may leave first.

161
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:33,076
Liang Daiwen.

162
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,477
Are you angry?

163
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:38,477
Nope.

164
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:43,597
I think the weather is changing.

165
00:10:44,337 --> 00:10:45,237
It feels cold.

166
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:17,597
Call Mr. Wang of Feng Shang Properties.

167
00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:20,157
Tell him that he can take back
Liang Daiwen's unit.

168
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:43,237
Liang Daiwen,

169
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:46,956
will you lose your job because of me?

170
00:11:48,977 --> 00:11:50,237
You're not as impactful as you think.

171
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,076
I knew that I messed up.

172
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:56,757
I'm truly sorry about it.

173
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:58,816
I'll buy Kevin Tsai's book

174
00:11:58,817 --> 00:11:59,836
and study it when I get back.

175
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:02,637
Forget it.

176
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:03,997
You won't be able to pick it up.

177
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:06,940
You're trying to keep it real when it's
a courtesy event like an annual party.

178
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:08,477
You should do underground rap instead.

179
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:14,556
So,

180
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:18,316
did you actually rush there
because you were worried about me?

181
00:12:20,376 --> 00:12:21,397
Not entirely?

182
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:22,716
Why else, then?

183
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:25,716
Zhang Qingya.

184
00:12:29,736 --> 00:12:31,036
I've known her for a long time.

185
00:12:31,577 --> 00:12:33,036
Our business involves complex matters.

186
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:36,556
I just tendered my resignation.

187
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:38,157
I don't want any additional trouble.

188
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:40,277
Moreover,

189
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:43,397
she doesn't seem to like you.

190
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:48,036
Seems like you're
not that silly after all.

191
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:50,357
I thought you couldn't tell.

192
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:56,597
She was hurtful with her words today.

193
00:12:58,136 --> 00:12:59,477
Thank you for
not holding it against her.

194
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:02,237
If not, it'll make things
difficult for you, huh?

195
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,696
You reprimanded me

196
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:10,036
and thanked me.

197
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,637
I guess we're even now.

198
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,157
You should recommend me
more gigs in the future.

199
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:16,716
Alright.

200
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:12,357
Liang Daiwen.

201
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,117
I know what's my issue now.

202
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:21,735
I can't dress properly
and do stand-up comedy

203
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:22,997
at the same time.

204
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:25,976
As soon as I enter
business-like settings,

205
00:15:25,977 --> 00:15:27,716
I'll get sarcastic easily.

206
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:30,757
I would be sarcastic to them
without knowing it myself.

207
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,720
Are you sure you didn't know
what you were doing?

208
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,976
Mainly, all of the guys
were wearing sharp suits

209
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:39,436
while the girls were wearing gowns.

210
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:41,176
They dressed themselves properly,

211
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:43,237
yet they were playing
such a boring game.

212
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:45,135
If the Internet hears about this,

213
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:47,436
I'm sure a group of people will say
that the girls are acting cheaply.

214
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:48,960
They'll say that they're
giving out mixed signals

215
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,243
for wearing something like that.

216
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:51,997
I assume

217
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:54,076
it's the same group of people
who said I found a sugar daddy.

218
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:00,796
If so, why didn't you clarify yourself?

219
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,157
You think I didn't want to do it?

220
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:09,535
But girls have to pay a huge price

221
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,196
to clarify such rumors, you know?

222
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:17,477
What are you doing?

223
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:19,117
Does your leg hurt?

224
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:21,877
What's with the question?

225
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:24,357
You stood up right after sitting down.

226
00:16:25,337 --> 00:16:27,397
You didn't sit down much
when you were backstage either.

227
00:16:29,736 --> 00:16:31,076
The outfits you guys wore

228
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:32,436
were too short.

229
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,196
The angle was terrible

230
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:36,597
when I sat down.

00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,117
Are you a mute now?

251
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:22,615
Why didn't you reply

252
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:23,637
to my texts?

253
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:28,916
Since you hate me that much,

254

since you want to bite my head off
that badly,

255
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,736

257

I'm here to discuss business with you.

00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:36,676
You love making money, don't you?

259
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:38,716
I don't understand at all.

260
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,856
Why would a ruthless woman like you

261
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:42,375
be so short-sighted

262
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:44,276
that you just tried to make a living
in the office?

263
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:45,877
Short-sighted?

264
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:48,597
I just didn't want to see
all those filthy things.

265
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,436
Zhang Junjie,

266
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:54,496
back then, I brought you here
from the poor countryside.

267
00:18:54,497 --> 00:18:55,980
I provided you with resources
and connections.

268
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,557
I let you rise high by stepping on me,

269
00:18:57,656 --> 00:18:59,357
but you went for an abortion
behind my back.

270
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:00,837
Who's the filthy person here?

271
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,077
Mr. Huang,

272
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:06,837
you already made it big in Beijing.

273
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:08,816
Did you come to find me

274
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:10,236
just to dig up the old debts?

275
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:13,516
You may choose to invest
in Nextmonday or not.

276
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,895
There's no need for you
to cling on relentlessly.

277
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:17,256
I can choose
to invest in it or not, huh?

278
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,837
It's not like our debt
can be settled immediately.

279
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:22,117
I have plenty of time.

280
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,276
If so, I'll give you a suggestion.

281
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:28,676
You can invest in Art List

282
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:30,037
instead of Nextmonday.

283
00:19:30,696 --> 00:19:31,496
Roger

284
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:32,895
will proceed with the M&A soon.

285
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:33,716
I promise

286
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:34,916
that Art List will be comparable

287
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:36,436
to Nextmonday
after I take over the company.

288
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:43,597
What?

289
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:46,117
Are you willing to be demoted
and manage Art List instead?

290
00:19:47,257 --> 00:19:49,557
Don't tell me you were kicked out
by your boss's mistress?

291
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:50,956
That's none of your business.

292
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,975
Anyway, you just need
to consider making an investment

293
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:55,276
that will only bring you profit

294
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:57,480
or make another investment
that can bring you more profit.

295
00:20:01,976 --> 00:20:03,856
An ingrate like Roger

296
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:05,496
might not uphold
his end of the bargain, you know?

297
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,455
Do you trust him?

298
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,516
I don't.

299
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:11,196
Anyway, someone can't wait for the M&A.

300
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,077
If you don't have that much patience,

301
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:16,080
I suggest you make other investments.

00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:06,117
I understand.

336
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,256
It's difficult for

337
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:09,296
a workaholic like you to find

338
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:10,597

340
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:13,117

The higher-ups decided to proceed
with the conservative option.

Although your proposal
was better than Penny's,

347
00:22:36,216 --> 00:22:38,637
you were lacking in other aspects.

348
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,336

349
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:41,056
one's behavior

Having good content alone

352
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:46,077
won't help the company to survive.

353
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,956
You need to separate work
from your expertise.

354
00:22:52,656 --> 00:22:53,797
I don't get it.

355
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:57,837
You're not utilizing your talent
by brainstorming topics in the office.

356
00:22:58,497 --> 00:23:00,476
Working isn't a creative endeavor.

357
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:02,157
You have to be flexible.

358
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:05,276
So, you think

359
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:08,597
it's only creative
if it caters to the masses?

360
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,935
Although you're talented and daring,

361
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:13,637
you don't know
how to cater to the market.

362
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,895
Do you know why the executives

363
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,317
voted for Penny instead of you?

364
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:19,877
Although her proposal
wasn't as good as yours,

365
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:21,877
she could help Nextmonday
to gain a better reputation.

366
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:25,397
But you? You write scripts during work time
and do stand-up comedy after work.

367
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:27,476
You don't care about anything else
besides your work.

368
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,317
The clients could only detect
Penny's presence,

369
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,117
not yours.

370
00:23:31,257 --> 00:23:32,996
Only your words were seen,

371
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,037
not your person.

372
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:36,676
I won't

373
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:38,676
tell you this again.

374
00:23:42,936 --> 00:23:45,157
Penny and I joined the company
at the same time.

375
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:48,557
I always focused
on content-related work.

376
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:51,600
During work time, I'm either working
on scripts or getting reprimanded.

377
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:53,877
It's natural for clients to know Penny.

378
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,935
She's very familiar
with the brand's products.

379
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,716
She spent more time entertaining clients
than working.

380
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,877
I only know how to write scripts,
work overtime, and do interviews.

381
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:07,037
It's fine that the clients
don't know who I am.

382
00:24:07,297 --> 00:24:09,317
I thought at least you could
appreciate my effort.

383
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:11,837
But that wasn't the case.

384
00:24:14,297 --> 00:24:16,157
I always hoped that I could

385
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:17,877
be someone like you.

386
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:20,175
I thought the difference between us

387
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:21,716
was our experience.

388
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:23,236
But that wasn't not it.

389
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:25,916
The difference is that I don't
favor power as much as you.

390
00:24:26,737 --> 00:24:28,877
I won't repeat myself either.

391
00:24:30,057 --> 00:24:31,397
I'll return to work first.

392
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:03,916
Don't try to console me.

393
00:25:04,696 --> 00:25:05,877
Don't try to ask me about it too.

394
00:25:06,497 --> 00:25:07,637
Don't even bring it up.

395
00:25:12,616 --> 00:25:14,037
If so, how's your relationship

396
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:15,956
with the robot?

397
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:23,117
You're so good at consoling people.

398
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:29,157
You look so pitiful.

399
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:35,516
I asked for it.

400
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,797
You reminded me once before this.

401
00:25:40,257 --> 00:25:41,196
I didn't believe you.

402
00:25:43,857 --> 00:25:45,236
This is already the second time.

403
00:25:46,497 --> 00:25:47,996
The harder I work,

404
00:25:48,097 --> 00:25:50,557
the harder I fail.

405
00:25:57,817 --> 00:26:00,056
Everyone has moments
when they fail at something

406
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:01,837
even after working hard on them.

407
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:03,716
It's the same for Jacqueline too.

408
00:26:05,376 --> 00:26:06,637
We just need to accept the fact

409
00:26:06,737 --> 00:26:07,576
that our efforts

410
00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:08,877
might not be repaid.

411
00:26:09,017 --> 00:26:09,877
Am I right?

412
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:16,956
But I don't understand at all.

413
00:26:20,737 --> 00:26:21,895
Do I look casual

414
00:26:21,896 --> 00:26:22,916
and messy?

415
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,117
Am I unprofessional just
because I do stand-up comedy?

416
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:30,916
Did she give up on me because
I didn't want to focus on networking?

417
00:26:32,616 --> 00:26:33,516
And,

418
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,436
do I have a low cost-performance ratio

419
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:41,676
when it comes to work?

420
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:47,236
Come.

421
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:51,037
Let's go.

422
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:53,756
Time for a ride.

423
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:57,956
Did you cry?

424
00:27:04,337 --> 00:27:05,317
Thank you.

425
00:27:09,616 --> 00:27:10,436
Alright now.

426
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,516
Go ahead and cry.

427
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:14,996
You can cry all you want.

428
00:27:17,017 --> 00:27:18,716
Although you're upset,

429
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:23,256
this time, you don't need to be upset
because of Liang Daiwen,

430
00:27:23,257 --> 00:27:24,157
am I right?

431
00:27:24,537 --> 00:27:25,436
Okay now.

432
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:30,117
Time for a drift!

433
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:56,776
(Please collect the payment)

434
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:58,135
(Ms. Sun)

435
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,549
(Ms. Sun)

436
00:28:10,337 --> 00:28:11,476
Hello?

437
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:12,676
Hello.

438
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:13,956
Is this Ms. Gu?

439
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,236
Ms. Gu.

440
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:18,357
We've transferred
the performance fee to you.

441
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:19,296
Please check your account.

442
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,317
Have you received it?

443
00:28:21,136 --> 00:28:21,996
I have.

444
00:28:22,817 --> 00:28:23,676
However,

445
00:28:23,777 --> 00:28:25,837
why were there two different payments?

446
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:32,637
I hope you don't mind me asking,

447
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:34,916
but is this

448
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:36,716
the service fee for the annual party?

449
00:28:37,097 --> 00:28:38,716
The initial fee
was only 1,000 yuan, right?

450
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,357
Ms. Gu, you're intelligent indeed.

451
00:28:40,497 --> 00:28:42,597
But please don't ask
Mr. Liang about this.

452
00:28:42,656 --> 00:28:44,480
If not, it'll be difficult
for me to explain myself.

453
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:46,676
Mr. Liang pays
quite a lot of attention to you.

454
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:49,037
He gave you extra fee
without Ms. Zhang's knowledge.

455
00:28:49,337 --> 00:28:51,716
He said your stand-up comedy
was worth this much.

456
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,736
Actually, he also joined

457
00:28:53,737 --> 00:28:55,436
the annual party's performance
on the spot.

458
00:28:55,737 --> 00:28:57,557
His name wasn't included
in the performer's list.

459
00:28:57,857 --> 00:29:00,196
Independent designers like him,
who are under contract,

460
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:02,037
usually work on
a commission-based order system.

461
00:29:02,216 --> 00:29:03,837
There was no need
for him to perform at all.

462
00:29:04,257 --> 00:29:05,135
But I assume

463
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:06,536
he was worried about you.

464
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,280
And, he didn't want
to show himself in public either.

465
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,077
That's why he acted as a tree.

466
00:29:16,817 --> 00:29:17,516
Aren't you cold?

467
00:29:20,537 --> 00:29:21,597
I'm happy.

468
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:22,996
I want to pick you up from work.

469
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:25,996
You're happy?

470
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:30,597
I received my performance fee today.

471
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:32,557
They paid me 3,000 yuan.

472
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:35,436
I became rich all of a sudden.

473
00:29:36,497 --> 00:29:38,037
You deserved that much.

474
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:39,880
You don't need
to stand out here in the cold.

475
00:29:44,537 --> 00:29:45,676
Liang Daiwen.

476
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:50,597
Can you tell me why

477
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:53,797
you're doing all of this

478
00:29:54,817 --> 00:29:56,037
for me?

479
00:30:00,737 --> 00:30:01,597
What do you mean?

480
00:30:03,857 --> 00:30:05,837
You came to watch my performances

481
00:30:06,616 --> 00:30:08,276
and take me to your house.

482
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,476
Was it because

483
00:30:11,616 --> 00:30:14,716
you took me as a friend
who you could confide in?

484
00:30:15,577 --> 00:30:17,256
Do you think I'm an outlier

485
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:18,557
like you?

486
00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:21,117
Or did you merely

487
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:23,837
wish to help me

488
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:25,476
since I looked pathetic?

489
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:32,117
Or,

490
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,196

Let's go home.

513
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:37,073
(Today's steps)

514
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,200
(To Liang Daiwen: Are you busy?
Why aren't you replying to me?)

515
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,284
(Hurry and reply to me.
Didn't you see my text?)

516
00:35:46,817 --> 00:35:47,796
You're back.

517
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:32,917
I'll cut to the chase, then.

518
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:38,356
Liang Daiwen is easy to control.

519
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:40,676
But judging from your skills,

520
00:36:41,217 --> 00:36:42,316
you can't win his heart yet.

521
00:36:45,857 --> 00:36:47,356
As for Zhang Qingya,

522
00:36:47,976 --> 00:36:49,396
she's considered his bosom friend.

523
00:36:50,337 --> 00:36:51,816
When Liang Daiwen was in college,

524
00:36:51,817 --> 00:36:53,356
he attended a design exhibition.

525
00:36:53,817 --> 00:36:56,637
The blueprints he used were
based on ancient Chinese elements,

526
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:00,077
which unexpectedly align perfectly with
the aesthetics of the high-end market.

527
00:37:00,337 --> 00:37:02,117
Zhang Qingya discovered him

528
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:04,236
and made him a designer
for luxurious furniture.

529
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:06,756
Even now, Zhang Qingya

530
00:37:06,896 --> 00:37:08,356
is buying all of his designs.

531
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:12,356
She's considered half of his sponsor.

532
00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:15,836
I'm just joking.

533
00:37:16,457 --> 00:37:18,240
They would've been together
long ago if they wanted to.

534
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:20,836
She poses no threat to you.

535
00:37:21,817 --> 00:37:23,296
Now, you're just

536
00:37:23,297 --> 00:37:25,517
shooting yourself in the foot.

537
00:37:26,697 --> 00:37:28,997
He can't just ignore me forever, right?

538
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:31,676
He's emotionally abusing me to no end.

539
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:33,637
It won't last forever.

540
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:35,356
It's not like you confessed to him.

541
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:36,997
At most, he'll irritate you
for a few days.

542
00:37:38,016 --> 00:37:39,077
Irritate?

543
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,836
That doesn't sound polite.

544
00:37:43,337 --> 00:37:44,676
Let me put it another way.

545
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:47,316
He needs to give you
the silent treatment for a few days.

546
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:51,637
There's no need to be scared.

547
00:37:51,857 --> 00:37:53,477
Have you ever seen Liang
scrolled his phone before?

548
00:37:53,976 --> 00:37:56,975
He'll only remember that he has
a device to communicate

549
00:37:56,976 --> 00:37:59,196
when he needs to send out a text.

550
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:00,895
And,

551
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:02,957
he knows that his vicious tongue
is frowned upon.

552
00:38:03,697 --> 00:38:04,517
That's why he never

553
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:06,276
initiates a chat.

554
00:38:07,617 --> 00:38:08,696
But I texted him.

555
00:38:08,697 --> 00:38:10,356
He should at least reply to me.

556
00:38:10,936 --> 00:38:12,836
And, I already took his emotions
into consideration.

557
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:14,656
I added emojis at the back

558
00:38:14,657 --> 00:38:16,077
of all my texts.

559
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:17,316
What kind of emojis?

560
00:38:17,576 --> 00:38:18,437
A love?

561
00:38:21,976 --> 00:38:22,756
A dog's head.

562
00:38:27,536 --> 00:38:28,736
Do all stand-up comedians

563
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:30,997
perform comedy at all times?

564
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:35,517
You're just like Yu Dule.

565
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:36,637
He's so cute.

566
00:38:37,496 --> 00:38:38,756
Cute?

567
00:38:39,496 --> 00:38:40,756
Since he's so cute,

568
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,557
why are you still being indecisive?

569
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:49,997
Actually,

570
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:51,776
do you hate

571
00:38:51,777 --> 00:38:53,356
how I'm treating Yu Dule now?

572
00:38:54,536 --> 00:38:55,917
I don't reject or accept him.

573
00:38:59,496 --> 00:39:01,637
You know that Liang and I
are fellow patients, right?

574
00:39:04,096 --> 00:39:05,597
But he didn't tell me the details.

575
00:39:05,737 --> 00:39:07,117
It's your privacy after all.

576
00:39:12,297 --> 00:39:14,037
I have an anxious attachment.

577
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:16,736
Therefore,

578
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:19,236
I always get into strange relationships.

579
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:22,356
But I don't want it
to be the same with Yu Dule.

580
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:24,696
Shen said

581
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:26,037
he could help me remove my mask.

582
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,037
But he hasn't succeeded yet.

583
00:39:29,096 --> 00:39:31,836
Maybe he'll only have time for that
after he manages to treat your Mr. Liang.

584
00:39:36,177 --> 00:39:37,157
However,

585
00:39:38,016 --> 00:39:39,055
I think

586
00:39:39,056 --> 00:39:41,597
he seems to have a bit
of a breakthrough lately.

587
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,077
Of course.

588
00:39:44,777 --> 00:39:46,055
I realized something was off

589
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:47,396
when he carried you in his arms

590
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,957
during the
murder mystery role-playing game.

591
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:50,437
Shen also said

592
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,557
that the appointments he made lately

593
00:39:52,697 --> 00:39:54,316
were at odd hours.

594
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:56,495
I'm sure his robot of a brain

595
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:58,276
must be panicking right now.

596
00:39:59,576 --> 00:40:01,517
What should I do, then?
Should I give him some time, then?

597
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:04,316
It'll be too late if you wait for him
to react, you know?

598
00:40:08,177 --> 00:40:10,957
As Liang's fellow patient,

599
00:40:11,137 --> 00:40:12,276
I'll tell you this responsibly.

600
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:13,957
Liang Daiwen

601
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:15,415
has noble motives

602
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:16,517
and goals.

603
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:18,437
He's good at everything

604
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:21,997
except for relationships.

605
00:40:23,936 --> 00:40:26,716
Alexithymia is too much
of a blow for him.

606
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:29,276
He might not court anyone again
in this lifetime.

607
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:32,597
However,

608
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:34,117
all those who succeed in relationships

609
00:40:34,257 --> 00:40:35,756
are those who have
blind faith in themselves.

610
00:40:36,297 --> 00:40:38,756
Therefore, when it comes
to dealing with Liang Daiwen,

611
00:40:39,056 --> 00:40:40,716
you can't wait for the right timing.

612
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:43,477
You have to cling to him
and make him feel like you need him.

613
00:40:44,016 --> 00:40:45,037
Give him a sense of crisis.

614
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:46,736
When the time is almost ripe,

615
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:48,997
you may strike
when he can't part with you.

616
00:40:51,297 --> 00:40:52,356
How?

617
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,557
Take a hot water bath for now.

618
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,756
After that,

619
00:41:02,777 --> 00:41:03,876
call him.

620
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:06,077
Tell him to pick you up at my house.

621
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:15,196
Don't throw it away. It's not dirty.

622
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm not throwing it away.
I'm keeping it for you.

623
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,276
You can retrieve it next time.

624
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:21,756
Remember,

625
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:24,236
today's your comeback stage.

626
00:41:25,376 --> 00:41:27,236
That's too deliberate.

627
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:29,477
Shen once told me

628
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,375
that Liang Daiwen's mother passed away

629
00:41:31,376 --> 00:41:32,676
when he was ten.

630
00:41:33,056 --> 00:41:34,196
During the new school semester,

631
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:35,917
everyone was wearing
the new school uniform

632
00:41:36,056 --> 00:41:37,077
except for him.

633
00:41:37,737 --> 00:41:41,716
It's because the collar was red.

634
00:41:42,657 --> 00:41:43,997
In some ways,

635
00:41:44,137 --> 00:41:45,876
he reminds me of my younger self.

636
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:47,796
Since I couldn't see,

637
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:50,597
it made my other senses sharper.

638
00:41:51,016 --> 00:41:53,437
To Liang, color

639
00:41:53,737 --> 00:41:55,196
is the barometer of his world.

640
00:41:55,936 --> 00:41:57,415
It can briefly revive

641
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:58,836
the senses he had lost.

642
00:41:59,737 --> 00:42:01,796
What you need to do now

643
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:04,796
is to grab hold of
this transient opportunity.

644
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:08,756
And,

645
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:12,276
do not sever your ties with him
out of spite when you throw a tantrum.

646
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,796
He'll take it seriously.

647
00:42:14,496 --> 00:42:15,836
I know him all too well.

648
00:42:16,056 --> 00:42:17,895
It's not easy to get someone like him

649
00:42:17,896 --> 00:42:18,957
to budge.

650
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:20,637
Therefore,

651
00:42:21,777 --> 00:42:23,597
I truly hope that you won't mess it up.

652
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:26,895
But don't you think

653
00:42:26,896 --> 00:42:29,117
I look like a living gift?

654
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:33,037
Love is the gift of life, you know?

655
00:42:34,936 --> 00:42:36,575
I should remove the bow tie.

656
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:38,517
No, you mustn't.

657
00:42:40,217 --> 00:42:41,917
It's more than just an accessory.

658
00:42:42,737 --> 00:42:43,816
Although Liang Daiwen's heart

659
00:42:43,817 --> 00:42:45,276
is sealed with concrete,

660
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:47,077
he has an excellent memory.

661
00:42:47,536 --> 00:42:49,176
Instead of bombarding his mind

662
00:42:49,177 --> 00:42:51,077
without purposes,

663
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,495
you should leave behind

664
00:42:53,496 --> 00:42:55,276
some movie-like memories for him.

665
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:59,997
Could I do that with a bow tie alone?

666
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,360
This is a movie between you and him.
I'll leave the script writing to you.

667
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,280
It's none of my business.

668
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:05,957
You can do it.

669
00:43:54,896 --> 00:43:55,836
Where's your car?

670
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:57,997
At home.

671
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,077
Didn't you drive here?

672
00:44:00,976 --> 00:44:01,716
I'm charging it.

673
00:44:10,657 --> 00:44:11,437
Are you cold?

674
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:14,796
I'm fine.

675
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:22,077
Seems like

676
00:44:22,737 --> 00:44:24,316
you're pretty close

677
00:44:25,137 --> 00:44:26,077
to Guan, huh?

678
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:28,957
She's quite interesting.

679
00:44:29,817 --> 00:44:31,415
And, I'll collaborate with her

680
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,597
on Xu Guanrui's music column.

681
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:34,055
We might become colleagues

682
00:44:34,056 --> 00:44:35,716
in the future.

683
00:44:36,857 --> 00:44:38,597
If the data looks good,

684
00:44:38,657 --> 00:44:40,477
maybe we'll have to increase the price

685
00:44:40,576 --> 00:44:41,917
for your ads.

686
00:45:00,456 --> 00:45:02,557
Why isn't the bus here yet?

687
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,997
Why don't we take the subway?

688
00:45:05,337 --> 00:45:06,597
The subway station is right opposite.

689
00:45:08,697 --> 00:45:09,716
