=Episode 34=

25
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:22,598
Stop reviewing it.

26
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:24,678
I drafted the entire thing
as per your request.

27
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:26,519
I didn't change a single word.
Just sign it.

28
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:27,878
Shut up

29
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,096
if you have nothing to say.

30
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:32,158
Say,

31
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,718
we'll be business partners from now on.

32
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,079
We're equals now.

33
00:03:37,118 --> 00:03:38,799
Can you be courteous with your words?

34
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,039
Can you just shut up?

35
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:45,199
Fine.

36
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,199
I can do that.

37
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:47,278
Take your time.

38
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:23,560
Where's the wedding ring?

39
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:26,079
I sold it.

40
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,918
It has already come to this.

41
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:31,718
Can you be honest with me for once?

42
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,030
You didn't manage
to find the ring, right?

43
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,838
What's the point
of keeping an empty box?

44
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:22,358
When we first broke up,

45
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:26,079
I had dreams every day.

46
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,119
I dreamt that we and our child

47
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:34,119
were leading blissful lives.

48
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:44,358
But since we're talking about this,

49
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:47,439
there's something I cannot figure out.

50
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:49,918
No matter if...

51
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,199
No matter how despicable
I was back then,

52
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,959
our child did nothing wrong.

53
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:56,718
I know that.

54
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,158
If so, why did you insist on
having an abortion?

55
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:02,136
Did you do it
to seek revenge against me?

56
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,759
I didn't intend to do so.

57
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,208
I didn't undergo an abortion.

58
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,358
The child

59
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:16,598
passed away due to my health issues.

60
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:20,918
I told you this

61
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,238
because I wanted you to give up on me.

62
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:26,358
I'd made up my mind
to break up with you.

63
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,119
I wanted to steel my resolve.

64
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,470
I didn't want the relationship
to end messily.

65
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:34,959
That is all.

66
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:51,759
Huang Wenda,

67
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:54,190
we've been torturing each other

68
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,559
for the past decade and so on.

69
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,759
It's time to end this.

70
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,439
If you're still dwelling on the past,

71
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,879
you can take the contract back.

72
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,718
It's fine that the ring is gone.

73
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,718
I can at least keep the box
as a memento, right?

74
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,216
Ms. Zhang, I'll stop interrupting you.

75
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,238
I'll be flying to Beijing tomorrow.

76
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:35,704
Deliver the contract to Beijing
after you're done signing it.

77
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,798
See you in Beijing.

78
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,400
(A Human Soul Weighs Only One Ounce)

79
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,119
(Please enjoy yourself at Ounce)

80
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,918
Has anyone here
gone for cosmetic surgery?

81
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:16,430
Everyone is keeping quiet.

82
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:17,710
No one wants to admit it, huh?

83
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:18,718
It's fine.

84
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:19,559
I went for it once.

85
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,439
I went there just to experience it.

86
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,040
When I was there, the doctor
grabbed me and told me

87
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:25,718
that my temples looked a bit sunken.

88
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,238
I said,

89
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,552
"You're pressing on them so hard.

90
00:08:28,552 --> 00:08:29,592
How could they not sink?"

91
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,519
She said,

92
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,936
"You should consider getting a filler

93
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:33,959
for your sunken temples.

94
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:35,416
It's bad for your husband."

95
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:37,279
Let me take a sip.

96
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:39,518
What's wrong?

97
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,718
Who made you upset?

98
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:45,039
Liang Daiwen.

99
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,799
I don't know where he learned

100
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,838
all those bizarre facts from.

101
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:49,718
This morning, he suddenly told me

102
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,679
that he would never propose to me again.

103
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,279
And then?

104
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:54,664
Were you disappointed?

105
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:57,118
I don't know.

106
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,424
Let me ask you this, then.

107
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,870
Now, Liang Daiwen says that he's
not going to propose to you again.

108
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:04,159
Do you feel relieved?

109
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,679
Or

110
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:05,670
do you feel disappointed?

111
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,358
A little disappointed.

112
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,039
Just a little?

113
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:15,878
Fine.

114
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:17,279
I'm very disappointed.

115
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:19,518
You got your answer.

116
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,478
Since you wanted him to propose
to you that badly,

117
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,039
why did you

118
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,199
reject him, then?

119
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:31,118
Before my mother passed away,
she told me

120
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:33,270
not to believe in the promises
anyone had made to you.

121
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:35,518
She told me not to change my life plans

122
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:36,998
for the sake of another person.

123
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,878
I still remember the scene

124
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:41,478
where she and Dad got a divorce.

125
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,399
Although she didn't say

126
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,279
that marriage was a bad thing,

127
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:48,478
I still think

128
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,518
this is a huge deal.

129
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:54,039
Understood.

130
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:57,598
I fell out with my family before this

131
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,319
because I didn't want to get married.

132
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:02,598
I have two pairs of parents.

133
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,399
Mr. Chen and Mrs. Chen

134
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,152
lost their daughter during middle age.

135
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,598
They've been depending on each other
all these years.

136
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:10,559
And my biological parents too.

137
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:13,559
Although they had a rough life,

138
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,039
they

139
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,319
endured it together.

140
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,598
To them,

141
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:19,878
their partner

142
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,848
is their home
and their sense of belonging.

143
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:24,790
When it comes to relationships,

144
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,998
it's different for everyone.

145
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,232
However, when it comes to marriage,

146
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:29,598
you have to think carefully.

147
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,439
I believe in you.

148
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:33,800
I believe in Liang too.

149
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,439
But I'm not doing good at work now.

150
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,559
I don't have any future plans either.

151
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,750
As for Liang Daiwen, he's just
starting to get on the right track.

152
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:46,638
I think he's not ready either.

153
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:47,718
Gu Yi,

154
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:50,838
have you turned numb
from all the scripts you've written?

155
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,238
For me,

156
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:54,750
I was someone who had to finish

157
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:55,998
one task

158
00:10:55,998 --> 00:10:57,399
before I could proceed
with another task.

159
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,598
That's why

160
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:00,408
I insisted on finishing
the romance variety show

161
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,998
before I dealt with

162
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,838
the issue between Yu Dule
and my parents.

163
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:07,159
Look at me now.

164
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:10,664
Although I finished
the romance variety show,

165
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:11,959
I've messed up

166
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,358
all the things that are important to me.

167
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,919
In life,

168
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,279
you're never ready.

169
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,559
We don't know

170
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,510
what will happen in the future.

171
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,439
Therefore,

172
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,358
don't waste your time contemplating.

173
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,128
You should hold on
to what you have right now.

174
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:31,799
Don't wait.

175
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:36,518
Love requires trust.

176
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,630
If you wish to have a future with him,

177
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,672
you must tell him about it.

178
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,632
Don't make him guess.

179
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:56,430
In ancient times,
there were ten infamous tortures.

180
00:11:56,598 --> 00:11:57,878
Now, we have cosmetic surgery.

181
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:00,136
The ancient executioners
are as good as the cosmetic surgeons

182
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,750
if they live in the current era.

183
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,039
For their ads,

184
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:03,638
they always

185
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,104
encourage people to shed some fat
in order to lose weight.

186
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,279
So, what's the best way
of losing weight?

187
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:12,150
By cutting snacks.

188
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:12,959
Mr. Xu.

189
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,478
Are you a cat?

190
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,959
You didn't make any noise
when you walked.

191
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,399
You scared me, you know?

192
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,992
How come you're free enough
to come here today?

193
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:26,478
You weren't at Nextmonday.

194
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:28,598
Guan Xingxin told me that you were here.

195
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:31,439
Guan Xingxin is here
to support the show.

196
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,199
Yu Dule wants to avoid her.

197
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:34,758
He told me to keep an eye here.

198
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,079
Do you need anything from me?

199
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,238
I heard from Penny

200
00:12:41,118 --> 00:12:42,919
that you don't intend
to extend your contract.

201
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,688
Are you here to persuade me
to extend my contract?

202
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:49,679
How is that possible?

203
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,598
I'm in charge of Art List now.

204
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,319
I don't care about Nextmonday's KPI.

205
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,910
I'm glad to hear that.

206
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:56,664
That's right.

207
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:58,838
I'm finishing the termination procedure.

208
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,998
I wanted to tell you in advance.

209
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,959
But you just assumed a new position.

210
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,279
You were too busy.

211
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,039
I'm not surprised that you're
terminating the contract.

212
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,319
I just didn't expect

213
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,559
to bid farewell to you this soon.

214
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:17,159
I just bade farewell to Jacqueline.

215
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:18,799
And now, you're leaving too.

216
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,079
Are you here

217
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:26,118
just to bid farewell to me?

218
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:30,559
You're my friend.

219
00:13:30,616 --> 00:13:32,424
Of course I have to
give you an official farewell.

220
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:34,878
Alright.

221
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,559
Once the show is over,

222
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:39,439
I'll take you somewhere.

223
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:43,838
Sure.

224
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,538
(Yuji Restaurant)

225
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:53,919
Ms. Mei.

226
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:55,439
We're full now.

227
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,598
Have a seat first.

228
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:57,478
Business is booming, huh?

229
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,478
Do you want the usual?

230
00:13:59,478 --> 00:13:59,919
Yeah.

231
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,349
I've already made the arrangements.

232
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,072
We'll wait here.

233
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:02,510
Please wait.

234
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,128
You can go ahead.

235
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,199
What do you mean by the usual?

236
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,959
They're your favorite dishes.

237
00:14:08,984 --> 00:14:10,824
She remembered my order
since I ordered them a lot.

238
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:12,598
It's my treat today.

239
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:14,358
Let me treat you instead.

240
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,389
I said I wanted to buy you a meal
since last year.

241
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,890
You always said I could
buy you a meal next time.

242
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:18,952
But I never bought you a meal.

243
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:20,230
No worries.

244
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,592
We have plenty of chances in the future.

245
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:24,799
Gu Yi, I have something fun here.

246
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,758
What is it?

247
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:28,680
I have some sparklers.

248
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:31,079
Are you a supplier?

249
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,358
You even have sparklers with you?

250
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:34,040
I'm trying to make you happy.

251
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:35,518
Sparklers

252
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:37,118
are meant for angels.

253
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:45,352
Come on.

254
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,456
Let's play with the sparklers.

255
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:47,518
Let's go.

256
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:08,079
Although my fireworks

257
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,799
aren't as beautiful
as the star you have,

258
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,279
I can at least provide you

259
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,118
with some happy memories.

260
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:18,478
Every encounter in life
is a coincidence.

261
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,758
That's why we don't need to say goodbye

262
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:22,238
or bid farewell.

263
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,039
We'll see each other again.

264
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:40,319
Mr. Xu,

265
00:15:41,998 --> 00:15:43,638
what's your plan, then?

266
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:46,279
Me?

267
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:48,799
I'll just go with the flow.

268
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,559
I'll do something that I like.

269
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,319
I took over the music column

270
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,758
because Jacqueline needed
my help urgently.

271
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,439
Now, it's time
to complete my task and move on.

272
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,672
Once I'm done with the work handover,

273
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:01,638
I plan to travel around the world,

274
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:02,910
meet up with my friends,

275
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:04,238
and enjoy some concerts.

276
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,238
I realize that office work

277
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:08,358
doesn't suit me at all.

278
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,238
I only worked for one year,

279
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:12,040
yet I'm getting headaches
from choosing topics.

280
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,358
I have to take a long break.

281
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,480
You should rest well.

282
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:22,231
In the future, we won't be
working in the same field.

283
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,560
We'll be in different circles as well.

284
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:25,799
Both you and Liang Daiwen
can find me anytime.

285
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,478
There's no need to avoid me.

286
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,799
We'll always be comrades.

287
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,029
Why do I feel like

288
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,696
you and Liang Daiwen are
more like comrades now?

289
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:36,590
It's more than that.
We're business partners too.

290
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:39,878
Although I don't wish to admit it,

291
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,118
I'm starting

292
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:42,439
to take him as a friend.

293
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:45,159
At first, I thought

294
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,638
alexithymia was a flaw of his.

295
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:49,016
But after I started to understand him,

296
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,919
I realized that it made
the difference between us.

297
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,838
At least he's not crafty

298
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:55,878
when it comes to love.

299
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,512
He loves people with determination,

300
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:57,998
sincerity,

301
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,118
and courage.

302
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:01,752
Sometimes, I can't
achieve the things he can.

303
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,238
You can do it.

304
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:06,639
One day,

305
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:08,798
you'll encounter your own star.

306
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:10,710
When that happens,
you'll charge ahead bravely.

307
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:15,919
Now,

308
00:17:15,998 --> 00:17:17,599
I'm one of Ounce's shareholders.

309
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:18,879
Ounce is my territory now.

310
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:20,318
When you come back,

311
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:22,518
you have to perform for me.

312
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,639
As one of the bosses,

313
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:25,238
I have to assess
my employees' abilities.

314
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:27,879
Alright.

315
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:29,639
Deal.

316
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:31,558
Okay.

317
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,199
Deal.

318
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,278
Let's finish them.

319
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,558
Forget about being a supplier.

320
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:42,558
Come.

No matter who you get married to,

357
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:58,359
you will always be

all of them are worth your devotion.

362
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,318
After you get married,
you should be devoted to each other.

363
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:12,679
But there's a prerequisite.
It's that you have

364
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:14,110
to maintain all the previous...

when I'm not home, huh?

370
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:26,472
What were you doing?

371
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:28,679
I was doing some stretches
after my bath.

372
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,278
What are you hiding, then?

373
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:33,224
Nothing. I was scrolling
through my phone.

374
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,199
You just came back.

375
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:38,238
You're dirty.

376
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:39,359
Go and wash up.

377
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:42,168
It's too late for you
to complain about me.

378
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:43,679
I'm already yours now.

379
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:45,839
I realized

380
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,199
that you're no longer adorable.

381
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:48,359
You're not obedient anymore.

382
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:52,159
Since when was I obedient?

383
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:53,176
You were obedient once.

384
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:54,998
You were so adorable

385
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,680
when you first returned to the country.

386
00:21:56,718 --> 00:21:57,839
You did everything I told you to.

387
00:21:58,518 --> 00:21:58,998
Is that so?

388
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,159
I don't remember.

389
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:01,679
You don't remember?

390
00:22:02,478 --> 00:22:03,558
What did you say back then?

391
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:05,959
"I'm done for.

392
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:08,478
I was done for the moment

393
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,518
I felt love.

394
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:11,758
Now, anything else doesn't matter

395
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,119
except for loving..."

396
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,117
(Jacqueline)

397
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
(Jacqueline)

398
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:29,038
Hello?

399
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,639
Why don't you sell your page to me?

400
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,032
I'll pay you 300,000 yuan.

401
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,008
You can operate it.

402
00:23:34,184 --> 00:23:35,710
I guess paid licensing
is also acceptable.

403
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,798
You're still trying to extort me
after leaving the company?

404
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:40,318
And, can't you call me
during the daytime?

405
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:41,758
I'm busy during the daytime.

406
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:44,229
The outdated HR
at Huang Wenda's company

407
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,800
struggles to recruit
suitable candidates.

408
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:47,790
Even if they have a budget
for new media,

409
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:49,879
it isn't worth my time
to train new recruits.

410
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,119
Your account

411
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,696
is a ready-made teaching material.

412
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:54,792
If I buy it, I can solve my issues
once and for all.

413
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:57,798
You have plenty of pages
that accommodate a lot of ads.

414
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:00,159
Why are you interested in
my small and unnoticed page?

415
00:24:00,998 --> 00:24:03,038
And, I created that
to record my daily life.

416
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:05,544
I'll create another one
after you buy this one.

417
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:06,888
Will you buy it again after that?

418
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,469
I'll keep buying them

419
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,560
as long as they're interesting.

420
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:11,238
I like your content.

421
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:12,238
300,000 yuan

422
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,359
for your IP?

423
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:14,318
No problem.

424
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:17,320
She's offering me 300,000 yuan.

425
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:20,199
But why?

426
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:28,632
Thanks for the invitation.

427
00:24:28,696 --> 00:24:29,624
But it's a no for me.

428
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:34,159
It's 300,000 yuan, you know?

429
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:37,064
Do you know how many scripts
I have to write to earn that sum?

430
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:39,278
I can give you all the money you want.

431
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:41,839
What they like is your content.

432
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:44,159
You have to protect your talent.

433
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:46,488
You should pay more attention.

434
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:04,600
Did you change your mind?

435
00:25:05,318 --> 00:25:06,998
I have a better suggestion.

436
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,439
You should become

437
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:10,639
one of Ounce's shareholders.

438
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:11,959
Gu Yi,

439
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:14,718
are you even trying to set me up now?

440
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:18,558
You like my IP, right?

441
00:25:19,238 --> 00:25:20,998
I, Gu Yi, am the creator of my content.

442
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,758
But Ounce has more people like me.

443
00:25:27,998 --> 00:25:28,798
You should consider it.

444
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:31,029
There's a show at Ounce
in a few more days.

445
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,928
Come and catch the show.

446
00:25:32,024 --> 00:25:32,968
You should consider it.

447
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,152
Go and take a bath.

448
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:50,558
Okay.

449
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:18,679
Are you done packing?

450
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,590
Don't tell me to mail your things to you

451
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:22,919
if you forget anything.

452
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:25,318
I'm sure that I left nothing behind.

453
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:28,399
I've caused trouble
for you all this while.

454
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,399
Thank you for tolerating me.

455
00:26:31,518 --> 00:26:32,478
I'm glad that you know it.

456
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,798
Experience is the mother of all wisdom.

457
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:38,159
Don't repeat your mistake.

458
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:39,439
Roger that.

459
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,318
When are you heading to Beijing?

460
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:43,704
I'll see you off at the airport.

461
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:46,518
I hate it the most
when people get sentimental.

462
00:26:47,758 --> 00:26:49,119
I still have a show to catch at Ounce.

463
00:26:49,128 --> 00:26:50,600
I don't think I'll be leaving that soon.

464
00:26:59,199 --> 00:26:59,758
Jacqueline,

465
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,199
thank you for taking me in.

466
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:06,798
From now on, we're friends.

467
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:10,399
You can visit me anytime.

468
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:12,120
I'll prepare plenty of liquor for you.

469
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:24,318
If you don't let go now,

470
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:25,919
I'll increase your rent.

471
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:37,199
What are you doing?

472
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:39,119
You're still holding me tightly.

473
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:41,848
Do you want the moving company
to carry you to your new place?

474
00:27:44,968 --> 00:27:45,950
I'll be leaving, then.

475
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,439
Go now.

476
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:51,998
My friend.

477
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:53,630
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

Yeah, right?

491
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:49,430
You bought it for me.

492
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:52,879
I gave you an everlasting flower

493
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,758
while you gave me
a bunch of cornflowers.

494
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,632
At least you know how to be courteous.

495
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,990
Since you're done moving,

496
00:29:59,238 --> 00:30:00,119
what plans

497
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:01,590
do you have in the future?

498
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:04,758
I'll keep on living.

499
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:07,798
I'll look after myself and my parents

500
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:10,959
even though they're still
ignoring me at the moment.

501
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:14,639
Don't be impatient.

502
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:16,718
Give them some time.

503
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:17,758
You guys are a family.

504
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,879
There's no issue
that cannot be resolved.

505
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:23,278
I know that.

506
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:26,839
Actually,

507
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,679
I'm quite envious of Gu Yi

508
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:31,959
and her mother.

509
00:30:33,318 --> 00:30:34,439
I couldn't figure out

510
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:35,758
why other people's mothers

511
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:37,439
could visit their daughters

512
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,639
with plenty of delicious food

513
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,679
while my mother

514
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:42,040
was always picky with me.

515
00:30:43,672 --> 00:30:45,190
But when I put myself in their shoes,

516
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:47,599
to them,

517
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,959
maybe I'm a lousy daughter.

518
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,718
Shen told me to accept myself.

519
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,640
Now, I finally understand what it means.

520
00:30:58,318 --> 00:30:58,919
You,

521
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,078
Liang,

522
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:01,038
Gu Yi,

523
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:01,639
Mr. Lu,

524
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:02,518
and even Xu Guanrui,

525
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,518
none of you had

526
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,439
perfect growth.

527
00:31:07,758 --> 00:31:09,839
Even so, you guys didn't become selfish.

528
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:12,670
I was the only one.

529
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,824
Actually, you don't need
to compare yourself with others.

530
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:18,910
You've already taken your first step

531
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:20,639
toward independence.

532
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,599
That's already a great start.

533
00:31:22,808 --> 00:31:24,472
You just need to keep up the good work.

534
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:29,639
Yu Dule,

535
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,839
if we didn't break up,

536
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,944
do you think you'd be confident
in meeting my parents?

537
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:40,718
Actually,

538
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:44,078
whether or not I'm confident

539
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:46,278
depends entirely on you.

540
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,359
I told you this before as well.

541
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,199
When I was together
with my ex-girlfriend,

542
00:31:53,998 --> 00:31:55,439
they also had such doubts about me.

543
00:31:57,998 --> 00:31:58,959
Back then,

544
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:00,879
I wasn't confident

545
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:03,038
that I could handle
the futures of two people.

546
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,159
I wasn't confident in coming up

547
00:32:05,518 --> 00:32:06,839
with plans

548
00:32:07,478 --> 00:32:08,159
and promises.

549
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,439
Therefore, in the end,

550
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:13,159
I spent no effort in dealing with them.

551
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:16,518
After six years, I got to know you.

552
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:18,359
This time,

553
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,032
I wish to work hard and take it head-on.

554
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,078
I wish to be prepared
before I face such doubts.

555
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:24,839
But in the end,

556
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:28,599
you said you didn't need me
to face them.

557
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:32,919
Don't apologize to me.

558
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:34,318
There's no need

559
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:36,008
for an apology between us.

560
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:43,998
But at least we'll always be friends.

561
00:32:54,504 --> 00:32:56,840
We should work hard
to become the best version of ourselves.

562
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:58,639
Maybe we'll encounter

563
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,718
each other again

564
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,399
at the end of the road.

565
00:33:55,464 --> 00:33:56,792
You don't need to worry now.

566
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:03,278
Are you ready?

567
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:10,008
You can do it. It's your time to shine.

568
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:10,759
Alright.

569
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:17,279
Hello, everyone. I'm Gu Yi.

570
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:20,558
Excellent!

571
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:23,959
I realized

572
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:25,558
that many youngsters

573
00:34:25,558 --> 00:34:27,439
weren't willing to live together
with their parents.

574
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,078
That's why they chose to buy houses.

575
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:31,672
A friend of mine
wanted to renovate his house lately.

576
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,799
The designer asked him

577
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,759
about the style he liked.

578
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,198
He asked him whether
he preferred Chinese classical style,

579
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:39,198
Japanese wabi-sabi style,

580
00:34:39,558 --> 00:34:40,759
or Scandinavian minimalist style?

581
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:41,919
He said,

582
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:43,799
"I like the kind

583
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,078
where it makes my parents
hate the place."

584
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,478
I've been in a relationship lately.

585
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:57,518
I realized

586
00:34:57,759 --> 00:34:59,198
that men love to say mushy things

587
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:01,118
when they're in a relationship.

588
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:02,598
Something like this.

589
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,198
"I need you,

590
00:35:04,678 --> 00:35:06,078
I cannot live without you,

591
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:09,759
and I've never loved someone else
as much as you."

592
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:13,719
The way

593
00:35:13,919 --> 00:35:16,598
they brainwash people
is comparable to scammers.

594
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,879
But I feel touched
whenever I hear these words.

595
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,399
Therefore, when I answer a scam call,

596
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:25,439
when the scammer says,

597
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:26,359
"Hello,

598
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,799
we have an event.

599
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:29,239
We wish to invite you."

600
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:30,638
I'll say this,

601
00:35:32,158 --> 00:35:33,038
"You can invite me.

602
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:34,711
However, you must tell me

603
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:36,664
whether you invited
anyone else to the event

604
00:35:36,712 --> 00:35:38,110
before me?"

605
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,158
The scammer will face
a mental breakdown.

606
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:43,359
They'll say this, "Miss,

607
00:35:43,638 --> 00:35:44,959
this is just a scam call."

608
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:46,239
I'll say,

609
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,478
"Even if it's a scam call,

610
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:50,919
you can only scam me."

611
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:52,678
That was funny.

612
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:00,879
My boyfriend and I

613
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,319
have a great relationship.

614
00:36:03,198 --> 00:36:05,359
Last time, he proposed to me

615
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,678
under such circumstances.

616
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:08,518
But I rejected him on the spot.

617
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:11,558
Even so, he wasn't angry at all.

618
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,279
I was wondering if he stopped loving me.

619
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:16,678
It was just a joke.

620
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,439
It's because
I wasn't prepared for it yet.

621
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,759
It was too sudden.

622
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:22,759
And,

623
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:26,239
why would someone propose to a girl
during a stand-up comedy gig?

624
00:36:26,558 --> 00:36:27,799
Yeah.

625
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:28,719
Yeah, right?

626
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:29,558
Yeah, right?

627
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:30,518
No one knows

628
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,399
whether or not you mean it, you know?

629
00:36:33,598 --> 00:36:34,558
What if I said yes

630
00:36:34,558 --> 00:36:35,879
and you said it was just a joke?

631
00:36:36,038 --> 00:36:36,799
What should I do?

632
00:36:40,118 --> 00:36:40,879
Therefore, today,

633
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,558
I plan

634
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:44,439
to take the initiative.

635
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,518
Liang Daiwen,

636
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,478
you know

637
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:00,839
that I love you.

638
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:05,118
But I think I've never told you

639
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:06,998
what I love about you.

640
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:09,799
I love you.

641
00:37:10,518 --> 00:37:13,359
Of course it's not merely because
you're good-looking,

642
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:14,879
have an excellent job,

643
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,839
and have a huge villa.

644
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:19,998
To you, all these external conditions

645
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,399
are nothing compared to your strengths.

646
00:37:24,038 --> 00:37:25,359
I love you

647
00:37:27,518 --> 00:37:28,998
because you're kind, reliable,

648
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:31,399
meticulous, and gentle.

649
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:33,839
You're simple-minded,

650
00:37:35,038 --> 00:37:35,598
sincere,

651
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:37,118
ambitious,

652
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:39,198
patient,

653
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:41,279
and tolerating.

654
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,558
You'll listen to me seriously.

655
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,959
You don't judge me easily.

656
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,576
And you support me unconditionally.

657
00:37:51,158 --> 00:37:52,478
More importantly,

658
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:56,118
I also love the version of me

659
00:37:57,078 --> 00:37:58,919
when I was together with you.

660
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,118
But compared
to expressing my love for you,

661
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,399
I feel like saying

662
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:05,638
