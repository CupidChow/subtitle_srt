(Adapted from Douban Read's work
"Smile Code" by Zu Yue)

=Episode 18=

25
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:40,962
Liang Daiwen!

26
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,761
You filthy animal.

27
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:50,201
Where are my clothes?

28
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:52,880
I put them in the dryer.

29
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:54,441
In the dryer?

30
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:00,321
Did you see everything?

31
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:03,321
See what?

32
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:05,921
You...

33
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:07,441
You're despicable!

34
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,921
You threw up after leaving Ounce.

35
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,128
You threw up all over yourself.

36
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:19,721
And, you clung onto me like an octopus.

37
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:27,320
It took Guan Xingxin a lot of effort

38
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:28,639
to drag you away from me

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,736
and help you get changed.

40
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:31,962
What you're wearing right now

41
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:34,082
is the spare sweatshirt
Yu Dule kept in the bar.

42
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:40,201
So, this filthy animal

43
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:41,761
didn't see anything.

44
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:51,441
If so, why didn't you send me home?

45
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:52,761
I did.

46
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:55,064
I asked you about your door password.

47
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:56,792
You kept repeating my door password

48
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:57,962
like a broken record.

49
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:08,881
You...

50
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:11,641
You didn't move?

51
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:15,362
I did.

52
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:16,856
I moved up one floor.

53
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:19,362
One floor?

54
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,362
This is Unit 1502.

55
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:35,922
That number

56
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,042
is quite auspicious.

57
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,496
Sorry for bothering you.

58
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:40,472
I'll make a move first.

59
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:45,162
I...

60
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:48,242
Thank you.

61
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,968
So, please deliver

62
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,300
the clothes to me
via express delivery.

63
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:53,128
Express delivery, okay?

64
00:05:32,242 --> 00:05:32,722
Hello?

65
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:34,961
Hello, Mr. Liang.

66
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,841
I got in touch with Mr. Li Ai.

67
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,936
Can you arrange an appointment for us?

68
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:41,122
It's kind of difficult.

69
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:42,482
He's not around at the moment.

70
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:43,362
He's abroad.

71
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,641
Go on stage!

72
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:59,682
Go on stage!

73
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:07,401
Yi,

74
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:09,048
I've sent the weekly report
to your email.

75
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,759
(Challenges women
face during job hunting...)

76
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
(Remark: Our current theme
is the struggle of women.)

77
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:20,420
(These topics are unrelated. Redo them.)

78
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:23,881
Look.

79
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,362
What does she mean by this?

80
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:30,641
Low desires of the working class,

81
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,088
workplaces obsessed with "wolf culture",

82
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,730
the public relations crisis
of a scandalous affair,

83
00:06:33,736 --> 00:06:35,448
which of them aren't
a part of women's struggle?

84
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:38,719
Obviously, Deputy Director
doesn't care about

85
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,704
such struggles of women.

86
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:47,521
I'll change them!

87
00:06:54,703 --> 00:06:56,415
(Struggle of women's body image anxiety)

88
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,822
(What's wrong with being chubby?)

89
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,160
(What's wrong with that?
Did I eat your food?)

90
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:09,281
Done.

91
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:12,584
(Jacqueline: Hurry and send it to me.
Your draft is the only thing lacking.)

92
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,630
(These are the new scripts.)

93
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:15,480
(All ideas are welcome.)

94
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:35,602
Gu Yi.

95
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:38,242
Gu Yi!

96
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:57,281
You sent the content
to the group chat directly.

97
00:07:57,682 --> 00:07:58,961
Are you perfectly confident in them?

98
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,042
That's not it.

99
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:05,864
Are you happy
that you've skipped your superior?

100
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,321
I'm not.

101
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,242
But I don't know
how to change my content.

102
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:12,362
If you think my scripts are lousy too,

103
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:14,321
I'll be willing to change them.

104
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:18,519
Promoting Penny

105
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,840
to the position of Deputy Director

106
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:21,120
was a decision made by the company.

107
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,162
Why didn't you heed her suggestions
now that she's your superior?

108
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:28,602
She told me to write about
the struggles of women.

109
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:30,562
But all of the interviewees she found

110
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:31,441
were successful women.

111
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,442
It feels shallow to discuss
that topic with them.

112
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:34,602
Think about it.

113
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:37,561
We're discussing the struggle of women
with someone who earns millions of yuan.

114
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:39,401
Don't you think that'll irk the readers?

115
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,616
If I were a reader,

116
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:42,660
I wouldn't want to listen to people
at the top of the pyramid

117
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,528
talking about success.

118
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:44,999
What's wrong?

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,792
Can't ordinary people
talk about their struggles?

120
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:48,801
Is Nextmonday
a meddlesome middle-aged aunt?

121
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:49,761
We...

122
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:53,064
(I'm done for.)

123
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:55,881
(Roger designated Penny
to be the Deputy Director.)

124
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,639
(Jacqueline did him a favor
by promoting Penny.)

125
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,008
(And now, I'm trying to obstruct him?)

126
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:04,561
(This time, I walked right
into the trap myself.)

127
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:07,442
Sorry.

128
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:09,482
I was too reckless.

129
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:11,800
I'll head back and change the content.

130
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:16,082
The group chat

131
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:17,401
and meeting room

132
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:20,482
are parts of
a public working environment.

133
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:23,161
Is embarrassing your superiors

134
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:24,482
the way you do things?

135
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:27,202
If everyone acted like you,

136
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:29,736
the company wouldn't need
to proofread your scripts, then.

137
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:32,632
Log into your Outlook account

138
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:33,962
and send an explanation

139
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,801
to the Deputy Director

140
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:37,816
as to why you bypassed her.

141
00:09:38,392 --> 00:09:40,168
This is the last time you're doing this.

142
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:17,881
I'm finally done.

143
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:20,281
Mr. Yu,

144
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,722
help me proofread my scripts.

145
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:24,761
Can't you see that I'm busy?

146
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,992
Who are you ordering around?

147
00:10:26,362 --> 00:10:27,801
Can you please do me a favor?

148
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:30,921
That Deputy Director of ours
will inspect my content.

149
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:32,904
I'm afraid I'll throw up
if I proofread my own content.

150
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:34,962
Fine.

151
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:36,242
What about this?

152
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,848
You can do me a favor in return.

153
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:41,040
Guan Xingxin will go for
several trial live streams

154
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:41,976
in a few more days.

155
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:43,322
Remember to remind her

156
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:44,681
to bring the beeper

157
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:45,722
I gifted her

158
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:46,962
when she leaves the house.

159
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:48,281
Girls need to stay safe

160
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,242
when they're outside,

161
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:50,242
am I right?

162
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:53,322
Can you stop spreading anxiety?

163
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,561
She did plenty of live streams
before she got to know you, you know?

164
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:00,322
You do have a point.

165
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:01,442
But you see,

166
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:03,521
you can never understand the severity

167
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:05,384
of harassment
that a beautiful woman will face.

168
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,801
Yu Dule,

169
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,401
that sounds offensive even if
you pass it off as a joke,

170
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:10,962
you know?

171
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:12,202
Besides,

172
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:14,242
so what if she brings
the beeper with her?

173
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,584
Will you appear right beside her
after she presses it?

174
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,442
What? Are you a superhero
who can teleport?

175
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:22,881
You've hit my nerve.

176
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:25,161
If only I were a superhero.

177
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,722
But you see, at least

178
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:28,660
I can sleep peacefully
if she brings it with her,

179
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,288
don't you agree?

180
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:37,801
A friend of mine

181
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,161
has a crush on a female live streamer...

182
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:42,002
Gu Yi,

183
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:43,962
that's too much.

184
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:45,521
Delete that. Stop reading it.

185
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:51,482
Gu Yi.

186
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:53,401
I'm warning you.

187
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:03,002
He actually told her to bring a beeper
with her when she leaves the house.

188
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:05,521
I asked him what she could do
with a beeper

189
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:07,722
out of curiosity.

190
00:12:07,722 --> 00:12:08,681
Ms. Gu?

191
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:10,801
Delete that.

192
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,482
I can't do that. I...

193
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,322
To hell with you!

194
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:19,641
And...

195
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:20,600
You see...

196
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:22,641
Guys, dogs are very strict.

197
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:23,722
They are.

198
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:25,482
Back then,
I couldn't retrieve the frisbee.

199
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:41,722
You...

200
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:43,722
You...

201
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:44,962
You...

202
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
What drinks do you want?

203
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,161
What drinks do I want?

204
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:53,082
I haven't asked you why you're here yet.

205
00:12:53,602 --> 00:12:54,521
Duo is busy today.

206
00:12:54,568 --> 00:12:55,800
I'm covering for her for a while.

207
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:56,968
You're covering for her?

208
00:12:57,848 --> 00:12:59,336
Do you two know each other that well?

209
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:01,000
Can't I cover for her
if I don't know her well?

210
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,242
I merely have alexithymia.

211
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,322
I'm not an idiot.

212
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,224
I can handle basic social interactions.

213
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:18,002
But they've already arranged
the shift for me.

214
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:21,362
Don't be angry. I'll think of something.

215
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,521
It's too late for me to apply for leave.

216
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:27,761
Okay.

217
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:29,801
I'll see if someone can replace me.

218
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:40,242
Duo.

219
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,184
Here are your clothes.

220
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:47,161
Thanks.

221
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:48,719
Express delivery will do.

222
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,896
No need to deliver them yourself.

223
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:50,720
I wanted to.

224
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,128
I was here to pester you so that
you would provide me with treatment.

225
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:58,584
What? You want to give up
on the treatment after doing this to me?

226
00:13:58,664 --> 00:13:59,720
I'll never agree to it.

227
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:04,761
Come here.

228
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:17,080
You wish to continue
with the treatment, huh?

229
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:18,242
I'll consider it.

230
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:20,962
However,

231
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:22,322
can you leave the bar counter first?

232
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,641
It's unfair to others
when you pretend to be a bartender.

233
00:14:25,242 --> 00:14:26,002
Unfair to who?

234
00:14:26,962 --> 00:14:27,722
Xu Guanrui?

235
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:32,199
It's unfair to the customers.

236
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,160
Were you calling for me?

237
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:39,160
Is this the new bartender?

238
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:41,656
I wasn't eavesdropping on you two.

239
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:43,082
I just heard someone calling my name.

240
00:14:45,002 --> 00:14:45,681
It was me.

241
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:47,322
But I wasn't making a wish.

242
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:49,561
You didn't need to appear immediately.

243
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,842
If I hadn't appeared
in the nick of time previously,

244
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:55,242
Gu Yi would have no way
of leaving the stage.

245
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,322
It's not a good thing
to carry a woman in public

246
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:00,082
without permission.

247
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:12,040
She already kissed me before.

248
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:13,768
The bite mark will only vanish
after some time.

249
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:15,960
Now, you want to act
as if nothing had happened?

250
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:20,040
Let me take a look.

251
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:21,482
Stop looking.

252
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,401
Go and wash the cups.

253
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:24,680
I didn't see it clearly.

254
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:26,082
Who bit him? Did you bite him?

255
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:27,679
It wasn't me.

256
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,696
You should bite me too.

257
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,880
It was a dog.

258
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,041
Two beers.

259
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:39,161
Beer?

260
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:40,360
Where is it?

261
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,082
Over there.

262
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:46,602
Just now, Liang Daiwen said

263
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:47,401
he has

264
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:48,482
a strange condition.

265
00:15:49,602 --> 00:15:50,521
Alexithymia.

266
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:51,801
Alexithymia?

267
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:52,920
What does that mean?

268
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:55,362
It's a condition

269
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:57,752
where his emotions
are not well-regulated all year long.

270
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,801
He cannot express them accurately.

271
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:03,000
A condition like this
actually exists, huh?

272
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:04,161
If so...

273
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:07,242
If so, how much love
will he be able to sense?

274
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:11,842
A little.

275
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,002
You shouldn't mock him.

276
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:23,082
I'm not.

277
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:24,761
Instead, I think

278
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:27,602
you're more courageous than I think.

279
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,842
It's hard on him too.

280
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:35,041
You already swallowed so many grievances
because of him.

281
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,362
Now, you can't bear for him to be upset?

282
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:39,202
You see, when it comes
to apologies in a relationship,

283
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:41,521
saying sorry alone
won't resolve the issue.

284
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:44,232
You have to make him
go through the same thing as you.

285
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,656
That's what we call a worthy apology.

286
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:51,962
There's no need
to be so calculative, right?

287
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,881
Actually, he's been trying his best.

288
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:57,432
However, one's effort might not
correspond to the result.

289
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:02,842
Therefore,

290
00:17:04,642 --> 00:17:05,882
you still can't give up on him, huh?

291
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:10,561
You'll become soft-hearted

292
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:11,960
when he approaches you again.

293
00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:16,642
Actually, I asked myself
the same question before.

294
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,321
Will I lose my patience

295
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:21,682
if he keeps acting like this?

296
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,776
I don't know the answer to that.

297
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:32,121
I only know

298
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,682
that I don't like myself

299
00:17:36,664 --> 00:17:38,696
when I lose control
of my emotions because of him.

300
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:45,600
The right person will help you
regulate your emotions.

301
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,128
This is a painful relationship.

302
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:52,520
You should find someone
who can warm your heart.

303
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:57,281
Gu Yi,

304
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:01,121
you're my comrade.

305
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:04,841
You're also an important friend of mine.

306
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,088
I don't treat other people like you.

307
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,242
(I've always been living like this)

308
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:28,162
(before I got to know you.)

309
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:30,442
(I don't want to waste your time,)

310
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,162
(yet I don't want to let you go.)

311
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:48,682
Listen.

312
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:50,002
That thief only stole

313
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:51,922
the DSLR camera.

314
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:52,761
Luckily,

315
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,281
the female owner wasn't around.

316
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:55,361
After that,

317
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:56,841
he hid in the foyer

318
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:58,482
of Unit 501, behind the door,

319
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:00,642
after stealing the camera.

320
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:01,442
Is that so?

321
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:02,521
It was terrifying.

322
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:03,642
The thief only ran away

323
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,321
after he was shocked to see

324
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:07,224
the male owner
when he was disposing of the trash.

325
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:10,202
Woohoo!

326
00:19:10,202 --> 00:19:12,081
This neighborhood is crowded.

327
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,120
The tenants come from
all kinds of backgrounds too.

328
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,281
Listen,

329
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:17,722
there was a burglary
in the unit below mine.

330
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:19,599
The committee madam

331
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,992
said she needed to register the names
of all female tenants.

332
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:23,864
(Deliver upon release)
That's dangerous.

333
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,962
If the criminals
get their hands on the list,

334
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:28,801
that means they'll have a list
of ready targets to go.

335
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,960
(Guan Xingxin: Gu Yi, don't be scared.
I'll stay with you tonight after work.)

336
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,592
(I'll give you the beeper
that Yu Dule had given me.)

337
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:42,281
Will Yu Dule's beeper actually work?

338
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,521
Is it actually useful?

339
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,155
(Robot: I'll head there later.)

340
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,226
(Robot: I'll head there later.)

341
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:24,682
Now, even if Liang Daiwen is here,

342
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,922
he won't be able to criticize
my storage skills.

343
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:36,962
Who's there?

344
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,761
Why

345
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:03,722
are you installing a CCTV?

346
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:08,121
I'll be safe if I can view my doorstep

347
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:09,162
with my phone, you know?

348
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:12,281
It's not for your phone.

349
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:13,361
It's for mine.

350
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:16,801
Huh?

351
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:20,242
Will I be safe
if you can view my doorstep

352
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:22,321
from your phone?

353
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:24,962
Can you transport yourself here
from the phone

354
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,722
and fight off the crooks
if they come here?

355
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:31,882
Or,

356
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:35,882
are you trying to
put me under surveillance?

357
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,601
Are you trying to spy on me?

358
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:41,682
Am I that sinister?

359
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:43,162
I promised Mdm. Wang

360
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:44,760
that I would keep an eye on you.

361
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,488
I'm just worried about you.

362
00:21:46,882 --> 00:21:48,242
What's there to worry about?

363
00:21:48,922 --> 00:21:51,521
I'm just a small cog in the workplace.

364
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:53,601
Being unlucky is a part
of my character setting.

365
00:21:58,281 --> 00:21:59,922
Why are you placing a pair of shoes

366
00:21:59,922 --> 00:22:00,882
on my shoe rack?

367
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,361
Are you moving in?

368
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:03,864
I learned this from the Internet.

369
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,048
They said women who live alone

370
00:22:05,402 --> 00:22:07,202
could keep some
men's clothing in the house.

371
00:22:07,642 --> 00:22:08,279
They can also

372
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,640
put a pair of men's shoes in the house.

373
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:11,496
But people can see through this easily.

374
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:13,882
They're too new.

375
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,528
It's obvious that this is a bluff.

376
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:24,642
You...

377
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:28,482
Can't you just put your current shoes

378
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:29,801
on my rack

379
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:31,521
and wear the new ones?

380
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,642
You dirtied your new shoes
for no reason, you know?

381
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:42,402
It's impolite for me
to put my used shoes

382
00:22:42,882 --> 00:22:43,482
in your house.

383
00:22:43,624 --> 00:22:44,792
It's inappropriate as well.

384
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:55,841
Thanks for the CCTV.

385
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,960
Don't mention it.

386
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,202
But if Xu Guanrui dares

387
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:01,962
to step into the house,

388
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:04,440
I'll call the cops on him.

389
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:42,521
Aren't pets supposed
to protect their owners?

390
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:44,801
But the kittens you took from Liang

391
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,162
are only good at sleeping.

392
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:47,521
Aren't they adorable?

393
00:23:47,962 --> 00:23:50,642
Sleeping is the kittens' only mission.

394
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,521
If so, you have to exercise.

395
00:23:56,321 --> 00:23:57,202
Liang

396
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:58,561
can play squash.

397
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:00,696
Tell him to play squash
with us this weekend.

398
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:03,002
Must I?

399
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:04,841
I'll get smacked

400
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:06,801
by the ball, you know?

401
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:10,882
You'll get smacked, huh?
That's pretty good.

402
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:13,400
If not, Liang doesn't have
a chance to care for you.

403
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:22,242
What is this?

404
00:24:22,616 --> 00:24:24,280
This is the beeper
Yu Dule bought for me.

405
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:28,002
Is this it?

406
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:29,962
I assume Mr. Yu

407
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:31,202
might get upset at himself

408
00:24:31,256 --> 00:24:33,080
if he knows that his gift
is actually useless.

409
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:34,761
I don't think it's useless.

410
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:35,801
It's adorable.

411
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:38,962
Things like beepers and CCTVs

412
00:24:38,962 --> 00:24:41,081
match the style
of Yu Dule and Liang completely.

413
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:42,521
However,

414
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,121
Mr. Lu and Xu Guanrui

415
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,121
would never buy something like that.

416
00:24:48,761 --> 00:24:50,321
Speaking of Xu Guanrui,

417
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:51,976
I have to tell you something.

418
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:54,442
I feel like he's been acting strange

419
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:55,521
lately.

420
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:56,600
What's wrong?

421
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:57,560
Did he confess to you?

422
00:24:57,642 --> 00:24:58,442
That's not it.

423
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:00,400
He has always been considerate

424
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,288
and known his boundaries

425
00:25:01,442 --> 00:25:02,242
ever since

426
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:03,361
we got to know each other.

427
00:25:04,642 --> 00:25:05,601
But lately,

428
00:25:06,242 --> 00:25:07,642
he's been kind of proactive.

429
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:12,281
That's because he realized

430
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:13,642
that you and Liang

431
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:15,281
don't have mutual feelings
for each other.

432
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:17,841
Love is an emotion

433
00:25:18,121 --> 00:25:20,561
produced by the secretion of dopamine.

434
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:21,561
Competition

435
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:22,722
also produces dopamine.

436
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:25,256
That's why candy tastes better when
you take it from someone else.

437
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:29,242
But Liang Daiwen doesn't like candy.

438
00:25:31,202 --> 00:25:31,761
Yeah.

439
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:40,841
Sanju, what should we do?

440
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,361
What should we do about him?

441
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
(Popcorn)

442
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,632
I'll talk about the rumors
in the stand-up comedy circle.

443
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,280
I know nothing
about the entertainment circle.

444
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:41,002
If so,

445
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:42,962
let's talk about some stand-up gossip.

446
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:55,400
It's not like I directed them to do so.

447
00:26:56,402 --> 00:26:57,482
What has this got to do with me?

448
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:00,456
This has nothing to do
with stand-up comedy either.

449
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:02,202
It's purely because the man was drunk.

450
00:27:36,728 --> 00:27:37,600
Aren't you surprised?

451
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:39,882
I am.

452
00:27:41,682 --> 00:27:42,402
What's going on?

453
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:43,864
You did this on purpose, right?

454
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:45,402
I swear to God.

455
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:46,552
It happened randomly.

456
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:49,761
What kind of stupid machine is this?
Someone should get a new one.

457
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:51,561
Calm down.

458
00:27:52,442 --> 00:27:53,722
When it comes to romance,

459
00:27:53,832 --> 00:27:54,960
it's a blessing when it arrives.

460
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:56,160
If it doesn't, just let it be.

461
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,002
Do not let potential partners

462
00:27:58,202 --> 00:28:00,482
distract you from being funny.

463
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:04,160
You can do this.

464
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,882
Hello, everyone. I'm Gu Yi.

465
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:24,202
In Ounce,

466
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,248
to be an audience,
you need to draw a lot.

467
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:28,232
You need to draw a lot
if you wish to perform here as well.

468
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:29,960
It's been a long time
since I was chosen.

469
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,402
I was so annoyed that I argued
with the boss on the street.

470
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:34,682
Why didn't you slap me?

471
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:35,882
You should slap me.

472
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:38,962
The passersby were dumbfounded.

473
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:41,202
A kind Samaritan who passed by
came with his palm raised.

474
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:42,601
He asked me

475
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:44,561
whether I needed any help.

476
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:47,561
Ounce is pretty strict
when it comes

477
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,002
to drawing lots for the audience.

478
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:51,162
It's an official process too.

479
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:52,442
You need to register your name.

480
00:28:52,882 --> 00:28:54,361
I'm afraid that you guys

481
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:55,521
have to swear a vow one day.

482
00:28:56,162 --> 00:28:57,281
The crew will say this,

483
00:28:58,482 --> 00:28:59,281
"Will you

484
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:01,321
come and spectate
the performances in Ounce

485
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:03,922
no matter if it's hilarious or awkward,

486
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:05,361
no matter if it's crowded

487
00:29:05,722 --> 00:29:06,521
or not?"

488
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,041
The audience will say...

489
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:10,081
Yes, I do! Pick me!

490
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,922
Pick me!

491
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:15,242
That's right. Excellent.

492
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,202
No wonder they picked you.

493
00:29:17,442 --> 00:29:18,521
We'll pick you again next time.

494
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:19,682
Okay!

495
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:22,722
There's a friend of mine

496
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:23,561
who's a content creator.

497
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,121
He recently posted a video of him

498
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:26,521
brushing a Golden Retriever.

499
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:27,601
It went viral.

500
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:29,402
He posted it every day.

501
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
He brushed the dog every day.

502
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:32,002
He uploaded videos

503
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:33,482
more and more frequently.

504
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:35,528
The dog's fur was getting
lesser and lesser.

505
00:29:35,896 --> 00:29:38,408
The brushing was so intense that
the Golden Retriever lost its color.

506
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:40,482
Its fur became white.

507
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,722
When he took it out for a walk,

508
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:47,041
people asked him why
his Schnauzer was gigantic.

509
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,632
They said it looked like
a Golden Retriever.

510
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:54,041
Actually, I'm a simple person.

511
00:29:54,081 --> 00:29:55,482
I only like two things.

512
00:29:56,202 --> 00:29:56,761
Dog

513
00:29:57,841 --> 00:29:58,601
and men.

514
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:01,442
I'm not a dog.

515
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:02,882
I truly fancy you.

516
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,402
Why didn't you drink after ordering it?

517
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,304
I don't take alcohol.

518
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:29,761
I love customers like you.

519
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:31,096
You stimulate consumer spending.

520
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:32,008
Give me the drink, then.

521
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:36,281
Who were you calling
dog for a man just now?

522
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:39,801
That was just a part of my script.

523
00:30:40,561 --> 00:30:41,922
It's a joke. Don't take it seriously.

524
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,521
Xu Guanrui understood your joke.

525
00:30:44,922 --> 00:30:45,801
He could tell

526
00:30:46,008 --> 00:30:47,304
that you were referring to me.

527
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,682
Fine. I'll apologize to you, then.

528
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:55,399
I'll come up with another joke

529
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,552
to clear your name next time.

530
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:57,081
This won't do.

531
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,521
What do you hate about me?

532
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:01,442
Tell me.

533
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:04,162
Why are you so serious?

534
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:08,321
It's because you sounded like
you detest me

535
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,192
whenever you feature me in your jokes.

536
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:14,682
So, will you

537
00:31:15,224 --> 00:31:16,880
change your ways
if I tell you about them?

538
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:17,482
I will.

539
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:20,361
Fine.

540
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:22,321
Firstly,

541
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:25,761
you need to change the way
you chat on WeChat.

542
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:27,256
You can't just type things like

543
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:29,561
"Okay"

544
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:30,882
or "Alright."

545
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:32,321
That's being indifferent.

546
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,162
You have to at least change your tone

547
00:31:34,521 --> 00:31:36,521
when you chat with your friends.

548
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,002
For example?

549
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:40,242
For example...

550
00:31:41,281 --> 00:31:42,682
For example, you shouldn't type "Okay."

551
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,248
You should type something like

552
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:45,121
"Okay, then!"

553
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:46,281
or

554
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:47,202
"Sure!"

555
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:49,162
Just add a random interjection.

556
00:31:49,482 --> 00:31:51,041
That'll sound much better.

557
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:52,442
At least it proves

558
00:31:52,642 --> 00:31:54,002
that we're close to each other.

559
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:55,761
Is there actually

560
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,081
a difference?

561
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:58,882
Of course.

562
00:31:59,281 --> 00:32:00,121
From "Okay"

563
00:32:00,442 --> 00:32:01,482
to "Okay, then!"

564
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,856
is just like going from
not being familiar with each other

565
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:05,361
to

566
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:11,882
me liking you.

567
00:32:14,722 --> 00:32:15,442
That was mushy.

568
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:19,280
You said you would change your ways.

569
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:21,081
Now, you're turning your back on me.

570
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:23,882
It's tiring to chat with you.

571
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:26,880
Do you still remember

572
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:29,601
the script that Mr. Lu had written?

573
00:32:29,928 --> 00:32:32,680
If two people always chat in a way
that feels like an online romance

574
00:32:32,712 --> 00:32:34,104
with indifferent conversations,

575
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:36,642
there's no need to go as far
as sending pictures to each other.

576
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:38,504
The relationship will be over
before you know it.

577
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:46,202
Okay, then.

578
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:48,712
I'll change my ways.

579
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:06,922
Xu Guanrui is quite crafty.

580
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,456
You should be wary of him.

581
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:17,281
Liang Daiwen,

582
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,760
can you stop scaring me
in the middle of the night?

583
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:21,361
I didn't mean to scare you.

584
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,081
I just feel that Xu Guanrui
is overly attached to you.

585
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:25,736
I'm worried about your safety.

586
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:28,722
You're the one putting me in danger
when you scare me like that.

587
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:32,120
Sorry about that.

588
00:33:35,761 --> 00:33:36,442
Alright now.

589
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:39,682
Don't do this again.

590
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:41,521
If you do this again,

591
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,281
I'll unplug the CCTV

592
00:33:43,656 --> 00:33:44,760
and sever my ties with you.

593
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:47,642
Sure.

594
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:01,081
Mr. Liang,

595
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:05,041
you once designed products
for Xiafurui and Fenqi.

596
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,660
You've received plenty of invitations

597
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,880
from luxurious brands abroad.

598
00:34:08,762 --> 00:34:10,322
Why did you give up on

599
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:11,641
all those opportunities

600
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:13,362
to focus on accessible designs?

601
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:15,241
If you insist on
developing them yourself,

602
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:17,721
will you consider accepting investments?

603
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:20,442
I'm developing the products myself

604
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:22,521
to ensure their functions.

605
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,802
Of course, I welcome
any investments as well.

606
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:27,080
The longer the development period,

607
00:34:27,128 --> 00:34:28,568
the more resources I have to expend.

608
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:31,160
More supporting products need to be
developed alongside the main product.

609
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:34,482
Morning.

610
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:42,762
What's wrong?

611
00:34:43,561 --> 00:34:44,561
Is there something on my face?

612
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:57,641
What's the matter?

613
00:35:01,962 --> 00:35:02,641
Stop looking at them.

614
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,832
It's related to the special feature
from the last Fashion Week.

615
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,882
Didn't I send it to all of them?

616
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:10,442
You did.

617
00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:12,041
But you omitted a client.

618
00:35:13,032 --> 00:35:14,760
The client reported it
to Jacqueline directly.

619
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,440
Penny spoke with Jacqueline
in private this morning.

620
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:18,840
You should be mentally prepared.

621
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:21,736
Here she comes.

622
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:23,721
Gu Yi.

623
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:36,201
So, Penny took charge
of the exhibition voluntarily.

624
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:37,002
Gu Yi,

625
00:35:37,161 --> 00:35:39,121
you were responsible for
communicating with our clients,

626
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:39,641
right?

627
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:42,561
Let me ask you this, then.

628
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:44,561
How did the feature end up like this?

629
00:35:47,561 --> 00:35:48,962
Deputy Director filled her Moments

630
00:35:48,962 --> 00:35:50,521
with short video clips for three days.

631
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,552
She never gave me
a complete description of the scene.

632
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:54,962
I matched her video playlist
with the on-site photos

633
00:35:55,002 --> 00:35:56,561
requested by the brand dealers
one by one

634
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,040
before turning them into
a complete folder.

635
00:35:58,136 --> 00:35:59,800
You sent the content to them
without permission.

636
00:35:59,882 --> 00:36:01,121
There was no live coverage section,

637
00:36:01,128 --> 00:36:02,968
and it wasn't sent to me for review
before the release.

638
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:04,960
You didn't reply to my texts on WeChat
or answer my calls.

639
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,696
The clients were waiting for
their features to be released.

640
00:36:06,712 --> 00:36:07,840
Does that mean

641
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:09,322
you can ignore the procedures?

642
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:10,599
Who said I ignored the procedures?

643
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,530
Even photographers need time before they
publish their work.

644
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:13,200
I...

645
00:36:13,282 --> 00:36:14,561
I can prove that I sought

646
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:16,439
your confirmation
before sending the content to them.

647
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,152
I could still
take screenshots of our chat too.

648
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,322
What's the use of that?

649
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:23,002
Do you think you two are still kids?

650
00:36:23,624 --> 00:36:25,608
Why don't you send a copy
to the Marketing Department?

651
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:29,762
Gu Yi is responsible for
the substantive work.

652
00:36:30,442 --> 00:36:32,442
It's easy to find out whose fault it is.

653
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,041
But I didn't call you guys here

654
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:37,161
so that you two could blame
each other for the mistake.

655
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,081
You should know clearly
about the job scope

656
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,744
of Deputy Director
of the planning department.

657
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:43,912
Why did you return to Nextmonday

658
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:44,968
when it was fun to be at shows?

659
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:48,081
You could've finished the task easily
according to the procedures.

660
00:36:48,322 --> 00:36:49,601
You had to drag it out like this?

661
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:51,576
Are you trying to prove
your authority here?

662
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:55,762
Take it back and redo it!

663
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,240
Make sure you deliver the content

664
00:36:58,362 --> 00:36:59,161
and pacify our client

665
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:00,536
before the end of the workday!

666
00:37:00,882 --> 00:37:01,601
And,

667
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:04,282
this matter

668
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:05,402
ends with me.

669
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:16,002
Ms. Gu.

670
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:17,402
Thanks.

671
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,282
Why are you still working?

672
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,472
I have to wait for Penny's approval
after proofreading it

673
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:23,760
before I can send it to the clients.

674
00:37:23,762 --> 00:37:25,442
I can't clock out
until the feature is published.

675
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:27,882
Penny loves to exploit people,
just like Jacqueline.

676
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:30,802
I know Jacqueline

677
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,992
was harsh with her words today.

678
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:32,882
Don't take it to heart.

679
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:34,241
I'm fine.

680
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:36,442
My script isn't that urgent anyway.

681
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,520
We can discuss it next time.

682
00:37:38,184 --> 00:37:40,792
Why don't I discuss it with you
through the phone on my way back?

683
00:37:41,816 --> 00:37:43,470
But you have to
look after yourself, okay?

684
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:43,962
See you.

685
00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:54,482
I was climbing the stairs just now.

686
00:37:55,362 --> 00:37:56,482
I'm almost home.

687
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,282
You should go inside.

688
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:57,721
Alright.

689
00:37:57,922 --> 00:37:58,762
Stay safe.

690
00:38:00,744 --> 00:38:01,960
Is there someone beside you?

691
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:03,521
There's a spirit.

692
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:05,641
Give me a moment.

693
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:10,002
Are you doing falcon-training?
Why aren't you asleep yet?

694
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:12,081
I was waiting for you to get home.

695
00:38:13,402 --> 00:38:14,802
Can you speak with a nicer tone?

696
00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:16,402
Sure.

697
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:20,561
Mr. Xu,

698
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:21,842
I've reached home.

699
00:38:22,376 --> 00:38:23,704
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

700
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:24,561
Okay.

701
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:26,002
Sleep early, then.

702
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:27,002
Good night.

703
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:28,241
I'll hang up now.

704
00:38:28,241 --> 00:38:28,802
Goodbye.

705
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:50,161
Door unlocked.

706
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,041
Liang Daiwen?

707
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:30,442
Liang Daiwen?

708
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:33,721
Liang Daiwen?

709
00:39:40,762 --> 00:39:41,641
Liang Daiwen,

710
00:39:43,402 --> 00:39:44,762
although you're asleep

711
00:39:45,362 --> 00:39:47,002
and you can't keep
staring at the camera,

712
00:39:48,962 --> 00:39:50,922
I still feel safe.

713
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,681
I feel like my sleep quality
has improved

714
00:39:56,362 --> 00:39:58,442
after you installed the CCTV.

715
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,282
I can't help but to come out

716
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:04,962
and check if you're still here.

717
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:09,721
The CCTV isn't as good as WeChat.

718
00:40:10,362 --> 00:40:11,561
And, you'll only get to see me

719
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:13,161
at random moments.

720
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:17,721
This is what you call
a reverse check-in, I guess.

721
00:40:26,962 --> 00:40:27,721
Liang Daiwen,

722
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:33,002
actually, I felt upset

723
00:40:34,442 --> 00:40:35,721
when I moved out of your house.

724
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:41,802
And, I felt awkward when you ignored me

725
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:43,922
when I was on stage.

726
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,842
Xu Guanrui said I was
soft-hearted toward you.

727
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:53,161
I guess he's right.

728
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:55,922
I don't know either.

729
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:00,161
Maybe I have no way

730
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:01,882
to be angry at you for real.

731
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:06,601
Say,

732
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:10,402
why do people always have expectations

733
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:11,681
for the impossibility?

734
00:41:15,962 --> 00:41:17,482
Is it because

735
00:41:19,962 --> 00:41:22,041
they like something so much
that they can't give up on it?

736
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:26,521
Stop being dramatic.

737
00:41:26,856 --> 00:41:27,560
Just go to sleep.

738
00:41:27,976 --> 00:41:29,576
We still need to play squash tomorrow.

739
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:33,362
Why are you still eavesdropping on me
even when you're sleeping?

740
00:41:35,336 --> 00:41:36,504
Don't simply go anywhere.

741
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:37,962
I'm on duty 24/7.

742
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:42,721
Alright, then.

743
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:47,161
Good night.

744
00:42:04,362 --> 00:42:05,362
Mom!

745
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:06,521
Mom!

746
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:09,681
I thought we were playing tennis.

747
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,200
I'll let you guys experience

748
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,144
the most popular sport for influencers
at the moment.

749
00:42:13,144 --> 00:42:14,440
How can you play in that getup of yours?

750
00:42:15,352 --> 00:42:16,792
I just finished
meeting a client just now.

751
00:42:17,482 --> 00:42:18,482
My trial live stream is soon.

752
00:42:18,504 --> 00:42:20,152
Even so, I didn't bring
my motion capture suit here.

753
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:21,081
Get yourselves ready.

754
00:42:25,201 --> 00:42:26,601
How can he play in that getup?

755
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:29,081
I don't know either.

756
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:30,762
I'm the same.

757
00:42:31,922 --> 00:42:33,121
You have work later.

758
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:34,442
But he just got off work.

759
00:42:35,784 --> 00:42:36,920
Just let them enjoy themselves.

760
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,040
Be careful. Don't get a sprain.

761
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:38,472
Okay.

762
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:45,201
What are you doing?

763
00:42:46,282 --> 00:42:46,802
What's wrong?

764
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:49,040
People will see your bite mark.

765
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:51,521
I'm not scared.

766
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,922

an eccentric personality.)
