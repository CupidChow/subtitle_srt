=Episode 19=

25
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:50,532
Relax!

26
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:52,013
You're already anesthetized.

27
00:01:52,332 --> 00:01:52,853
Relax.

28
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:53,812
It won't hurt.

29
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:57,013
Relax.

30
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:01,732
Relax.

31
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:03,372
Calm down.

32
00:02:18,212 --> 00:02:19,413
You only lost half a tooth.

33
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:20,850
You just need to get a dental implant.

34
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:26,584
How much does it cost?

35
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:29,573
That'll cost around
6,000 to 15,000 yuan.

36
00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:31,452
It's that expensive?

37
00:02:32,212 --> 00:02:33,013
It's that expensive?

38
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:35,932
Different materials

39
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:36,973
have different prices.

40
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,813
She's asking you if you could

41
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:45,093
reattach this tooth somehow.

42
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,652
This way, she can
save on material costs.

43
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:48,413
Stop joking around.

44
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:49,492
Stop joking around.

45
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:52,413
Since I was the cause,

46
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:54,088
I'll bear the responsibility.

47
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:56,888
That's right. He'll pay the bill.

48
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:11,212
Your dishes are ready.

49
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:32,216
We're strangers sharing the same table?

50
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,480
I'm the one who lost a tooth here.

51
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,680
Why are you being silent as well?

52
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:43,973
Talk to me.

53
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:45,490
How could we have

54
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,192
nothing to talk about
when we're facing each other?

55
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,512
I was afraid that you

56
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:52,952
might not want to open your mouth.

57
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,253
Stop blaming yourself.

58
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:01,332
I'm not angry at you.

59
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:02,332
Here.

60
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:03,130
Have some meat.

61
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,328
I'll make a wrap for you.

62
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:06,373
I...

63
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:08,573
This is how

64
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:09,853
we eat in northeast.

65
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:12,093
We like to make wraps.

66
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:13,610
One wrap with one bite.

67
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:16,212
Here.

68
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:16,852
I...

69
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:18,652
You...

70
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:19,972
Have you washed your hands?

71
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:22,373
I have.

72
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:24,290
Besides, a robot like you

73
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:25,852
who knows nothing
about the ways of the world

74
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,212
should be infected by an easygoing human

75
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:29,933
like me.

76
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,133
It can boost your immunity.

77
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:32,613
Eat up.

78
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:47,373
How is it?

79
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:48,173
Is it nice?

80
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:30,373
You're pretty good
at caring for someone.

81
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,892
How did you get alexithymia, then?

82
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:38,733
I don't really remember

83
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:39,892
the details.

84
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:44,536
I only remember
that I was mischievous when I was young.

85
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:46,852
My mother sent me to art lessons

86
00:05:47,832 --> 00:05:49,416
so that I could learn how to be quiet.

87
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:53,373
She passed away

88
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:55,733
not long after that.

89
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:01,613
Since then, I've become very rebellious.

90
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:03,493
I skipped school,

91
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:05,336
handed empty test papers,

92
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:07,212
and fought with hooligans.

93
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,040
My father was very busy.

94
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:11,292
He had no time for me.

95
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:14,200
And, he felt that he couldn't
communicate with me.

96
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:18,053
He sent me to a boarding school.

97
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:22,088
I scaled the wall
and ran away from the school.

98
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:24,970
He searched for me everywhere.

99
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:26,733
When he found me,

100
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:28,092
I was at the cemetery.

101
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,133
I confided in my mother's grave.

102
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:36,613
I don't really remember

103
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:39,613
what I said.

104
00:06:43,412 --> 00:06:44,452
I only remember

105
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:46,712
that it was snowing back then.

106
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:49,000
It was very cold.

107
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:55,933
My father came and slapped me,

108
00:06:57,412 --> 00:06:58,733
but I couldn't feel anything.

109
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:04,010
I don't remember much
of what happened before.

110
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:13,933
Liang Daiwen, it's fine.

111
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,650
If you can't remember the past,

112
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,776
let's just not think about it.

113
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,013
Now,

114
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:21,173
you're capable
of exhibiting simple emotions.

115
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:24,092
You're recovering gradually.

116
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:26,412
Everything will get better.

117
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:52,053
This is for you.

118
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:55,452
This tooth represents my courage
and determination.

119
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:57,133
It can serve as a reminder

120
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,570
of the physical and mental blow

121
00:07:58,613 --> 00:07:59,892
I had to endure just to fancy you.

122
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:01,332

146
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:33,013
Hello?

147
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:35,772
I said that it was a draft.

148
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:38,973
I did it as per your request.

149
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:40,900
You extended your contract with us.

150
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:41,992
I'll resolve the issue for you.

151
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:45,013
Impossible.

152
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,853
I already guessed that this would happen

153
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:49,770
when you told me to sign the contract.

154
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:52,373
It doesn't matter.

155
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:53,692
We're even now.

156
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:55,052
Liang Daiwen,

157
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:56,930
are you willing to ruin your reputation

158
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,412
in order to stay away from me?

159
00:10:59,172 --> 00:10:59,812
What's your reason?

160
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:01,320
Have you already joined another company?

161
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,770
Or are you serious about Gu Yi?

162
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:07,304
This is none of your business.

163
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,050
This is none of my business indeed.

164
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:10,373
Great, then.

165
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:13,213
Roger doesn't like Gu Yi either.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,248
What are you trying to do?

167
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:19,652
Nothing.

168
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:21,050
I want to keep you in the company.

169
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,858
(Gu Yi: Liang Daiwen, you blockhead.
Don't you intend to say anything?)

170
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,093
This has nothing to do with Gu Yi.

171
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:34,453
She's unrelated to me.

172
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,373
You don't need
to waste your time on her.

173
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,213
Is that so?

174
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:42,253
I heard that Gu Yi had a rough time
in Nextmonday.

175
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:45,208
She would've been fired long ago
had it not been for Jacqueline.

176
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:47,176
The reputation
you're trying to ruin here,

177
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:48,920
do you think she'll desire it?

178
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:57,996
(Gu Yi: Fine. I'll say it if you don't
want to. Are we in a relationship now?)

179
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:02,572
I don't care about her.

180
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:07,013
She's just a bet I made with Shen.

181
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,152
(Gu Yi: Tell me when you reach home.
I'll wait for you.)

Don't you intend to say anything?)

00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:50,373
Sorry.

187
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:53,093
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

188
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:54,892
Please try again later.

189
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,896
(Fine. I'll say it if you don't want to.
Are we in a relationship now?)

190
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,692
Coming.

191
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,172
Buddy,

192
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:47,812
this is a counseling center, you know?

193
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,768
But I have to open my center
earlier than breakfast shops.

194
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:51,013
Does this even make sense?

195
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,288
You previously suggested that I should
go abroad for counseling therapy.

196
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:54,333
Can you arrange for it?

197
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:56,692
Arrange it for me

198
00:13:57,373 --> 00:13:58,052
if it's possible.

199
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,080
As soon as possible.

200
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:02,692
Counseling therapy, huh?

201
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:05,493
I've tried to persuade you
on numerous occasions.

202
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:06,453
You never agreed to it.

203
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:08,296
Why do you want to attend it
all of a sudden?

204
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:14,056
In the past,
there was no one I cared about.

205
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,632
But now, there's someone I care about.

206
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:29,692
The branch publication focuses mainly
on affordable luxury fashion.

207
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:33,009
The target audience
is working female adults

208
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,088
between the ages of 20 and 40.

209
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,532
Most people just quickly
skim through it with a glance.

210
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:39,253
So you must prioritize the key points
with your layout.

211
00:14:39,772 --> 00:14:41,412
Look at what you're doing right now.

212
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:43,013
You need to redo it.

213
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:43,412
Understood?

214
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:45,853
Ms. Zhang.

215
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:46,904
What are you doing here?

216
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:47,932
What's going on?

217
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,232
Since when was Gu Yi in charge
of the branch publication's layout?

218
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:51,853
That's not it.

219
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,093
The issue will be published soon.

220
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:55,812
I'm asking Gu Yi for a favor here.

221
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:57,850
You can find someone else for now.

222
00:14:58,052 --> 00:15:00,572
HF Design Company has a negotiation
with Bvlgari today.

223
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:01,572
Gu Yi should join me.

224
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:04,172
Didn't you tell me

225
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:05,973
to join you before?

226
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:08,664
The issue for the branch publication
will be published soon.

227
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:09,352
You should finish it.

228
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:09,892
Gu Yi,

229
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:10,729
hurry and finish it.

230
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,880
We'll depart in an hour.

231
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:12,613
Roger that.

232
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:16,892
Sorry about that.

233
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:18,172
I can't help you out now.

234
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:21,610
Send the revised draft to my email.

235
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:29,052
She deserves it.

236
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:31,292
Who told her to flaunt her superiority?

237
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:32,493
Precisely.

238
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:34,652
Yi,

239
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:36,052
so,

240
00:15:36,424 --> 00:15:37,770
what company did she mention just now?

241
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:38,532
HF Design Company.

242
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,093
What's that?

243
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:43,853
It's a seminar focused on
the latest developments in the industry.

244
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:45,769
You can see it

245
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,672
as an investment conference
with a touch of fashion.

246
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:51,572
Is this fashionable?

247
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,812
I'm just toothless.

248
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,412
What's wrong, Ms. Zhang?

249
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:23,892
What's your relationship
with Zhang Qingya?

250
00:16:24,892 --> 00:16:26,253
She designated you to write the scripts.

251
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:27,890
She even designated me to take you

252
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:29,093
for the seminar.

253
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,172
And, our client is also Zhang Qingya?

254
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:36,584
This seminar is held by
HF Design Company.

255
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:37,692
By the way,

256
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:39,572
you have to pay more attention later.

257
00:16:39,672 --> 00:16:40,712
Don't commit any blunders.

258
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,639
(HF Design Company)

259
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,880
(Premium custom design services)

260
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,792
Register your name there.

261
00:16:58,853 --> 00:16:59,493
Look for me later.

262
00:16:59,692 --> 00:16:59,973
Okay.

263
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:01,892
Hello and welcome.
Please sign your attendance.

264
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,132
(Zhang Qingya)

265
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,292
Hello and welcome.
Please sign your attendance.

266
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:33,173
Who's that guy?

267
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:34,973
He's so good-looking.

268
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:36,092
You're right.

269
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:38,173
Not only is he good-looking,

270
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:39,612
but he also has a domineering aura.

271
00:18:25,453 --> 00:18:26,253
Shut up.

272
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:29,532
Stop fawning over him.

273
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:30,812
Record the seminar's content.

274
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:32,968
Organize it into
a written draft for me later.

275
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:35,372
Understood.

276
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:39,332
Hello, Mr. Liang.

277
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:40,933
I'm a reporter from Zhiqu Magazine.

278
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,253
We saw that your products
were also on display today.

279
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,893
Can you please share

280
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,413
your current aesthetic concept with us?

281
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,290
There's no concept to speak of.

282
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,092
I'm only fulfilling the needs

283
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,493
of our clients.

284
00:18:57,672 --> 00:19:00,050
Someone who can spend millions
of dollars on a piece of furniture

285
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,092
must surely live in a huge house.

286
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,493
They must have a courtyard by the sea
and live near the riverside landscape.

287
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,092
They have everything in the world.

288
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,893
There's no need for
any aesthetic concept.

289
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:15,812
Are you saying
that aesthetic concept doesn't matter?

290
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,872
The smallest unit in high-end apartments
is a one-bedroom, one-living room unit

291
00:19:20,888 --> 00:19:22,080
with an area of 180 square meters.

292
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:24,013
At least two walls
are made of glass windows.

293
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,332
The lighting and views
are impeccable.

294
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:27,852
High-end real estate

295
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:29,253
emphasizes Feng Shui,

296
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:30,413
orientation,

297
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:31,173
and layout.

298
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:33,132
But in reality,

299
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:35,210
luxury cars occupy
the sidewalk for the disabled,

300
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:36,852
and the accessible elevator
is shut down.

301
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:38,812
The so-called aesthetic concept

302
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:43,013
is just an uneven allocation
of resources.

303
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,532
If so, what is the underlying concept

304
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:50,052
behind your creation this time?

305
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:51,052
Functionality.

306
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:54,013
The majority of the space is
occupied by the minority.

307
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:56,410
The space for people with disabilities
is occupied by healthy people.

308
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:57,733
Sorry, guys.

309
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:59,893
That's all for the current interview.

310
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:02,332
If any of you still have any questions,

311
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:04,493
you guys may contact
our crew in private.

312
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:06,453
Thank you, everyone.
Please take a break.

313
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:06,933
Wait a moment.

314
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,812
What did Mr. Liang mean by that?

315
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:09,693
Can you give us an answer?

316
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:11,852
Mr. Liang wishes to take a break.

317
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:13,852
He'll answer all of your questions
after the break.

318
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,013
Did something happen to Mr. Liang?

319
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:17,092
He's fine. He just needs a break.

320
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,904
Liang Daiwen, you're digging
your own grave here,

321
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:19,733
you know?

322
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,090
Are you disregarding everything else

323
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,928
just so you can terminate
your contract with me?

324
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:25,933
I'll tell you this one last time.

325
00:20:26,152 --> 00:20:28,410
Once people find out that you
plagiarized other people's design,

326
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,653
it'll stain your reputation for life.

327
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:32,092
No one would ever hire

328
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,493
a designer like you again.

329
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:35,812
Today's your last chance.

330
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:37,693
If you fall out with me,

331
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,480
I won't bear the responsibility
on your behalf again.

332
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:16,132
I can publish a notice on your behalf.

333
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:18,824
It can clarify that you requested
a contract termination before this.

334
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:21,240
You didn't plagiarize
other people, right?

335
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:25,112
It doesn't matter
if I plagiarize other people or not.

336
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:26,973
Nobody cares anyway.

337
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,612
I care.

338
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:30,572
People who care about you will care.

339
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:32,973
Gu Yi.

340
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,893
I just wish to do the things
I desire as soon as possible.

341
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:38,893
This is the quickest way.

342
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:42,852
Do not stand up for me.

343
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:46,132
What kind of stupid logic is that?

344
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:47,653
Even an idiot knows that they need

345
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:49,292
to use the law
to defend themselves from slander.

346
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:51,092
She's framing you,

347
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:52,493
yet you're not resisting at all?

348
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,080
I still have an interview to attend.

349
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:11,173
Hello, Mr. Liang.

350
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,904
(Youjia Design)
I'm a reporter from Youjia Design.

351
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:13,612
Rumor has it

352
00:22:13,653 --> 00:22:15,852
that you plagiarized
the lead designer of Finch.

353
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:17,092
Can you give us a response to that?

354
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:23,256
Mr. Liang, is it inconvenient
for you to answer the question?

355
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:36,170
Regarding that matter,

356
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,672
it's because I wasn't capable enough.

357
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:41,733
Mr. Liang, are you admitting
that you did plagiarize him?

358
00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:43,052
May I ask if your previous works

359
00:22:43,092 --> 00:22:45,413
also involve elements of plagiarism?

360
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:47,169
Mr. Liang, were your previous works

361
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,648
in the competitions
actual original works?

362
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:50,653
- Mr. Liang.
- Mr. Liang.

363
00:24:10,052 --> 00:24:11,213
Why did you admit to it?

364
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:14,173
Zhang Qingya was the one
who didn't want to let you go.

365
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,653
She set you up because she wanted you
to extend the contract.

366
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:18,330
You didn't plagiarize anyone.

367
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:18,893
Why didn't you...

368
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:19,852
You look so pretty today.

369
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:26,612
Liang Daiwen,

370
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:29,693
what's wrong with you today?

371
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:40,693
I've received the texts you sent me.

372
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:44,453
I didn't reply to you

373
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:46,933
because I needed time to consider it.

374
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:49,052
Now, I've made up my mind.

375
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:52,653
Gu Yi,

376
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:56,296
I can't provide you
with the relationship you desire.

377
00:24:57,693 --> 00:24:58,973
Let's remain as friends.

378
00:25:05,893 --> 00:25:07,332
Why did you say you fancied me, then?

379
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:09,410
What did you mean by that?

380
00:25:09,973 --> 00:25:11,092
Did you use me to pass the time?

381
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:13,453
Am I just an experiment?

382
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:18,693
Sorry.

383
00:25:22,852 --> 00:25:24,013
I had a rough time every day

384
00:25:24,013 --> 00:25:25,013
ever since I got to know you.

385
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:27,453
Stomach aches,

386
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,213
sleepwalking,

387
00:25:31,173 --> 00:25:31,812
even anorexia.

388
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:34,812
There are many emotions
that I'm unsure of.

389
00:25:35,893 --> 00:25:37,493
I cannot understand your emotions.

390
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:40,250
Unlike Yu Dule, I don't have
any chemistry with you.

391
00:25:41,052 --> 00:25:42,852
I can't cheer you up
like Xu Guanrui can.

392
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:44,852
I need to learn and imitate

393
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:46,292
the things that you guys
can do since birth

394
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:47,693
one step at a time.

395
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:50,772
My logic is telling me

396
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,104
that I shouldn't let you
misunderstand me anymore.

397
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:02,532
Liang Daiwen,

398
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:07,612
what have I done wrong

399
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:09,532
for you

400
00:26:09,812 --> 00:26:11,292
to become more of a robot
and harder

401
00:26:11,332 --> 00:26:12,132
to communicate?

402
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:17,612
I never changed.

403
00:26:20,296 --> 00:26:21,928
You were the one
who thought I could change.

404
00:26:26,812 --> 00:26:27,572
Liang Daiwen,

405
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:32,292
is alexithymia your shield?

406
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:36,013
You wag your tail and act pitiful
when you require attention.

407
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,092
You say that you can't feel anything
when you don't need any.

408
00:26:38,136 --> 00:26:40,104
You say that everything is
just a misunderstanding.

409
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,493
What am I supposed to do

410
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:44,693
for you to give me a definite answer?

411
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:50,332
I don't care whether
the ending is good or not!

412
00:26:50,812 --> 00:26:52,332
I just want to ask you this.

413
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:58,653
Do you truly fancy me?

414
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:16,693
Plenty of people fancy you.

415
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,330
Even if I leave now,

416
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,852
someone new will replace me soon.

417
00:27:42,776 --> 00:27:43,490
That's right.

418
00:27:48,453 --> 00:27:49,852
Love is a balancing act indeed.

419
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,733
- Hi, Ms. Zhang.
- Goodbye.

420
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:15,612
Do it.

421
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:45,733
Gu Yi, put your work aside for now.

422
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:46,920
Follow me to the meeting room.

423
00:29:47,013 --> 00:29:47,973
Boya Investment is here.

424
00:29:48,772 --> 00:29:48,973
Huh?

425
00:29:50,132 --> 00:29:51,092
Boya Investment.

426
00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:52,332
Follow me to the meeting room.

427
00:29:53,612 --> 00:29:55,213
Only the two of us?
Isn't Jacqueline joining us?

428
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,970
You finally got a dental implant, huh?

429
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:01,572
Stop grinning. Hurry up.

430
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,370
Ms. Zhang just left the office
for business purposes.

431
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:05,132
It's an exclusive interview
for HF Design Company.

432
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:06,090
The personnel from Boya

433
00:30:06,328 --> 00:30:07,656
designated you for the interview.

434
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:10,253
Let's go.

435
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:13,013
Hurry up.

436
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,080
(Meeting Room)

437
00:30:29,973 --> 00:30:30,532
I understand.

438
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:33,332
You need an exclusive interview
for HF Design Company.

439
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,170
It's about Liang Daiwen being kicked out
of the industry due to plagiarism.

440
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:38,893
Ms. Zhang, don't worry.

441
00:30:39,016 --> 00:30:40,488
We'll definitely point out his flaws.

442
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:42,824
Why must you say
that he committed plagiarism?

443
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:45,530
What has this got to do
with HF Design Company's interview?

444
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:49,332
I'm paying you guys for the ads.

445
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:51,852
I'm not here to discuss
our content with you.

446
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:53,893
That's right.

447
00:30:54,893 --> 00:30:55,413
Ms. Zhang,

448
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:58,413
Nextmonday has
our own content attributes.

449
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,693
Such exaggerated criticisms

450
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,440
do not align
with the theme of interview.

451
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,733
Denouncing plagiarism

452
00:31:05,768 --> 00:31:07,752
is a protection of intellectual property
and a counterattack

453
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:09,572
against poor creative practices
in the industry.

454
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:10,824
Is there an issue with that?

455
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:11,453
No.

456
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,512
I have no issue with that.
But I can't write it for you.

457
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:16,493
It's because Liang Daiwen
didn't commit plagiarism.

458
00:31:20,332 --> 00:31:21,812
May I speak with Gu Yi in private?

459
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:26,013
Of course. Go ahead.

460
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:36,572
Writing sarcastic content

461
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:37,733
should be your expertise.

462
00:31:38,536 --> 00:31:39,064
What's wrong?

463
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:41,372
You can't do it
when it's Liang Daiwen, huh?

464
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:44,893
Ms. Zhang,

465
00:31:46,413 --> 00:31:47,532
you shouldn't do this to him.

466
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:51,453
Gu Yi,

467
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,532
do you think you're standing up for him?

468
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:57,530
Do you think Liang Daiwen
will appreciate your effort?

469
00:31:58,488 --> 00:32:00,536
Have you ever considered why
he wanted to terminate

470
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,720
the contract with me urgently?

471
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:04,812
He's not just dumping me.
He's dumping you too.

472
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:08,232
Do you know
that he'll be going overseas soon?

473
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:13,653
Seems like you have no idea.

474
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:15,933
According to what I know,

475
00:32:16,493 --> 00:32:17,409
Liang Daiwen has

476
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,648
received Souxun's offer letter.

477
00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:25,730
I only know
that he didn't commit plagiarism.

478
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:27,928
That's the only thing
you're saying, huh?

479
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:29,852
You're just a bet

480
00:32:30,572 --> 00:32:32,092
made by him

481
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:33,292
and his psychiatrist.

482
00:32:36,493 --> 00:32:37,132
What do you mean?

483
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:39,772
What do I mean?

484
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,052
Why don't you ask him yourself?

485
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:43,372
But I think he should be

486
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:44,572
on his way to the airport.

487
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:46,856
You'll miss out on him
if you're one step late.

488
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,453
Where are you?

489
00:33:04,052 --> 00:33:04,812
I'm at the airport.

490
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:06,653
Don't move. I'll go and find you.

491
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:19,572
Gu Yi, what's wrong?

492
00:34:31,132 --> 00:34:32,293
Why are you leaving?

493
00:34:34,344 --> 00:34:35,720
I have something urgent to handle.

494
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,368
Something very urgent.

495
00:34:39,732 --> 00:34:40,933
You're going overseas, right?

496
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:43,493
How long will you be away?
Will you come back?

497
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:50,013
Fine. I'll stop asking you.

498
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:52,472
It's fine that you don't want
to tell me about it.

499
00:34:54,252 --> 00:34:55,773
Can you take me with you, then?

500
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,013
Gu Yi.

501
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:05,172
Don't do this.

502
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:11,092
Liang Daiwen,

503
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:13,973
don't leave me just like that.

504
00:35:18,893 --> 00:35:19,413
Even if...

505
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:23,333
I won't write
that you committed plagiarism.

506
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,572
It's fine even if I'm just a bet

507
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:26,893
made by you and your psychiatrist.

508
00:35:31,493 --> 00:35:32,973
It's fine if you fancy me

509
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:34,333
by accident.

510
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:39,092

You're heading to Dalian instead?

the offer letter.

isn't good enough for you.

00:38:10,132 --> 00:38:10,933
Rumor has it

548
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:12,773
that you plagiarized
the lead designer of Finch.

549
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,490
Regarding that matter,

550
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,832
it's because I wasn't capable enough.

551
00:38:20,413 --> 00:38:21,293
I need a scene

552
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,572
that even Zhang Qingya cannot handle.

553
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:24,252
For tomorrow's exchange,

554
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,008
I will admit silently
that I committed plagiarism.

555
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:27,252
Prepare the article in advance.

556
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:28,853
Post it right after the exchange.

557
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:32,853
Do it.

558
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:35,410
It's best if influencers
post the article.

559
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:37,373
Nextmonday's posting speed

560
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:39,096
is inferior to the netizens'.

561
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,920
They have to post it before Nextmonday.

562
00:38:42,132 --> 00:38:43,732
Gu Yi can stay safe as long as

563
00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:45,612
she doesn't take up the task.

564
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:50,264
According to my understanding
of Ms. Zhang,

565
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:52,413
HF Design Company
will terminate my contract

566
00:38:53,013 --> 00:38:54,373
after Gu Yi's article is posted.

567
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,630
They'll wait until
the situation is exaggerated

568
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:58,530
before coming out to clarify
that I didn't plagiarize.

569
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:00,652
Nextmonday will be implicated
for no apparent reason.

570
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,570
After that, Boya can withdraw

571
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,252
their investment officially.

572
00:39:04,973 --> 00:39:07,333
Using the editor as a scapegoat
is common if one offends their client.

573
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,893
But Boya is our client.

574
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,092
I have no reason to refuse their deal.

575
00:39:12,572 --> 00:39:13,413
You don't need to.

576
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,488
Just drag it out until HF Design Company
terminates my contract.

577
00:39:17,572 --> 00:39:19,172
Once articles of my plagiarism are out,

578
00:39:19,272 --> 00:39:21,352
the heated responses
will force them to express their stand.

579
00:39:21,624 --> 00:39:23,290
You hired someone
to post the article yourself.

580
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:26,344
If your contract gets terminated,
it'll confirm the rumors, you know?

581
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,296
Don't you care about
your reputation at all?

582
00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:31,013
I just want Gu Yi to stay out of it.

and turn into an emotionless person.

589
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:12,293
Because of you,

590
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:16,856
I started to develop an interest
in my surroundings.

591
00:40:18,813 --> 00:40:19,732
I started to dream.

592
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,293

the colors of the world.
