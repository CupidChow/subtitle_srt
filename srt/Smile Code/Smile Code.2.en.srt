26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,060
(Interview transcript about
independent musician Xu Guanrui)

27
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:19,790
You've met too many
handsome guys lately.

28
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,080
I didn't get a chance to ask you
when you brought him here last time.

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,950
Who is that guy?

30
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:25,230
I didn't bring him here.

31
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:27,311
Jacqueline told me to interview him.

32
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,690
By the way,

33
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,209
if you see him in the audience again,

34
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,390
remind me.

35
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,471
Why?

36
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,489
Are you worried
your supervisor will find out?

37
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,910
Obviously.

38
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,910
Do you know who Jacqueline is?

39
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,850
She's the type who grills you

40
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:41,250
about what you do in your free time

41
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:43,070
during the interview.

42
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,670
Well,

43
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:49,010
did Liang Daiwen get the ticket

44
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:50,431
for today's audience lottery?

45
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,790
Who?

46
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,991
That stand-up assassin in the front row.

47
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,431
I met him for an interview
in my supplement.

48
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,271
You met him?

49
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:02,471
For an interview.

50
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,271
I see. I almost thought your progress

51
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,790
was way too fast.

52
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,130
He is

53
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:12,230
a furniture designer,

54
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:14,871
but he's a humanoid robot deep down.

55
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:18,151
Not only did he not laugh at my jokes,

56
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,151
but he also sent me off

57
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,649
before I could even finish

58
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,871
the interview earlier today.

59
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:26,070
Can you even believe this?

60
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,970
I told you not to fall in love
with the audience,

61
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:29,769
but you wouldn't listen.

62
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,910
Now you're paying the price.

63
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,471
You won't know yet.

64
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,230
Before I left, I told him

65
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:38,510
we'd meet again at Ounce.

66
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,991
Put me the last to perform tonight.

67
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,940
Are you bossing me around?

68
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,480
Do you think he'd show up just because
you said so? Who do you think you are?

69
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,630
Speak of the devil.

70
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:08,510
I told you.

71
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:09,711
See?

72
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:12,471
I must

73
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,950
pull it off well tonight.

74
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,950
That's not important.

75
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:19,231
What's important is,
why he's in the front row again.

76
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:20,490
Yeah.

77
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:21,710
Why?

78
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,351
Gu Yi.

79
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:29,849
Gu Yi.

80
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,690
Not me.

81
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:31,630
Gu Yi.

82
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,289
Not me.

83
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,849
Gu Yi, you did it on purpose.

84
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,610
You...

85
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:36,871
Gu Yi, you did it on purpose.

86
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,169
Hi, everyone. I'm Gu Yi!

87
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,710
Hi!

88
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,950
Before we start, a quick question.

89
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:58,630
Who here rents a place?

90
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,169
Me!

91
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,390
So many hands up.

92
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,490
I rent, too.

93
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:06,470
A shared apartment.

94
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,490
Thirty-seven square meters,
including the public area.

95
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:09,991
When I open the door,
it hits the wall across.

96
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,089
This is how

97
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,991
I enter the room.

98
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,270
I open the door

99
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,911
like this.

100
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,231
Yes.

101
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,510
I'm like a hermit crab.

102
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,551
I'm now living with a female housemate.

103
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,671
She likes playing with sand in her room.

104
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,250
She says

105
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:29,630
she does sand baths and hot yoga.

106
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,050
One day, I passed by her room

107
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:33,250
and saw her

108
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,890
rolling around in a tub

109
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:36,351
full of sand.

110
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,871
I thought

111
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:39,570
it shouldn't be wasted,

112
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:40,890
so I bought a bag of chestnuts

113
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:41,991
and threw them in.

114
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,590
Bravo!

115
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,390
I have two other male housemates.

116
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:52,830
They share a bedroom.

117
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:56,150
One of them is learning Japanese.

118
00:05:56,691 --> 00:06:00,231
He's been at it for six months,
but all he's got so far is "Bakayaro".

119
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,590
The other guy loves flirting

120
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,431
with any girl he sees.

121
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,150
Strangely, they hit it off.

122
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:10,791
One of them says,

123
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,830
"Come over to my place tonight,"

124
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:15,431
and the other goes, "Bakayaro."

125
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,791
You lost again.

126
00:06:35,051 --> 00:06:36,510
A total failure.

127
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:39,390
I really don't understand.

128
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,351
Why didn't he laugh?

129
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,551
Why?

130
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,991
What why?

131
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:46,470
Do you think

132
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,610
he looks like someone
who'd live in a shared apartment?

133
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:49,390
Right?

134
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:51,111
He's probably a rich guy.

135
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:53,649
That's why he wouldn't get to the jokes

136
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,890
about your tiny little house.

137
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:55,950
Fair enough.

138
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,510
Fair enough?

139
00:06:58,131 --> 00:06:59,791
I've been in stand-up for years.

140
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:00,969
He's the first one

141
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,751
who put me to shame.

142
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,390
What do you want, then?

143
00:07:05,611 --> 00:07:07,050
I want to burn out
his central mechanism.

144
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:07,830
What?

145
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,311
I want to burn out
his central mechanism.

146
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,111
She wants to burn out
your central mechanism.

Someone interviewed me,

150
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,111
but I don't want to answer
the same question again.

153
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:57,351
Did you come here

154
00:07:58,051 --> 00:08:00,311
just to give me this?

155
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,390
There are two things.

156
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:04,270
First,

157
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:08,911
you seemed upset on that day.

158
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,270
I put some tissues in your bag.

159
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:15,991
Don't forget to check it.

160
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:17,551
Second,

161
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,969
even though you were upset,

162
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,590
you shouldn't have sat
on my sample sofa.

163
00:08:23,131 --> 00:08:24,231
That's the exhibition area,

164
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,950
not IKEA.

165
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,390
That's it.

166
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:34,350
Wait.

167
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,511
Well,

168
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:41,791
may I ask something?

169
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,689
You

170
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,710
didn't laugh again.

171
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,311
Was my joke really that bad?

172
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,311
Whether I laugh or not

173
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:54,350
matters to you?

174
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,391
Of course.

175
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,169
When an audience doesn't laugh,

176
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,551
that's the greatest humiliation
to a stand-up comedian.

177
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:01,769
Otherwise,

178
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,911
why are you at Ounce?

179
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,710

(Demographic research on Gen Z)

209
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,311
What's the upcoming topic
on the public account?

210
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,090
This time, I'm preparing

211
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,769
demographic research on Gen Z.

212
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,130
I've contacted an illustrator
for the long illustration.

213
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:21,070
Elaborate on it.

214
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:24,289
Now, China-chic,
Han clothing, ancient style,

215
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:24,850
JK style,

216
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,210
and fandom culture
have greatly integrated

217
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:27,911
into every community.

218
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:30,960
These concepts have monopolized the mainstream,
and their statistics show a promising future.

219
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,311
Where is Guan Xingxin?

220
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,911
Why?

221
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:41,289
Do you have no idea

222
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,110
where your new deputy director is?

223
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:47,870
Did you hold Nextmonday's topic meeting
just for me?

224
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,470
Since the day

225
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,271
she came for registration,

226
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,551
she hasn't shown up.

227
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,631
What can I say?

228
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,750
This makes zero sense,

229
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,470
but it's still workable for the video.

230
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:16,769
All right.

231
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,631
Give me the payment.

232
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,271
What payment?
The client hasn't reviewed it yet.

233
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,610
Give Mr. Chen some time.

234
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:22,970
Try to rush him.

235
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:24,730
My time for the side hustle is precious,

236
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:25,490
okay?

237
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:26,271
Come on,

238
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,551
don't push me so hard.

239
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,730
His wife is here.

240
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,151
Why don't you go talk to him yourself?

241
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:31,710
Wow.

242
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:32,990
People around you are such a mess.

243
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,250
It's not like you're not part of it.

244
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:36,230
Of course not.

245
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:37,490
Don't lump me in with you.

246
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,551
I'm far away from you.

247
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,990
How far?

248
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:41,631
A thousand miles away.

249
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:42,791
Anyway,

250
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,191
I'm not part of you.

251
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,911
Layla's here.

252
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:01,250
She's in the lounge outside.

253
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:02,449
Try to stall her.

254
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,490
Why should I? I'm not doing that.

255
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:06,031
Do you want your payment?

256
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,850
Come on. Go. Please do me this favor.

257
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:09,970
I'm not interested in influencers, okay?

258
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:10,689
Do you think...

259
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,470
Just go.

260
00:13:58,851 --> 00:13:59,950
Thank you.

261
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,110
You're welcome.

262
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:03,230
You must be

263
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:04,791
Layla, right?

264
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:05,769
Pardon me.

265
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,950
I didn't know your real name.

266
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,070
Guan Xingxin.

267
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,230
How do you know I'm Layla?

268
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:14,289
Thanks to Mr. Chen,

269
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,110
a lot of people know you.

270
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:17,730
It's not

271
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,830
a secret.

272
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:21,990
Have we met before?

273
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,031
I don't think so.

274
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,590
My main job is ticketing,

275
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,110
and my side hustle is editing.

276
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,911
I only earn peanuts. We probably wouldn't
have the chance to meet.

277
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,529
This is our first meeting.

278
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,470
Did I ever offend you?

279
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,710
Why are you being sarcastic with me?

280
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,070
I'm not.

281
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,649
Well, someone's paying my wages,

282
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,710
so I'm here to guard the door.

283
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:45,511
If you want me to do the talking,
that'll be an extra charge.

284
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,911
Where is Chen Yijin?

285
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,610
He's probably

286
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:53,671
in one of the rooms.

287
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,551
Let me check for you.

288
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,130
If you want to order anything,

289
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:08,590
use this card.

290
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,090
If you want to go to any rooms,

291
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:11,449
use it as well.

292
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,230
It grants access to the entire building.

293
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:24,719
(Yu Dule)

294
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:45,911
Are you leaving?

295
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,590
No.

296
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,791
I didn't see any vacancies.

297
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:18,350
Is this seat

298
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:19,911
taken?

299
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:32,850
Accessibility design should adhere
to five main principles,

300
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:33,750
including,

301
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,070
environmental inclusivity,

302
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:36,311
accessibility,

303
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,590
integration design,

304
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:38,911
operability,

305
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,631
and perceptibility.

306
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:42,750
Let's take an elevator as an example.

307
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:45,500
In terms of environmental inclusivity,
it requires the designing of an elevator

308
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,791
to take the requests of different groups
into consideration.

309
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,470
First,

310
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:49,449
the space

311
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,830
should be spacious enough

312
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,529
for wheelchair users

313
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,929
or people with walking difficulties

314
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,890
to enter and operate the elevator
with ease.

315
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:56,649
Second,

316
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,809
the buttons should be
of an appropriate height

317
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,271
and should show understandable signs

318
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:04,130
for users of different heights
and visually impaired people.

319
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:05,570
As for accessibility,

320
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:06,290
it means

321
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,111
the elevator...

322
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,810
For example, install an entrance ramp

323
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:13,710
or wheelchair lanes.

324
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,489
Inside the elevator,

325
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,929
it should provide convenient grips,

326
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,631
handrails, and seats

327
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:22,191
for people who need support.

328
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:24,710
The control panel inside the elevator...

329
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:28,191
Can I borrow your notes?

330
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:57,790
It's nice.

331
00:17:59,131 --> 00:17:59,610
I mean

332
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,071
your handwriting is nice.

333
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,631
Appropriate size

334
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,310
and easy to press.

335
00:18:44,663 --> 00:18:49,193
(Chen Yijin)

336
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:56,842
(Chen Yijin)

337
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:26,683
(Yu Dule)

338
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,510
See you.

339
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:39,071
Wait.

340
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,911
Um...

341
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:46,831
This is my first time attending
a seminar like this.

342
00:19:47,371 --> 00:19:49,050
I'm not sure

343
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:50,671
if I did anything wrong.

344
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:53,030
What gives you that idea?

345
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,631
Because you seem unhappy.

346
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,950
It happened after I copied your notes.

347
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:03,631
You can tell

348
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,030
I'm unhappy?

349
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:09,770
If it's because I copied your notes

350
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:10,831
and disturbed you,

351
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,710
I'm truly sorry.

352
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:14,009
I didn't mean to disrespect

353
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,631
the accessibility design at all.

354
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:19,391
It's just that
this is pretty different from my field.

355
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:20,969
The seminar was

356
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,470
a bit dull for me.

357
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:25,310
I couldn't quite catch up with it.

358
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:27,391
No.

359
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,071
I'm just not feeling well.

360
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,310
My wrist hurts.

361
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:33,351
For taking too many notes?

362
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,631
A comedic setup?

363
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,249
Sorry.

364
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,191
I couldn't help it.

365
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,929
In stand-up comedy,

366
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,370
we don't call it a setup.

367
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:43,431
It's a foreshadowing joke.

368
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,710
I see.

369
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:53,310
Do you

370
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:55,550
drive?

371
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,431
Mr. Liang,

372
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:14,230
where are we going?

373
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,911
We'll send you home first.

374
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,480
I'll get a designated driver later.

375
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:20,591
There's no need for the hassle.

376
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:22,409
I'll drive you home,

377
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,871
then take a cab.

378
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:26,310
You once mentioned in your joke

379
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:27,391
that you needed money.

380
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,351
You were listening,

381
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,431
but you just wouldn't laugh.

382
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,850
Your jokes and the seminar

383
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:41,111
have no difference to me.

384
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:43,151
It's not your fault I couldn't laugh.

385
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,550
Thank you.

386
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:49,990
The explanation is good.

387
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,009
This is the greatest humiliation

388
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,591
for both comedies
and professional seminars.

389
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,750
You said the seminar was boring

390
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,649
because you're not

391
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,151
its target audience.

392
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,431
People with physical disabilities
of various degrees

393
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,431
and those who are losing mobility

394
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,230
are the real audience.

395
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:17,191
People with visual,

396
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,671
hearing,

397
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,631
behavioral or cognitive

398
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:24,111
impairments and deficits

399
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,591
rely on the guidance
of the public environment and facilities

400
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:28,191
to live comfortably.

401
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:32,550
Stand-up comedy is also a guide
for emotions.

402
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:33,990
Laughter

403
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,030
is the antidote for life.

404
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:38,391
People with sound emotions

405
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,671
are your audience.

406
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,770
So,

407
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:46,391
you're emotionally unsound?

408
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,209
If that helps you

409
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,431
stop struggling about
whether I laugh or not,

410
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,431
yes, I am.

411
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,671
Mr. Liang,

412
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,111
for stand-up comedians,

413
00:23:08,331 --> 00:23:10,550
laughter isn't the antidote for life.

414
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,391
Instead,

415
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:14,510
it's the painkiller of life.

416
00:23:43,851 --> 00:23:45,071
Are you performing later?

417
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,151
Ounce isn't just a theater,
it's also a bar.

418
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,850
You can find a designated driver there,

419
00:23:50,851 --> 00:23:52,191
and also my ride.

420
00:23:53,051 --> 00:23:53,770
By the way,

421
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:54,990
thanks for the tissues.

422
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:56,969
But don't put them in my bag next time.

423
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,310
Put them in my hands.

424
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,570
When I tell jokes,

425
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:02,591
I hope my jokes can land with my crowd.

426
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:03,871
It's the same with friends.

427
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:05,770
What friends really need

428
00:24:05,771 --> 00:24:07,510
is simple and straightforward.

429
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:08,750
Got it?

430
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,090
Excuse me, please send him back.
Thank you.

431
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:18,810
Sure, no problem.

432
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:19,591

Do you

456
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:26,671
have a glitch or something?

457
00:26:37,303 --> 00:26:39,923
(Say goodbye to shared rental)

(Shen Zhimin, Internationally Certified
Psychological Counselor)

459
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:48,631
Coming.

460
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,290
My goodness.

461
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,310
It's already late at night.

462
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,351
Something feels off.

463
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:01,191
I went to Ounce for the show

464
00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:02,330
and met a comedian there.

465
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:03,929
I couldn't laugh at any of her jokes.

466
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,030
We went to an accessibility design
seminar just now,

467
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:07,409
and my hand hurt.

468
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,710
Hold on.

469
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,550
Everything

470
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:10,729
you said just now

471
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,351
makes no sense.

472
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:13,431
Who is this girl?

473
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:15,391
The stand-up comedian?

474
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,950
Let's sit down first.

475
00:27:36,371 --> 00:27:37,710
Try to describe

476
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,030
the feelings she gave you.

477
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,230
She always seems to have bad luck.

478
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:45,071
Even so, she smiles a lot.

479
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:46,990
She's pretty when she smiles.

480
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:53,550
When she's telling jokes,

481
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:55,030
she shines

482
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,310
in warm lighting.

483
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:00,191
But when she's at work,

484
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:01,391
she turns into a dim

485
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,191
and cold gray tone.

486
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,990
She needs money,

487
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,591
lives in a shared apartment,
and works at a magazine house.

488
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:15,671
She seemed bothered that I didn't laugh.

489
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,270
She's passionate,

490
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:19,750
simple,

491
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,071
straightforward,

492
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:23,950
and reckless when she rides her bike.

493
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,370
Sounds like

494
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:30,470
a cute girl.

495
00:28:30,771 --> 00:28:31,950
So, where did you feel off?

496
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:36,710
When we were at the seminar,

497
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:37,890
she wasn't focused

498
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:38,871
and kept looking at me.

499
00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:41,591
She pretended to copy my notes,

500
00:28:42,611 --> 00:28:44,391
but the page was blank.

501
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:48,790
It reminds me of

502
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,030
one of my drawings.

503
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:53,990
What drawing?

504
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,230
An incomplete sketch draft.

505
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:01,111
I wanted to draw her face,

506
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,591
but I couldn't.

507
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,750
Why would you want to

508
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,911
draw her face?

509
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,230
You told me

510
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,710
to feel emotions
before I can express them.

511
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,911
To me,

512
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:17,950
she's very vivid.

513
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,230
Carry on.

514
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:23,351
Next,

515
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:25,671
after the seminar ended,

516
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,750
my hand hurt,

517
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,911
and she said I wasn't happy.

518
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,351
I think I really was,

519
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,831
but I didn't realize it
until she said it.

520
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,351
I didn't know why.

521
00:29:41,371 --> 00:29:42,750
Very vivid.

522
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:44,510
Unhappy.

523
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,111
As of now,

524
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:51,750
we won't analyze the reason.

525
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,631
Let's remember this unknown feeling.

526
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,831
Take time to get familiar with it,

527
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,169
then identify it,

528
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,310
and finally interpret it.

529
00:30:01,371 --> 00:30:03,209
The current cognition process

530
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,071
requires external stimulation.

531
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:05,871
Of course,

532
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,449
it can be good or bad,

533
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,030
and it's normal to be confused.

534
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,270
But at least it helps us

535
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,431
connect

536
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,810
how our body responds to emotions

537
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:15,871
and internal feelings.

538
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:25,030
What does that mean?

539
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:27,510
It means

540
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,990
the problem isn't your hand.

541
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,831
It's that someone invades
a blind spot in your brain.

542
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,710
Does that sound like

543
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,911
comedic setup?

544
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:41,911
Well, just kidding.

545
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,790
If your hand hurts,

546
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,950
it's probably triggered

547
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:53,270
by emotions or tendinitis like before.

548
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,950
We need to analyze and observe
to figure it out.

549
00:30:57,611 --> 00:30:59,030
I have some painkillers here.

550
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:00,230
I'll get them for you.

551
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,631
As for professional advice,

552
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:04,831
you should go for an X-ray.

553
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,111
Give me a moment.

554
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:26,810
Okay. No problem.

555
00:31:26,811 --> 00:31:29,191
Not at all. This is what we should do.

556
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,191
Sure thing. See you.

557
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,510
Yi,

558
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,831
what did they say?

559
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,570
"Ms. Gu,

560
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:43,729
we've received your proposal.

561
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,729
Well, how should I put it?

562
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,871
It's not ideal.

563
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,810
I know you've revised it several times,

564
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:50,191
but the theme still doesn't work well.

565
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,050
The color of the long illustration
isn't grand, the layout isn't fashionable,

566
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:53,969
the font is too small,

567
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,631
and the story isn't intriguing
and shallow.

568
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,230
I hope you can revise it again."

569
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,270
Can I swear?

570
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:02,969
You don't have to.

571
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,750
It's not the client's fault.

572
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,770
I'm to blame.

573
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:08,111
I shouldn't have shown them the slides.

574
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:09,950
Where are my slides?

575
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,489
Why?

576
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,191
Have you done all your work?

577
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,470
Come and help me out.

578
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:24,071
Gu Yi,

579
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:25,409
have you revised the client feedback

580
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,710
for the first quarter content?

581
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:29,950
Reply to them before work tomorrow.

582
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,431
Understood.

583
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,770
(As often as not, I suspect I'm in
a different time and space)

584
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:41,831
(from where Jacqueline is.)

585
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,151
(Even in this cutthroat
fashion industry,)

586
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,030
(she's like a Medusa,)

587
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:48,470
(irreplaceable.)

588
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,151
(Meanwhile, as mass-produced
senior copywriter,)

589
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,510
(I can only look up to her
from the lowest rung.)

590
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:08,309
(Ounce: The ticket lottery has begun)

591
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:12,163
(Ounce Stand-up Comedy
ticket lottery starts!)

592
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,443
(To Shen Zhimin)

593
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:28,979
(Shen, do I have to continue therapy
with stand-up comedy?)

594
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,265
(You didn't make much progress
last time, so no need.)

595
00:33:43,703 --> 00:33:47,516
(Ounce: You've won the ticket)

596
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:51,516
(Congratulations! You've won
a ticket to watch a stand-up comedy.)

597
00:34:00,811 --> 00:34:01,631
Instant noodles?

598
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,950
I'm eating something else.

599
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,929
Finally, you bought yourself some bread.

600
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:09,991
That's rare.

601
00:34:10,211 --> 00:34:11,290
It's from my colleague.

602
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:12,210
Almost expired.

603
00:34:12,211 --> 00:34:13,671
I'm racing against time.

604
00:34:14,371 --> 00:34:16,471
Well, the first task

605
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:18,671
for the new deputy director

606
00:34:18,811 --> 00:34:20,631
is to hunt for expired bread.

607
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,151
I didn't get promoted.

608
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,969
No need to console me.

609
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:28,969
I'm calm now.

610
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,111
I've already let it out.

611
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,770
To be honest,

612
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,910
I didn't get my final payment either.

613
00:34:40,691 --> 00:34:42,489
I slipped off

614
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,151
the moral high ground.

615
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,631
Speak English.

616
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,270
I stuck my nose into someone's business

617
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,910
and messed up my job.

618
00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:51,671
Whose business?

619
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:52,910
A pretty lady?

620
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,230
Not bad.

621
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,790
She's prettier than you.

622
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,009
Did you come here

623
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,511
for that guy?

624
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:03,009
Has he shown up?

625
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,111
Of course not.

626
00:35:05,651 --> 00:35:07,200
It's fine. I'm still performing tonight.

627
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,631
Chance favors the prepared.

628
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,910

629
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,810
Hi, everyone. I'm Gu Yi!

630
00:35:19,811 --> 00:35:21,631
Hi!

631
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,870
I'm a bit nervous today.

632
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,591
There was a handsome guy

633
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:31,830
who came to see my show twice,

634
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:33,710
but he didn't laugh even once.

635
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,730
Not only that,

636
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:37,631
he was sitting in the front row

637
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,430
with a blank face like a robot.

638
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,690
How should I describe

639
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:43,951
my feelings?

640
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,310
Half embarrassed,

641
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,350
and half...

642
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,591
I want to be his significant half.

Let's talk about love today.

655

Friends around you

656
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,551
tend to treat you like a plague
when you stay single for too long,

657
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:39,991
saying,

658
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,471
"She's single.

659
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:43,870
Stay away from her.

660
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,430
You might catch it."

661
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:50,790
My mom didn't let me date
when I was a teenager.

662
00:36:51,371 --> 00:36:52,330
Back in high school,

663
00:36:52,331 --> 00:36:54,409
I was kind of close

664
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,511
to this cute class rep.

665
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:57,270
When my mom found out,

666
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,951
she beat me right up

667
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:01,151
and wanted me to come straight home
after school

668
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:02,790
to avoid meeting each other.

669
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:04,951
She had indirectly increased my "value".

670
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,390
Only later did I realize

671
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:10,111
it was actually hunger marketing.

672
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,750
Bravo!

673
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,790
One of the male housemates
is learning Japanese.

674
00:37:20,211 --> 00:37:21,250
He's been at it for six months,

675
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:23,951
but all he's got so far is "Bakayaro".

676
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:28,529
No need to remind me.

677
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,111
I know he didn't laugh.

678
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,430
What's wrong with him, really?

679
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,240
I pulled it off well in every show
before this,

680
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,270
but nothing works with him.

681
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:38,270
It's not about that.

682
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,890
Previously, you told jokes
about your housemates.

683
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,310
Someone filmed it and posted it online.

684
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,739
(Female actress rants about)
I'm living with a female housemate.

685
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,790
(living with her housemate)
She likes playing with sand in her room.

686
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:49,350
The video has gone viral.

687
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,730
Wait.

688
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:52,031
Who did this?

689
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,390
Who did it to me?

690
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,591
That video is secretly filmed.

691
00:37:55,811 --> 00:37:58,111
We could've deleted it
if we'd caught them in the act.

692
00:37:58,211 --> 00:37:59,830
But now it's too late.

693
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,690
Maybe

694
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:03,511
you should go back

695
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:04,991
to pull the cable.

696
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:06,730
It's too bad

697
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:07,650
if your housemates

698
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:08,790
watch that.

699
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:11,631

Still,

752
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:24,951
move out.

753
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,111
We'll help you.

754
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:27,910
No.

755
00:40:28,731 --> 00:40:31,390
The bank always offers me
unsecured loans.

756
00:40:31,691 --> 00:40:33,631
I don't want to ruin my friendship
over this.

757
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,270
That's a good joke. Let me jot it down.

758
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,129
Is the stand-up comedy

759
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,671
really stressing you out?

760
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,529
Well, collecting material anytime
and anywhere

761
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,409
is the professionalism
of a stand-up comedian.

762
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,270
You wouldn't understand.

763
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,591
Right, I won't.

764
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:49,471
Lu,

765
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,310
there's something I want to ask you.

766
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:55,191
I sent my manuscript
to the Tonight Gen Y Talk Show.

767
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,210
They picked it and paid me 800 yuan

768
00:40:57,211 --> 00:40:59,071
but didn't say anything about taxes.

769
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,310
Rookie.

770
00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:04,310
You don't have to pay tax on 800 yuan.

771
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:07,210
We should celebrate this.

772
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:07,929
Sure.

773
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,730
Duo, pop the champagne.

774
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:10,370
No.

775
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:11,569
How much do you make a month?

776
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,870
Just give us beers.

777
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:13,770
Let's take champagne.

778
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:14,529
Champagne.

779
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,991
I'll pay for it with my 800 yuan.

780
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,071
It's only half a bottle.

781
00:41:20,331 --> 00:41:21,370
There aren't many big companies

782
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:22,951
like Nextmonday in Donghai.

783
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,730
I pulled some strings to get you in,
you know?

784
00:41:25,731 --> 00:41:28,350
Look at what you've done.
You skipped work on your first day.

785
00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:30,310
Where did you go?

786
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,191
Zhang Junjie complained
to Roger about that.

787
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:35,310
Did you embarrass me on purpose?

788
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:36,750
Hello?

789
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,350
Are you listening?

790
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,210
Hello?

791
00:41:39,211 --> 00:41:40,089
- Answer me.
- Chen Yi.

792
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,710
That's enough.

793
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,591
All right, Mom.

794
00:41:46,891 --> 00:41:48,390
I'll go to work tomorrow.

795
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,151
Xin,

796
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:53,870
Mom is just worried about you.

797
00:41:54,731 --> 00:41:55,750
Don't take it personally,

798
00:41:56,771 --> 00:41:57,591
okay?

799
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:00,710
Okay.

800
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,830
Good night, Dad.

801
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:03,770
Good night,

802
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,790

Have you seen a dead one?

811
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:01,830
Why are you here?

812
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,151
Night jog.

813
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:04,551
Night jog?

814
00:43:04,771 --> 00:43:07,111
What a destined encounter.
Let's jog together.

815
00:43:15,691 --> 00:43:16,991
Liang Daiwen,

816
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,870
you didn't laugh tonight.

817
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,471
Why wouldn't you laugh?

818
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,151
Can you please laugh a little?

819
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:29,790
Is she crying?

820
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:31,471
Maybe.

821
00:43:33,251 --> 00:43:34,551
Liang Daiwen,

822
00:43:35,171 --> 00:43:37,151
just laugh for her.

823
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:39,511
Look at what you've done to Gu Yi.

824
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,830
I'm fine.

825
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:45,151
I just got emotional.

826
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,230
I'll take my leave, then.

827
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:01,390
Where does she live?

828
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,511
I'll send her home.

829
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,529
She's hammered.

830
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:06,910
She can't go home by herself.

831
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:07,991
Can you guys send her home?

832
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,390
Sure. No problem.

833
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,350
No, we can't.

834
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,191
Bring her home.

835
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,191
- Why did you let him take her home?
- Shut up.

836
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,230

Bye-bye.

839
00:44:42,731 --> 00:44:43,790

840
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:46,710
Let's go.

841
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,031
My gosh.

842
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,191
Are you sober?

843
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,230
Where's my phone?

844
