I'm getting images in my head.

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,941
I can really picture that.

you were talking about?

Isn't it normal

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,919
for a kept woman to lose?

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,359

don't be impulsive.

00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,519
It only gets worse

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,900
if you confront them now.

43
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,981
Pay no mind to them.

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,340
What are they talking about?

45
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:33,541
Huh?

46
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:35,141
What's the deal with Penny?

47
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:37,780
There are rumors

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,220
that Penny was chosen
because she hooked up with Roger.

49
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,520
Besides, they're saying
you're being kept by some handsome guy.

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,380
And that you're living in his place.

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,919
I'm being kept by some handsome guy?

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,461
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

53
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:50,359
Why can't I

54
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,141
just be dating a handsome guy instead?

55
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,500
So you're seeing someone?

56
00:02:58,961 --> 00:02:59,560
Well,

57
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,340
I'm not.

58
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,400

to buy a telly she'd been wanting to.

62
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:24,220
She said to me,

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,820
"Sweetheart,

64
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:27,900

66
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:32,960

67
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:34,421
I don't care about that?

68
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,880
But clarifying rumors like this

69
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,541

73
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,021
replying to those rumors, she said,

"Do you know what kind of person
Gu Yi is?

Do you even know anything about her?"

76
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:05,141
The moment I saw those,

77
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,340

Hi!

85
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:39,940
Recently,

86
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:42,260
there has been some exciting news.

87
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:44,341
What is it? What news?

88
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,140
Rumor has it that I'm a kept woman.

89
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,421
Why are you all so excited?

90
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,901
Calm down.

91
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:54,181
Actually, I've heard about it
for a while.

92
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:58,060
It's all because of a joke I made
at Ounce

93
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,580
about my shared rental.

94
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:00,600
I mentioned

95
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,861
there were guys knocking on my door
in the middle of the night.

96
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,541
So, some of the audience

97
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:06,861
started speculating.

98
00:05:07,561 --> 00:05:08,500
In the middle of the night.

99
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:09,901
Guys.

100
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:11,661
She must be kept by a man.

101
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,680
It must be.

102
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:14,981
She has a sugar daddy.
They're so confident about that.

103
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,541
But if you think about it,

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,940
it makes zero sense.

105
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,421
Why would a sugar daddy
live in a shared apartment?

106
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:26,741
Right? There's another
new story this time.

107
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,440
It's said that I'm being kept

108
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:30,380
by a super hot guy in a villa.

109
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:33,901
I have a different take on it.

110
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,020
I wish it were true.

111
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,541
An unmarried man

112
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:42,140

113
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,260
a decent job,

114
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,741
and a huge villa.

115
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,820
How wonderful would that be
if he wooed me?

116
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:48,460
Why bother to keep me?

117
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,380
It'd be a waste of money.

118
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,901
As everyone knows,

119
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:57,460
there's this drama trope

120
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:00,460
where a domineering boss
falls in love with a kind-hearted girl.

121
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:03,901
These stories have deeply influenced me
since I was a kid,

122
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,781
and my brain got poisoned.

123
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,421
Therefore, I swear

124
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,820
I must be a kind-hearted girl.

125
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:12,901
Whenever I see a beggar

126
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,661
on the street,

127
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:16,181
I'll give them money.

128
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,500
One day,

129
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,940
a beggar fell in love with me.

130
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:25,020
I rejected him, but he wouldn't
take no for an answer.

131
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:28,140
He was so domineering.

132
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,181
I really couldn't stand it.

133
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,981
Well, I can't blame people
for making speculations.

134
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,661
It's true I'm living with that hot guy.

135
00:06:42,121 --> 00:06:45,260
But one of us sleeps on the bed,
and the other on the sofa.

136
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,341
We don't even talk.

137
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:50,500
We live our lives separately

138
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,861
like a middle-aged couple.

139
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,781
Middle-aged couples kissing

140
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,460
is like a long nightmare.

141
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,460
That's why he's always
having nightmares.

142
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:03,719
It's not just that,

143
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,541
he even sleepwalks.

144
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:06,440
Well,

145
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:07,440
I should stop now.

146
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:09,159
I'm revealing too much

147
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,000
of his privacy and habits.

148
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:13,280
All right. That's all. Thank you, everyone.
That's all from Gu Yi.

149
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,260
I hope you have a great night at Ounce.

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,600
Have any of you played frisbee before?

152
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:29,519
Before I went,

153
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,319
I had made a lot of mental preparations.

154
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,719
I watched videos about dogs
playing frisbee at home all day.

155
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,020
I didn't know many people had dogs,

156
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:36,920
and they brought their dogs

157
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:38,279
to play frisbee.

158
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,199
They tied their dogs up

159
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,380
while they went to play themselves.

160
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:42,440
Before I came,

161
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:43,480
I checked REDnote

162
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:45,301
to fully prepare myself.

163
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:46,319
Can you imagine

164
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,360
how dogs barked

165
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:49,199
when I was playing?

166
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,981
You're kind of sharp lately.

167
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:52,440
Is anyone putting pressure on you?

168
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,639
Just a joke.

169
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,741
Don't take it seriously.

170
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,781
Why wouldn't I?

171
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:00,781
You're so fearless when you perform

172
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:03,120
as though there are over 300 people

173
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:04,181
backing you up.

174
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,981
You're completely out of control.

175
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,580
But let me warn you.

176
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:09,399
If you keep this up,

177
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,500
you might have to change
your unlucky image.

178
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,460
Change it to what?

179
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,981
To an independent woman
kept by a hot guy.

180
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,159
I wish it were true.

181
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,781
Get out.

182
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,719
Well,

183
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,240
the latest rumor

184
00:08:22,241 --> 00:08:24,221
spread from Ounce to Nextmonday.

185
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:26,221

00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:28,661
It's hinting at something.

187
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,040
Do you think

188
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,101
that's just a coincidence?

189
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,621
Gu Yi,

190
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,060
stop showing off.

191
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:36,781
You must be delirious deep inside.

192
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:38,220
But listen,

193
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,720
is Liang Daiwen the only hot guy

194
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,220
in this world?

195
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,541
It's hard to say.

196
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,960
You better think about

197
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:45,039
who might be behind

198
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,781
those rumors.

199
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,381
Wait for me.

200
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,621
What's going on?

201
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,181
Beat me.

202
00:08:58,961 --> 00:08:59,740
Let's go take a look.

203
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:04,480
Make way. I'm here to look for my wife.
Mind your own business.

204
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,980
Your stand-up is trash.

205
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:07,820
Were you the one

206
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,860
spewing nonsense just now?

207
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:10,860
Get off!

208
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,421
Liang Daiwen.

209
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:43,220
- Do you have a first aid kit?
- You're injured.

210
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:45,501
I'll get the first aid kit for you.

211
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,501
- No need.
- I'm fine.

212
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:49,100
Let's sit down.

213
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,621
Why are you always like this?

214
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,600
Last time, someone drunk tried to
pick a fight with me at a private party,

215
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:00,840
and you ended up getting hit in the head
while protecting me.

216
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,700
Don't ever do this again.

217
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,279
Gu Yi, don't worry.

218
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,440
He'll be fine after disinfecting
his wound and taking painkillers.

219
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,381
Thank you.

220
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,381
I'll call the police.

221
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,100
Yes.

222
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,261
I came down from here,

223
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,200
and saw

224
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,220
someone holding a bottle here.

225
00:10:58,601 --> 00:10:59,940
You two live together.

226
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:02,021
Do you know where Liang Daiwen
keeps his medicine?

227
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,820
I do.

228
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:07,381
Give him a pill
if the pain gets intense.

229
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,220
If it doesn't help, go to Shen Zhimin.

230
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,261
He handles Liang Daiwen's medication.

231
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,060
Okay.

232
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:17,261
Gu Yi,

233
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,580
you like Liang Daiwen, do you?

234
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,740
I came here for your show

235
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,141
because I wanted to know

236
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,860
how you attracted him.

237
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,301
Turns out it's your naivety
and ignorance.

238
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,421
What are you getting at?

239
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:39,460
You think you're helping him,

240
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,460
but in fact, you've become
a burden to him.

241
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:43,460
If you really want to help him,

242
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:45,261
you should keep your distance.

243
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,100
He never asked me to do that.

244
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,301
You didn't ask him, did you?

245
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:54,421
If you really want to know,

246
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,759
why don't you ask him

247
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,381
if he likes me?

248
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:00,559
Don't read into it. I mean no harm.

249
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,740
I'll send him back later.

250
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,901
He can't drive right now.

251
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,340
Hey, comrade.

252
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,360
I came to see your show tonight,

253
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:35,781
but I missed it.

254
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:38,381
I heard someone made a scene here,
so I rushed over to check on you.

255
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,940
I'm fine.

256
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:44,860
Your eyes are red, and you say
you're fine. I'm not convinced at all.

257
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:46,901
Don't cry.

258
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:47,901
Wait for me.

259
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:12,421
Here.

260
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,381
Well.

261
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,661
Thank you.

262
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:19,120
What do you think?

263
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:20,421
Are they brighter than your star?

264
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,421
Cheer up.

265
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:25,039
Here.

266
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,740
I'll help you.

267
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:26,781
Give it to me.

268
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:28,181
Come on.

269
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,120
Very well.

270
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:29,781
Smile.

271
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:31,060
Give me a smile.

272
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:33,580
Smile.

273
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,560
(Happy)

274
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:13,661
You're home.

275
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,220
How's your hand?

276
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,421
I'm good.

277
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:12,060
The medicine is in the bathroom.
Help me bandage it up.

278
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,021
Hurry.

279
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:17,141
It hurts.

280
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:40,220
Liang Daiwen,

281
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,700
why did you remove the bandage?

282
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,460
I was given painkillers at the party,
but it turned out to be birth control pills.

283
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,901
It was a silly prank.

284
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:53,661
My English name is Daven.

285
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,100
From then on,

286
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:57,301
they called me Mr. Dumb.

287
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:00,860
She doesn't know about this
even until now.

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,181
So don't take her words

289
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:06,940
too seriously.

290
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:10,500
Also,

291
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:12,740
I took a cab home.

292
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,540
Liang Daiwen,

293
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,621
you really are a kind robot.

294
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:53,181
You went to the annual dinner,

295
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:55,260
played the tree
to keep an eye on me,

296
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,260
paid the HR to give me extra pay,

297
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:03,861
protected me from the attack,

298
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,500
asked me to rewrap your bandage,

299
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,621
and those conversations

300
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,260
that made no sense,

301
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,821

during Chinese New Year and birthdays.

00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,621
He's lonely.

336
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,020
He never reaches out to others,

337
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,621
but he hoped someone would know him.

338
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,181
Coming.

I'm a year older today.

351
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,540
Still, you're not here with me.

352
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,940
There's nothing worth celebrating.

353
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,300
It's been an eventful year.

354
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:36,260
I met a girl.

355
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,700
Gu Yi.

356
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,421
Mom,

357
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:49,661
I'm planning to change my job.

358
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,940
I want to focus on accessibility design.

359
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,421

360
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,220

363
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,020
Oh, that's awkward.

364
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:12,700
Liang,

365
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,980
show some response.

366
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,260
Why are you here?

367
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,020
I invited them over.

368
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,101
I didn't tell you.

369
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:24,621
It's a surprise for you.

370
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,120
Gu Yi prepared all of this by herself.

371
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,540
She's so exhausted,

372
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,381
just to give you a surprise.

373
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,626
(29th birthday gift)

374
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,700
Maybe we should leave
after giving him the gifts.

375
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,500
Who sent this?

376
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,061
It arrived this morning.

377
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,181
Who told you to accept it?

378
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,280
It's a birthday gift for you.

379
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:00,980
Who told you to celebrate my birthday?

380
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,700
Guan Xingxin told me

381
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,199
you were alone

382
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,861
during Chinese New Year and birthdays,

383
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,260
so I wanted to give you
a birthday surprise.

384
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,341
Happy birthday.

385
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:25,260
Happy birthday.

386
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,181
Happy birthday.

387
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:04,980
Get lost.

388
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:08,381
All of you,

389
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:11,581
get out of here!

390
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,821
We were there to celebrate his birthday,

391
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:12,760
but yet

392
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:14,061
he drove us all out.

393
00:27:14,121 --> 00:27:14,800
Enough said.

394
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,280
Perhaps he's having some situation.

395
00:27:16,281 --> 00:27:17,220
As if.

396
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:18,239
Alexithymia?

397
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,460
He's simply a lunatic.

398
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:21,199
That's enough.

399
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,940
Let's send Gu Yi back to my place.

400
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:24,120
All right.

401
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:25,181
Don't be sad. Let's go.

402
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,061
Only you here?

403
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,300
Gu Yi only accepted the parcel for you,

404
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,020
she knew nothing about it.

405
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,300
We shouldn't have snapped at her.

406
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:22,780
I didn't mean to.

407
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:25,500
I know.

408
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,341
Why?

409
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:49,581
I won't eat him.

410
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,381
Liang Daiwen,

411
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:00,220
you're my best friend,

412
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,460
but sometimes, I really can't stand you.

413
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:06,421
You make things difficult
for everyone around you, do you know?

414
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,040
Gu Yi just wanted
to celebrate your birthday.

415
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,220
What has she done wrong?

416
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:12,940
Why didn't you tell her to leave
when you first brought her home?

417
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:16,181
Why didn't you tell Shen and me to leave
when you first met us?

418
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,479
Will you only be happy

419
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,381
if you push all of us away?

420
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,500
Do you want to live
with alexithymia your whole life?

421
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,300
Let's clean the place up.

422
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:04,661
Are you less angry now?

423
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,300
I'm not angry.

424
00:30:07,761 --> 00:30:09,861
Gu Yi almost gives him
her whole heart.

425
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,661
He actually told her to get lost.

426
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,780
It's not like you just met him today.

427
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:17,260
I know he can't control himself.

428
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:18,959
Even so, I must let him know

429
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,141
what he has done to Gu Yi.

430
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:22,639
That's why

431
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,700
I didn't stop you just now.

432
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:25,621
Guan.

433
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,399
Liang Daiwen's mom

434
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,141
suffered from thoracic myelopathy.

435
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:35,220
When he was a kid,
his mom had been in a wheelchair.

436
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,600
Later, her condition worsened
and developed into cancer.

437
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:38,999
His dad

438
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,181
worked abroad.

439
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,940
He couldn't make it back
to see his mom before her passing

440
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,260
because he was on his way
to pick his dad up at the airport.

441
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:46,780
So,

442
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,300
for Liang Daiwen,

443
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:52,421
his birthday isn't a happy day.

444
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,280
(Groom)

445
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,581
Are you still going back there?

446
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,220
It's only a quarrel.

447
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,300
I can't just leave.

448
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,061
I should get going.

449
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,581
What are you doing?

450
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,780
Moving out.

451
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,700
This apartment is rented by the company.

452
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:02,061
I'm going to resign, and the landlord
has informed me to move.

453
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:04,260
I didn't touch your stuff.

454
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:06,380
Arrange a time to clean everything up,

455
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:08,380
but try not to take too long.

456
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,579
(Adoption statement)

457
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,141
You're moving out

458
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,461
without the cats?

459
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,860
I'm changing my job and my place.

460
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:30,740
There are too many uncertainties.

461
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:35,101
It'd be best if someone in the neighborhood
could adopt them so they won't suffer.

462
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,860
I get it now.

463
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,981
It's like the depressed dog.

464
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,420
You abandoned them

465
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:53,780
because you thought
it was for their own good.

466
00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:59,541
You never tried to keep them,

467
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:02,461
even though you've been together
for so long.

468
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:07,941
Why do I have to?

469
00:36:09,321 --> 00:36:10,780
They are only here temporarily.

470
00:36:21,801 --> 00:36:22,740
What about me?

471
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:37,181
Liang Daiwen.

472
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,501
Do you...

473
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,981
Do you like Zhang Qingya?

474
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,661
She's my senior

475
00:36:58,841 --> 00:36:59,860
and supervisor.

476
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,061
We went to the same college
and now work in the same company.

477
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:04,840
We've known each other
for many years.

478
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:07,141
What do you think?

479
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:16,621
What about me?

480
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,061
What?

481
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,820
It's nothing.

482
00:37:34,161 --> 00:37:36,021
I'll take Daju and Erju with me.

483
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,700
Are you really moving out?

484
00:38:40,281 --> 00:38:41,021
Yes.

485
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:43,621
Even if Liang Daiwen doesn't move out,

486
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:44,541
I'd still leave.

487
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:47,780
It's good, anyway.

488
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,220
Take some time apart

489
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,820
so you both can calm down.

490
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:57,380
He's the one who needs to calm down.

491
00:38:57,641 --> 00:38:59,541
I don't even have a choice.

492
00:39:01,321 --> 00:39:03,240
I'm a stray cat

493
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:04,260
he brought home temporarily.

494
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,220
Zhang Qingya was right.

495
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,380
I'm a burden to him.

496
00:39:12,241 --> 00:39:13,141
Gu Yi,

497
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:15,981
I know you're upset right now,

498
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,101
but you can't take
what she said personally.

499
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:21,461
She likes Liang Daiwen,

500
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:24,181
so it won't be easy for him

501
00:39:24,201 --> 00:39:25,300
to resign.

502
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,021
Please understand him.

503
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,061
Give him some time.

504
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,700
I want to,

505
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,820
but it seems he doesn't need that.

506
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,780
I know.

507
00:39:39,321 --> 00:39:40,981
He went too far yesterday,

508
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:43,501
but feelings go both ways.

509
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:45,981
I'm sure he isn't feeling
any better, either.

510
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,141
When are you moving out?

511
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,621
After Gu Yi.

512
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:09,160
She's coming to pack her things tonight.

513
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,220
If you haven't found a place yet,

514
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,220
you can crash at mine for a few days.

515
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:20,061
The corridor in the hospital.

516
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,740
Every corridor has its end.

517
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,141
One can't stay stuck
in the same corridor forever.

518
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,420
Gu Yi came by earlier today

519
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:46,860
and took away two of the cats.

520
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:48,661
She asked me

521
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:52,380
if I liked Zhang Qingya.

522
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,420
What did you say?

523
00:40:59,681 --> 00:41:01,420
I said," I've known her for years.

524
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:04,260
What do you think?"

525
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,141
That's not the way to answer,

526
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,941
nor is it the answer Gu Yi wants.

527
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,860
Liang Daiwen,

528
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:18,181
please give Gu Yi a straight answer.

529
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,181
I've known Zhang Qingya for years.

530
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:25,220
If I liked her,

531
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,181
I would've dated her already.

532
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,740
So you know the answer yourself,

533
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,101
but you chose not to tell Gu Yi honestly

534
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:37,501
because you wanted to push her away.

535
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,661
I'll only break her heart.

536
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,621
If she really moves out,

537
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:55,340
how would you feel?

538
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:03,581
We're only sharing this place

539
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:05,621
temporarily.

540
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,501
What could I possibly feel?

541
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,820
Liang Daiwen,

542
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,101
do you know what's more dangerous

543
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,661
than feeling nothing?

544
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:21,461
It's ignoring.

545
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,300
You clearly feel it

546
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,860
but refuse to express

547
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:26,941
or respond.

548
00:42:27,361 --> 00:42:29,661
Instead, you let those feelings
fade away in silence.

549
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,220
Have you ordered a cab?

550
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:38,061
I'll do it myself.

551
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,700
I dirtied your watch strap.

552
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,740
I'm sorry about that.

553
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:56,740
I replaced it with a new one.

554
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,061
You don't have to give it back.

555
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:58,340
Remember how you feel right now.

556
00:45:03,641 --> 00:45:05,061
For what you gave me,

557
00:45:07,281 --> 00:45:09,380
I'm returning it to you, no less.

558
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,101
I'm sorry.

559
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,760
I understand that you're mad at me

560
00:45:49,761 --> 00:45:50,640
and that you don't want to

561
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:51,780
be my friend.

562
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,820
I know

563
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,101
I've made things difficult
for everyone around me.

564
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:58,200
None of them are happy
when they're with me.

565
00:45:58,201 --> 00:45:59,380
- But I really...
- Liang Daiwen.

566
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,621
I'm not mad.

567
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,420
I'm just sad.

568
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:26,220
You pushed me away.

569
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:42,839

570
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:48,339
