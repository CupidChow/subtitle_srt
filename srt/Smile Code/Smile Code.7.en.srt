00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600

"Smile Code" by Zhu Yue)

=Episode 7=

25
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:57,805
I did an MRI scan before.

26
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,406
It's not organic mental disorder,

27
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,725
just occasional
sleepwalking caused by stress.

28
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:07,326
You didn't get it treated?

29
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,965
It wasn't that serious

30
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:12,405
or frequent.

31
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:14,645
Shen said

32
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:17,085
it's my punishment
for being such a jerk.

33
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,046
Do you know what you did
when you were sleepwalking?

34
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:28,245
You chased after me
like a tail on my back.

35
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:35,446
Perhaps it's hereditary.

36
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,085
My dad sleepwalks too.

37
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:41,125
He used to be a prison guard,

38
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:45,726
and often dreams of chasing
after jail-breaking prisoners.

39
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:55,166
So, was your sleepwalking

40
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,085
triggered by some kind of dream?

41
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:08,766
I didn't dream of anyone.

42
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:33,736
(Yu Dule: The 4S center is
offering a stand-up comedy gig.)

43
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:37,379
(1000 yuan, interested?)

44
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,593
(Gu Yi: Yep, I can do anything for money.)

45
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:56,699
(File Transfer Assistant)

46
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,878
(I'm worried about everything:
my looks, my finances, my skills,)

47
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,358
(my results, my weight, my social life,
I'm totally stressed out.)

48
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:35,206
Are you getting involved
in the car industry now?

49
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:38,794
Have you ever seen
anyone in the car industry

50
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,085
earning a mere 1000 yuan?

51
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:42,126
That's already quite a lot.

52
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:45,206
KFC pays 10 yuan per hour,
and you're getting 200 yuan per minute.

53
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:47,965
That's because this is a 4S center.

54
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:49,474
Sometimes,

55
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:52,045
making the right choice is
more important than working hard.

56
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:54,474
Only year-end corporate gigs
would pay 500 to 1000 yuan.

57
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:56,605
Usually, we're only paid 200 yuan.

58
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,206
Mr. Liang,

59
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:37,405
this is my first time
performing in a 4S center.

60
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:39,725
Can you come?

61
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:41,566
I don't feel confident.

62
00:05:42,996 --> 00:05:44,566
I didn't know
you'd ever feel unconfident.

63
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:47,485
Do I look very confident to you?

64
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:52,246
When you're on stage,
you look absolutely confident.

65
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:55,845
Well, not anymore off the stage.

66
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:57,326
You'd look dispirited.

67
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:26,326
Why are you blushing?

68
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:35,126
I'm blushing again?

69
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:47,126
That's a bit too warm.

70
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:52,405
Do you think I'm a dog?

71
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:00,326
You're running a fever.

72
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:04,605

No more next time.

91
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,035
He died in Dali

92
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:53,885
while researching barrier-free routes.

93
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:56,605
You probably remember him.

94
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:58,874
The handrails in
the special needs school

95
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,765
was designed by him
before he went to Dali.

96
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,514
He was too much of an idealist.

97
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:04,994
Of all the projects he could pick,

98
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,446
he chose to do barrier-free designs.

99
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:09,046
Just take a look at the streets.

100
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:12,005
Pavements for the visually impaired
are now littered with stalls.

101
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:14,326
Barrier-free washrooms
have been converted into storerooms.

102
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:16,286
You get nothing from such projects.

103
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,005
You too.

104
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:22,485
Don't spend too much effort

105
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:24,005
on the special needs school.

106
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:55,234
Bye, Mr. Yu.

107
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:55,955
Bye.

108
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:56,725
Thanks for today.

109
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:00,206

110
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:07,634
Thank you, Mr. Yu, bye.

111
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:08,485
Bye.

112
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:47,125
Here's your food.

113
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,085
This is a nice place.

114
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:58,526
How did you find it?

115
00:11:58,956 --> 00:12:00,514
Come on, let's just dig in.

116
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:01,765
Enjoy the food.

117
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,046
Come on.

118
00:12:03,316 --> 00:12:04,245
Nice, right?

119
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,075
Not bad.

120
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,485
Hey, look who's there.

121
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:08,446
Is that Layla?

122
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:09,395
She does look like her.

123
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,714
You have a video of her, right?
Let's take a look.

124
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:13,114
Why get so excited?

125
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:13,634
Come on.

126
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:14,566
It can't be her.

127
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,594
It is her.

128
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:17,446
It is.

129
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:18,155
She's all alone.

130
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:19,566
She's alone?

131
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,555
Go, then.

132
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:21,725
I'm going.

133
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:22,646
I'm going.

134
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,195
I'm going.

135
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:26,675
Come on, go talk to her.

136
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:27,354
I'm going.

137
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:28,395
I'm going if you're not.

138
00:12:28,396 --> 00:12:29,754
Quick, she's looking at you.

139
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,474
She's looking, come on.

140
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:32,725
Go.

141
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,806
Hey, girl.
Let's add each other on WeChat.

142
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:39,245
No, thanks.

143
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:40,646
No?

144
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,275
Playing hard to get, are you?

145
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:43,275
You're Layla, aren't you?

146
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:45,206
We've already seen
that video of you in bed.

147
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,834
Come on, join us for a few drinks.

148
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:47,675
Come on.

149
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,125
Come on, join us.

150
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:52,965
What are you doing?

151
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:54,406
What's this?

152
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:19,195
Move it.

153
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:20,994
Wait, officer.

154
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:21,555
Officer.

155
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:23,354
What, are you resisting arrest?

156
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:24,725
No, I'm not.

157
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:25,955
I just wanted to ask

158
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:27,675
if I could ride my
scooter to the station.

159
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:28,915
I won't run away.

160
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:29,646
No.

161
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:32,354
You're under arrest, and you expect
to choose how you want to commute?

162
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:34,234
But, my scooter

163
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:35,634
is all I've got now.

164
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:36,834
I can't afford to lose it.

165
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:38,514
My friend lost his bike once,

166
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:39,955
and he barely managed to find it.

167
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:40,945
I'll ride it to the station.

168
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:45,125
That's settled, then.

169
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,526
I'll be counting on you.

170
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:15,326
See you.

171
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:03,365
You're awake.

172
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:06,085
I just came across this melody, listen.

173
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:07,885
Have you heard of it? It's Chinese music.

174
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:11,725
Using music to meditate

175
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:14,326
is part of China's
traditional music culture.

176
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,555
There are three aspects to it,

177
00:15:16,556 --> 00:15:18,365
namely to meditate the mind,

178
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:20,315
to meditate the heart,

179
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:21,885
and to cultivate the character.

180
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:25,605
Life is full of confusion and troubles.

181
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:27,035
Listening to music

182
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:28,634
is like sharing your troubles

183
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:29,725
with a friend.

184
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:34,275
That's why spreading and reshaping media

185
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:36,406
can turn entertainment into
a new form of involution.

186
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:38,035
Weirdly enough, youngsters today prefer

187
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:39,035
being alone and meditating,

188
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:41,286
and that actually contributes
to the development of music.

189
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:43,754
More and more
traditional music academies

190
00:15:43,755 --> 00:15:45,845
and folk music ensembles
are growing in scale.

191
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:48,085
This is what Chinese
pop culture truly is.

192
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:51,125
And that's our theme for this issue.

193
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:52,245
Is that okay?

194
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:56,005
Okay.

195
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:03,913
(Robot)

196
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:06,806
Hello?

197
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:09,765
Yu Dule and Guan Xingxin got into
a brawl. They're at the police station.

198
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:11,926
They...

199
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,166
Why did they fight?

200
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:17,046
They weren't fighting each other,

201
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,725
but with another guy.

202
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:21,965
They need someone to pick them up now.
I'm on the way there.

203
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:23,166
Where are you?

204
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:25,485
I...

205
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:27,874
Send me the location.

206
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,845
I'll go there right away.

207
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:36,085
Mr. Xu,

208
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:39,125
can I bring my work home instead?

209
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:40,446
Something just cropped up.

210
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:43,526
I know you need to go,
but it's rush hour now.

211
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:49,166
I'll drive you, come on.

212
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:51,646
Sure.

213
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:00,806
My knees.

214
00:17:02,676 --> 00:17:04,525
My pelvic bone.

215
00:17:07,356 --> 00:17:08,474
That's enough.

216
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:09,886
Stop yelling. Keep it down.

217
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:11,714
You.

218
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:13,325
Tell me what happened.

219
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:17,245
I just wanted to add her on WeChat,

220
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,045
but before I could reach her,

221
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:21,195
he swatted me like a fly!

222
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:22,195
That's right, officer.

223
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:23,886
Look how serious my injuries are.

224
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:26,525
Why did you...

225
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:28,446
Swat them?

226
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:30,325
They were rude. They deserved it.

227
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:31,646
No, officer.

228
00:17:31,795 --> 00:17:34,725
I had a few drinks,
and I just wanted to chat.

229
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:36,045
Besides, it's no big deal

230
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:38,278
since she already slept
with a married man.

231
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,754
Shut your trap.

232
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:40,965
Did I ask you that?

233
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:41,926
Officer.

234
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:44,034
They beat us up.

235
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:45,955
That's a fact, isn't it?
How should we settle this?

236
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:47,915
Yeah, look at my face!

237
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,285
Look at my face!

238
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:52,355
You may be covered in bruises,

239
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:54,126
but my friend here injured his face.

240
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,406
He's an actor, and
looking good is part of his job.

241
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:57,714
How should we settle that?

242
00:17:57,715 --> 00:18:00,355
We hit only him,
but he beat all of us up!

243
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:00,994
Exactly!

244
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:02,234
We're suffering too!

245
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:04,446
Officer, you heard that?

246
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:07,514
All of them ganged up on my friend.

247
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:09,714
Wait, ganged up?

248
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,646
Look at me, even my arm is hurt!

249
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:13,794
Officer!

250
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:15,366
How is that ganging up on him?

251
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:19,366
Who's there?

252
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:22,005
Jeez.

253
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:23,565
Dressed in black

254
00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:25,126
like a grim reaper.

255
00:18:26,995 --> 00:18:28,366
This is our lawyer.

256
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:33,406
Where's your work permit?

257
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:37,606
You left it in your car, didn't you?

258
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:41,366
What happened to his eye?

259
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:45,725
And his mouth?

260
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:50,606
What happened to them?

261
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:55,086
Come on, drop the act.

262
00:18:55,396 --> 00:18:56,846
So what if you've got another friend?

263
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,234
So what?

264
00:18:58,235 --> 00:18:59,635
We literally got bamboozled.

265
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:01,115
We're not going to let him off.

266
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:02,595
We won't agree to a mere settlement!

267
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:03,395
Yeah!

268
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:04,485
No way!

269
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:06,915
Before that, I should inform you

270
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,395
that you're suspected of violating

271
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:09,955
Article 16 of the Criminal Law

272
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:11,206
of the People's Republic of China.

273
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:13,355
In accordance with the laws
pertaining to provoking trouble,

274
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:15,754
those involved in a public brawl

275
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,406
may receive up to
five years' imprisonment,

276
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:20,245
short-term detention,
or controlled release.

277
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:23,195
We didn't start it.

278
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,714
What about that guy?

279
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:26,446
Yeah.

280
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:28,640
Ouch.

281
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,876
It's up to the court to decide
the severity of the crime and sentence.

282
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:32,285
However, since you provoked trouble

283
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,166
and started a brawl afterwards,

284
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,355
and given the fact that
you harassed Ms. Guan

285
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:38,646
both verbally and physically,

286
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,195
we may need to observe whether

287
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:41,725
your actions have
caused any emotional trauma.

288
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:43,565
If so, you may be

289
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:45,725
prosecuted under criminal law.

290
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:49,395
If you are ultimately found guilty,

291
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,474
the consequences will cause

292
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:51,926
irreparable damage to your future.

293
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:54,005
I suggest that you consider

294
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:56,285
reconciling with the victim

295
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,765
to reduce your legal responsibilities.

296
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:03,166
He really is a lawyer.

297
00:20:03,876 --> 00:20:04,646
Keep it down.

298
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,606
This is no place for you to squabble.

299
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,965
Now that we have
a written record of the incident,

300
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:13,525
and since you refuse to reconcile,

301
00:20:14,636 --> 00:20:16,034
we will submit the case to court

302
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:17,395
and request for detention.

303
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:19,234
No, officer!

304
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:20,115
We'll reconcile.

305
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:21,805
We'll reconcile.

306
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:23,325
We still have work tomorrow.

307
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,926
Yeah.

308
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,446
Get your guarantors to sign here.

309
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:28,765
Follow me.

310
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:47,213
I didn't know you could fight.

311
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:50,915
(Donghai Police, Zejie Police Station)

312
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,646
I didn't know, too.

313
00:20:53,196 --> 00:20:54,206
And I was being easy on them.

314
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,525
They were just so rude.

315
00:20:57,116 --> 00:20:57,926
They really were.

316
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:00,285
It's okay.

317
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:03,366
Guan Xingxin.

318
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:06,325
You were really cool

319
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:07,446
and brave today.

320
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:10,274
If this happens again,

321
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:11,554
do the same thing

322
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:13,245
and say no bravely.

323
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:15,485
Is that the right thing to say now?

324
00:21:17,396 --> 00:21:19,846
Sorry, I mean, this won't happen again.

325
00:21:23,196 --> 00:21:24,086
Here's a band-aid.

326
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:30,446
Thanks.

327
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:33,765
What?

328
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:36,646
Your hand is functional enough
to reach that gash on your face.

329
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:37,886
Do it yourself.

330
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,846
Do you really think you're a big-shot?

331
00:21:40,156 --> 00:21:41,034
That doesn't matter.

332
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:41,835
The thing is,

333
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:43,406
I can't see my lower jaw now.

334
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:47,366
I'll do it.

335
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:14,406
Thanks for just now.

336
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:17,366
No worries.

337
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:20,406
Come listen to my jokes
at Ounce when you're free.

338
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:22,406
Sure.

339
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:26,646
Why does that sound so familiar?

340
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,965
Isn't that the same pickup line
I used on Liang Daiwen?

341
00:22:31,396 --> 00:22:32,045
Get down.

342
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:42,633
(Police Station)

343
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:56,926
Thank you for the ride, Mr. Xu.

344
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:59,245
No problem. Gu Yi,
where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

345
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,565
There's no seatbelt on your bike.
It's too dangerous.

346
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:02,725
I'll drive you back.

347
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:06,606
Yu Dule is riding his scooter today.

348
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:09,525
You bikers can go together.

349
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:10,886
Me?

350
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:16,875
I'm riding a scooter.

351
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:18,446
He's riding a motorbike.

352
00:23:22,315 --> 00:23:23,395
It's okay.

353
00:23:23,396 --> 00:23:25,005
Both has two wheels, anyway.

354
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:26,395
I'm not troubling you, right?

355
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:27,406
No.

356
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:27,915
Let's go.

357
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:28,565
Come on.

358
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,366
Let's go.

359
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,325
Move forward a little.

360
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,206
Your seat.

361
00:24:04,715 --> 00:24:06,714
Gu Yi, why don't you
take the front seat?

362
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:07,805
I'd like to get some rest behind.

363
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:11,886
Sure.

364
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:25,646
Liang, that's enough.

365
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:35,965
Mr. Liang,

366
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:38,166
that was some awesome ad libbing.

367
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:40,166
How did you come up
with those law stuff?

368
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:45,155
"I have to inform you

369
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:47,846
that you have violated
Article 203 of the Criminal Law..."

370
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:51,206
It's "suspected of violating".

371
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,640
Only the court can determine
whether he's truly violated the law.

372
00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:55,195
And it's not Article 203,

373
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:56,206
but Article 293.

374
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:57,045
Also,

375
00:24:57,555 --> 00:24:59,245
making false laws up is also a crime.

376
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,126
I'm speaking the truth.

377
00:25:01,156 --> 00:25:01,926
I'm not making them up.

378
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:05,206
I didn't know you're well-versed in law.

379
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:08,765
I don't have a social life,
so I've got lots of free time

380
00:25:09,196 --> 00:25:10,485
to read many books.

381
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:13,646
I wouldn't say I'm a professional,
but I can definitely explain

382
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,725
some basic concepts.

383
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:19,155
You may be bad at
picking up social cues,

384
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:21,285
but you sure know
how to impersonate a lawyer.

385
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:26,126
I don't remember
claiming myself to be a lawyer.

386
00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:27,366
You said that.

387
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:29,406
Besides, strictly speaking,

388
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:30,926
I wasn't impersonating,

389
00:25:31,715 --> 00:25:33,485
but what you did
can be construed as fraud.

390
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:39,245
You're kidding me, right?

391
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:42,274
Scared now?

392
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:44,195
Then, don't make any bold claims

393
00:25:44,196 --> 00:25:45,045
without a real lawyer,

394
00:25:45,415 --> 00:25:46,846
or I'd have to come
to your rescue again.

395
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:53,285
Why are you

396
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:55,485
dressed like an assassin today?

397
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,606
I was at a colleague's funeral.

398
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:01,045
Wait.

399
00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:06,245
It's in your pocket.

400
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:11,926
I did some research.

401
00:26:12,116 --> 00:26:14,805
Normally, sleepwalkers can
stop sleepwalking naturally

402
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:17,005
or go back to sleep,

403
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,565
but they must not be woken up,

404
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:20,926
or they might turn dumb.

405
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:23,525
That's why I got you a sports watch.

406
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:25,886
I turned the tracker on

407
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:28,285
to monitor your whereabouts.

408
00:26:29,235 --> 00:26:30,525
I also changed the strap

409
00:26:31,315 --> 00:26:32,965
so that it won't disturb your sleep.

410
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:41,965
If you're worried,

411
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:43,086
I can lock the door.

412
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:45,846
I'm not worried that you'd sleepwalk.

413
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:50,045
I'm worried that you'd leave the house

414
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:52,446
and chase after someone else.

415
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:48,646
Liang Daiwen.

416
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:50,725
Liang Daiwen.

417
00:28:57,755 --> 00:28:58,725
Liang Daiwen.

418
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:01,646
Take your shoes off.

419
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:11,525
Go back to bed.

420
00:29:17,795 --> 00:29:18,485
Come on.

421
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,446
I'm a manual GPS now.

422
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:03,086

444
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:34,794
But we did hire a professional

445
00:32:34,795 --> 00:32:36,406
advertisement company for the magazine,

446
00:32:37,676 --> 00:32:39,366
and our sales are still dropping.

go down in the first quarter?

00:32:45,836 --> 00:32:47,485
Nextmonday is our feature magazine,

450
00:32:47,836 --> 00:32:49,846
yet the content is so boring,
even our old readers loathe it.

451
00:32:50,795 --> 00:32:52,565
What are all the departments doing,
slacking off?

452
00:32:58,035 --> 00:32:58,794
Excuse me, Roger.

453
00:32:58,795 --> 00:33:01,086
I didn't know you're having a meeting.
I'll be waiting outside.

454
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,274
Wait, Mr. Huang.

455
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:03,234
We just ended the meeting.

456
00:33:03,235 --> 00:33:04,446
Let's talk in my office.

457
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:07,765
Ms. Zhang.

458
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:09,406
Ms. Zhang?

459
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:15,126
Long time no see.

460
00:33:35,836 --> 00:33:37,406
Hello, I'm Gu Yi.

461
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:39,565
I'm a stand-up comedian.

462
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:40,875
Usually,

463
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:43,166
the only commuting tool
I have is an electric scooter,

464
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:45,846
so I'm honored to be
invited to Cadillac's event.

465
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:48,765
This is the second closest time
I've ever been to a Cadillac.

466
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:51,525
The first time

467
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,045
was when I got crashed by one.

468
00:33:57,116 --> 00:33:59,366
I'm going to talk about
my blind date experience today.

469
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:02,965
Lately, I got a blind date
who has a PhD degree.

470
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:05,725
He's extremely proud of
his academic qualifications,

471
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:08,285
and sees mine as inferior.

472
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:12,126
I told him, if you think my academic
qualifications are inferior,

473
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:14,086
why don't you look
for another PhD holder?

474
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:16,206
He said,

475
00:34:17,276 --> 00:34:18,725
that's still too high for me.

476
00:34:28,595 --> 00:34:31,086
I heard some bombastic news lately.

477
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:33,046
They said I've become
someone's mistress.

478
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:36,086
Actually, I've heard about it.

479
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:42,765
Why don't I talk about

480
00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:46,206

Liang Daiwen,

482
00:35:02,716 --> 00:35:05,126
you didn't laugh again today.

483
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:08,206
Why is it that you never laugh at all?

484
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:12,006
Can't you try to laugh once?

485
00:35:12,796 --> 00:35:14,994
Yeah, don't get too excited.

00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:16,046

00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:28,445
that you do feel awful
when you're on stage.

00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:35,006

Yes, I remember.

511
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:33,526
I'm on my way.

512
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,285
You've got work to do?

513
00:38:40,356 --> 00:38:42,046
I need to go to my office
and edit an article.

514
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:45,126
And you're still driving me back?

515

521
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:20,285
Recently, I'm working
as a diving instructor.

522
00:39:21,316 --> 00:39:23,006
The lady students love me.

523
00:39:23,316 --> 00:39:24,606
They even gave me a nickname,

524
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:25,606
the Sea-ducer.

525
00:39:27,716 --> 00:39:29,325
During my lessons,

526
00:39:29,555 --> 00:39:31,206
a lot of incredible things
have happened.

527
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,006
Once, I was teaching a student.

528
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:36,114
I went underwater to demonstrate,

529
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:37,845
moving my arms and
limbs like an octopus.

530
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:39,646
Suddenly,

531
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:41,315
I found myself

532
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:42,725
fished up in a fishing net,

533
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:46,966
along with scallops, prawns,

534
00:39:47,236 --> 00:39:48,486
crabs, and fish.

535
00:39:48,716 --> 00:39:50,166
I was even entangled
in a mess of seaweed.

536
00:39:51,075 --> 00:39:52,365
The fishermen were shocked.

537
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:54,400
I guess I wasn't an octopus,
but an electric eel.

538
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:55,845
Nice!

539
00:40:04,356 --> 00:40:05,046
What's wrong?

540
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:07,606
Things not going well
between you and Liang?

541
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:11,566
It's a long story.

542
00:40:13,515 --> 00:40:14,925
I'd love to help you,

543
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:18,245
but Liang is a tough nut to crack.

544
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,885
Even Shen can't handle him.

545
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:23,365
Shen?

546
00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:26,486
You mean the psychiatrist?

547
00:40:27,356 --> 00:40:29,566
He's a very famous psychiatrist,

548
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:32,725
but Liang and I

549
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:35,006
may prove to be
the bottleneck of his career.

550
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:36,966
You?

00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:39,885
Are you okay?

552
00:40:40,515 --> 00:40:41,725
I'm fine.

553
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:44,285
Forget about me. Back to Liang.

554
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:49,285
I want to know

555
00:40:50,035 --> 00:40:51,725
if I have the chance

556
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,445
to meet Dr. Shen?

557
00:40:55,396 --> 00:40:56,285
Gu Yi.

558
00:40:56,876 --> 00:40:59,046
You do like Liang Daiwen.

559
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:02,285
I'd love to help,

560
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,206
but first,

561
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:05,606
I need to ask Shen.

562
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,925
Of course.

563
00:41:07,995 --> 00:41:09,554
Thank you for telling me

564
00:41:09,555 --> 00:41:11,046
about his emotional dysregulation.

565
00:41:13,396 --> 00:41:14,805
You didn't tell him anything else?

566
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:17,526
What?

567
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:19,526
That you fancy him?

568
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:21,606
You didn't want him to know?

569
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:25,285
Relax, I didn't tell him.

570
00:41:25,675 --> 00:41:27,154
I won't tell him anything

571
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:28,765
that you don't want him to know.

572
00:41:31,195 --> 00:41:32,166
But,

573
00:41:32,796 --> 00:41:35,634
I suggest that you need certain methods

574
00:41:35,635 --> 00:41:36,925
to open Liang's heart.

575
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:40,325
Perhaps you can create
a romantic ambiance

576
00:41:41,075 --> 00:41:42,554
and have a candlelit dinner

577
00:41:42,555 --> 00:41:44,086
or go stargazing.

578
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:47,725
Anyway, try interacting
with him in different ways.

579
00:41:48,155 --> 00:41:50,206
Since he has literally

580
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:51,925
zero emotional experience,

581
00:41:52,515 --> 00:41:54,606
normal methods won't work.

582
00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:58,365
That's why we need to introduce

583
00:41:58,916 --> 00:41:59,925
some novelty

584
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:01,805
and strong stimulation.

585
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:05,725
Novelty?

586
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:07,445
Strong stimulation?

587
00:42:09,756 --> 00:42:10,606
Like what?

588
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,590
(Happy Valley)

589
00:42:24,356 --> 00:42:26,365
I checked the queue time before coming.

590
00:42:26,756 --> 00:42:28,474
Theoretically,
this should be the fastest ride.

591
00:42:28,475 --> 00:42:29,955
Leave my hair alone.

592
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:30,594
Come on.

593
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:32,194
I braided my hair all morning.

594
00:42:32,195 --> 00:42:32,994
You're so annoying.

595
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:33,275
Gu Yi.

596
00:42:33,276 --> 00:42:34,915
Don't you think your face
has a shine to it today?

597
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:36,755
Yeah, and your face
is shining like the Green Lantern.

598
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:38,126
Nonsense.

599
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:43,447
(The Swaying Sun)

600
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:54,725
Scared?

601
00:42:57,195 --> 00:42:59,086
Me? I can manage.

602
00:43:03,356 --> 00:43:04,206
I'm not scared.

603
00:43:06,475 --> 00:43:07,315
Dude,

604
00:43:07,316 --> 00:43:09,805
"not scared" is your default mode.

605
00:43:10,276 --> 00:43:11,925
Me, that depends.

606
00:43:14,356 --> 00:43:15,235
I wasn't born

607
00:43:15,236 --> 00:43:16,445
without emotions.

608
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,885
