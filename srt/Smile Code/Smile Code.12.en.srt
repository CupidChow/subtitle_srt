23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
(Adapted from Douban Read's work
"Smile Code" by Zu Yue)

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,115
=Episode 12=

25
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,281
You think you're Sisyphus?

26
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:56,000
I think I'm starting to get
why you find it so fun.

27
00:01:57,491 --> 00:01:59,089
Melting an iceberg

28
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,961
with pure passion

29
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,290
seems

30
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,841
impossible to accomplish.

31
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:05,440
Still,

32
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,321
it's romantic to catch stars.

33
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:09,130
Please don't expose me.

34
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:10,801
It's kind of embarrassing.

35
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:12,169
But I'm curious

36
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,970
how long you can stay in love

37
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:15,641
with a robot.

38
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,361
Gu Yi.

39
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:21,801
Are your legs numb?

40
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,760
Gu Yi,

41
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,369
does he have a palsy or what?

42
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,570
He's been pulling a long face.

43
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:29,329
He didn't laugh at your joke.

44
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,410
That's not true.

45
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:32,561
He's just not easily amused.

46
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,090
Why try to beautify

47
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:36,889
a life that's already tough?

48
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,320
Instead of laughing at her jokes,

49
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:40,690
it's better to bring her home
and give her a comfortable life.

50
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:41,929
Well said.

51
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,200
Gu Yi,

52
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,760
do you want to come home with me?

53
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:47,489
I have plenty of limited-edition CDs

54
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,521
and over a thousand albums.

55
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:51,440
Are you coming?

56
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,361
She's staying with me.

57
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,720
I have those, too.

58
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,440
That intrigues me even more.

59
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,040
Both those albums

60
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,320
and you.

61
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:08,841
Bye-bye.

62
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,649
Mr. Lu's script

63
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,241
is quite impressive, right?

64
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:52,361
Let me tell you this.

65
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,410
Previously, Mr. Lu
started his own business

66
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:55,760
and had a happy family.

67
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:56,850
But then,

68
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:58,410
he was scammed and fell into deep debt.

69
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:00,570
His wife took the kids and left.

70
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:02,841
Now, he's doing part-time jobs,

71
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,720
trying to make ends meet.

72
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:06,480
Even so, he never complains.

73
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,929
Honestly, I kind of understand

74
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,970
why he's so desperate

75
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:14,320
to keep Ounce and Fuzzy.

76
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:17,600
Not everyone in this world
needs to laugh,

77
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:19,881
but finding joy in a bad situation
is important.

78
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,120
Why were you so absorbed

79
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,881
in Mr. Lu's script?

80
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,600
Because it felt so real.

81
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,961
True.

82
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,761
He put so much emotion into the role.

83
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,441
That's why you thought it was real.

84
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,281
So much emotion?

85
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,800
Do you mean Xu Guanrui?

86
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,001
I wouldn't take it seriously,
no matter how he acts.

87
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:46,800
I'm talking about you.

88
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:48,160
Me?

89
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:51,120
I was playing

90
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,321
a heartless netizen.

91
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,201
A jerk without feelings.

92
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,441
So,

93
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,169
will you be so direct

94
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,680
when you reject someone?

95
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,201
I don't do online chats.

96
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,920
Are you still going on blind dates?

97
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,410
If it's for your work,

98
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,680
you can ask me.

99
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,800
Anyway, you just want to see
if your jokes land,

100
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:30,961
there's no need to go so far away.

101
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,321
Liang Daiwen,

102
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,480
let me teach you a way
to capture emotions.

103
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:47,920
Metaphor.

104
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:50,809
When you feel certain emotions,

105
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,281
describe them with a metaphor.

106
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,680
For example,

107
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,600
if one day you meet someone you like,

108
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,730
you feel a gust or a storm

109
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:03,720
when looking at her.

110
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,650
When those feelings appear again,

111
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:08,689
you'll know

112
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,040
it's love.

113
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,410
Emotions are fleeting,

114
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,001
but you should at least recognize them.

115
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:20,049
Otherwise, you'll be a heartless netizen

116
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,560
who's far away from this world
by the internet.

117
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,689
When you feel such emotions,

118
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,530
it doesn't matter
if you can't understand them

119
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:29,081
or they make no sense,

120
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,560
describe them with a metaphor.

121
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:36,881
This is your first assignment.

122
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:39,480
Will you accomplish it?

123
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:43,841
Are you still going on blind dates?

124
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,640
It seems you really don't like
the idea of me going on blind dates.

125
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,761
Do you like going on blind dates?

126
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,049
I don't,

127
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,040
and I'm not going anymore.

128
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,641
Are you feeling better now?

129
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,040
Will you accomplish the assignment?

130
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,120
I will.

131
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,401
Very well.

132
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,120
An extra question.

133
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,201
Why do you lock the door
when you sleep?

134
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,800
My phone is synced
with your exercise record.

135
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:23,249
It woke me up
in the middle of the night.

136
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,360
I heard you bumping around in your room.

137
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,441
It was more disturbing
than sleepwalking.

138
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:27,929
Why?

139
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,609
Were you setting up
a magical formation in your room?

140
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,240
Or were you worried
I couldn't take care of you?

141
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,800
I don't want to sleep
on the floor again.

142
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,201
My body will fall apart.

143
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,970
Uh...

144
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,450
I wanted to carry you to your room,

145
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:46,809
but you were sleeping so soundly.

146
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,360
I couldn't move you.

147
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:50,360
My bad.

148
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:53,210
I'll look after you

149
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:54,360
like how I tend to the plants.

150
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,530
I'll set up a bed

151
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:57,201
wherever you lie down.

152
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,290
I will

153
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,410
water you,

154
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:01,321
loosen the soil around you,
and give you sunshine.

155
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,920
You can't even take care of the cactus.

156
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,240
But I can take good care of you.

157
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,009
With me around,

158
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,081
you'll have peaceful nights from now on.

159
00:08:56,211 --> 00:08:57,761
Before I go in,

160
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,560
I have something to ask you.

161
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,040
Do I get a treat if I'm right?

162
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:04,281
There's no right or wrong.

163
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,769
I just want to make sure

164
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,761
we're on the same page.

165
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,521
Go on.

166
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,001
Do you like me?

167
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:14,121
I do.

168
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,401
Since when?

169
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,401
When you returned my staff card.

170
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:21,930
Were you the one who exposed

171
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:23,409
the fake ultrasound?

172
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,320
Right.

173
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:26,881
Why did you help me?

174
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:29,401
Because you did nothing wrong.

175
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:31,481
They shouldn't have forced you
to apologize.

176
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:36,800
How were you so sure of that?

177
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,721
Do you know me?

178
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,800
What am I like

179
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:44,361
to you?

180
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,281
Pretty,

181
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,241
fragile,

182
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,200
naive,

183
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:53,170
or

184
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:54,440
sheltered?

185
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,601
You don't have to answer me.

186
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,680
Let me tell you.

187
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,361
I'm the opposite of those words.

188
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,200
I hate crowds.

189
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:10,001
Noisy occasions

190
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:11,800
make me anxious.

191
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,920
I was blind before.

192
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:17,320
I have had many relationships.

193
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,401
I have loads of negative labels on me.

194
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:23,521
My parents think
I've brought shame to them

195
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,001
to the point they almost disowned me.

196
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,761
I've resigned. I'm jobless.

197
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:31,401
I leech off my parents.

198
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,601
I'm also seeing a therapist.

199
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:37,721
I was told

200
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,521
that I'm incapable of love.

201
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,361
I've liked many strange men,

202
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,200
but I can't even recall their faces.

203
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:52,401
I only fell for them out of boredom.

204
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,001
But having a crush isn't really love.

205
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,170
You'll be disappointed
if you have expectations of me.

206
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:00,800
I expect nothing from you.

207
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,881
You say

208
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,960
having a crush isn't really love.

209
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,481
Are you sure?

210
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:13,521
Let's give it a try.

211
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:15,680
What if

212
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:17,361
it is love this time?

213
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,889
How was it, Mr. Yu?

214
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,401
Any good news?

215
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:35,001
(Neck Massager)
Gu,

216
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:39,521
now I know how difficult it is
to catch the star.

217
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,529
(Yu Dule)
What happened?

218
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,090
Didn't you send her home?

219
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,601
I did.

220
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,330
I was stopped at the doorstep.

221
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,850
I thought I'd cleared it.

222
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:48,800
Turns out

223
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:50,129
I was only at the first level.

224
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,080
What will happen between you, then?

225
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:54,960
Just keep dragging it out.

226
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,649
I get you.

227
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,200
Sisyphus.

228
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,440
Gu Yi,

229
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,881
we both will have

230
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,281
good endings, right?

231
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:14,001
We will.

232
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:16,930
All right. That's all.

233
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:17,690
I'm hanging up.

234
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:18,601
Bye-bye.

235
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:35,070
(To Xu Guanrui)

236
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,783

(Today's steps)

241
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,641
You said you could look after me well.

242
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,001
Can you even wake up

243
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,401
if I sleepwalk?

244
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,139
(Food cure. Exercise)

245

(Today's steps)

247
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,800
Was he sleepwalking again?

248
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:14,080
I didn't hear anything.

249
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,560
If you want to go in,

250
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:51,800
just knock.

251
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:02,040
What are you

252
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,849
wearing?

253
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,619
(Extravagance and Beauties Massage)

254
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:08,930
Don't get the wrong idea.

255
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:11,560
It's a free gift that came
with the massager I bought for you.

256
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:21,441
Why did you buy this?

257
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,489
You said your body was falling apart

258
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,481
from sleeping on the floor.

259
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:26,970
It helps to reassemble your body.

260
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:28,241
Just in case.

261
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,281
You bought it for me?

262
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,961
Of course.

263
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:36,560
I told you I'd look after you.

264
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:40,800
By the way,

265
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,201
where did you end up
after sleepwalking last night?

266
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:49,481
I slept soundly.

267
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:51,481
I was wrong about you.

268
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:55,761
I see.

269
00:17:57,971 --> 00:17:59,281
Where did he sleep then?

270
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,630
(Nextmonday)

271
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,521
What's going on here?

272
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:36,210
Roger came back early

273
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:38,450
and also moved up the selection
for the supplement's person in charge

274
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,800
to next Monday.

275
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:42,009
Wasn't it on next Friday?

276
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,080
How could he change it just like that?

277
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,690
I still have a lot more to review.

278
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,040
It's the messed-up couple to blame.

279
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,450
That guy came here
just for tea last time,

280
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:52,040
and now he's bringing
an investment contract for an entrapment.

281
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,450
Given Jacqueline's personality,

282
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:55,809
do you really think she'd fall for it?

283
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,880
The Demoness ignored him.

284
00:18:57,891 --> 00:19:00,089
But somehow, her ex managed

285
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,970
to make Roger return

286
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:03,201
on a red-eye flight.

287
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,241
That's why
the Demoness couldn't avoid it.

288
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,921
They're discussing it
in the meeting room now.

289
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:08,001
Wait.

290
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:09,569
What does any of this

291
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,130
have to do

292
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:12,521
with the selection?

293
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,890
It's all because

294
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:15,489
of this sudden change.

295
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,730
The meeting room was scheduled
for next Friday to fit Roger's time.

296
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:19,809
Now that he's returned earlier,

297
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,800
we should stick with his schedule.

298
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,961
I understand what you're saying,
Mr. Huang.

299
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:40,769
However, the investment

300
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,241
isn't under my charge.

301
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:44,161
Please excuse me.

302
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:48,400
Please stay, Ms. Zhang.

303
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,880
Here's the thing.

304
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,761
Even though Ms. Zhang is not in charge
of the investment, she manages the business.

305
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,730
I need her help to tell me

306
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,840
what suitable projects we can discuss.

307
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,080
Ms. Zhang,

308
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:08,040
since Mr. Huang wants you to stay,

309
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:09,560
well,

310
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,761
please do us a favor
and stay for a while more.

311
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,009
Mr. Huang,

312
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,241
well,

313
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,481
shall we?

314
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,080
Of course.

315
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:31,690
Some parts are lacking.

316
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:33,489
I've already highlighted them.

317
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,721
Review it as quickly as possible

318
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,441
and send it back by the end of the day.

319
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,921
Thank you.

320
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:40,890
I'd prefer the supplement
as a thank-you.

321
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:41,880
Get moving.

322
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,961
No need.

323
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:51,800
Jacqueline,

324
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,640
as for the next theme

325
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,450
on the virtual idol holographic concert,

326
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:58,281
I promised to bring
Guan Xingxin with me.

327
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:00,681
Now that she has left Nextmonday,

328
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,481
I came here to check with you

329
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,890
how much impact this interview

330
00:21:04,891 --> 00:21:06,521
might have on us.

331
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:07,809
Your contract

332
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,880
didn't include maintaining
Nextmonday's reputation.

333
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:13,241
Before this, I was only
helping one person.

334
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,681
But now, I have a team.

335
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,201
It'll be bad for everyone if this messes up.

336
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,001
I'm doing this for your benefit.

337
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,009
Someone once told me

338
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,370
that things of no value

339
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:24,809
should be thrown away immediately,

340
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,721
including relationships and emotions.

341
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,360
Layla's comeback will surely turn the tables
in terms of her public acceptance.

342
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:32,721
It's not a bad thing
to have controversies.

343
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,080
Reputations can rise higher

344
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:36,120
unless they hit rock bottom.

345
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,489
Understood.

346
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,681
I'll play it by ear.

347
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:42,080
Hold on.

348
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:44,730
Gu Yi isn't familiar
with things like this.

349
00:21:44,731 --> 00:21:46,001
Get it outsourced.

350
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:49,281
Do you have any candidates?

351
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:53,823
(Huang Wenda)

352
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,769
Wipe your mouth.

353
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,400
All right.

354
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:16,080
I've heard from Jacqueline

355
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,761
that you're good at maintaining clients.

356
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:21,481
I didn't believe it at first.

357
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,400
But after today's event,

358
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:27,040
I think you're smart.

359
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,040
Smart people

360
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,880
should be placed in smarter roles.

361
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:38,040
The head of the supplement,

362
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,360
do you like it?

363
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,489
(Qingya, happy birthday)
That's it?

364
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,730
Your junior is so ungenerous.

365
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:13,560
Only a piece of paper
for your birthday present?

366
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,569
She likes it.

367
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,761
She's making a man out of him.

368
00:24:23,371 --> 00:24:24,921
Ms. Zhang, you asked for me?

369
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,840
Ask Liang Daiwen to come up.

370
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,880
Oh, right, Ms. Zhang.

371
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,089
HF Design Company's admin sent a message

372
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,840
asking if you need to increase the budget
for the annual dinner's prizes.

373
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:36,721
Is Liang Daiwen going?

374
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,569
If so,

375
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,040
add ten more flagship phones.

376
00:24:39,451 --> 00:24:40,650
His graphic tablet is old.

377
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:41,800
Get him a new one.

378
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,600
Is that included in the budget?

379
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:46,690
No, use my individual account.

380
00:24:46,691 --> 00:24:47,761
Get the best tablet.

381
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,521
Understood.

382
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,560
This is a newly drafted contact.

383
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:12,040
Review it and see if
there's anything missing.

384
00:25:18,731 --> 00:25:19,890
Take a look.

385
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:21,521
I may have missed out on something.

386
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,281
Qingya,

387
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,161
I want to resign.

388
00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:30,281
What do you mean?

389
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,761
The term is up.

390
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:35,961
I want to do something I truly want.

391
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:41,400
And what is it that you want to do?

392
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:43,880
Accessibility design again?

393
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,730
Is it because I've given you
the best offer,

394
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:47,640
and you're making money too easily?

395
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:50,320
Is your gratitude for me
and our relationship only worth five years?

396
00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:51,690
The moment the term is up,

397
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:53,761
you leave to do charity work
for disabled people?

398
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,600
I don't think HF Design Company ever
lacks new designers who serve wealthy clients.

399
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,130
Liang Daiwen,

400
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:01,880
think this through.

401
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,600
I've already given it a serious thought.

402
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,360
Have you made up your mind?

403
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:10,360
Yes, I have.

404
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:17,320
I know you won't be easily swayed
once you make a decision.

405
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,080
I won't force you either.

406
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:21,560
But you should give me some time.

407
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:23,049
At least allow me

408
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,840
to find someone to replace you.

409
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:27,360
There are new designers
who need opportunities.

410
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:30,921
I'll tie up all loose ends
before I leave.

411
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:38,001
All right.

412
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:40,560
There's a client

413
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,849
who specifically requested
the best designer I have.

414
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,800
There's no one more suitable than you.
Please do me this favor.

415
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:48,009
Complete this draft,

416
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,201
and I'll let you go.

417
00:26:54,411 --> 00:26:55,320
Okay.

418
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,690
Come on

419
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:23,049
and have a look.

420
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,769
(Gu Yi: Mr. Liang, I'll be working late tonight.)
You don't want to miss the best deal.

421
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,839
(Liang Daiwen: OK.)
Christmas Eve

422
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,521
(Gu Yi: Merry Christmas Eve.)
with peace apples.

423
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,320
(Eat an apple for me.)
May your family be happy and lucky.

424
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:33,040
Handsome,

425
00:27:33,171 --> 00:27:34,400
it's Christmas Eve.

426
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,489
Buy a peace apple
for your girlfriend.

427
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,210
Look at them.

428
00:27:37,211 --> 00:27:38,690
My apples

429
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,080
are fresh

430
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:41,521
and red.

431
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:43,769
How much is it?

432
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,730
Thirty.

433
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:45,650
They just arrived today.

434
00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:47,610
Look at them. They are fresh.

435
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:48,640
Over here.

436
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:51,130
(Shen Zhimin)

437
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:52,410
We're selling at a fair price,

438
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:53,249
you know?

439
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,761
Hello? Is this Price Bureau?

440
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,521
Hey, don't.

441
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,610
Well, you don't have to do that.

442
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,089
Right?

443
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,560
How much is this?

444
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,441
Fifteen.

445
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:05,281
Fifteen, is that okay?

446
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:06,489
I'll take one.

447
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,640
Sure.

448
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,721
You see, the business is tough.

449
00:28:10,971 --> 00:28:12,089
So tough.

450
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,001
Jeez.

451
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,640
I can't even ride back.

452
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,840
Tough luck.

453
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,450
Why are you back?

454
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:08,880
It's raining outside.

455
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:10,130
I came to get the umbrella.

456
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:10,849
Did you get wet?

457
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,809
Here are some tissues.

458
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:12,961
Here.

459
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,049
Are you not leaving yet?

460
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,721
I'm not done yet.

461
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:20,961
Today's Christmas.

462
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,080
Do give the Santa face.

463
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:27,289
If the Santa can
give me a quick promotion,

464
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,681
I'll get off work right away.

465
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:32,560
All right.

466
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,201
It's saved.

467
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,840
Why?

468
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:39,370
Everyone has left to celebrate.

469
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:40,921
No one will spread rumors about us.

470
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,400
Let's go

471
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,281
grab something hot.

472
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:44,930
I...

473
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:46,120
It's on me.

474
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,249
- Okay.
- Do it later.

475
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,049
Okay.

476
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,249
Stop pushing the chair.

477
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,600
You can do it later.

478
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,001
It's heavy rain.

479
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,961
Gu Yi,

480
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,921
hold this.

481
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,249
No need. I'm not that weak.

482
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:06,930
Don't put that on me.

483
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,921
It's the time of times.

484
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:11,400
You don't want to get sick
and lose to Penny, do you?

485
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,441
True, though.

486
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:16,569
- Hold it yourself.
- I'm holding the umbrella for you.

487
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,961
Take it.

488
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:11,040
Santa Claus,

489
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:13,001
time is almost up.

490
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,970
Even if you don't speak,

491
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:17,120
I'll charge you.

492
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,560
Gu Yi went on a blind date.

493
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:24,840
That's normal.

494
00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:26,800
Humans have emotional needs.

495
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,329
Is that

496
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,961
bothering you?

497
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,761
I'm uncomfortable.

498
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:33,681
Uncomfortable?

499
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:36,840
Is it because she went on a blind date

500
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,210
or because her focus

501
00:31:38,211 --> 00:31:39,560
isn't on you?

502
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,800
To be frank,

503
00:31:47,131 --> 00:31:48,210
I'm pretty glad

504
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:50,040
to see you in this condition.

505
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,241
I think this is the first time

506
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:56,529
you're speaking of troubles
as an ordinary man, not just as a patient,

507
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,360
after all these consultations.

508
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,761
Actually, as for why
you're uncomfortable,

509
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,201
you know the answer.

510
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,400
It's simple.

511
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:12,329
Your body realizes your emotions

512
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,921
before your brain does.

513
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,001
You're jealous.

514
00:32:21,211 --> 00:32:22,320
I'm jealous

515
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,560
because of Gu Yi?

516
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,690
You're well aware

517
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:29,040
of how Gu Yi feels about you.

518
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:31,089
You'll have to

519
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,040
talk this through one day.

520
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:35,849
Given your personality,

521
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,970
once you do,

522
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:38,800
both of you are done.

523
00:32:39,211 --> 00:32:41,809
Waiting for someone else's
feelings to disappear

524
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,921
isn't hard for you.

525
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,210
But do you know?

526
00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:48,529
Feelings won't just go away,

527
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,880
they transfer.

528
00:32:50,411 --> 00:32:54,450
Jealousy is a sign from your body

529
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:57,001
telling you don't want
this relationship to disappear.

530
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:03,640
She taught me

531
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,880
that when I have emotions,

532
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,001
I can describe them with a metaphor.

533
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:11,441
I didn't get it at first.

534
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:23,880
But when I saw her leaving
with another man

535
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,201
at the office,

536
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,800
I suddenly

537
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:38,360
have this feeling.

538
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,761
It's like someone taking

539
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:45,721
the apple I was going to buy.

540
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:53,640
That's a good one.

541
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,921
I got it.

542
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,489
Listen,

543
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,849
we have two options now.

544
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:00,681
First,

545
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,849
take the apple and go to her.

546
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,289
Follow your heart for once

547
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,721
and see what happens.

548
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,201
Second,

549
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:12,800
we'll sit on the sofa

550
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,320
and share the apple

551
00:34:14,611 --> 00:34:16,929
without trying anything
outside the plan.

552
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,530
Then, you go home, take the painkiller,

553
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:19,761
and go straight to bed.

554
00:34:20,131 --> 00:34:21,570
Pretend you feel nothing

555
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:23,041
today.

556
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,721
You didn't approve of me
stepping into a relationship.

557
00:34:40,691 --> 00:34:42,201
It's not that I look down on you.

558
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:45,440
You still have a long way to go

559
00:34:45,491 --> 00:34:46,721
before entering one.

560
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,000
Go ahead.

561
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:16,400
Liang Daiwen?

562
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:20,161
I'm Gu Yi's colleague.

563
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:21,641
We met before.

564
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,081
Xu Guanrui.

565
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,400
I remember you.

566
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,201
Are you here for Gu Yi?

567
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,130
She's working overtime tonight.
It might take a bit longer.

568
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:29,081
I know.

569
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:30,721
I came here to give her something.

570
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,281
Don't touch my apple.

571
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:40,880
An apple?

572
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:42,840
Right, it's Christmas.

573
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,320
44th floor.

574
00:35:56,091 --> 00:35:56,849
Thank you.

575
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,920
You're welcome.

576
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,960
I just want Gu Yi to be happy.

577
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:21,081
That startled me.

578
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,400
Why is the power out?

579
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,360
Is the breaker tripped?

580
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,960
I'll go check it out.

581
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:48,400

Mr. Liang went home after work

604
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:54,130
and came to Nextmonday,

605
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,201
but he didn't go in.

606
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,641
Instead, he went to Dr. Shen's

607
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:59,289
and then returned here again afterward

608
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,041
and stayed until now.

609
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,960
Does he know anyone at Nextmonday?

610
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:05,449
Not that I know of.

611
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,369
But I think Jacqueline

612
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,201
had an interview with Mr. Liang before.

613
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,489
(Written by Gu Yi)

614
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:18,440
Gu Yi?

615
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,400
Look into this name.

616
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,721
Understood.

617
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,960
Ms. Zhang, he's out.

618
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,920
I... I'm not cold.

619
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,161
I'm hot.

620
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:55,121
Wait for me in the car.

621
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:14,929
Regarding the design,

622
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,690
refer to the latest draft

623
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:17,849
from Fenqi's chief designer.

624
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,360
The client wants the final result.

625
00:40:20,611 --> 00:40:22,081
Through drafts?

626
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:24,409
That might give them confidence

627
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,480
for further collaborations.

628
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:30,081
Why didn't you show them
Fenqi's final product, then?

629
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:32,530
That's their request.

630
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,081
We're only doing what they ask for.

631
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:36,281
Are you doubting me?

632
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,360
When did you get a girlfriend?

633
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:57,360
She's just a friend.

634
00:41:03,571 --> 00:41:04,601
Qingya.

635
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,121
Ask away.

636
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,721
Who is she?

637
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:45,570
HF Design Company's investor.

638
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:46,761
She's also my senior.

639
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,730
When I was studying design
in college,

640
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:51,281
she guided me.

641
00:41:51,731 --> 00:41:53,281
She got me this job.

642
00:41:55,531 --> 00:41:57,960
So she's someone very important?

643
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:04,800
She's not my girlfriend.

644
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:08,170
Why are you explaining to me?

645
00:42:08,171 --> 00:42:09,601
I didn't think that way.

646
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:14,840
I don't want to get distracted
from the real business.

647
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,520
What real business?

648
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,800
It's the company's annual dinner.

649
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:21,201
Would you

650
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,761
be interested in performing?

651
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,161
Three thousand for the appearance fee.

652
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:33,000
Is your favor worth that much?

653
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,320
It's not a favor.

654
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:37,920
I saw an HR event notice.

655
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:40,010
There are no restrictions

656
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:41,400
on performers.

657
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:45,969
So, are you interested?

658
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,320
Yes.

659
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:49,840
But

660
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,730
what if your colleagues find out

661
00:42:51,731 --> 00:42:53,480
you recommended me,

662
00:42:53,491 --> 00:42:55,369
and I mess up the show?

663
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,400
It's fine.

664
00:42:57,051 --> 00:42:59,081
I don't know any of them anyway.

665
00:42:59,171 --> 00:43:00,480
Even if you mess up,

666
00:43:00,531 --> 00:43:02,121
it won't affect my job.

667
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,520
Besides...

668
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,840
(Besides, you're fine)

669
00:43:08,131 --> 00:43:10,320
(losing a job for me?)

670
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,840
Besides, it's a dinner.

671
00:43:15,091 --> 00:43:17,360
You don't have to do research
like the car exhibition.

672
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:39,641
Do you feel something?

673
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:41,601
Feel what?

674
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:46,681
