=Episode 23=

25
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:57,914
Mr. Xu has decided on the band

26
00:01:57,914 --> 00:01:58,994
and their performance date.

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,632
The procedures
have been completed as well.

28
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,515
As for the makeup team
and choice of hotel,

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,104
they will be sent
to the group gradually.

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,568
The time for the interview and
photoshoot have been scheduled as well.

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,992
Have you guys checked out the venue?

32
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,592
Mr. Xu went to check out
the venue himself.

33
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:10,472
There should be no issue.

34
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:12,155
Xu Guanrui is good at everything.

35
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,432
It's just that he's too particular.

36
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:14,875
Monitor his progress.

37
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:16,234
Okay.

38
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:26,155
Hello, Mr. Xu. What's the matter?

39
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:26,875
Gu Yi,

40
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:29,064
the contract for the event
has been sent to the company.

41
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:30,634
Can you deliver it to me?

42
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,470
Aren't you returning to the company?

43
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:35,155
I sprained my waist
when I was checking out the venue.

44
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:37,155
I can't move now.

45
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:40,430
Alright. Please wait a moment.

46
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,384
I'll head there in a moment.

47
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,296
I'll send you the address.

48
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:43,030
I'll wait for you.

50
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:32,514
Mr. Xu.

51
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:47,875
Gu Yi.

52
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:51,736
I've been waiting for a long time.

53
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:55,194
I've always been waiting for
the best opportunity.

54
00:03:58,835 --> 00:03:59,954
In the past, I thought

55
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:02,634
reward without expectation

56
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:04,555
was the best.

57
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:08,194
It's just like
how you appeared beside me.

58
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,954
That's why I'm holding on
with the utmost patience.

59
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:16,472
I wanted to develop
a natural relationship with you.

60
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,275
But I missed out on
a lot of opportunities.

61
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:24,554
Now,

62
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:28,344
I want to do something
that I should've done long ago.

63
00:05:02,874 --> 00:05:04,075
Since then,

64
00:05:06,794 --> 00:05:08,835
I never dreamt about stars again.

65
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:14,155
When you do get to dream,

66
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:17,155
you become a romantic kid.

67
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:29,595
Gu Yi,

68
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:32,755
as long as you're willing

69
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:35,354
you can embrace

70
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:37,835
my entire sky.

71
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:47,434
Sorry.

72
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,470
Since you're apologizing, that means
you already have an answer in mind,

73
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:55,635
right?

74
00:05:58,794 --> 00:05:59,674
Mr. Xu,

75
00:06:01,354 --> 00:06:02,755
you're an important friend of mine.

76
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:05,035
You kept me company

77
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:06,515
when I faced difficulties

78
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:08,234
during my lowest moments.

79
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:10,075
I'm very grateful to you.

80
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,616
But compared to Liang Daiwen,
you occupy a different position

81
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,234
in my heart.

82
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:23,395
I cannot lie to you.

83
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:25,635
That's why

84
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:28,955
I have to say sorry.

85
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:40,710
I've watched over you for a long time.

86
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:43,590
But now, I still have to let you go.

87
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:46,994
I feel quite unsatisfied.

88
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,664
I knew that you would
choose Liang Daiwen.

89
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:57,994
However,

90
00:06:59,955 --> 00:07:01,395
if he doesn't cherish you,

91
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:05,835
you shouldn't tolerate him.

92
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:08,354
I'm still around.

93
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,195
You look beautiful today.

94
00:07:58,035 --> 00:07:58,794
Thank you.

96
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:22,395
Gu Yi.

97
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:24,595
Nice to meet you.

98
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:26,994
I'm Li Ai.

99
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:28,715
I'm the same as Liang Daiwen.

100
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,088
I do accessible designs as well.

101
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,910
His reputation
hasn't been the best lately.

102
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:34,475
I'm his cheat code.

103
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:37,954
Have we met before?

104
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:39,434
We haven't.

105
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:41,074
However,

106
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,235
I've seen your portrait before.

107
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:48,954
I'll tell you a secret.

108
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:52,115
He often drew portraits of you

109
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:53,594
when he was overseas.

110
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,240
He did a great job at it too.

111
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:56,995
However,

112
00:08:57,554 --> 00:08:58,714
you look more beautiful in person.

113
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:01,074
What about this?

114
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:02,914
I'll show you some of them in secret

115
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:04,635
when you come to our workshop next time.

116
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:07,554

This is Mr. Li Ai.

119
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:20,120
He's the teammate
I brought back from abroad.

120
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:21,794
He excels at designing
accessible designs.

121
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:23,864
He would've been the main speaker
for the lecture

122
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,160
had it not been because of his jet lag.

123
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:26,395

She's the person I like.

00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:50,875

00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,355

Is this what you meant
by a quicker method?

00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:36,475
It is.

00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:38,235
Have fun.

00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:41,275
what are you doing?

139
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:42,875
Are you proposing to me?

140
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:47,074
Don't get ahead of yourself.

141
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:49,288
Have a seat.

142
00:12:54,952 --> 00:12:56,790
If there's nothing else,
I'll make a move first.

Ms. Gu.

144

Ms. Gu?

145
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,914
I just paid a seven-figure penalty
for breach of contract.

The hotel room isn't cheap, you know?

149
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:20,794
Have a seat.

150
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:27,635
You...

151
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:31,194
You won't film another
weird transformation clip, right?

152
00:13:58,235 --> 00:13:59,155
So,

153
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:01,355
how have you been lately?

154
00:14:04,674 --> 00:14:05,954
I've been great.

155
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:08,984
I'm doing the opposite.

156
00:14:09,096 --> 00:14:09,830
That's great to hear.

157
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:13,755
I've watched plenty of TV dramas.

158
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:15,914
What do you mean?

159
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:18,115
There's a Sci-Fi drama.

160
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:20,536
The plot is about the male lead
making a robot identical to him

161
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:22,590
so that it can protect his wife.

162
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:25,155
His wife spent a lot of time

163
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,194
with the robot.

164
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:30,875
Everything changed after the robot

165
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,714
started to develop
feelings and emotions.

166
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:35,914
After I finished it, I thought to myself

167
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:42,434
that I was also a robot
that was changed by you.

168
00:14:46,914 --> 00:14:48,035
I lied to Zhang Qingya

169
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,115
that you were a bet made by me and Shen.

170
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:54,235
I was wrong.

171
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:57,314
Of all the people,

172
00:14:58,554 --> 00:14:59,515
you chose me.

On the day we met,

174
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,008
there were plenty of people at Ounce,

175
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:11,074
yet you developed an interest in me.

176
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:12,510
You don't say?

177
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,896
You were the only one who didn't smile.

178
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:16,794
I don't care.

179
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:18,434
Anyway,

180
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:19,314
you've chosen me.

181
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:21,834
I'm yours now.

182
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:30,870
What are you doing?

00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:32,355
What are you doing?

184
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,074
Stop right there.

185
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:49,594
Liang Daiwen,

186
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:51,155
can you stop messing around?

187
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:58,035
Hello?

00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:00,434
Gu Yi.

189
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:02,954
Hello?

190
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:04,794
Gu Yi?

191
00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:07,594
Hello?

192
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:09,194
Hello?

193
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,194
Fine.

194
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:11,194
What?

195
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,875
I'm Liang Daiwen,

196
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,674
who has undergone
hypnosis treatment overseas.

197
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:24,355
I know I was a jerk for leaving.

198
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:29,554
You can beat me up
or reprimand me all you like

199
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:30,674
after I come back.

200
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:34,515
You can be angry at me
or just ignore me.

201
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:36,594
But can you...

202
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,875
Can you please not dislike me?

203
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:48,954
And...

204
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:50,875
And,

205
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:53,515
can you please

206
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,834
not accept Xu Guanrui's confession?

207
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:02,594
At least

208
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:04,435
you should give me a chance.

209
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:36,354
I suddenly

210
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:37,715
feel hungry.

211
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:41,515
Let's have a meal.

212
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:44,035
Let's go.

213
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:45,390
Let's have a meal.

214
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:50,475
What are we having?

215
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:51,874
You want to have a meal with me?

216
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:01,594
I'll serve the dishes later.

217
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:02,435
Thank you.

218
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:04,794
Liang Daiwen,

219
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:06,915
how much exactly did you drink?

220
00:18:10,874 --> 00:18:11,235
Just

221
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:12,275
a little.

222
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:22,235
Promise me this.

223
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:24,354
Can you please finish this meal quietly

224
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:25,554
without misbehaving,

225
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:26,114
okay?

226
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:27,275
Okay.

227
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:39,670
What are you doing? Put it on.

228
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:48,834
Sit down.

229
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,110
These are purple sweet potatoes.

230
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,230
These are red sweet potatoes.

231
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:02,074
You're my potato.

232
00:19:04,074 --> 00:19:04,715
Shut up.

233
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:05,715
These are scallops.

234
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:07,350
These are small scallops.

235
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:09,915
You're my baby scallop.

236
00:19:10,154 --> 00:19:11,394
Shut up!

237
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:15,235
Sorry about that.

238
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,328
I wasn't reprimanding you.

239
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:17,834
That's fine.

240
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:22,275
Shut up.

241
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:25,755
Let's have some cake.

242
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:31,235
Say goodbye to all your troubles.

243
00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:34,915
Say hi to happiness.

244
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:38,755
Dear, happy birthday!

245
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:41,154
Stay happy every day!

246
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:45,154
Say goodbye to all your troubles.

247
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:49,354
Say hi to happiness.

248
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:54,035
Dear, happy birthday!

249
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:59,035
Let's keep drinking.

250
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,354
Bottoms up!

251
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:04,435
Happy birthday!

252
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:05,515
Cheers!

253
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:17,354
They insisted on giving me a hat

254
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:18,675
for my effort.

255
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,190
This is for you.

256
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:38,915
Come here.

257
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:52,955
Liang Daiwen.

258
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:55,794
Wake up.

259
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:04,235
I'll leave if you don't sober up now.

260
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:22,394
What the heck is this?

261
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:24,554
You're awake now, huh?

262
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:29,390
What are you doing?

263
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:29,794
Sit down.

264
00:21:32,554 --> 00:21:33,715
I have a present for you.

265
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:45,955
Come.

266
00:21:52,314 --> 00:21:53,195
What is this?

267
00:21:58,634 --> 00:21:59,634
This is a present for you.

268
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:04,755
Who gave you permission
to print pictures of me?

269
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:09,275
Kid, let's play together.

270
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:15,275
What is this?

271
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:23,394
What are these?

272
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:25,715
I searched online

273
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:28,195
for presents that could
move your girlfriend to tears.

274
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:30,594
These are what I found.

275
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:39,634
What are these?

276
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:55,110
The health check-up reports

277
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:57,195
are meant for employee onboarding,

278
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:58,984
and were purchased through
a group package.

279
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:00,675
You're an unlucky person.

280
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:02,696
I'm sure you lose
your temper all the time.

281
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:05,114
I even added
a tumor screening test for you.

282
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:07,114
As for the credit card,

283
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:09,755
I registered it with my ID card.

284
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:12,114
The limit is one year's worth
of your rent.

285
00:23:13,195 --> 00:23:14,235
The password is your birthday.

286
00:23:14,504 --> 00:23:15,720
It's for emergency use.

287
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,096
You can use it all you like.

288
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:18,195
I'll repay it.

289
00:23:21,394 --> 00:23:22,074
And...

290
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:23,794
And,

291
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:25,992
this is the most important thing.

292
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,480
(Insurance Proposal)

293
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:39,955
I heard everything you said to me

294
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:42,515
through the CCTV.

295
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:47,794
This is my answer.

296
00:24:05,032 --> 00:24:07,016
(I'll come back to be with you
without going anywhere.)

297
00:24:07,016 --> 00:24:08,360
(Gu Yi, I love you. I'm very serious.)

298
00:24:14,074 --> 00:24:14,634
Tell me.

299
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,590
Why did you come back all of a sudden?

300
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,790
I came back to be together with you.

301
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:21,794
Tell me.

302
00:24:22,874 --> 00:24:23,915
Will you still be leaving?

303
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,430
Will you still be heading overseas?

304
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:27,594
I won't.

305
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:29,390
I won't go anywhere again.

306
00:24:33,594 --> 00:24:34,354
Liang Daiwen,

307
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,235
are you serious about this?

308
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:42,715
Gu Yi,

309
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:45,834
I love you.

310
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:49,035
I'm very serious.

311
00:24:49,035 --> 00:24:50,452
(Gu Yi, I love you. I'm very serious.)

312
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:13,394
Before this, Shen told me
to observe my reaction

313
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:16,874
during the moment I felt loved.

314
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:20,670
I've always been waiting for it.

315
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:24,794
It happened.

316
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,035
What was your reaction?

317
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:31,515
I'm done for.

318
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,955
I was already done for

319
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:41,834
when I felt loved.

320
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:45,475
Now, I only wish to love you.

321
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:49,715
Nothing else matters to me.

Liang Daiwen.

331
00:27:20,035 --> 00:27:20,834
Door unlocked.

332
00:27:24,328 --> 00:27:25,368
Why are you only back now?

333
00:27:28,435 --> 00:27:29,035
I...

334
00:27:29,874 --> 00:27:30,594
I met a friend.

335
00:27:41,475 --> 00:27:42,314
A friend?

336
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:44,475
Liang came back, right?

337
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:46,790
What are you talking about?

338
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:47,928
I don't understand you at all.

339
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:49,720
You're still pretending, huh?

340
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:51,874
Do you think

341
00:27:51,955 --> 00:27:53,235
you can hide secrets from me?

342
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:55,874
Fine, fine. You're the best.

343
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:57,554
You're the Great Meixia indeed.

344
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:02,114
I won't ask you two

345
00:28:02,984 --> 00:28:03,950
about your relationship.

346
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:06,515
But I want you to answer this question.

347
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:08,435
Do you still fancy him?

348
00:28:12,154 --> 00:28:12,794
I do.

349
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:15,834
But I'm no longer obsessed with him.

350
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:19,190
In the past,
whenever I was together with him,

351
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:20,834
I felt like I was floating.

352
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:22,995
I felt inferior.

353
00:28:24,394 --> 00:28:25,554
I felt insecure too.

354
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:26,995
After he left,

355
00:28:27,515 --> 00:28:28,594
I actually felt better.

356
00:28:30,424 --> 00:28:31,750
Anyway, love isn't the only thing

357
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:33,235
that exists in life.

358
00:28:34,394 --> 00:28:35,755
I've already tried my best to pursue it.

359
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,110
That's why I don't have any regrets.

360
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:39,475
Although I'm happy

361
00:28:40,154 --> 00:28:41,235
that he's back,

362
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:43,675
I don't wish
to return to the past again.

363
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:46,995
What if

364
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,150
you aren't returning to the past?

365
00:28:48,154 --> 00:28:49,235
What if it's a new beginning?

366
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:54,755
You see,

367
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:56,270
it's common for humans to err

368
00:28:56,354 --> 00:28:57,235
and mend their ways.

369
00:28:57,594 --> 00:28:59,235
Although some people travel slowly,

370
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,910
you might be their only destination.

371
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:05,874
Maybe.

372
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:09,834
But I think my current life
is good enough.

373
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:13,074
I can hug the Great Meixia

374
00:29:13,074 --> 00:29:15,035
and lead a comfortable life.

375
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,027
(Lu Ming: Do you want to do
a comedy gig at Fuzzy?)

376
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,471
(Corner Fuzzy)

377
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,120
(Ounce Comedy Club)

378
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:43,912
Congratulations.

379
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,990
Cheers.

380
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:51,235
Sorry about this.

381
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:53,035
Although I can't do anything

382
00:29:53,035 --> 00:29:54,074
about the incident in Ounce,

383
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:55,634
Fuzzy is empty.

384
00:29:55,672 --> 00:29:56,728
You guys can use this place.

385
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:57,435
Really?

386
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,792
Are you sure we can use this place?

387
00:29:58,792 --> 00:29:59,384
Of course.

388
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:00,995
Although this venue is smaller,

389
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:02,874
it's better than the place
we had in 2014.

390
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,470
Do you guys still remember?

391
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:06,189
When Ounce first operated,

392
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,272
we didn't have a single audience.

393
00:30:07,634 --> 00:30:08,634
A girl in a wedding gown

394
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:10,074
barged into the club.

395
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,354
Only then we had our first audience.

396
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:13,154
After that, we found out

397
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,000
that she brought her PC
and worked overtime

398
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:16,229
until midnight

399
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,400
because her fiance deserted her.

400
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:19,176
She needed to take
the wedding photoshoot herself.

401
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:20,515
That's right.

402
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:21,789
In the end,

403
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,800
we even became the witnesses
to her marriage with her PC.

404
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,035
Back then, I just started
doing stand-up comedy.

405
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:28,568
I had to perform
alongside other comedians.

406
00:30:28,755 --> 00:30:30,755
I never expected myself
to persist for five years.

407
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:32,114
Young girl, you can do it.

408
00:30:32,715 --> 00:30:34,834
Let me become your
somewhat unreliable backer.

409
00:30:36,195 --> 00:30:36,675
Yu,

410
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:38,314
put up the signboard.

411
00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:39,995
Wait.

412
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:50,675
Mr. Lu.

413
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:53,195
Mr. Yu and Guan Xingxin

414
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:55,515
are an item now.

415
00:30:57,394 --> 00:30:57,995
I know.

416
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:00,634
Are you okay, then?

417
00:31:01,154 --> 00:31:02,275
Of course.

418
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:04,154
Yu is my buddy.

419
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:04,915
I'm happy for him.

420
00:31:08,456 --> 00:31:10,150
I've taken plenty
of orders lately as well.

421
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:11,314
My ex-wife said

422
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:13,435
she would consider a remarriage

423
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:15,160
if I could clear my debt by this year.

424
00:31:16,354 --> 00:31:18,035
I got a divorce before this
because of my debt.

425
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:19,550
I don't blame her at all.

426
00:31:20,872 --> 00:31:23,110
I only wish to return to
my daughter's side as soon as possible.

427
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:32,269
(Fuzzy's official comeback
stand-up comedy gig)

428
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,560
(has attracted quite a lot of audience.)

429
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:36,435
(Most of them are fans
of Ounce's stand-up comedy.)

430
00:31:37,435 --> 00:31:38,275
(The rest of them)

431
00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:39,928
(are youngsters
from the nearby neighborhood)

432
00:31:39,928 --> 00:31:41,256
(who came upon this place by accident.)

433
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:42,150
Please line up, okay?

434
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,496
(People from all corners of the world)

435
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:46,275
(gather here
thanks to a chance encounter.)

436
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:48,588
(Ounce Comedy Club)

437
00:31:55,634 --> 00:31:56,715
Welcome.

438
00:31:57,074 --> 00:31:57,715
I'm very happy

439
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:59,554
to see a lot of new friends today.

440
00:31:59,915 --> 00:32:01,114
There are some old friends as well.

441
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:03,594
This microphone is pretty quiet.

442
00:32:04,074 --> 00:32:05,074
But we have no choice.

443
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:06,634
Our neighbors are living upstairs.

444
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:07,874
We can't just allow them

445
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:09,074
to catch our show for free,

446
00:32:09,288 --> 00:32:09,830
am I right?

447
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:14,475
Fuzzy

448
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:16,235
was a bar before this.

449
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:18,794
When the boss isn't operating it,

450
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:20,435
he'll rent it
to the drama students nearby

451
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:21,768
for them to rehearse their plays.

452
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,070
He didn't do it for the money.

453
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,456
He did so to seek peace.

454
00:32:25,035 --> 00:32:26,035
But after that, he told me

455
00:32:26,072 --> 00:32:27,464
that he no longer
sought peace.

456
00:32:27,464 --> 00:32:28,504
He felt lonely.

457
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:29,915
That's why he rented it to me.

458
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:31,475
It's because we hold

459
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:34,394
two stand-up comedy gigs per week.

460
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:37,634
Excellent!

461
00:32:38,755 --> 00:32:40,314
But then again,
this is just the beginning.

462
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:42,675
We can't guarantee
that all performers will get paid.

463
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,354
Please keep this a secret.

464
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,594
The performers have no idea about this.

465
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,394
But I can guarantee this.

466
00:32:51,074 --> 00:32:52,515
We have the best performers here.

467
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:53,912
And, they deliver the best performances.

468
00:32:54,314 --> 00:32:56,314
I'm sure you guys will be entertained.

469
00:32:56,915 --> 00:32:57,515
Thank you.

470
00:33:06,715 --> 00:33:08,235
Hello, everyone. I'm Gu Yi.

471
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:15,995
It's been so long since I did
stand-up comedy.

472
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,035
I'm very thankful to Mr. Lu

473
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:20,154
for saving us from unemployment.

474
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,808
There's something good about
doing stand-up comedy at Fuzzy.

475
00:33:23,154 --> 00:33:25,114
Mr. Lu doesn't have a bar license.

476
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:26,600
He cannot sell alcohol here.

477
00:33:27,195 --> 00:33:27,829
This way,

478
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,984
it'll greatly reduce the chance

479
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:30,568
of the performers getting drunk.

480
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:31,675
Of course,

481
00:33:31,736 --> 00:33:34,030
it also significantly reduces
the number of performers and crew.

482
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,928
I've fallen out of love lately.

483
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:44,675
The guy told me
that he was going abroad.

484
00:33:45,394 --> 00:33:45,794
I said,

485
00:33:46,394 --> 00:33:47,715
"Could you take me with you?"

486
00:33:48,314 --> 00:33:48,955
He said no.

487
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,992
I decided to break up with him
right after that.

488
00:33:52,755 --> 00:33:54,515
I don't like such tasteless men.

489
00:33:55,554 --> 00:33:56,195
Excellent words!

490
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:57,235
Excellent!

491
00:34:01,435 --> 00:34:02,794
After I broke up with him,

492
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,190
it felt like my soul left my body.

493
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,755
I did a lot of things
that were beyond belief.

494
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,310
I bumped into the tree while walking.

495
00:34:10,056 --> 00:34:11,688
When I rode my bike onto the bridge,

496
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:12,915
I got soaked.

497
00:34:14,074 --> 00:34:15,395
My mental state was terrible.

498
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:17,795
But soon enough, I calmed down.

499
00:34:18,594 --> 00:34:19,835
It's because I got a fever

500
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:20,835
after getting soaked.

501
00:34:21,674 --> 00:34:22,995
To keep me company, my best friend

502
00:34:23,114 --> 00:34:24,074
had a fever as well.

503
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:26,795
Maybe he was

504
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:28,154
too enthusiastic.

505
00:34:34,995 --> 00:34:36,594
He was such a great friend.

506
00:34:37,395 --> 00:34:39,395
He didn't recover
even after I'd recovered.

507
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:41,400
He tried to console me
while lying on the hospital bed.

508
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:42,915
He said, "Gu Yi,

509
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,395
you must stop making a mess of yourself.

510
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:47,150
You have to hang in there for my sake.

511
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:48,674
I'm dying over here."

512
00:34:53,915 --> 00:34:54,475
After that,

513
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:56,429
I borrowed an electric bike
from my friend

514
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,688
so that I could take it for a spin.

515
00:34:58,114 --> 00:34:59,835
It was refreshing
to cruise around the city.

516
00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:01,515
The bicycles were slower than me.

517
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,154
The cars were slower than me too.

518
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,754
I felt relieved at that moment.

519
00:35:07,234 --> 00:35:08,234
In my heart,

520
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,416
I said this to my ex-boyfriend,

521
00:35:09,915 --> 00:35:10,795
"Scum,

522
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:12,714
you don't want me, huh?

523
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:14,835
Do you know how many suitors I have?"

524
00:35:15,274 --> 00:35:15,754
Excellent!

525
00:35:19,795 --> 00:35:21,035
I started riding faster and faster.

526
00:35:21,835 --> 00:35:23,035
At that moment, it felt like

527
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:24,554
I was detached from the world.

528
00:35:24,554 --> 00:35:25,835
Love meant nothing to me at all.

529
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:28,395
I'm the most aloof and sacred woman

530
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:29,274
in the city

531
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:30,554
who's riding on a fast bike.

532
00:35:42,435 --> 00:35:42,795
Gu Yi.

533
00:35:44,536 --> 00:35:46,070
I've been looking for you
after the show.

534
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:47,995
I was drunk yesterday.

535
00:35:48,674 --> 00:35:49,074
I'm sorry.

536
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:55,634
Did you notice something?

537
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,030
You kept apologizing to me

538
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:58,114
ever since you came back.

539
00:36:02,154 --> 00:36:03,194
Did you actually mean the jokes

540
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:06,194
you delivered today?

541
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:09,315
Don't overthink it.

542
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:10,915
I didn't say them for you to hear.

543
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,754
And, I won't create any jokes

544
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,154
related to you in the future.

545
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:17,560
That means you mean them, right?

546
00:36:23,274 --> 00:36:23,915
I'm sorry.

547
00:36:25,074 --> 00:36:26,315
I returned to Dalian because...

548
00:36:26,315 --> 00:36:26,714
I know why.

549
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:29,594
Your father was terminally ill.

550
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,150
You had no choice but to go back.

551
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,736
If so, why didn't you tell me about it
when you were at the airport?

552
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,875
It was too sudden.

553
00:36:38,234 --> 00:36:39,554
Back then, I couldn't think straight.

554
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:41,790
I already felt guilty enough
to drag you into

555
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,144
the mess Zhang Qingya had created.

556
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:44,714
I also had no idea

557
00:36:44,714 --> 00:36:46,035
when I could return.

558
00:36:46,594 --> 00:36:48,035
I couldn't guarantee anything either.

559
00:36:51,016 --> 00:36:52,750
So now, can you please
give me one more chance?

560
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:56,510
So, you chose to hide it from me
after weighing the facts.

561
00:36:57,074 --> 00:36:58,915
You weren't willing
to tell me what happened

562
00:36:58,915 --> 00:36:59,835
even at the very end.

563
00:37:01,995 --> 00:37:02,515
I understand.

564
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,915
But that wasn't the worst moment.

565
00:37:09,274 --> 00:37:11,074
The worst thing was
that you made me doubt myself.

566
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:13,795
For a long time after you left,

567
00:37:13,795 --> 00:37:14,395
I kept wondering

568
00:37:14,674 --> 00:37:16,114
if you left me just like that

569
00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:17,315
because

570
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:18,714
I wasn't good enough for you.

571
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:21,288
Isn't it funny?

572
00:37:22,315 --> 00:37:23,475
It was obviously your issue,

573
00:37:24,248 --> 00:37:25,790
but I felt like I wasn't worthy enough.

574
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:31,515
Now,

575
00:37:31,634 --> 00:37:33,114
you're starting to feel something.

576
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:35,230
You've recovered your ability to feel

577
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:36,194
and gained confidence.

578
00:37:36,872 --> 00:37:38,750
That's why you think
we can give it another try.

579
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:42,795
But to me,

580
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:44,114
your alexithymia was never an issue.

581
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:47,194
I was upset
that you didn't need me at all.

582
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,915
To you, I'm just someone

583
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,915
you cling to when you feel good.

584
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:52,915
You ditch me

585
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:54,355
when you feel negative.

586
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:00,515
Now, you're back.

587
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:03,035
When you encounter another issue,

588
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:04,035
you'll push me away again.

589
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,395
I know you're sincere in your apology.

590
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:14,795
But maybe

591
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:18,795
we're not suitable for each other.

live well.

597
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:33,870

Mom, what are you doing?

607
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:20,114
You scared me.

608
00:39:20,714 --> 00:39:21,634
Speak for yourself.

609
00:39:22,056 --> 00:39:23,470
Why aren't you focusing on your meal?

610
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,488
How could you play with food?

611
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:26,594
Let's eat.

612
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,754
Did you argue with Liang again?

613
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:56,395
That's not it.

614
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:05,630
This is delicious.

615
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:19,234
I guess all of you
have heard about this.

616
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:20,910
Besides handling
the content of Nextmonday,

617
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:22,995
our content department needs

618
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:24,435
to take over Art List as well.

619
00:41:25,624 --> 00:41:28,190
Gu Yi was responsible for the
media's branch publication before this.

620
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:30,056
After both companies are merged,

621
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:31,554
she'll be the official editor-in-chief

622
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:33,234
for the company.

623
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:35,830
All personnel positions
will remain unchanged.

624
00:41:36,154 --> 00:41:36,754
All of her work

625
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:38,194
will be proofread by me directly.

626
00:41:39,554 --> 00:41:40,074
Gu Yi,

627
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:41,435
congratulations.

628
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:42,554
Congratulations.

629
00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:44,955
Deputy Director,
thank you for nurturing me.

630
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:46,475
Don't mention it.

631
00:41:49,035 --> 00:41:49,515
Ms. Zhang,

632
00:41:50,194 --> 00:41:52,234
let's go for a karaoke session
after work.

633
00:41:52,714 --> 00:41:53,355
Let's celebrate

634
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:54,835
Gu Yi's promotion.

635
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:56,776
You guys can go ahead.
I have a date to attend.

636
00:41:56,904 --> 00:41:58,136
I'll foot the bill for you guys.

637
00:41:59,035 --> 00:42:00,114
Sorry about that. I'm busy too.

638
00:42:00,355 --> 00:42:02,035
I still need to work after this.

639
00:42:02,915 --> 00:42:03,955
You still need to work?

640
00:42:04,234 --> 00:42:05,435
What kind of work?

641
00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:07,256
You're working immediately
after getting a promotion?

642
00:42:08,674 --> 00:42:09,395
Don't tell me

643
00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:11,194
you're going to do
another stand-up comedy gig?

644
00:42:11,714 --> 00:42:12,194
Gu Yi,

645
00:42:13,475 --> 00:42:14,515
you should join them.

646
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:15,976
You guys are colleagues, you know?

647
00:42:16,754 --> 00:42:17,515
Go and relax.

648
00:42:17,672 --> 00:42:18,670
You can work again after that.

649
00:42:20,114 --> 00:42:20,634
Alright now.

650
00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:21,634
Get back to work.

651
00:42:26,114 --> 00:42:27,154
Text me after work.

652
00:42:27,315 --> 00:42:27,955
Alright.

653
00:42:35,515 --> 00:42:36,395
Yi, are you actually going?

654
00:42:36,915 --> 00:42:37,554
I guess.

655
00:42:38,315 --> 00:42:39,875
I'll come up with a way
to escape after that.

656
00:42:40,714 --> 00:42:41,274
Take me with you.

657
00:42:59,154 --> 00:42:59,795
Yi,

658
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:01,955
what if they notice our absence?

659
00:43:02,554 --> 00:43:04,035
My voice is getting coarse.

660
00:43:04,488 --> 00:43:06,584
We just need to wait
until the fruit platter is here.

661
00:43:06,632 --> 00:43:07,710
When it comes to colleagues,

662
00:43:07,736 --> 00:43:09,048
there are just three words to abide by.

663
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:10,435
Mind your own business.

664
00:43:14,035 --> 00:43:14,594
Yi,

665
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:15,915
that sentence has four words.

666
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,910
It's only three words.

667
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:18,840
Leave me alone...

668
00:43:18,872 --> 00:43:19,848
It's the same thing.

669
00:43:19,995 --> 00:43:20,915
Learn from me.

670
00:43:22,456 --> 00:43:23,350
By the way, Yi,

671
00:43:23,448 --> 00:43:24,590
I haven't told you about this.

672
00:43:24,744 --> 00:43:26,264
When I went out for a meal yesterday,

673
00:43:26,475 --> 00:43:28,114
I encountered Demoness
and her ex-husband.

674
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:31,875
I finally understood what it meant
to be at loggerheads.

675
00:43:32,915 --> 00:43:34,274
They broke up back then

676
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:36,554
because Huang Wenda had an affair.

677
00:43:39,554 --> 00:43:41,509
Even so, Mr. Huang wanted
to headhunt his ex-wife

678
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,789
to be his business partner in Beijing.

679
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,600
He's offering her double
the salary and benefits too.

680
00:43:45,395 --> 00:43:46,754
Don't you think he's making

681
00:43:47,256 --> 00:43:49,336
this too obvious? He's trying
to rekindle their relationship.

682
00:43:49,955 --> 00:43:50,915
Has she agreed to it, then?

683
00:43:51,554 --> 00:43:52,475
She hasn't.

684
00:43:53,515 --> 00:43:54,194
But you see,

685
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,150
the conditions are too lucrative
for her to refuse him.

686
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,035
Although their love story

687
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:00,074
ended as a tragedy,

688
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:02,315
Demoness isn't that melancholic.

689
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:03,674
Profits above all else, you know?

690
00:44:04,616 --> 00:44:06,280
It's just that we'll lose a great leader

691
00:44:06,634 --> 00:44:08,274
if she leaves the company.

692
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:13,515
You call her Demoness every day.

693
00:44:13,848 --> 00:44:15,350
But it turns out that you like her, huh?

694
00:44:15,674 --> 00:44:17,554
Everyone likes a leader like her.

695
00:44:17,848 --> 00:44:18,910
Although she's a workaholic,

696
00:44:19,435 --> 00:44:20,035
her ability

697
00:44:20,154 --> 00:44:21,234
is unmatched.

698
00:44:21,955 --> 00:44:22,789
Observing her

699
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,200
is just like watching a Hong Kong drama.

700
00:44:26,634 --> 00:44:29,035
I did my internship here
all because of her.

701
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:30,234
If she leaves the company,

702
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:32,835
I feel like leaving as well.

703
00:44:33,395 --> 00:44:36,194
After all, it's hard
to find a parking spot near the company.

704
00:44:38,194 --> 00:44:39,315
You should learn from me, then.

705
00:44:39,435 --> 00:44:40,955
A bicycle is much easier to park.

706
00:44:44,424 --> 00:44:46,430
They bought it for me
after I became an official employee.

707
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:48,795
Yi,

708
00:44:48,824 --> 00:44:49,544
where are you going?

709
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:50,515
Let me send you there.

710
00:44:51,435 --> 00:44:52,355
No need for that.

711
00:44:52,395 --> 00:44:54,274
Our neighborhood doesn't like BMW.

712
00:44:54,808 --> 00:44:55,430
You should go.

713
00:44:55,714 --> 00:44:56,475
I'll hire a cab.

714
00:44:56,552 --> 00:44:57,110
Alright, then.

715
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:58,194
Goodbye.

716
00:44:58,475 --> 00:44:59,714
Goodbye.

717
00:45:07,395 --> 00:45:09,355
Why isn't my cab here yet?

718
00:45:12,154 --> 00:45:13,035
It's so cold out here.

719
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:30,795
Jacqueline?

720
00:45:32,754 --> 00:45:33,754
How did you end up so drunk?

721
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:35,835
Gu Yi,

722
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:37,995
what's wrong with your voice?

723
00:45:38,955 --> 00:45:40,389
Didn't you tell me to join them?

724
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,960
My voice became coarse
from all the singing.

725
00:45:45,594 --> 00:45:46,315
Come with me.

726
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:47,475
Let's go back to work.

727
00:45:48,074 --> 00:45:49,315
What are you talking about?

728
00:45:49,315 --> 00:45:49,835
Jacqueline!

729
00:45:50,035 --> 00:45:51,035
Don't throw up!

730
00:45:51,035 --> 00:45:51,835
Don't throw up here!

731
00:45:53,194 --> 00:45:53,634
Don't!

732
00:45:53,995 --> 00:45:54,554
Hang in there.

733
00:45:55,355 --> 00:45:56,355
I'll hire a cab for you.

734
00:45:56,515 --> 00:45:57,315
No need for that.

735
00:45:57,336 --> 00:45:58,200
No need for that.

736
00:46:06,395 --> 00:46:06,995
Zhang Junjie.

737
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:08,274
Wake up.

738
00:46:09,835 --> 00:46:10,915
Where do you live?

739
00:46:16,114 --> 00:46:16,754
Young girl,

740
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:17,992
I'm getting off work after this.

741
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:19,270
Where exactly is your destination?

742
00:46:20,435 --> 00:46:21,955
Please wait a moment.
I'll ask her again.

743
00:46:22,795 --> 00:46:23,554
Ms. Zhang?

744
00:46:23,674 --> 00:46:24,714
