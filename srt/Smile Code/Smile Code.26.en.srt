25
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:57,967
Come on, Mom.

26
00:01:58,447 --> 00:01:59,288
Can you manage?

27
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:00,087
Yes, I can.

28
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:00,768
Madam Wang's back.

29
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:02,247
Yu!

30
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:03,527
Mr. Yu.

31
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:05,327
Thanks for taking care of the cat.

32
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:06,688
I'll cook something delicious today.

33
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:07,880
You deserve a good meal tonight.

34
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:08,680
Thank you, Madam Wang.

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,768
It wasn't much trouble at all.

36
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:11,120
Maybe another time.

37
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:13,128
I'll come to have a drink
with you next time.

38
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:15,088
Tonight, I need to head
to the engine room.

39
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:19,927
Mom, I'll walk him out.

40
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,607
He'll

41
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,528
come for dinner next time.

42
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:22,479
Sure.

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,400
Alright, I'm leaving now.

44
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,720
Alright then, another time!

45
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:30,808
We're alone now.

46
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:31,647
So tell me,

47
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:32,248
what's up?

48
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,088
It's nothing.

49
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:36,607
I just wanted to ask you,

50
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:39,368
has Guan Xingxin been in touch
with you lately?

51
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:42,447
Did she say anything about me?

52
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:44,727
About you?

53
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:46,887
In what way?

54
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:48,167
Did you two have a fight?

55
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:50,688
No, we didn't.

56
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:53,927
How should I put it?

57
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:55,848
I just feel like

58
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:59,008
she might think I'm not good enough.

59
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:02,368
Don't overthink it.

60
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,727
I didn't overthink things
with Liang Daiwen.

61
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:06,800
And Guan Xingxin is way better
than Liang Daiwen,

62
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:08,088
that hopeless romantic.

63
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:11,128
That's different.

64
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:15,008
Not everyone is as steadfast as you two.

65
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:17,368
Guan Xingxin even said
she envies you two.

66
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:18,447
The two of you

67
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:20,327
never have any intrusive thoughts.

68
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:21,968
One is persistent,

69
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:23,167
and the other is unwavering.

70
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:25,047
No obstacle is too big

71
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,008
for you two.

72
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,848
Do you two have any intrusive thoughts?

73
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:33,767
I don't know.

74
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:39,299
Forget it. I don't want to think about it.

75
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,820
I still have to go to the
engine room tonight.

76
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:41,752
Go home and get some sleep.

77
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,008
You can sleep at my place.

78
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:44,688
No, not this time.

79
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:45,487
Your mom just arrived.

80
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:46,728
Spend some time chatting with her.

81
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:47,848
Besides,

82
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,647
I've moved back
to Ganquan Second Village,

83
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,408
remember?

84
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:54,288
Why move back to that dump?

85
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:55,528
It's closer to the engine room.

86
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:56,808
Saving money.

87
00:03:56,952 --> 00:03:58,080
When it's time to buy a house,

88
00:03:58,088 --> 00:03:59,528
I'll have saved enough
for a down payment.

89
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:01,887
Why not just move in with Guan Xingxin?

90
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:02,927
Wouldn't that save even more?

91
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:08,848
Her parents came over.

92
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:10,927
I met them briefly.

93
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:12,647
And then,

94
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,528
they kindly asked me to leave.

95
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:18,168
Bye.

96
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,536
(Xu Guanrui: There's an issue with
the contract, the deal might fall through.)

97
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:01,040
Mom.

98
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:02,847
I need to go out for something urgent.

99
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:03,728
You all eat first.

100
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:04,608
Don't wait for me.

101
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:05,488
Why the rush?

102
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:08,048
Going out to be some shady idol?

103
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:12,087
How did you know?

104
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:18,087
Don't ask.

105
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:19,728
He won't tell you.

106
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:23,967
Xin.

107
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:28,808
Think of it as an opportunity.

108
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:31,527
From now on,

109
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:32,688
all your work

110
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:34,248
must go through me and your dad.

111
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,008
If we don't approve,

112
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:37,544
you're not allowed to do it.

113
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:43,008
Xin.

114
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:45,808
Don't take it the wrong way.

115
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:49,287
We just think you're too green.

116
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,064
We're afraid someone will
take advantage of you.

117
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:52,368
Enough already.

118
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:55,608
Why can't you just be honest with her?

119
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:00,128
Xin.

120
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:03,008
I think the people you associate

121
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:05,568
with are just awful.

122
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:08,207
You're so beautiful.

123
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:10,344
You should have higher standards
when choosing a boyfriend.

124
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:11,967
At the very least,
someone like your dad,

125
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:13,128
handsome and accomplished.

126
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,160
How many times have I told you?

127
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:17,527
A girl must have self-respect
and self-love.

128
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,087
Self-respect and self-love!

129
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:23,008
Look at yourself.

130
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,488
Letting those toads

131
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,887
take advantage of a swan.

132
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:30,320
Who are you calling a toad?

133
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:31,527
He's my boyfriend.

134
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:32,928
Can't you show some respect?

135
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,368
I don't like him.

136
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:36,728
I don't want

137
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:37,928
to see him ever again.

138
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:39,407
He's a low-life.

139
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:40,568
He's not a low-life!

140
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:43,287
So, does that mean

141
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:45,207
every young man who doesn't live
by your standards

142
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:46,767
is a low-life?

143
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,180
You only met him once

144
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:49,350
and you've already written him off.

145
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:50,160
What is he to you?

146
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:51,967
A fly?

147
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,087
Trash or a beggar?

148
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:57,327
He's the one I love.

149
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,248
How can you talk to me like that?

150
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,967
Xin.

151
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:07,008
How can you talk to me like that?

152
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:11,368
Haven't we treated you well enough?

153
00:07:11,608 --> 00:07:13,488
Haven't we given you enough?

154
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:14,808
We bought you a house.

155
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,087
What more do you want from us?

156
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,527
In your heart,

157
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,207
are we less important than a thug?

158
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,008
Alright, put a lid on it,

159
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:23,608
will you?

160
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:24,368
Shut up.

161
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:25,647
You shut up!

162
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:29,928
Go ahead, speak.

163
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:31,488
Fine.

164
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:37,087
Fine.

165
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:38,207
Mom.

166
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:42,327
The house belongs to you.

167
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:45,608
I'm moving out.

168
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:49,568
Xin!

169
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:51,248
Xin!

170
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:06,368
The air here isn't great.

171
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:08,848
Well...

172
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:11,608
I still have some work to do.

173
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:13,128
You

174
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:14,047
make yourself at home.

175
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:25,807
We haven't seen each other in days.

176
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:28,208
Don't you have anything to say?

177
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:31,887
Nope.

178
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:34,448
Didn't your parents come over?

179
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:36,927
Spending more time with them

180
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,520
is the right thing to do.

181
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:45,527
My mom found out I wanted
to be a virtual idol.

182
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:47,448
She thinks it's shameful.

183
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:49,767
She made a scene at the office,

184
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:51,608
and I got replaced.

185
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:58,088
Dule.

186
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:00,600
I don't want to stay
at that home anymore.

187
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:03,088
Let's move in together.

188
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:08,368
And then what?

189
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:12,448
Spend the rest of our lives

190
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:15,400
hiding from your parents?

191
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:25,887
Go back.

192
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:27,968
This place

193
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,567
isn't suitable for you.

194
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:32,927
Lately, I've taken on a lot of jobs.

195
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:34,328
Honestly,

196
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:37,208
I won't have time for you.

197
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:21,527
Your mother

198
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,088
also passed away from illness.

199
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Have the pictures been confirmed
with the artist's team?

200
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:31,968
Not yet.

201
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:33,167
I'll send them now.

202
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:33,848
No need to.

203
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,480
The National Drama Award-winning
veteran actor

204
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,047
on our magazine cover

205
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:40,968
looks like Edward Scissorhands.

206
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,968
The lighting hit his face
like a flyswatter.

207
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,047
If this gets published,

208
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,767
we'll become a laughingstock.

209
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,407
Contact the artist's team.

210
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:50,968
Reshoot it.

211
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:52,807
Got it.

212
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:54,480
I'll ask them to arrange
another session.

213
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:55,047
Ask?

214
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,608
You're the content manager.

215
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:00,647
Are we the ones begging now?

216
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,687
You need to stand your ground
when negotiating.

217
00:14:04,488 --> 00:14:06,567
Even Gu Yi isn't afraid to reject
her client's drafts.

218
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:08,128
Haven't you learned how to be

219
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:09,767
an effective leader yet?

220
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:11,927
Understood.

221
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:15,592
Meeting adjourned.

222
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:23,128
Gu Yi.

223
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,720
These are my notes

224
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,040
from when I first started at Nextmonday.

225
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:27,767
Take a look.

226
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:30,687
You're so nice to me.

227
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:33,608
In all my years at Nextmonday,

228
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:34,728
I haven't seen many

229
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:35,647
down-to-earth

230
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:36,687
and hardworking employees.

231
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:38,088
You're one of the few.

232
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,047
Decent job on the public account revamp.

233
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:42,728
Keep monitoring.

234
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:44,167
Alright.

235
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:46,767
I said it was decent.

236
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:47,927
Don't get cocky.

237
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:49,647
Instead of grinning like a fool,

238
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,872
focus on scheduling your content.

239
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:55,887
Thank you, boss.

240
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:19,368
Madam Wang.

241
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:23,687
This is the gift I gave Gu Yi last time.

242
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:25,488
She returned it to me.

243
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:28,287
It's nice.

244
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:30,648
It looks like something you'd give.

245
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:37,687
The last time I video-called you,

246
00:15:37,848 --> 00:15:38,887
I was watering this plant.

247
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:52,887
This is my mom.

248
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,984
I haven't finished the drawing yet.

249
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:01,287
I can't quite remember
what she looked like.

250
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:20,647
Liang,

251
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:22,968
can you draw me?

252
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:24,767
When I pass away,

253
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:26,280
you can use this portrait

254
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:27,608
at my funeral.

255
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,647
I hope your mom likes Gu Yi too.

256
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,280
(Oncology Clinic No. 2)

257
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:21,527
Mom.

258
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:24,728
Why are you at the hospital?

259
00:17:25,248 --> 00:17:26,127
Are you feeling unwell?

260
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:28,008
It's nothing.

261
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,607
Next time, if you're unwell,
just tell me directly.

262
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:33,847
I can take leave from work
to accompany you.

263
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:35,928
It's okay.

264
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:37,847
Liang is here with me.

265
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:39,600
He's picking up the medicine right now.

266
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:41,087
What medicine?

267
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:42,728
What illness?

268
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:04,807
Stop reading.

269
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:06,327
It's pancreatic cancer.

270
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,888
Are you joking with me?

271
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:23,448
Who jokes about something like this?

272
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,008
It's true.

273
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:26,488
Late stage.

274
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:27,767
It's incurable.

275
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:38,248
It's okay, Mom.

276
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:39,888
I'll go talk to the doctor.

277
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:45,087
What's wrong?

278
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:45,968
What's wrong, Mom?

279
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:47,127
Don't move.

280
00:18:48,648 --> 00:18:49,847
It hurts.

281
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:00,087
Stay here and chat with me.

282
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:07,767
Yi,

283
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:11,648
I know what you want to ask the doctor.

284
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:15,928
Mr. He and I have already
consulted everyone.

285
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:19,367
The local hospital,

286
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:21,360
and the hospital in Donghai,

287
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,984
we've consulted them all.

288
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:24,488
It's incurable.

289
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:30,968
My body isn't fit for surgery either.

290
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:35,968
If I go through chemotherapy,

291
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:37,607
it's just

292
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:39,648
throwing money away,

293
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,904
enduring unnecessary suffering,

294
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:42,208
and buying a little more time.

295
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:45,928
It's okay, Mom.

296
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:47,327
Well,

297
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:48,807
if Donghai can't treat it,

298
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,208
we'll go abroad for treatment.

299
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:51,488
I have friends abroad.

300
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:52,488
They know good doctors.

301
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:54,367
I'll call them and ask.

302
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:57,047
Gu Yi,

303
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:00,567
I know it's difficult,

304
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:04,888
but you've grown up now.

305
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:08,248
It's time for you to make decisions.

306
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:12,488
If you want me to undergo treatment,

307
00:20:13,488 --> 00:20:14,968
I'll listen to you and be hospitalized.

308
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:19,408
But I've been strong my whole life.

309
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,367
I don't spend my final days
on a hospital bed.

310
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:41,208
Yi,

311
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:43,527
everyone

312
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:45,448
faces this day sooner or later.

313
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:49,287
I just hope

314
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,888
that you'll remember the Great Meixia

315
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,728
as a vibrant and lively woman.

316
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:14,567
There, there.

317
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:17,208
There, there.

318
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:18,168
There, there.

319
00:21:24,047 --> 00:21:24,847
There, there.

320
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:26,607
No more crying.

321
00:21:33,968 --> 00:21:34,807
There, there.

322
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:37,888
Does it hurt?

323
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:42,168
Yi, don't cry anymore.

324
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,488
I've sent your mom home.

325
00:23:16,248 --> 00:23:17,607
She transferred the house deed to me,

326
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:21,928
gave me her savings passbook

327
00:23:25,607 --> 00:23:26,728
and taught me how to cook.

328
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:32,127
She did everything she could
to bring us together.

329
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,607
It turns out she was preparing
for her departure.

330
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:41,807
She arranged everything

331
00:23:41,807 --> 00:23:42,607
before telling me.

332
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:48,008
Does this mean she has no regrets?

333
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:01,287
That day at home, I saw her
hiding her medical records.

334
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:05,807
I casually asked about it.

335
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:13,127
Why did I only ask casually?

336
00:24:15,127 --> 00:24:17,367
If I had just snatched the
medical records and read them,

337
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,807
maybe things wouldn't have
turned out this way.

338
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:26,047
She must have been ill for a long time.

339
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:28,968
It's all my fault.

340
00:24:46,488 --> 00:24:48,248
In the 20 years after my mom passed on,

341
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:51,127
I felt guilty every single day.

342
00:24:54,008 --> 00:24:55,327
I blamed myself for being too oblivious.

343
00:24:57,648 --> 00:24:58,527
I didn't notice how bad

344
00:24:58,527 --> 00:24:59,648
things had gotten for her.

345
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:05,648
I couldn't properly say goodbye to her,

346
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,488
nor did I spend enough time with her.

347
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:20,567
But you're different.

348
00:25:22,527 --> 00:25:23,567
You still have time.

349
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,921

(Ounce Comedy Club)

351
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:16,287
First,

352
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:17,767
I'd like to thank

353
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:18,728
Yu

354
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:19,847
and Liang.

355
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:22,327
You two fulfilled my wish

356
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:23,488
and allowed me to indulge myself

357
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:25,208
on this stage

358
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:26,607
where my daughter, Gu Yi,

359
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,607
once performed.

360
00:26:29,807 --> 00:26:31,648
Since I'm already on stage,

361
00:26:32,688 --> 00:26:34,168
I might as well perform, right?

362
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:37,888
Later, when I'm no longer around,

363
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:40,168
you can play this recording
at my memorial service.

364
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:41,968
No more tears.

365
00:26:42,408 --> 00:26:43,168
Only joy.

366
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:44,648
I'm going to do a set for you.

367
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:47,367
Yi, isn't this how you do it?

368
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:49,968
Hello, everyone. I'm the Great Meixia.

369
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:55,127
I'm Gu Yi's "manufacturer".

370
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,607
I may not look impressive,

371
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:01,287
but my product is certified
and top-quality.

372
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:02,408
Credibility is key.

373
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:05,488
But this old machine of mine

374
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:06,968
is about to break down.

375
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:08,648
So,

376
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:10,047
to all you youngsters out there,

377
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:11,728
work-life balance is key.

378
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,327
Take good care of yourselves.

379
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:15,888
Otherwise, if any parts wear out,

380
00:27:16,104 --> 00:27:17,680
they might not be replaceable
with originals.

381
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:22,728
Don't think

382
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,208
just because you're young,

383
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,847
you have all the time
in the world to waste.

384
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:27,488
Everything goes by

385
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:28,968
in the blink of an eye.

386
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:31,047
Life

387
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:32,208
is like three flicks.

388
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:34,400
One flick, you're all grown up.

389
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,704
Another flick, you're old.

390
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:36,527
The next flick,

391
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:37,208
you're gone.

392
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:38,807
I've already flicked twice,

393
00:27:38,872 --> 00:27:39,944
and I don't dare flick again.

394
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:43,127
Actually,

395
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,327
when I was young,

396
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:46,847
I was quite pretty.

397
00:27:46,968 --> 00:27:47,567
Am I right?

398
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:48,367
Gorgeous.

399
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:53,567
Back then,

400
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:55,527
I was a poet at heart.

401
00:27:58,567 --> 00:27:59,728
I joined a small theater troupe

402
00:27:59,784 --> 00:28:00,824
and performed folk opera.

403
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,080
That's where I met my ex-husband.

404
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,327
Not long after, I had Gu Yi.

405
00:28:05,488 --> 00:28:06,648
I thought

406
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:08,728
I would live happily

407
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:10,248
ever after.

408
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:12,648
But once the novelty wore off,

409
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:14,127
the scoundrel

410
00:28:15,287 --> 00:28:17,567
was always drinking, gambling, dancing,

411
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:19,008
and living it up outside

412
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:20,448
while abandoning his family at home.

413
00:28:22,472 --> 00:28:23,560
You know what, forget about it.

414
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,287
My current husband is still here,

415
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:27,767
and so is my future son-in-law.

416
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:29,928
Liang,

417
00:28:30,536 --> 00:28:31,688
let me tell you something.

418
00:28:32,312 --> 00:28:33,656
Gu Yi didn't inherit her dad's traits.

419
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:35,248
If she had,

420
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:36,928
she wouldn't have stuck

421
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:37,648
with you.

422
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:42,527
Before Liang appeared,

423
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:43,847
I used to wonder

424
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:46,567
why Gu Yi never looked for a boyfriend.

425
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:49,527
Was it because my divorce
had affected her?

426
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:51,767
Later, I realized

427
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,248
she's just picky and has high standards.

428
00:28:54,287 --> 00:28:55,448
She won't just settle for anyone.

429
00:28:55,888 --> 00:28:56,607
What does this show?

430
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,087
It shows she never really cared

431
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:00,327
about me or her dad.

432
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:05,367
In my life,

433
00:29:07,648 --> 00:29:09,287
my marriage wasn't great.

434
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,847
But I got a wonderful daughter,

435
00:29:12,072 --> 00:29:13,064
so it was worth it.

436
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:15,488
When it came to raising Gu Yi,

437
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:17,287
I took a hands-off approach.

438
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:18,648
The thing is,

439
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:20,688
I couldn't control her,
even if I wanted to.

440
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:22,287
Thankfully,

441
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:24,367
Gu Yi has good taste,

442
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:26,688
especially when it comes to men.

443
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:28,248
Better than mine.

444
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:31,847
Anyway,

445
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:34,047
each generation has its blessings.

446
00:29:36,248 --> 00:29:37,767
How do I feel now?

447
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:40,728
It's kind of like

448
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:43,287
the first time I sent her
to kindergarten.

449
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:46,327
I felt reluctant,

450
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:48,208
but I had to let her go.

451
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:21,807
You know, I'm already near
the end of my life,

452
00:30:22,607 --> 00:30:23,688
yet I've never really traveled

453
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:24,928
or enjoyed myself.

454
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:25,968
Isn't it a shame?

455
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:28,632
You know what?

456
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:29,928
I'll live a little for once.

457
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:31,648
Let's go on a honeymoon trip.

458
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:34,607
Sanya...

459
00:30:34,607 --> 00:30:35,607
Xishuangbanna...

460
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:37,008
I'll check them all off my list.

461
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:38,607
I'll go wherever I feel like.

462
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:40,928
My life motto is,

463
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:42,968
to spend all my money before I die.

464
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:54,639
Don't give me that look.

465
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,280
I'm not going to spend your money.
I have my own.

466
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:09,287
Everyone knows I used to be
a folk opera singer.

467
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,800
But some of you haven't heard me sing.

468
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:14,567
Let me sing a bit for you.

469
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:16,728
Can I have a round of applause?

Ms. Gu,

484
00:33:48,847 --> 00:33:49,648
answer the phone.

485
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,047
Ms. Gu,

486
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:53,488
wake up.

487
00:33:55,287 --> 00:33:56,888
Ms. Gu, are you home?

488
00:33:57,888 --> 00:33:59,968
What's that racket
so early in the morning?

489
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:02,928
It's so annoying.

490
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:05,208
Ms. Gu,

491
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:06,448
are you home?

492
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:18,808
Young lady,

493
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,808
can you take down that camera?

494
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,727
The sound from that camera is haunting.

495
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:25,647
Sorry, Madam,

496
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,952
I'll take it down right away.

497
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:28,127
Sorry.

498
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:29,368
It's so annoying.

499
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:44,408
Don't take it down.

500
00:34:45,008 --> 00:34:46,047
If you do, I'll reinstall it.

501
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:49,488
Liang Daiwen,

502
00:34:49,928 --> 00:34:51,247
you're disturbing the neighbors.

503
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,207
Move back in with me,
and I won't disturb them.

504
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:54,687
You go off the grid so often,

505
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,167
and I get really worried.

506
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:00,848
You're just clingy.

507
00:35:01,448 --> 00:35:02,488
Don't make excuses.

508
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:04,848
Since you know I'm clingy, get up.

509
00:35:05,352 --> 00:35:06,696
I'll take you out for a meal.

510
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:26,408
I don't feel like eating.

511
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:27,968
It's all meat. I have no appetite.

512
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,247
There's no cilantro,

513
00:35:32,808 --> 00:35:34,288
and no pointy-nosed animals.

514
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:36,840
You don't like meat anymore?

515
00:35:39,768 --> 00:35:41,047
Who told you that?

516
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:43,968
It must've been my mom.

517
00:36:01,488 --> 00:36:02,368
Do you...

518
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,664
Do you remember the first time
we came here?

519
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,127
At that time, I had severe anorexia.

520
00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:15,727
I couldn't eat anything.

521
00:36:16,104 --> 00:36:17,256
I could only drink water.

522
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:19,567
You fed me that huge rice ball.

523
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:21,207
I threw up afterward.

524
00:36:24,008 --> 00:36:24,687
Alright, alright.

525
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:26,488
Are you trying to change the subject?

526
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:28,448
Fine.

527
00:36:28,607 --> 00:36:30,247
I'll give you two a break.

528
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:31,768
I'll eat.

529
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:21,127
Hello?

530
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:22,167
Liang.

531
00:37:22,768 --> 00:37:23,928
Can you come find me?

532
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,960
My mom's setting me up on a blind date
at People's Square.

533
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:27,368
I'm about to go crazy.

534
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
(Marriage ad: Born in 1993,
master's degree, height 168cm)

535
00:37:34,968 --> 00:37:36,288
Mom, stop putting those up!

536
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:37,727
What are you doing?

537
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:38,968
Hey!

538
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,064
I should be asking you that.

539
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:42,696
Mrs. Chen introduced you
to such a fine man,

540
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:43,440
and you rejected!

541
00:37:43,488 --> 00:37:44,399
Are you out of your mind?

542
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,920
Instead, you keep that good-for-nothing
at home.

543
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,744
Aren't you embarrassed?

544
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:47,440
I know I am.

545
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:49,087
What good-for-nothing?

546
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:50,328
Can you stop this?

547
00:37:50,328 --> 00:37:52,727
Mrs. Guan, she already has a boyfriend.

548
00:37:52,727 --> 00:37:53,687
Please stop it.

549
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,792
What nonsense are you spouting?

550
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:55,440
What boyfriend?

551
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:57,087
Haven't you had enough hardship?

552
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:58,527
Are you out of your mind?

553
00:37:58,808 --> 00:38:00,207
Keeping a freeloader at home?

554
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:00,928
Mrs. Guan,

555
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,600
can we talk about this at home?

556
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:03,848
Which home?

557
00:38:04,488 --> 00:38:05,087
Ask her.

558
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:06,968
Who keeps a useless man at home

559
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,328
and throws away a house worth millions?

560
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:09,567
Millions!

561
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,047
I said I don't want to get married.

562
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:12,527
Then what do you want?

563
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:13,567
You're almost 30!

564
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:15,008
What are you going to do
if you don't get married?

565
00:38:15,288 --> 00:38:15,727
Mom!

566
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:18,247
Is there a law that says
you must marry at 30?

567
00:38:18,408 --> 00:38:19,768
Does not marrying make you inferior?

568
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:20,527
Guan Xingxin!

569
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,704
You think you're all that now?

570
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:23,160
Do you see me as your mom or your enemy?

571
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:23,727
Mrs. Guan,

572
00:38:24,288 --> 00:38:25,328
she can go on blind dates,

573
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:27,448
but she doesn't need to right now.

574
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:28,607
Young lady,

575
00:38:28,888 --> 00:38:31,368
I've been holding back long enough.
I haven't even said anything to you yet.

576
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:32,240
My daughter's blind date

577
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:33,127
is none of your concern.

578
00:38:33,768 --> 00:38:36,127
You have a boyfriend like Liang,

579
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:37,288
yet you're standing here talking.

580
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:38,768
You think he's great, right?

581
00:38:39,008 --> 00:38:39,448
Fine.

582
00:38:39,672 --> 00:38:41,512
Why don't you swap him
with that good-for-nothing?

583
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:43,247
I've told you so many times,

584
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,808
he's not a good-for-nothing.

585
00:38:44,808 --> 00:38:46,488
He's a talented video editor.

586
00:38:46,808 --> 00:38:47,768
Talented, is he?

587
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:48,567
Fine.

588
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:50,888
Let's see this talented video editor

589
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:52,408
buy a house.

590
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:55,087
Guan Xingxin!

591
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,456
What are you doing here?

592
00:38:58,552 --> 00:38:59,680
Forgetting your responsibilities?

593
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,000
The whole company is waiting for you,
and you're here on a blind date?

594
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:03,968
Are you Mrs. Guan?

595
00:39:04,264 --> 00:39:04,880
Here's the thing,

596
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:06,000
Guan Xingxin has something

597
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,176
very important at work right now.

598
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,120
I have to take her away.

599
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,047
Here's my business card.

600
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:11,488
Feel free to contact me anytime.

601
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,200
(Huang Wenda, Founder & Chairman)

602
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,193
(Linda Group)

603
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:33,200
You didn't even notice
you were being photographed.

604
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:35,607
If I didn't show up,
you'd be trending again.

605
00:39:40,448 --> 00:39:41,207
Sorry about that.

606
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:44,008
My parents aren't satisfied

607
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:44,768
with my boyfriend,

608
00:39:45,488 --> 00:39:46,848
so they're pressuring me to break up.

609
00:39:47,848 --> 00:39:48,968
What does your boyfriend do?

610
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:52,408
Does it matter to you?

611
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,647
If you could stand up to your parents
like you stand up to me,

612
00:39:57,727 --> 00:39:59,047
this wouldn't have happened.

613
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,696
Where do you want to go now?

614
00:40:03,207 --> 00:40:04,127
Still dare to go home?

615
00:40:06,368 --> 00:40:07,448
I've run away from home.

616
00:40:11,047 --> 00:40:12,008
Your boyfriend's place, then.

617
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:13,440
I'll give you a ride.

618
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:14,368
Give me the address.

619
00:41:10,647 --> 00:41:11,527
Mom,

620
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,127
are you in the car?

621
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:14,488
Yes, rented.

622
00:41:14,968 --> 00:41:15,687
What's the matter?

623
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:18,928
You answered the phone so quickly.
Were you waiting for me?

624
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:22,247
No, I was watching a show and eating.

625
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:23,888
Let me show you.

626
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:27,087
This is your daughter's

627
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:29,647
homemade dinner.

628
00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:30,440
What do you think?

629
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:32,087
Oh my goodness!

630
00:41:32,488 --> 00:41:33,808
Is this the recipe I taught you?

631
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:34,607
Come on.

632
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:35,607
Mr. He, take a look.

633
00:41:35,808 --> 00:41:37,247
Is that soy sauce-marinated meat?

634
00:41:38,808 --> 00:41:39,647
Not bad.

635
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:45,008
Can't you be more encouraging?

636
00:41:45,328 --> 00:41:46,288
If you don't compliment me,

637
00:41:46,288 --> 00:41:47,448
I'll order takeout next time.

638
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:48,968
Sure.

639
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:49,639
Come on.

640
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,872
Mr. He, say a few nice words, quick.

641
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:52,808
Good job, keep it up.

642
00:41:53,768 --> 00:41:54,567
Mr. He,

643
00:41:55,288 --> 00:41:56,127
thanks.

644
00:41:57,727 --> 00:41:58,727
Where are you guys now?

645
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,647
Having fun these past few days?

646
00:42:01,808 --> 00:42:02,848
Yes, we are.

647
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:04,127
Very much so.

648
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,488
We're currently in Xiamen.

649
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:08,488
Next,

650
00:42:08,632 --> 00:42:09,760
we're heading to Gulangyu Island.

651
00:42:09,968 --> 00:42:11,167
Tomorrow we're off to Hainan.

652
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:12,808
Isn't there a beach in Xiamen?

653
00:42:12,808 --> 00:42:14,127
Why do you need to go to Hainan?

654
00:42:15,008 --> 00:42:16,288
It's not the same.

655
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:17,888
Hainan has coconut chicken.

656
00:42:18,104 --> 00:42:19,240
You've never tried it, have you?

657
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:20,848
I'll send you

658
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:22,527
some pictures.

659
00:42:24,047 --> 00:42:24,647
Sure.

660
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,768
Go for it.

661
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:27,888
Whatever you eat or spend,

662
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:29,488
put it all on my account.

663
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:30,607
I'll pay for it.

664
00:42:32,448 --> 00:42:34,288
My daughter has such good taste.

665
00:42:35,207 --> 00:42:37,368
Alright, let me show you the night view.

666
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:38,808
You know what?

667
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:41,888
The weather in Xiamen is perfect.

668
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:43,448
It feels so nice.

669
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:44,408
