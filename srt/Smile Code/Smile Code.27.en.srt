=Smile Code=

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
(Adapted from Douban Read's work
"Smile Code" by Zu Yue)

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,033
=Episode 27=

25
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,430
Here's the problem.

26
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:05,670
Her contract signing is messed up,

27
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,888
and she quarreled with her parents.

28
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:08,030
You broke the promise first.

29
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:10,104
It's not too much to ask
to take her in, right?

30
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,789
Is this my duty?

31
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,390
No.

32
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,229
But you also ran away from home.

33
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:15,576
You should understand her, right?

34
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,349
Don't forget

35
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,469
it was you

36
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:19,710
who shifted the blame for her mess
onto me.

37
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:20,949
Good night.

38
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,590
You can stay in the guest room.

39
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:54,408
Move out as soon as possible.

40
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,629
I can't live with others
under one roof for too long.

41
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,270
Thank you.

42
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,789
I'll move out once I find a place.

43
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:06,968
Do you have money?

44
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:14,390
You have no money,

45
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:16,870
yet you have the guts
to cut ties with your parents.

46
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,469
It's indeed rare to see
someone who leeches off their family

47
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:23,550
like you.

48
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,990
If you want to decide on your own life,

49
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:29,349
first of all,

50
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:30,728
you need to be financially independent.

51
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,390
Make your own money

52
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:33,784
before you can stand tall with pride.

53
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,189
Do you know why

54
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,590
I got back together with Huang Wenda

55
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,032
when I broke up with him the first time?

56
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,110
It was because

57
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:42,669
I couldn't afford

58
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,789
a place with a private bathroom.

59
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,830
Of course,

60
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:50,749
everyone has times

61
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,899
when they avoid asking for help

62
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,248
but are not brave enough to go all out.

63
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:58,344
Wean yourself off your parents' support
so you can be independent sooner.

64
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,270
I understand it's an embarrassing
situation when escaping from family.

65
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:04,909
But bear this in mind,

66
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,189
it's not my duty to always help you.

67
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:10,390
Why are you still standing here?

68
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:12,430
The guest room is over there.

69
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:34,309
There's a jewelry exhibition

70
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,496
at The Peninsula this afternoon.

71
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,390
People like influencers,

72
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,270
wealthy ladies,

73
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:40,429
socialites,

74
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,789
and media people
who promote their brands like us

75
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,830
will be there.

76
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,270
You're coming with me.

77
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,469
Okay.

78
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,549
Do I need to prepare for interviews?

79
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,429
What interview?

80
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,568
I'm not asking you
to do interviews there.

81
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:55,789
Those people are brand representatives.

82
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,950
Your

83
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:57,909
potential customers.

84
00:04:58,648 --> 00:04:59,830
When you become the chief editor,

85
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:01,270
are you going to negotiate deals

86
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:03,150
by exchanging files?

87
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,270
Should I change clothes?

88
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,469
Change your shoes.

89
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,549
No matter how you dress,

90
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,909
you won't outshine those wealthy ladies.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,190
Ms. Zhang, you personally came here
to get jewelry sponsorships.

92
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:49,080
Isn't that too big for you?

93
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,750
Mr. Huang,

94
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,750
I heard your English is excellent.

95
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,630
Can you understand

96
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:01,950
the seminar?

97
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,869
Of course.

98
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:06,789
Anyway, it's better not to understand
than not to afford it.

99
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,270
Mr. Huang,

100
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,100
there are a few new media friends
over there.

101
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,229
Let's meet them.

102
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,429
Let's go.

103
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:30,070
Director Peng,

104
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,549
it's been a long time.

105
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:32,590
It's been a long time.

106
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,270
This is my friend, Mr. Huang.

107
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:35,144
This is Director Peng.

108
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Nice to meet you, Director Peng.

109
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:36,750
I'm Huang Wenda.

110
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:37,512
Nice to meet you,

111
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:37,950
Mr. Huang.

112
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,150
I heard you're preparing a reality show.

113
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,030
I went to your office

114
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,789
but couldn't catch you.

115
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:45,150
Don't even mention it.

116
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,789
The schedule is fixed,

117
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:47,660
and the show is rated.

118
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,560
Yet a female guest withdrew
at the last minute.

119
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,660
Didn't you see all those influencers

120
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,270
surrounding me wherever I go?

121
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,830
They're all pitching themselves,

122
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,150
but none of them are suitable.

123
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,109
Finding a pretty amateur

124
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,309
is too hard.

125
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,669
You must be too picky.

126
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:04,792
How much of an amateur
will fit your requirements?

127
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,440
Has a strong character,

128
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:07,429
is untrained,

129
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,070
and is a bit saucy.

130
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,070
Even if she's controversial,

131
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:11,950
that's fine.

132
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:13,896
Criticism is the last thing

133
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:15,320
we should be afraid of in reality shows.

134
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,660
Director Peng,

135
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:18,168
if that's what you're looking for,

136
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:19,789
how about I recommend someone to you?

137
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,549
Sure.

138
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:27,390
We lost the advertisement
for Pages 88 and 89.

139
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,549
Is there any content available

140
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:29,390
to make it up?

141
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:33,909
I say,

142
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,950
you've been using the same authors.

143
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:40,504
I'm tired of reading their articles
before the readers are.

144
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:43,229
Can't you find some fresh topics?

145
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,229
Is it that hard?

146
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:52,390
I'll talk to you later.

147
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:55,549
Speak up.

148
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:57,989
I have a topic

149
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:00,109
about a Chinese accessibility designer.

150
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,000
It's not a common industry
with which everyone is familiar.

151
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:04,309
First-hand material.

152
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:05,832
It can be completed in two days.

153
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,150
Submit it to me in two days.

154
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:12,909
No problem.

155
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:36,549
Cheers, Director Peng.

156
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,510
Let's wait a bit longer.
She'll be here soon.

157
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,270
Here she is.

158
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:42,660
Talk about perfect timing.

159
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:43,624
Come over and have a drink.

160
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,392
I'm not drinking.

161
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:47,189
You said it's a serious business.

162
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:48,230
Of course, it is.

163
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,150
Listen.

164
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,110
Today, I'm introducing you
to a famous director.

165
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,300
He just got divorced.

166
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,750
So?

167
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,630
Is this the serious business
you mentioned?

168
00:08:57,789 --> 00:08:58,390
Or else what?

169
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Would you come if I told you
that you were here to drink?

170
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:02,150
Come.

171
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:03,549
Huang Wenda,

172
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,789
do you think I'm your caged bird?

173
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:08,230
Is drinking with young girls

174
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,309
the fun of you middle-aged men?

175
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:10,669
Wait.

176
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,270
Director Peng.

177
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:17,224
Do you think she's good?

178
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:18,589
Miss Guan,

179
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:19,350
calm down.

180
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,189
Mr. Huang

181
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,870
is helping me with an audition.

182
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:23,589
Are you interested

183
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:24,829
in a dating show?

184
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,539
I don't have talents,

185
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,496
and I have a boyfriend.

186
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,949
Keep it a secret.

187
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,780
In reality shows,

188
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,949

190

191

192
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,350

Let's

202
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:26,429
get down to business.

203
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,829
I have some questions for an interview.

204
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:32,120
What philosophy
are you trying to express

205
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:33,780
about accessibility design?

206
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,150
What products have you launched so far?

207
00:10:36,232 --> 00:10:37,580
What's the dilemma in this industry?

208
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,549
I've got you two pages of an interview

209
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:42,470
on Nextmonday.

210
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,870
I can write anything you want to say.

211
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:49,390
What's wrong?

212
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,829
Is something concerning you?

213
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,669
No.

214
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,510
My studio hasn't achieved anything yet.

215
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:58,990
The online app Li Ai is developing

216
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,189
is a money pit.

217
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,990
We're robbing Peter to pay Paul.

218
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:04,549

219
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,750

220
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:08,350
I'm not confident enough

221
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,549
for an interview right now.

222
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,470
Liang Daiwen,

223
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:18,390
you're not an independent designer

224

225
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,030
You have a team.

226
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:25,390
Stop pushing yourself too hard.

227
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:28,309
You need to let others know

228
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:29,150
what you're doing

229
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,470
to convince them to understand you
and join you.

230
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,549
All right.

231
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,350
I'll do as you say.

232
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:40,760
Let's talk about it at home.

233
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:43,416
All right, then.

00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,470
Gu Yi.

235
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,510
Move back to my place.

236
00:11:58,189 --> 00:11:58,789
I can't.

237
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:03,909
My mom will come back anytime.

238

239
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,030
she can't get in.

240
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,429

Go to your friends
for emotional matters.

I've been offered a role
as a guest on a dating show.

I'm not sure if I should accept it.

269

As you know,

270
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,709
I ran away from home.

271
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:11,309
My parents would make a scene
if they found out later.

The situation of my family is special.

275
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:20,180
I used to be blind when I was a kid.

276
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,150
I had a corner transplant.

277
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,110
The parents of my donor

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,110

279
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,189
They've given me

280
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,429
a lot of care.

281
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,429
My family

282
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,150
is very grateful to them.

283
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,309
Does that mean

284
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:51,470
you're embarrassed

285
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:52,820
because you've been receiving favors

286
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:54,110
and don't dare offend them?

287
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:17,669
You have four parents.

288
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,429
I have an aunt.

289
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,909
Our situations

290
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,110
are quite similar,

291
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:26,909
just with different relationships.

292
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,110
Back then,

293
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,368
I jumped out of the window and ran away

294
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,549
to come to this city.

295
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,270
I've never gone back since then.

296
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,820
I sent money back
but never returned home.

297
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,549
So nothing happened between us.

298
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:46,270
I probably don't have your courage.

299
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:50,630
Beauty

300
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,350
can sometimes be a resource

301
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,789
for women.

302
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,549
However, brainless beauty

303
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:57,069
can be dangerous.

304
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,350
Now, the opportunity to jump
out of the window is right ahead.

305
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,750
Whether you can bear the risk

306
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:05,230
is up to you.

307
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,549
I'm not interested in teaching you.

308
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,750
But

309
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,309
I have a boyfriend.

310
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,190
Your parents disapprove of him, right?

311
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:18,950
I guess your relationship
isn't very strong.

312
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,109
Otherwise,

313
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,829
you wouldn't have stayed here.

314
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,589
If you were me,

315
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:25,910
would you accept the offer?

316
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,904
Such a hypothetical is impossible.

317
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,149
I'm not you.

318
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,829
I can't understand your situation.

319
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,510
But I see a woman

320
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,750
who's brave enough
to reveal her private video in the hotel

321
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,510
to speak out against public opinion.

322
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,309
Your boyfriend may not like that,

323
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,629
but the audience

324
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,069
would love it.

00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,389

The subscriber you've dialed
is unreachable.

339
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:56,750
That's it?

340
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,670
You broke up without even discussing it?

341
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,549
He explained it to me

342
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:03,859
many times.

343
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,128
He said it was a misunderstanding.

344
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:08,629
I told him I had aborted the baby,

345
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:10,856
and then we broke up without hesitation.

346
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,389
Wait.

347
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:18,829
I don't believe you had an abortion.

348
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:20,910
If you did,

349
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,824
why would you even go to Huang Wenda
to discuss it?

350
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:30,549
Yes, I didn't have an abortion.

351
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:34,829
Because the baby couldn't survive
due to my body condition.

352
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,190
That was

353
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:39,510
just a pretext.

354
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,829
It doesn't matter.

355
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,710
As long as he bought it.

356
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,990
Our breakup

357
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:49,710
was a continuous result.

358
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,309
Even without this misunderstanding,

359
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:54,580
it would still end in the same way.

360

361
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,069
what I just said.

00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:09,990

363
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,750
to steer away from him.

364
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:15,549
But

365
00:21:16,616 --> 00:21:17,910
as far as work matters are concerned,

366
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:19,869

00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:32,296
Did you have bad dreams?

377
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:56,670
The entrance of this hotel

378
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,328
is equipped with special staircases
and ramps.

379
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,540
The accessible lifts and reception desk
are pretty well done.

380
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,270
However,

381
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,069
the rebound force of bathroom doors

382
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,230
is quite strong.

383
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:06,860
You might change them to side-hung doors

384
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,629
or sensor doors.

385
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,430
Understood.

386
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:12,750
It might be tricky to readjust
the height of the bathroom mirror.

387
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,990
You could install

388
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,589
a rotating multi-functional mirror

389
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,670
and also a doorbell indicator light

390
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,750
at the entrance

391
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:22,792
so the hearing-impaired
would know if they have visitors.

392
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,589
That's brilliant.

393
00:25:25,864 --> 00:25:27,240
I think that's everything.

394
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,589
Let's estimate the budget.

395
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,869
Okay. I'll look into

396
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:31,990

No.

to perform at Fuzzy tonight,

but she hasn't arrived yet.

405

She hasn't answered calls

406
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,389
or shown up at the office.

407
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:53,910

485
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:15,829
what's happened to your step count
on WeChat?

486
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,270
I couldn't sleep and checked it.

487
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,950
It showed over two thousand steps
early in the morning.

488
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,750
Did you get a dog?

489
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,230
Maybe it's an app glitch.

490
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:45,829
Liang Daiwen,

491
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:47,270
what are you doing?

492
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:00,430
What's wrong?

493
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:02,820
It's in the middle of the night.

494
00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:05,309
He's been pacing back and forth.
It spooks me.

495
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:09,549
Don't be afraid.

496
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:11,069
I think he's sleepwalking.

497
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,190
Sleepwalking?

498
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,389
Shen told me

499
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:17,789
he used to sleepwalk when he was abroad.

500
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,030
It was even worse back then.

501
00:33:19,224 --> 00:33:21,170
Shen had to go look for him
in the middle of the night,

502
00:33:21,192 --> 00:33:22,824
and he was so worried
that he couldn't sleep.

503
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:25,629
His condition hasn't improved at all
after coming back.

504
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:29,549
Now I get why his step count

505
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,510
is so high.

506
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:33,950
He's like a robot vacuum.

507
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:36,230
When is he going to stop sleepwalking?

508
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:37,910
I need to work tomorrow morning.

509
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,069
He can't be doing this all night.

510
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,549
Make way.

511
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:04,789

512
00:34:09,992 --> 00:34:11,350
Looks like he's finally stopped.

513
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,229

514
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,629

515
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,072
Can you teach me that?

516
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:18,700

all the on-site coordination.

530
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,830
Pretty well.

Are you sure?

00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,269
Your face says otherwise.

00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,269
Something happened?

534
00:35:09,669 --> 00:35:11,109
I'm totally fine.

535
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:13,709
Liang Daiwen is

536
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:15,269
a full-time accessibility designer,

537
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:16,408
but he's having a rough time.

538
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,109
There's a blank session on Nextmonday,

539
00:35:19,629 --> 00:35:20,669
so I did an interview with him.

540
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:22,790
I'm racing against time now.

541
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:25,069
Accessibility design is meaningful.

542
00:35:25,629 --> 00:35:26,870
But Liang Daiwen has to accept

543
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,229
the truth that life has regrets.

544
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,229
I don't know why

545
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:33,109
he has alexithymia.

546
00:35:34,189 --> 00:35:35,830
I guess it must be related

547
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,510
to his relentless focus
on accessibility design.

548
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,269
Perhaps he lost someone important
because of it.

549
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:43,310
Just a guess.

550
00:35:45,629 --> 00:35:47,350
That's why he's been promoting
accessibility design.

551
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,269
He tries to help more people.

552
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:52,069
It's a noble goal,

553
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,030
but one person's power is limited.

554
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,470
Real life

555
00:35:57,669 --> 00:35:58,709
is full of regrets.

556
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:01,350
If he could accept that earlier
and get used to it,

557
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,109
he would fully recover.

558
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,430
But there are some regrets

559
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,629
you'll never get used to.

Mr. Li Ai,

566
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,350
I'm not feeling well.

567
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,149
I think I need to take a few days off.

568
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,189
Thank you.

569
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,269
Bravo!

570
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,390
I haven't even started yet.

571
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,790
The gentleman over there,
you're the loudest.

572
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,096
Please stay after the show's over.

573
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,460
Sure thing.

574
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,310
Leave your info backstage.

575
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,470
I'll pay you to be my shill, okay?

576
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,350
Sure.

577
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,830
As everyone knows,

578
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,790
as a stand-up comedian,

579
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,030
it's no easy thing

580
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,229
to have a girlfriend.

581
00:38:39,549 --> 00:38:40,109
But...

582
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:43,310
He's a gifted comedian.

583
00:38:44,149 --> 00:38:45,510
Even if your jokes are funny,

584
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,510
they can't surpass a funny face.

585
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,669
If you don't enlist in marriage,

586
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,430
you can't return to the heavenly court.

587
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:52,589
In the meantime...

588
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,549
Give me a response.

589
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:55,669
Stop pulling a long face,

590
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:56,390
okay?

591
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:00,950
How about this?

592
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:01,910
I'll tell you

593
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,880
the story of Liang Daiwen sleepwalking
and chasing me

594
00:39:03,896 --> 00:39:04,552
one more time.

595
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:05,990
No need.

596
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:07,990
Guan Xingxin told me.

597
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,910
A 1.8-meter-tall guy

598
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,910
was running around the house

599
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,470
and almost cried, right?

600
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,669
Gu Yi, listen.

601
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,229
First,

602
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,189
it's 1.82 meters.

603
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,269
Second, I did not cry.

604
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,390
That night

605
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,470
was scarier than an escape room.

606
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:22,790
You know?

607
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,149
Liang Daiwen is like

608
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:24,830
an uncanny NPC.

609
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:26,390
You've played escape rooms before.

610
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:28,390
You get what I mean,

611
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:29,470
right?

612
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,149
I do, very much.

613
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,950
I wrote jokes

614
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,189
about his sleepwalk before,

615
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,350
but I won't have a chance
to perform them.

616
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,149
You can have them.

617
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:41,910
Why?

618
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,030
Are you quitting this?

619
00:39:46,312 --> 00:39:47,180
I haven't decided yet.

620
00:39:49,189 --> 00:39:51,030
I borrowed your ID card

621
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:52,470
to register a public account

622
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,589
for my long-form comic.

623
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,069
Thanks to Liang Daiwen's controversies,

624
00:39:56,629 --> 00:39:57,709
it gets good traffic.

625
00:39:58,549 --> 00:40:00,149
I'm planning to publish a few more

626
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:01,589
and develop the account

627
00:40:02,229 --> 00:40:03,830
to sell it to Jacqueline
for a good price.

628
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,310
That's ambitious.

629
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:11,830
There's some news I'm debating

630
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,669
whether I should talk to you.

631
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:17,350
Is it about the love story
between you and Guan Xingxin?

632
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:17,910
Dazzle me.

633
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,470
You underestimate me.

634
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,470
The good news is

635
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,310
that Ounce's Open Mic

636
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,669
is back.

637
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,470
The new owner asked

638
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:28,510
if I wanted to continue

639
00:40:28,669 --> 00:40:30,069
running the show.

640
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,069
The bad news is

641
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,709
the new owner is

642
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,269
Zhang Qingya.

643
00:40:39,629 --> 00:40:40,830
She's Liang Daiwen's senior.

644
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,870
The one who treated us
to the Christmas meal.

645
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:58,510
I think

646
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:01,229
at least...

647
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,549
At least Ounce is back.

648
00:41:04,749 --> 00:41:05,310
Right?

649
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,950
Here are the soy chips I made

650
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,928
and some ready-to-eat food.

651
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:27,390
It takes less than five minutes
to prepare.

652
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:28,749
Also,

653
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,470
I stocked up on cat treats,

654
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,990
paid the utility bills,

655
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:38,669
and saved the numbers
for property management, police station,

656
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,229
and tenants association on your phone,

657
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,189
just in case.

658
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:44,030
What do you mean by "just in case"?

659
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:45,990
Can you tell me what this is all about?

660
00:41:48,616 --> 00:41:49,180
By the way,

661
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:50,830
I need to record my fingerprint later.

662
00:41:51,864 --> 00:41:53,464
If I can't contact you
when you're drunk,

663
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,310
I can get in.

664
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:57,390
How did you get me home last night

665
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,470
when I was drunk?

666
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,350
You were hammered.

667
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:01,704
But I can still use your fingerprint.

668
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:05,390
Fine.

669
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,510
Since you've taken good care

670
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,030
of the place,

671
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:11,576
I'll share half of the house ownership

672
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:12,310
with you.

673
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:15,709
Deal.

674
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,120
Let's eat up.

675
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,310
Liang Daiwen.

676
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:55,669
The subscriber you've dialed
is powered off.

677
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:58,069
Please try again later.

678
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:01,549
The subscriber you've dialed
is powered off.

679
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:16,790
Here.

680
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:17,629
Drink some water.

681
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:18,669
Thank you.

682
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:23,709
Don't be anxious.

683
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:25,430
It happened before

684
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,229
that Liang Daiwen left without a word.

685
00:44:28,189 --> 00:44:29,310
People with alexithymia

686
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:30,990
tend to protect themselves.

687
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,229
They can't handle unstable emotions

688
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,950
and release or express their feelings.

689
00:44:36,749 --> 00:44:37,229
That's why

690
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,790
they temporarily cut themselves off

691
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:39,830
from the outside world.

692
00:44:43,149 --> 00:44:44,390
Are you saying

693
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,910
that he doesn't want to affect me
with his negative feelings,

694
00:44:48,229 --> 00:44:49,430
so he hides away?

695
00:44:53,176 --> 00:44:54,390
You can put it that way.

696
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,430
His perception

697
00:44:57,589 --> 00:44:58,470
has just recovered,

698
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,220
and his understanding of human feelings

699
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:01,709
is still very linear.

700
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:04,870
When he suffers a heavy blow,

701
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:06,950
he can't release it

702
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:07,990
like ordinary people do.

703
00:45:08,629 --> 00:45:09,310
He tends

704
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,310
to bottle it up.

705
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,870
That's why he comes off

706
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,589
as inexplicable,

707
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:15,950
selfish, aloof,

708
00:45:16,392 --> 00:45:17,830
and only concerned with his own feelings

709
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,229
while ignoring others.

710
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,229
But someone

711
00:45:22,549 --> 00:45:23,749
who blames himself

712
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:25,430
for his mom's death, like he does,

713
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,749
has never considered his own feelings.

714
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:30,709
That's his biggest problem.

715
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:37,870
What should I do?

716
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:39,790
One moment.

717
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,390
Let me show you something.

718
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:53,870
Liang Daiwen drew these

719
00:45:54,189 --> 00:45:56,390
during his hypnotherapy overseas.

720
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,310
Can you tell what they are?

721
00:46:02,669 --> 00:46:03,629
Are these

722
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:06,709
corridors?

723
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:09,269
They're hospital corridors.

724
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:12,669
When the doctors

725
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:14,030
were trying to save his mom,

726
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,149
he sat in the corridor waiting for her.

727
00:46:17,669 --> 00:46:19,030
Back then, Liang Daiwen

728
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,350
couldn't wait for his mom
to come out of surgery.

729
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,350
And the current Liang Daiwen

730
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,390
is still stuck in that corridor.

731
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,269
This painting

732
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,749
has no end in sight.

733
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,390
It's dark

734
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:33,749
and oppressive.

735
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:37,149
However, in Liang Daiwen's subconscious,

736
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,950
this is the sole place he can rely on.

737
00:46:56,109 --> 00:46:57,350
I know what he's looking for.
