23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
(Adapted from Douban Read's work
"Smile Code" by Zu Yue)

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,040
=Episode 30=

25
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:46,931
This is my previous design.

26
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:49,571
And this is the new one.

27
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:50,812
You can see

28
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:51,732
that I changed

29
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,452
the colors on this side.

30
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:57,931
If you feel pressured out there,

31
00:01:58,424 --> 00:01:59,450
you can come back any time.

32
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:02,291
We can act as if nothing happened.

33
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:10,472
What a coincidence.

34
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,680
What are you guys doing here?

35
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:14,360
We're here to check things out.

36
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,168
What about you, darling?

37
00:02:18,232 --> 00:02:20,008
I'm here to confirm
the design I mentioned

38
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:20,972
to you previously.

39
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:23,932
Ms. Zhang,

40
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:25,611
since it's been confirmed,

41
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:27,291
shouldn't you pay the closing fee?

42
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:30,212
I don't suppose you expect
unlimited after-sales service.

43
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:31,972
Gu Yi,

44
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:33,932
you are his girlfriend.

45
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:36,610
You should know how much
he's been suffering recently.

46
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,772
What's it to do with you

47
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,372
whether I know or not?

48
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:43,291
He's never been this spent
when he was with me.

49
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:45,652
You need to give him more assurance.

50
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:47,131
Ms. Zhang,

51
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:49,492
I must say

52
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:51,812
I can't handle what you're saying.

53
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:53,611
Whether or not he feels assured

54
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,652
is their own personal matter.

55
00:02:55,972 --> 00:02:57,731
We are, after all, only outsiders.

56
00:02:57,736 --> 00:02:58,810
And an outsider should have

57
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,252
a sense of boundary,

58
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:00,812
am I right?

59
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:02,332
Ms. Zhang,

60
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:03,731
I can't help

61
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,000
with the actual renovation.

62
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:06,291
If you're okay with the plan,

63
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:07,131
please make

64
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:08,808
the final payment as soon as possible.

65
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:10,052
Thanks, Ms. Zhang.

66
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:11,372
Thanks, Ms. Zhang.

67
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,252
Mr. Yu.

68
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:27,332
Well?

69
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,664
I stood up for you, didn't I?

70
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:29,192
Good job.

71
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:31,891
Piece of cake.

72
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:34,492
It was as simple as breathing air.

73
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:43,691
Let's go

74
00:03:43,772 --> 00:03:45,092
before we get a ticket.

75
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,290
Should I send you back first

76
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:48,372
or him?

77
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,011
Let's send Mr. Yu first.

78
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,092
Thank you for standing up for me.

79
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:54,131
You're welcome.

80
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,130
I'm a professional
when it comes to disrespecting people.

81
00:03:56,131 --> 00:03:56,731
But,

82
00:03:56,731 --> 00:03:58,092
I'm not going home tonight.

83
00:03:58,184 --> 00:03:59,192
I have to go to the office.

84
00:03:59,192 --> 00:03:59,690
So

85
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:01,016
it's more convenient to send you first.

86
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:09,891
What's the matter?

87
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:12,812
I love you.

88
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:21,050
Thank you for not being angry at me.

89
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:24,872
I'll keep a distance in the future.

90
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:26,811
You don't have to do that.

91
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,892
We shouldn't turn money away.

92
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:31,811
If a mere Zhang Qingya
could cause a wedge between us,

93
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,731
then our relationship is too fragile.

94
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,572
Besides, trust goes both ways.

95
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:39,692
Just like how you let Xu Guanrui
send me home,

96
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:41,291
I too, trust you.

97
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:45,811
But I don't like it when you keep

98
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,411
accommodating Zhang Qingya.

99
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:49,212
Liang Daiwen,

100
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:51,012
you're not obliged to be nice

101
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:52,132
or owe anyone anything.

102
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:54,332
So stop putting all the burden

103
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:55,491
onto yourself.

104
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:57,291
You're living your own life.

105
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,611
You need to think more for yourself.

106
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:05,572
Understood.

107
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:07,851
I will think for us both moving forward.

108
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:08,611
Guys.

109
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:09,851
Guys, guys.

110
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:12,411
Can you think for my sake first?

111
00:05:12,452 --> 00:05:13,491
I'm sitting right here, guys.

112
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:15,816
Please go somewhere private
if you want to be lovey-dovey.

113
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:17,851
What would you do without me?

114
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,371
Geez, for goodness sake.

115
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:21,251
Whatever you can't rely
on Zhang Qingya for,

116
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:22,171
you can rely on me.

117
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:23,132
Okay.

118
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:33,811
Just drive, will you? I'm begging you.

119
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:45,251
You should go.

120
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:47,132
Mr. Yu is waiting in the car.

121
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,128
I'll go after I see you to your house.

122
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,488
I left a crack in the window for him.

123
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:52,851
Is he a puppy that you left in the car?

124
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:56,731
Whoopee!

125
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:23,332
Liang.

126
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:25,811
I'm

127
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:27,892
sorry to you and Yi.

128
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:30,972
I didn't think

129
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:33,032
it would happen so suddenly.

130
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:35,051
I had no choice

131
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:37,171
but to come back.

132
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:42,491
Meixia

133
00:07:43,532 --> 00:07:44,811
had signed an organ donation form

134
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:46,731
before she passed.

135
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,892
She didn't want Yi
to see her last moments.

136
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:55,371
She asked me

137
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:57,652
to bring her ashes back

138
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:00,572
after the last rites.

139
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:07,572
How did Mdm. Wang

140
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:12,772
spend her last days?

141
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:17,892
We only just set out

142
00:08:19,772 --> 00:08:20,491
when her condition

143
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:22,532
rapidly deteriorated.

144
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:25,332
At first,

145
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:27,652
she could control it with medication.

146
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:30,171
Later,

147
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:32,572
she couldn't take it anymore

148
00:08:33,784 --> 00:08:35,560
and that's when
I took her to the hospital.

149
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:39,572
Meixia

150
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:41,544
kept stopping me

151
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,412
from telling you guys.

152
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:47,944
With having to keep up the secrecy,

153
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:51,092
she and Yi missed the chance to have

154
00:08:52,891 --> 00:08:53,771
one last phone call.

155
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:01,851
It happened too quickly.

156
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:46,680
(Where is the Great Meixia?)

157
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:50,400
(Mrs. Meixia, please reply.)

158
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,237
(- Tell me if you need money.
- Mom knows, my dear.)

159
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:06,760
(I have enough money, don't worry.)

160
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:09,829
(- Remember to take photos
- Sure thing. I'll send it to you later.)

161
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:27,400
(- I want to see your couple photos with Mr. He.
- Alright, I know.)

162
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,160
(Call rejected)

163
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:12,092
Take me to my mom.

164
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:19,812
Okay.

165
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,972
I'm still waiting for you at home.

166
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,572
How did you turn out like this?

167
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:38,011
I'll take you home.

168
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,452
We'll go home.

169
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:03,092
What should I do now?

170
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:10,538
(Beloved Mother, Wang Meixia)

171
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:54,292
(Yi,)

172
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:57,292
(I have to go back now.)

173
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:03,332
(This is your mom's phone.)

174
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:05,932
(She asked me to pass it to you.)

175
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:14,203
(My dear, I'm leaving.)

176
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:21,007
(To Gu Yi)

177
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:22,680
(To Liang)

178
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,369
(My dear, I'm leaving)

179
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:37,851
My dear daughter.

180
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:40,332
I'm in the hospital.

181
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:45,371
(I wanted to video call you)

182
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:48,131
(but I worried about scaring you.)

183
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:50,292
(After some thought,)

184
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:52,491
(I reckon this was the better way.)

185
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:55,212
(I know)

186
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:57,531
(that you want to come and see me.)

187
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:01,052
(I want to see you too.)

188
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:04,412
(But the fact is,)

189
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:07,011
(I didn't have the courage to let you)

190
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:08,132
(see me the way I am now.)

191
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:11,331
(I want you to remember)

192
00:17:11,412 --> 00:17:13,372
(only the beautiful Great Meixia.)

193
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,212
(For you to remember)

194
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:19,612
(the Great Meixia that makes
a mean fried hairtail,)

195
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:24,412
(the Great Meixia that exchanged
your dad with a television.)

196
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:28,932
The Great Meixia that backed you up
when you were bullied.

197
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,852
Not to forget the jovial, cheeky

198
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,571
and happy-go-lucky Great Meixia.

199
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:35,612
Also

200
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,251
the Great Meixia
with a horrible taste in men.

201
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:42,571
Remember this.

202
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,571
I will forever be your Dear Meixia.

203
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:57,491
Gu Yi.

204
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,051
With your lousy temper,

205
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:03,811
you should count yourself lucky
to be able to get

206
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:05,692
a man like Liang.

207
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:10,771
Aside from being a little quiet

208
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:12,251
and slow,

209
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:14,172
at the end of the day,

210
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:17,051
he doesn't have major flaws.

211
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:18,132
Am I right?

212
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:23,011
I might be terrible

213
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:24,652
at picking a man for myself,

214
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:28,172
but I'm confident in helping

215
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:30,291
my daughter pick hers.

216
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:34,412
Nobody is perfect.

217
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:37,852
Between two companions,

218
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:41,571
what matters most is supporting

219
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:43,251
and validating each other.

220
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:45,771
You made the choice,

221
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,612
so you have to cherish it.

222
00:18:48,852 --> 00:18:49,972
Simply put,

223
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:53,491
a companion is your chosen family.

224
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:56,212
Once you make the choice,

225
00:18:57,491 --> 00:18:58,612
you are responsible for them.

226
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:01,771
Gu Yi.

227
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:05,892
I want to thank you.

228
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:09,612
Thank you for being so mature this time.

229
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:13,892
Thank you

230
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:16,412
for letting me go on a trip.

231
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:22,011
My dear,

232
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,132
when I'm gone,

233
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:29,172
don't take me back to our hometown.

234
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:33,051
Let He

235
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:34,811
pour my ashes into the sea.

236
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:37,531
Then,

237
00:19:38,771 --> 00:19:41,172
whenever you see the ocean,

238
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,571
that's me by your side.

239
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:46,892
When

240
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:48,731
the wind blows over the water,

241
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:51,972
that's me brushing your face,

242
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:53,892
giving you a hug.

243
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:56,892
When it rains,

244
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:02,892
that's me helping to put out
your fiery temper.

245
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:05,932
And when

246
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,811
a rainbow appears after the rain,

247
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:12,452
that's me looking down on you
from heaven.

248
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:15,731
Anyway,

249
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:18,331
whether I change

250
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,571
into a flower,

251
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:22,331
a tree,

252
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:25,051
or a little star,

253
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,412
I'll be there with you,

254
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:31,491
always by your side.

Mr. Huang spoke to you, right?

275
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:36,932
You'll have lines in this episode.

276
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,610
Quickly familiarize yourself
with the script.

277
00:22:43,491 --> 00:22:44,051
Director,

278
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,331
I should do it on my own?

279
00:22:45,612 --> 00:22:46,692
I've not done this before.

280
00:22:47,972 --> 00:22:49,412
No one is born with the skill.

281
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:50,452
What the audience see

282
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:51,491
is you, the person.

283
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:53,320
They don't care
if your reading is any good.

284
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:54,290
Just follow the script.

285
00:22:56,852 --> 00:22:57,652
Don't worry.

286
00:22:58,011 --> 00:22:59,771
You just have to do well on the shoot.

287
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:00,652
As for the rest,

288
00:23:00,892 --> 00:23:02,531
Mr. Huang will smooth out
any wrinkles.

289
00:23:28,852 --> 00:23:29,531
Can you cut it?

290
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:30,652
No.

291
00:23:32,251 --> 00:23:32,932
I'll teach you.

292
00:23:33,132 --> 00:23:33,491
Okay.

293
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:35,251
Look here.

294
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:38,172
Do it like this.

295
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:11,212
Are you living in the editing room?

296
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,712
This is only the rough cut.

297
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,051
Is this really necessary?

298
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:21,932
What?

299
00:24:22,372 --> 00:24:23,132
Is it

300
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:24,932
a problem being a professional?

301
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:26,569
Hey, you're not going

302
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,599
to last very long like this.

303
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,560
I don't want you to die here.

304
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:30,331
You better not make me fire you.

305
00:24:38,692 --> 00:24:39,972
Add more shots of this lady.

306
00:24:40,652 --> 00:24:42,771
Who knows where the director
found this piece of gem.

307
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:50,280
Someone found her dirt on some
relationship program's forum.

308
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,312
She's revealed to be the mistress
who cheated.

309
00:24:52,932 --> 00:24:54,771
The program's popularity
soared because of it.

310
00:24:55,212 --> 00:24:56,771
There are many more ugly comments too.

311
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:00,811
But guests who go on the show
all have their dirty secrets.

312
00:25:00,972 --> 00:25:01,612
This lady

313
00:25:01,656 --> 00:25:02,856
only goes for the looks

314
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:04,744
and coupled with her less
than savory reputation.

315
00:25:04,811 --> 00:25:07,571
It totally hit the jackpot
for viral content.

316
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:10,212
It's top of the search trend
without having to try.

317
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:13,650
You don't know her
or what really happened.

318
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,531
So don't speak ill so easily.

319
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:18,212
I'm not the one who started it.

320
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,412
A colleague was at the recording studio.

321
00:25:20,731 --> 00:25:23,172
They saw her mixing with the investors.

322
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:25,144
The production crew said it themselves.

323
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,692
She gets around for shoots
in luxury cars.

324
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:30,612
I don't suppose those are all hearsay?

325
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:43,612
A pretty woman like her

326
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:44,811
who wants to make it big?

327
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:47,130
She has to have
some tricks up her sleeve.

328
00:25:47,544 --> 00:25:49,016
If she wanted a proper relationship,

329
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:51,032
she wouldn't go on
a relationship program.

330
00:25:54,212 --> 00:25:54,932
I'm off.

331
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,546
(Yi, the Demonness
is about to go berserk)

332
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:37,531
Call Gu Yi.

333
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:40,051
I'll do it.

334
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,394
(Gu Yi)

335
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:53,811
Gu Yi, where are you?

336
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:55,852
Did you forget about the meeting today?

337
00:26:56,212 --> 00:26:57,531
Everybody is waiting for you.

338
00:26:57,731 --> 00:26:59,291
We have our jobs to do, you know?

339
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:00,172
I'm not going.

340
00:27:01,212 --> 00:27:02,372
Are you for real?

341
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:05,372
Who said you could miss work
when you didn't apply for leave?

342
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:07,132
We're discussing topics today.

343
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,612
Do you expect me to write for you?

344
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:10,291
I'm quitting.

345
00:27:14,852 --> 00:27:15,571
Gu Yi.

346
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:18,852
Are you being obnoxious
just because you're an editor now?

347
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:21,132
Where's your sense of responsibility?

348
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:23,571
I said I'm quitting, okay?

349
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:25,892
Go on and take my spot as the editor.

350
00:27:25,892 --> 00:27:26,972
Stop calling me.

351
00:27:27,932 --> 00:27:28,372
Hello?

352
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:29,291
Gu Yi.

353
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:31,571
Gu Yi?

354
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:34,491
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

355
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:38,731
This is Liang Daiwen.

356
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:41,652
We're sorry.

357
00:27:42,731 --> 00:27:43,852
Gu Yi

358
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:45,372
is not feeling well today.

359
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:47,852
Is it possible for her

360
00:27:48,452 --> 00:27:49,172
to take the day off?

361
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:51,372
Okay.

362
00:27:58,291 --> 00:27:58,892
Ms. Zhang,

363
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,249
how could you

364
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,432
just let Gu Yi get away with it?

365
00:28:02,412 --> 00:28:03,251
When she's back,

366
00:28:03,731 --> 00:28:05,091
she can explain it herself.

367
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:06,932
She said she's quitting.

368
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,011
I'm sure you heard it, right?

369
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,600
Continue with the meeting.

370
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:14,452
Live and let live.

371
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:20,331
Zhi,

372
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:22,212
Gu Yi is on leave.

373
00:28:22,612 --> 00:28:24,331
You'll handle the article
she was supposed to do.

374
00:28:24,932 --> 00:28:26,212
Report back if it's too much for you.

375
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:27,592
Don't let it affect the progress.

376
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,250
Got it.

377
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:31,571
On to the next point.

378
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:37,571
Gu Yi.

379
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:40,212
You know,

380
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:42,612
with your lousy temper,

381
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:45,291
you should count yourself lucky
to be able to get

382
00:28:46,972 --> 00:28:48,251
a man like Liang.

383
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:52,132
I have to say he is quite a find.

384
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:57,051
I might be terrible
at picking a man for myself,

385
00:28:58,692 --> 00:29:00,571
(Flight Itinerary)
but I'm confident in helping

386
00:29:01,384 --> 00:29:03,200
(Thursday Donghai - Dalian)
my daughter pick hers.

387
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,920
(Liang Daiwen, Gu Yi)

388
00:29:06,132 --> 00:29:08,172
Aside from being a little quiet

389
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:09,811
and slow...

390
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:53,852
Here we go.

391
00:29:57,771 --> 00:29:59,291
Look how happy your dad is.

392
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:01,652
He even brought out his treasured wine.

393
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:02,892
Normally, no one's allowed near it.

394
00:30:02,892 --> 00:30:04,011
Of course.

395
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:05,932
The wine is hardly
as precious as the kids.

396
00:30:07,612 --> 00:30:09,011
Don't fuss about the wine.

397
00:30:10,011 --> 00:30:11,811
The kids must be hungry
from the long trip.

398
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:12,771
We should eat first.

399
00:30:12,932 --> 00:30:14,331
Yes, fill your stomach.

400
00:30:14,692 --> 00:30:16,172
This is my specialty soup.

401
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:17,051
And this too.

402
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:17,612
Thanks, ma'am.

403
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:18,452
Lotus.

404
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:20,132
Daiwen said

405
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:21,452
pot-fried pork is your favorite.

406
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:24,571
Go on, eat.

407
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:25,612
Try the food I made.

408
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:26,571
Okay.

409
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,120
What's the matter?

410
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:37,612
Is it not to your taste?

411
00:30:40,212 --> 00:30:40,811
No, no.

412
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:57,531
What's wrong?

413
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:04,731
It's nothing, ma'am.

414
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:05,852
It's very good.

415
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:12,731
What?

416
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:14,612
What's the matter?

417
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:15,852
You can tell me.

418
00:31:19,692 --> 00:31:20,251
Ma'am...

419
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:22,972
Your cooking

420
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:24,251
is too delicious.

421
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:27,172
It's just like my mom's cooking.

422
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,251
It's like her mom's.

423
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:34,090
You should eat more then.

424
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,372
Yes, eat more.

425
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:36,892
Daiwen.

426
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:38,692
Daiwen.

427
00:31:40,452 --> 00:31:41,652
My mom...

428
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:43,731
My mom

429
00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:45,491
just passed away.

430
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:06,212
Yi.

431
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:11,091
Sorry for your loss.

432
00:32:12,771 --> 00:32:13,531
I

433
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:15,692
understand how you feel right now.

434
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,251
I've lost my parents too.

435
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:21,491
I also lost my loved one.

436
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:24,692
Losing people you love
is part and parcel of life.

437
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:27,731
You'll probably never

438
00:32:28,452 --> 00:32:29,412
come to terms with it.

439
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:33,091
We may not be able to turn back time,

440
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:33,892
but,

441
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:37,011
we have to accept reality
and move forward.

442
00:32:39,212 --> 00:32:40,811
I told Daiwen the same.

443
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:43,412
It's no good

444
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:45,692
only to remember what tore us apart.

445
00:32:47,011 --> 00:32:48,132
What we should remember

446
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:50,972
is the time we spent together, right?

447
00:32:56,972 --> 00:32:58,531
People say parents

448
00:32:58,612 --> 00:32:59,892
are like angels manifested.

449
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,530
There's no need to put so much emphasis

450
00:33:02,972 --> 00:33:03,692
on life and death.

451
00:33:04,331 --> 00:33:05,612
What really matters is

452
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:08,771
they're never far away.

453
00:33:18,612 --> 00:33:18,932
Here.

454
00:33:19,352 --> 00:33:20,824
Let's raise our glasses to your mother.

455
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:23,692
Death is just a long journey.

456
00:33:24,932 --> 00:33:25,852
You'll meet again one day.

457
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:40,852
Eat more.

458
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:43,132
Come, have more meat.

459
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:44,291
Try this dish.

460
00:33:45,091 --> 00:33:45,452
Okay.

461
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:51,692
She bought this from the supermarket.

462
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,571
Don't be sly. I made this myself.

463
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:55,051
Yes, sure.

464
00:33:55,051 --> 00:33:55,571
Eat more.

465
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:56,091
You made it.

466
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:57,331
Eat more.

467
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,010
You too, Daiwen.

468
00:33:58,011 --> 00:33:58,491
Here.

469
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,051
Daiwen, have the lotus.

470
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:02,892
Is it good?

471
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:04,531
It has to be good since it's bought.

472
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:06,652
No, I mean, she made it.

473
00:34:45,732 --> 00:34:46,571
Liang Daiwen.

474
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:50,372
Can you

475
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:52,571
tell me

476
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:54,011
about your mom?

477
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:02,412
I don't quite remember

478
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:06,452
a lot of the details now.

479
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:08,691
I can't tell

480
00:35:10,571 --> 00:35:12,932
if certain memories actually happened

481
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:15,852
or if I conjured them.

482
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:21,412
That's okay.

483
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,091
You can tell me what you remember.

484
00:35:25,051 --> 00:35:25,972
I'd like to hear it.

485
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:42,651
I remember my mom

486
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:45,852
laughed a lot.

487
00:35:49,352 --> 00:35:50,850
She looked beautiful when she smiled.

488
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:56,292
She was very active before she got ill.

489
00:35:57,368 --> 00:35:58,264
Hiking mountains,

490
00:35:58,972 --> 00:35:59,491
dancing,

491
00:36:00,611 --> 00:36:01,051
and swimming.

492
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:02,892
She did them all.

493
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,040
She was really good at drawing too.

494
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,091
She knew

495
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:10,772
how to fix my dad's designs.

496
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:13,972
She was always hands-on.

497
00:36:15,252 --> 00:36:16,211
When we went to the beach,

498
00:36:17,452 --> 00:36:18,691
she'd help me build

499
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:21,131
those really cool sandcastles.

500
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,171
But when she got sick,

501
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:34,491
she hardly went outside.

502
00:36:37,772 --> 00:36:39,051
Most of the time,

503
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:43,011
she'd sit by the window

504
00:36:44,812 --> 00:36:45,571
and look out.

505
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:50,732
My dad worried
she might become depressed

506
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,252
and so he bought lots of plants

507
00:36:55,128 --> 00:36:56,290
and placed them on the balcony.

508
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:02,171
But she was like you.

509
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,211
She couldn't even keep a cactus alive.

510
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:10,452
She used to love watching horror films.

511
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,852
I was a cowardly kid.

512
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,650
I had lots of fears.

513
00:37:23,732 --> 00:37:25,091
So I never watched it with her.

514
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:32,491
But after she passed,

515
00:37:34,812 --> 00:37:36,051
I somehow became unafraid.

516
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,704
I wasn't afraid of the dark.

517
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:43,571
Nor afraid of ghosts.

518
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,850
I was no longer afraid of anything.

519
00:37:57,412 --> 00:37:58,491
I just really missed her.

520
00:38:00,972 --> 00:38:01,812
Missed her awfully.

521
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:06,091
I would often

522
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,211
go to the cemetery at night.

523
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:12,412
I wanted to see

524
00:38:12,892 --> 00:38:13,972
if I could see her.

525
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:25,651
But I never once saw anything.

526
00:38:41,732 --> 00:38:42,412
Liang Daiwen.

527
00:38:44,732 --> 00:38:45,571
Can you

528
00:38:46,131 --> 00:38:47,691
take me to see your mom tomorrow?

529
00:39:09,788 --> 00:39:14,475
(Tomb of loving mother, Zhou Dai)

530
00:39:17,452 --> 00:39:17,852
Mom.

531
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:22,691
I brought my girlfriend to see you.

532
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:28,972
Hello, ma'am.

533
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,252
I am Liang Daiwen's girlfriend, Gu Yi.

534
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:36,051
My apologies,

535
00:39:36,252 --> 00:39:37,651
for only coming to see you now.

536
00:39:40,131 --> 00:39:41,892
Liang Daiwen has grown up
to be a great person.

537
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:45,051
He's tall, handsome and healthy.

538
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:48,531
He's doing what he loves,
which is accessible design.

539
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:51,252
Besides him,

540
00:39:52,452 --> 00:39:54,211
there's me and a bunch of friends
who adore him.

541
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:56,571
So rest assured.

542
00:39:58,091 --> 00:39:59,412
The only bummer

543
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,812
is that he really misses you.

544
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:04,732
Liang Daiwen,

545
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:08,171
should we let your mom listen

546
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:10,051
to the message my mom left for you?

547
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:22,852
Liang.

548
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:26,091
I'm sorry I can no longer

549
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:27,732
speak to you face to face.

550
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:32,171
Consider this a few words of advice

551
00:40:33,372 --> 00:40:34,972
from your future mother-in-law.

552
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:38,252
I'm glad Gu Yi is in your care.

553
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:42,571
My wish is for you two
to be happy and well.

554
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:46,732
But don't feel pressured by it.

555
00:40:48,452 --> 00:40:49,011
After all,

556
00:40:50,412 --> 00:40:51,892
it's up to you

557
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:53,972
how you want to live.

558
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:57,531
Whether you stay together
or go separate ways,

559
00:40:59,252 --> 00:41:02,011
I hope you'll always have
the other's best interest at heart.

560
00:41:03,932 --> 00:41:05,051
Don't let the other person down.

561
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:09,332
When a person

562
00:41:09,691 --> 00:41:11,812
is able to find someone they love
who loves them back,

563
00:41:12,691 --> 00:41:14,491
that's the most wonderful thing.

564
00:41:15,852 --> 00:41:16,972
It needs to be properly cared for,

565
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:18,812
and cherished.

566
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:22,651
In the future,

567
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:25,852
if Gu Yi bullies you,

568
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,320
I hope you'll be more understanding.

569
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:31,932
You're the man after all.

570
00:41:34,452 --> 00:41:36,011
If you bully Gu Yi,

571
00:41:38,011 --> 00:41:39,332
then I'd be against it.

572
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:42,932
Because I know very well

573
00:41:44,412 --> 00:41:46,051
how much Gu Yi loves you.

574
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:52,812
Liang.

575
00:41:55,252 --> 00:41:56,252
I know

576
00:41:57,812 --> 00:41:59,051
you carry a burden.

577
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:02,651
You said you don't blame your mom.

578
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:06,211
But you need more time
to come to terms with it.

579
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,531
How much time do you need though?

580
00:42:11,531 --> 00:42:13,772
You were still little
when your mom passed.

581
00:42:16,051 --> 00:42:18,131
She must have had so much
she wanted to say to you,

582
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:20,812
but was unable to.

583
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:23,252
I hope you don't hate
your father either.

584
00:42:26,372 --> 00:42:29,131
He's surely the man who loves you
and your mom the most.

585
00:42:36,691 --> 00:42:37,252
Liang,

586
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:42,412
when I'm over there

587
00:42:44,452 --> 00:42:45,611
and come across your mom,

588
00:42:47,611 --> 00:42:49,211
I promise I'll take good care of her.

589
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:52,332
We'll be sending you our blessings

590
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:54,292
from over there.

591
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:58,171
May you two be happy and well.

592
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,384
Sending my love to you.

593
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:11,091
Mdm. Wang.

594
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:13,932
Mom.

595
00:43:17,932 --> 00:43:18,732
We'll be alright.

596
00:43:49,051 --> 00:43:50,292
Dr. Shen told me

597
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:52,812
this is the hospital hallway
depicted in your drawing.

598
00:43:53,852 --> 00:43:55,372
It's where your mom passed away,

599
00:43:56,252 --> 00:43:56,972
right?

600
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,732
So you sleepwalked in the Van Gogh Manor

601
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:08,252
because you dreamed that
your mom's wheelchair.

602
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:10,611
It was the same when you were

603
00:44:11,412 --> 00:44:12,211
at my house's corridor.

604
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:15,051
Most of your nightmares

605
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:16,932
are related to this incident.

606
00:44:18,252 --> 00:44:18,852
Am I right?

607
00:44:20,651 --> 00:44:22,732
I heard my dad's phone ring
in the dream.

608
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:28,091
I also heard the alarm
at my mom's bed going off

609
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:32,171
amidst instrument noises.

610
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,091
My mom's wheelchair

611
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:42,011
would always disappear
in this corridor in the end.

612
00:44:44,691 --> 00:44:45,772
I could never catch up to her.

613
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,452
Dr. Shen said

614
00:44:50,152 --> 00:44:52,570
this is where you were when
they were trying to revive your mom.

615
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:56,852
It is the last support
in your subconscious.

616
00:44:58,852 --> 00:45:00,531
I didn't quite get it at first.

617
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:02,772
But now I know.

618
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:10,972
If you keep staying at this spot,

619
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:15,812
you'll have to keep losing your mom.

620
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,932
I dreamed of my mom too
a few days ago.

621
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:46,932
In the dream, she was dancing
on the stage

622
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:49,051
wearing her high heels.

623
00:45:51,491 --> 00:45:52,131
But in reality,

624
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:53,972
it never happened.

625
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:57,211
Obsession can cause people's memory

626
00:45:57,732 --> 00:45:58,611
to deviate.

627
00:46:00,772 --> 00:46:01,972
Whether a past memory

628
00:46:02,772 --> 00:46:04,491
is real or not

629
00:46:05,531 --> 00:46:06,691
doesn't really matter.

630
00:46:10,252 --> 00:46:11,412
But your dad is right.

631
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:14,932
All we have to remember is

632
00:46:14,932 --> 00:46:16,332
that we are loved.

633
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:31,211
Liang Daiwen.

634
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:37,412
Your dad and madam love you very much.

635
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:40,252
And so do I.

636
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:16,332
Come on.

637
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:17,531
