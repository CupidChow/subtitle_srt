25
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,160
You're just in time.

26
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,390
Job's done.

27
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,190
Here's your work badge back.

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,090
Send me the remaining payment soon.

29
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,400
Don't worry, you'll get every cent.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,210
We're having a wrap party
for the love reality show tonight.

31
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,760
You should come.

32
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,710
The boss wants to meet you.

33
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,550
Tell your boss

34
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,750
that I'm done

35
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,790
taking

36
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,590
rough-cut jobs.

37
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,350
From now on,

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,330
I'll be picking my projects.

39
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,070
Who was it that said,

40
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,510
"Rough cuts are still editing"?

41
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,750
Now that the job's done,
you're nitpicking?

42
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,600
That's not what I mean.

43
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,830
I appreciate the opportunity,

44
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,930
but I've been working nonstop

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,230
for three and a half months.

46
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,750
I need a break.

47
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:26,830
Plus,

48
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,390
I've got my bar to manage.

49
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:29,990
Fine.

50
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,270
All right, then.

51
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,390
But seriously,

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,230
hurry up with that final payment.

53
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,270
I'm strapped for cash.

54
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,790
Sorry, sorry.

55
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,150
Did you wait long?

56
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,790
I was in a meeting the whole time.

57
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,070
It's no big deal.

58
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,950
I got you a sandwich to hold you over.

59
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,670
Save some room for cake tonight.

60
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,230
Before we pick up the cake,

61
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,110
can you take me to buy a gift first?

62
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,750
Didn't you organize
Yu Dule's birthday party?

63
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,750
How do you not have a gift yet?

64
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,440
I didn't buy one yet.

65
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,190
Did you?

66
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,030
A hard drive.

67
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,670
He edits videos, doesn't he?

68
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,870
It'll probably come in handy.

69
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,350
You didn't need to get him two presents.

70
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,270
Now I seem thoughtless.

71
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,640
Give me one to pass off as mine.

72
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,870
The graphics card is from Lu Ming.

73
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,990
He couldn't make it

74
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,470
and asked us to give Yu Dule
his regards on his behalf.

75
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,550
You even contacted Mr. Lu?

76
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,150
How's he doing?

77
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,390
He's doing well.

78
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,710
He's focused on fulfilling orders
at the factory.

79
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,870
I heard he's so busy

80
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,360
that he barely has time to sleep.

81
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,270
He was happy
about Ounce's grand opening.

82
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,670
He joked that Fuzzy has no luck

83
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,790
with comedy shows

84
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,810
and said he'll turn the place
into a script game venue

85
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,110
once the lease ends.

86
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,430
Liang Daiwen,

87
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,430
have you noticed

88
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,470
that all my friends
have become your friends?

89
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,790
Well, my dad always asks about you first

90
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,190
when he calls me now.

91
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,150
That reminds me.

92
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,710
Should we invite

93
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,190
Guan Xingxin too?

94
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,750
What do you think?

95
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,830
I think

96
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,110
we should.

97
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,190
That's right.

98
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,110
You're learning, robot.

99
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,260
You'll be a pro in no time.

100
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,390
(Guan Xingxin)

101
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,030
Do you have plans

102
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,910
tonight?

103
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,510
Still on set.

104
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,110
The last two episodes got moved up,

105
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,790
so we're filming them today.

106
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,750
There's a wrap party later.

107
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,670
It's Yu Dule's birthday today.

108
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,230
If you're free,

109
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,710
you should drop by.

110
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,270
Did he ask you to invite me?

111
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,390
He doesn't know,

112
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,510
but he'd definitely want you there.

113
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,090
(Crazy for you,
crashing into walls for you!)

114
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,850
(Happy birthday!)

115
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,660
(Congratulations
to the young master of Ounce!)

116
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,530
(Best wishes
Forever young)

117
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,560
(Happy birthday, Good Luck)

118
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,990
Should we call him to ask

119
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,190
where he is?

120
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,320
If we wait any longer,
you'll finish all of them.

121
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,910
No way.

122
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,990
That would ruin the surprise.

123
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,550
Why does this feel like
we're planning a heist

124
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,150
instead of a party?

125
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,630
You don't understand.

126
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,310
Mr. Yu's parents were always busy

127
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,270
when he was a kid,

128
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,390
so

129
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,200
he's never really
celebrated his birthday.

130
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,470
Every time we suggested it,

131
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,510
he turned us down,

132
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,160
saying it was too sentimental.

133
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,870
So, this time,

134
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,990
we're throwing him a big one.

135
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,110
You invited him out on his birthday.

136
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,710
Surely he'll know something's up.

137
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,190
That's where you're wrong.

138
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,750
Humans do silly things

139
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,550
to create happiness

140
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,790
for each other.

141
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,470
Learn from this, robot.

142
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,710
He's here.

143
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,190
Happy birthday!

144
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,870
Why is it you?

145
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,790
I've foiled your plan,

146
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,310
Ms. Gu.

147
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,070
Well…

148
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,190
Should we

149
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,390
try again?

150
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,110
Forget it.

151
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,510
It's a waste of my emotions.

152
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,510
Come on.

153
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,270
Let's cut the cake.

154
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,750
Cut it properly.

155
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,430
If you mess up,

156
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,390
no daughters for you.

157
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,190
Gu Yi,

158
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,430
how can you

159
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,550
curse me so?

160
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,750
Why is that a curse?

161
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,470
He's secretly a total "girl dad".

162
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,190
It worked wonders

163
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,830
on Mr. Lu

164
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,670
during his birthday.

165
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,550
That's different.

166
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,430
He already has

167
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,430
an adorable daughter.

168
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,370
Shut up.

169
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,110
Cut it nicely.

170
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,190
Not bad.

171
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:44,830
Right?

172
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,030
And my presents?

173
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,750
Gee, thanks, Gu Yi.

174
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,910
I can immediately tell
it's a last-minute from a mall.

175
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,990
See? Am I right?

176
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,150
How'd you know?

177
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,310
Last year, I gave you a microphone.

178
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,790
It was a last-minute from the mall too.

179
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,270
Guess our minds think alike.

180
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,990
The graphics card is from Mr. Lu.

181
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,030
And this is from me.

182
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,030
How unoriginal.

183
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,950
Straight into the editing room

184
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,190
for me, huh?

185
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,670
Thanks.

186
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,350
It's okay.

187
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:24,910
Um…

188
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,870
Let's serve the cake.

189
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,790
Wait.

190
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,110
What about
those fortune cookies we bought?

191
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,190
Let's write down our wishes.

192
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,950
No cookies left.

193
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,350
You ate them all.

194
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,670
Perfect. No need to write anything.

195
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,440
It's childish anyway…

196
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,950
Write.

197
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,190
Make up for your poor
childhood memories.

198
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,590
Let's write them.

199
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,410
I'll go get the paper.

200
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,980
Why not prepare beforehand?

201
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,200
Now you have to run backstage.

202
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,070
Wasting my time.

203
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,590
Are you writing an essay?

204
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,870
What did you write? Show me.

205
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,790
Show you what?

206
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,350
It won't come true if I let you see it.

207
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,630
And you said this was childish.

208
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,230
You're taking it awfully seriously now.

209
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,990
I… I'll go grab a case of beer.

210
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,230
Ms. Gu,

211
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,230
care to exchange wishes?

212
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,710
Why bother? The birthday boy's gone.

213
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,390
Here, just read it.

214
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,110
"I hope Mr. Yu becomes
the world's number one editor…"

215
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,750
Video editor.

216
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,550
That's it?

217
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,110
That's it.

218
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,300
What else would I write?

219
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,400
What did you write?

220
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,070
My cosmic order.

221
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,070
I hope next time

222
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,250
(Cosmic Order, Liang X Gu)

223
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,550
you won't reject my proposal.

224
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,600
I finished filming
the love reality show.

225
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,550
I know.

226
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,270
Let's head back.

227
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,120
Let's not talk about that.

228
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,990
In your heart,

229
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,110
I've always been
on the rocks, haven't I?

230
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,870
When we broke up,

231
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,790
you said I didn't love anyone.

232
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,390
You've long thought I was selfish

233
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,550
and knew this would be

234
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,470
our outcome,

235
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,630
didn't you?

236
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,190
It's all in the past.

237
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,150
Let's not dwell on it.

238
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,270
I know

239
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,630
you're disappointed in me.

240
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,110
I'm disappointed in myself, too.

241
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,670
It's my fault
our relationship fell apart.

242
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,190
There's no point

243
00:11:52,552 --> 00:11:53,830
in forcing a reconciliation.

244
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,830
My parents and I

245
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,630
won't hurt you anymore.

246
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,270
So,

247
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,990
let's end things here.

248
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,670
I respect your decision.

249
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,910
No one had ever
given me cornflowers before.

250
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,510
I'll always remember

251
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,070
the days we spent together.

252
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,950
Yu Dule,

253
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,230
thank you for being by my side
for so long.

254
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,230
Happy birthday.

255
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,310
Actually,

256
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,390
I've never blamed you or your parents,

257
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,070
so

258
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,030
don't blame yourself either.

259
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,070
Mr. Yu,

260
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,390
where do you live?

261
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,700
I don't have an address.

262
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,190
Mr. Yu?

263
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,790
Let me do it.

264
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
I'll put in the address.

265
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,310
Now that the show is over,

266
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,830
what's next for you?

267
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,790
There are plenty
of entertainment companies

268
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,030
and MCNs that want to sign me,

269
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,070
but I turned them all down.

270
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,510
After these past months,

271
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,110
I finally understand what Shen meant

272
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,590
by accepting oneself.

273
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,470
I want to live my own life,

274
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,710
for myself.

275
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,750
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

276
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,470
We'll all get better from here on out.

277
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,550
By the way, I saw what Yu Dule

278
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,950
wrote on the fortune paper he hid.

279
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,030
He wrote your name.

280
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,790
He hopes

281
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,910
you'll always live in the light.

282
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,590
What are you doing?

283
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,110
Are you taking advantage of me?

284
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,550
Take off your shoes.

285
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,150
Are you going to sleep with them on?

286
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,190
Go.

287
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,190
Grab my pajamas for me.

288
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,830
Gu Yi,

289
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,750
are you a gecko?

290
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,630
Don't move.

291
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,430
This is…

292
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,630
a robbery.

293
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,060
What are you robbing?

294
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,950
Your virtue.

295
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,100
(Good morning)

296
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,470
Get up, Ms. Gu.

297
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,710
It's Monday.

298
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,430
Monday?

299
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,190
I'm calling in sick.

300
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,030
Today is Monday.

301
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,790
The day you go to Art List.

302
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:07,790
Why…

303
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,190
why am I wearing your clothes again?

304
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,230
Don't you remember?

305
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,630
What should I remember?

306
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,030
Ms. Gu,

307
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,190
you know you pounce on people
when you're drunk, right?

308
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,230
And then you ask why
my clothes are on you

309
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,190
when it's you who took them off me.

310
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,550
Me?

311
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,070
Took them

312
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,630
off you?

313
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,590
Well…

314
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,390
Um…

315
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,550
I'm

316
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,670
almost late

317
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,590
for work. I need to wash up.

318
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,640
You really don't remember?

319
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,350
Nope.

320
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,670
Should I

321
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,270
remind you?

322
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,670
No, no, no need for that…

323
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,390
Liang Daiwen,

324
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,710
you're becoming less like a robot.

325
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,110
Have you evolved?

326
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,790
Are you Robot 2.0 now?

327
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,190
Isn't evolving good?

328
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,990
Evolving…

329
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,190
of course it's good.

330
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,670
I enjoy the process of training you.

331
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,710
All right.

332
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,670
Then train me.

333
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,190
I was joking!

334
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,550
I don't have time to train you.

335
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,870
Move. I need to get to work.

336
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,370
Now you're suddenly all about work?

337
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,310
All right.

338
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,830
Agree to one condition,

339
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,030
and I'll let you go.

340
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:36,950
Fine, fine.

341
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,350
What's your condition?

342
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,070

(Art List New Media Center)

371
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,630
Ms. Gu,

372
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,750
is there anything else you need from me?

373
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,070
No, everything's done.

374
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,230
All right, I'm heading home then.

375
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,350
Okay, head back early.

376
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,710
Okay.

377
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,070
You too.

378
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,550
Bye.

379
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,110
Bye.

380
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,040
(Video call from Robot)

381
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,860
(Robot)

382
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,830
What are you doing?

383
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,790
Buying daily necessities.

384
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,630
Take a look.

385
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,790
Do you need any of these?

386
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,750
Anything's fine.

387
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,470
Do you really need to be
so indecisive about stuff like this?

388
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,630
Got it.

389
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,190
I'll buy one of each.

390
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,030
Anything you want to eat?

391
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,390
Liang Daiwen,

392
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,470
why don't you just buy
a wedding decoration

393
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,630
for the door while you're at it?

394
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,870
Comedic setup.

395
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,750
Okay, stop teasing.

396
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,590
Hurry home.

397
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,430
If I need anything,
I'll just buy it online.

398
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,670
When do you get off work?

399
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,620
I'll come pick you up.

400
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,670
No need.

401
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,030
I want to go back to my old place
to grab a few things.

402
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,390
I'll handle it myself.

403
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,230
I've already moved
all your stuff from there.

404
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,110
What else do you need?

405
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,070
Something important.

406
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,550
Just go home.

407
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,390
Bye.

408
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,430
Gu Yi!

409
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,750
Gu Yi!

410
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,030
Where's Gu Yi?

411
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,390
Are you looking for Ms. Yi, Ms. Zhang?

412
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,310
She's reporting in at Art List today.

413
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:47,950
I forgot.

414
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,890
You should hurry and get off work.

415
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,550
Mr. Huang.

416
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,720
Where's Zhang Junjie?

417
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,630
She's inside.

418
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,790
If you have something to say, say it.

419
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,750
If not, leave.

420
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,750
You're being so dismissive today.

421
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,870
What happened
to your company's Biluochun tea?

422
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,310
No need to be impatient.

423
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,910
I'm heading back to Beijing soon.

424
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,910
I just came by to say goodbye.

425
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,950
Everything settled with Guan Xingxin?

426
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,110
After that show,

427
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,030
a lot of companies wanted to sign her,

428
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,470
but she turned them all down.

429
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,550
I can't keep focusing on an artist

430
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,990
who doesn't want to progress, can I?

431
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,590
Her future is up

432
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,950
to her.

433
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,830
Be honest.

434
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,630
It's nothing major.

435
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,710
At the celebration party,

436
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,990
an advertiser

437
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,430
said something inappropriate,

438
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,310
and I punched them.

439
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,470
They've been pestering me
these past few days,

440
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,150
and I'm fed up.

441
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,160
Heading back to Beijing
for some peace and quiet.

442
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,070
You're a grown adult.

443
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,030
Can't you think before you act?

444
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,150
They deserved it.

445
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,710
But

446
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,830
when I hit them, I felt like

447
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,230
I was hitting my younger self.

448
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,280
Do you still remember
what happened to us back then?

449
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,240
I've forgotten.

450
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:05,710
Good.

451
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,780
It's better forgotten.

452
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,950
I still remember

453
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,190
the year I brought you to Donghai.

454
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,640
There wasn't even a high-speed rail yet.

455
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,910
We took a hard sleeper train.

456
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,430
It was an eight-hour ride,

457
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,670
and my back was killing me.

458
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,390
You

459
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,670
sat

460
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,510
in the train corridor,

461
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,110
staring out the window,

462
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,550
and looking so excited.

463
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,870
Like you'd never seen the world.

464
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,070
Looking at you,

465
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,270
I thought it was endearing.

466
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,630
Later,

467
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,630
you fell out with your family
because of me.

468
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,590
After that,

469
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,710
when my career stabilized

470
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,510
and I started making money,

471
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,870
I wanted to get married.

472
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,670
Half of it was for myself,

473
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,790
but the other half

474
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,310
was out of care for you.

475
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,110
That's what I thought back then.

476
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,390
I thought,

477
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,750
if we keep working ourselves

478
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,590
into the ground
and end up in the hospital,

479
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,230
what's the point?

480
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,870
It's not worth it.

481
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,470
So I thought,

482
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,500
I'd go out and earn money,
and you could stay home

483
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,170
and take care of the family.
Wouldn't that be great?

484
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,750
But

485
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,910
I didn't expect you to refuse.

486
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,910
Whenever we talked about it,

487
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,470
we'd fight.

488
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,390
Fight until…

489
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,270
You know,

490
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,590
when I heard
you were pregnant back then,

491
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,870
I was so happy.

492
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,670
I know.

493
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,870
You don't want
to hear this old story again,

494
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,630
but I remember it all.

495
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,430
And I don't plan to forget.

496
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,110
Over the years,

497
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,830
Donghai has always been
a sad place for me.

498
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,510
I've loved you,

499
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,230
and I've resented you.

500
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,710
Even now,

501
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,510
I can't let you go.

502
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,390
You've become my inner demon.

503
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:43,950
All right.

504
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,150
I've said everything I wanted to.

505
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,110
I feel better now.

506
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,990
I won't bring it up again.

507
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,510
Junjie.

508
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,470
Can we let go

509
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,910
of all the grudges

510
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,750
from the past

511
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,430
and start over?

512
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,070
Can we

513
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:09,870
move on?

514
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,550
I know.

515
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,110
I still owe you an apology.

516
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,350
Zhang Junjie,

517
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,470
you're the best woman

518
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,910
I've ever known.

519
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,230
I shouldn't have
disrespected you back then.

520
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,830
I shouldn't have tried

521
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,790
to control your life,

522
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,110
forcing you to…

523
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,230
Forcing you

524
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,230
to have an abortion

525
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,830
just to escape from me.

526
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,670
I'm sorry.

527
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,150
I mean it.

528
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,270
I'm sorry.

529
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,270
Mom,

530
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,470
I'm moving.

531
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,900
(Happy Marriage)

532
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,910
Liang Daiwen!

533
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,110
What's with the wedding decoration
at the door?

534
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,870
Didn't you ask me to buy it?

535
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,680
The supermarkets were sold out.

536
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,430
I had to go
to several gift shops to find it.

537
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,910
Take it down!

538
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,270
No.

539
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,190
You won't?

540
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,390
Then, I will.

541
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,170
You tear it down, and I'll buy another.

542
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,420
(Be Happy Everyday)

543
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,030
You spent the whole day

544
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,030
on this?

545
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,590
The robot and cat drawings

546
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,190
are copied
from that long comic of yours.

547
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,040
Didn't need much imagination,

548
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,430
so they were easier to draw.

549
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,470
What about the one
in your bedroom?

550
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,230
That one? No one.

551
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,790
It's of my home.

552
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,150
When my mom was sick,

553
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,550
she often stared outside

554
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,910
through that window.

555
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,750
For some reason,

556
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,510
I always think of that image.

557
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,390
You woke up happy today.

558
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,510
Because I realized

559
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,070
that from now on,

560
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,270
the first thing I'll see
every morning is you.

561
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,350
That makes me very happy.

562
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,070
Your bar for happiness is pretty low.

563
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,630
It's enough for me.

564
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:07,790
Don't worry.

565
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,550
I won't casually propose again.

566
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:36,910
(Art List)

567
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,790
When discussing gender topics,
the entry point must be sharp,

568
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,750
but avoid being inflammatory.

569
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,270
For topics like advice from 30-year-olds

570
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,230
to 20-year-olds,

571
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,910
we've done this

572
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,390
countless times

573
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,750
when I was at Nextmonday.

574
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,150
There's nothing new to write about,

575
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,670
but we can be innovative
in terms of format.

576
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,910
For example,

577
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,990
random street interviews.

578
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,350
You can give that a try.

579
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,110
Also,

580
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,080
don't limit yourself
to marriage and relationships.

581
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,710
Be flexible about the gender and age

582
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,030
of the interviewees too.

583
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,900
Go out and gather material first.

584
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,120
We'll talk after you're back.

585
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,390
(What Advice Would You Give
To Someone In Love?)

586
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,280
(Zhou Huaizhi: Gu Yi,
the Demoness is resigning!)

587
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,470
You're supposed to be
at Art List right now.

588
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,560
What are you doing here?

589
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,990
Are you really resigning?

590
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,150
What?

591
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,710
Do I need your approval

592
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,870
to resign?

593
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,270
Why?

594
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,270
Is it because Art List
didn't meet the data targets?

595
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,670
You always say I gaslight you.

596
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,590
But actually,
you're gaslighting yourself.

597
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,470
Art List's numbers
already exceeded the targets.

598
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,110
The standards I set were just

599
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,350
to motivate you.

600
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,830
What you've achieved now
is already excellent.

601
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,430
Don't overthink it.

602
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,470
Then why are you suddenly leaving?

603
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,950
I'm tired of working on magazines.

604
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,830
Huang Wenda needs a partner over there.

605
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,590
I think I'll have more room to grow

606
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,910
with him.

607
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,710
What about Nextmonday?

608
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,390
Nextmonday belongs to Roger.

609
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,230
He has his plans.

610
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,830
You

611
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,870
just focus on doing your job well.

612
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,430
What's wrong?

613
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,790
Can't bear to see me go?

614
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,350
Huang Wenda's quarterly budget

615
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,670
is quite generous.

616
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,070
Didn't you learn video editing back

617
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,510
when you were at the TV station?

618
00:39:30,008 --> 00:39:30,630
How about this?

619
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:31,950
Why don't you come with me?

620
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,870
I'll teach you public relations.

621
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,350
25,000 monthly salary.

622
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,110
13-month pay.

623
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,630
15 days of annual leave.

624
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,070
No thanks.

625
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,150
You might as well say,

626
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,990
take-home salary is 15,000,

627
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,710
one typo deducts 500,

628
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,230
24-hours-a-day availability required.

629
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,270
Office hours include alternate days off,

630
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,550
and any minor issue
cancels annual leave.

631
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,670
One small mistake means no bonuses,

632
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,630
promotions require
cutthroat competition,

633
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,390
and I must work tirelessly

634
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,510
while serving as your office mediator.

635
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,030
Gu Yi,

636
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,470
you're smart.

637
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,390
I've been hearing this from you

638
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,790
since I joined the company.

639
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,430
I've already installed
a mental auto-translate system.

640
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,230
Thank you.

641
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,150
There's no such thing

642
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,870
as a banquet that doesn't end.

643
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,470
Take care of yourself.

644
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,430
Until we meet again.

645
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,830
Why are you all crowding here?

646
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:09,510
Is this a farewell ceremony or what?

647
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,310
Ms. Zhang,

648
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,350
are you

649
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,670
really leaving?

650
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,390
Stop calling me Ms. Zhang.

651
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,150
The company will send

652
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,910
a new director in a few days.

653
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,550
Don't say I didn't warn you.

654
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,630
Get your work in proper order.

655
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,150
Don't give anyone a chance to nitpick.

656
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:34,750
Ms. Zhang,

657
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,950
can't you stay?

658
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,190
You want me to stay?

659
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,230
Isn't it good
that the Demoness is leaving?

660
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,470
Don't rely on food

661
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,590
to cope with stress anymore.

662
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,270
Learn

663
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,670
how to release pressure.

664
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,630
And you, Mi.

665
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,070
Be punctual for meetings.

666
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,550
Stop being late.

667
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,350
All right.

668
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,190
Nextmonday's success today

669
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,990
is thanks to all of you.

670
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,470
I've been lucky to work with you

671
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,870
these past few years.

672
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:28,830
It's

673
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,230
a long journey ahead.

674
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:32,350
We'll meet again in the workplace.

675
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,830
But I hope

676
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,950
every one of you

677
00:42:38,648 --> 00:42:39,910
will be able to hold your own.

678
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:42,830
Meeting adjourned.

679
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,750
