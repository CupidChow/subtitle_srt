It's fine.

Liang Daiwen,

28
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:04,683
I know where you are.

29
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:07,923
I just wanted to check

30
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:09,162
if you were sleepwalking.

31
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:10,442
You knew?

32
00:02:13,403 --> 00:02:14,523
You went back to your hometown

33
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:16,442
to your mom's grave, didn't you?

34
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:17,882
Sorry.

35
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:19,602
I didn't mean to lose contact.

36
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:21,762
I just got off the plane.

37
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:24,123
It's okay.

38
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:26,322
I'll wait for you at home.

42

How did you know I was here?

43
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,202
I didn't.

44
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:39,722
I came to visit your mom.

45
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:40,800
It's just a coincidence.

46
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:44,563
When did you get back?

47
00:03:45,523 --> 00:03:46,882
How long are you staying this time?

48
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:55,922
I remember

49
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:59,123
when you were little,

50
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:00,042
you learned to draw.

51
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:03,162
You were quite mischievous.

52
00:04:03,922 --> 00:04:05,123
When no one was around,

53
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,123
you would just

54
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:07,482
scribble everywhere.

55
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,722
But when your mom was present,

56
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:12,243
you'd clean up your act.

57
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:14,442
Later, I asked her,

58
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,962
why not let me teach you at home?

59
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:19,163
Your mom said,

60
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:20,803
my drawing style was too stiff,

61
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:21,803
so she didn't agree.

62
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:24,282
You could only draw floor plans.

63
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:26,882
She wasn't wrong.

64
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:35,842
Wen,

65
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:40,243
before your mom passed away,

66
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:42,762
did you really hate me?

67
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:47,483
I remember

68
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:51,842
after your mom left,

69
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:56,322
our lives became a total mess.

70
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,243
Your personality completely changed.

71
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:02,442
The truth is,

72
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,163
I didn't know how to talk to a kid.

73
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:09,642
I couldn't figure out
what the problem was.

74
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:12,563
I thought

75
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:15,723
giving you a complete family again

76
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:18,003
would ease your pain.

77
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,082
I never expected

78
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,522
that it would only push us
further apart.

79
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:25,762
It was a "complete family" for you,

80
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:28,442
but not for me.

81
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:40,163
I understand your resentment.

82
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:43,282
You hate me

83
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:46,163
because you think

84
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:48,642
I stopped loving your mom

85
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:49,683
and gave up on her.

86
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:55,603
To be honest,

87
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:57,882
if I said that your mom's passing

88
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:01,243
caught me completely off guard,

89
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:04,842
I would be lying to you.

90
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:08,082
The truth is, your mom's decision

91
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,803
didn't surprise me at all.

92
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:12,442
Because

93
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:15,402
I knew your mom very well.

94
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,962
But what I want to tell you, Wen,

95
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:22,563
is that respecting your mom's decision

96
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:27,243
was the last thing I could do for her.

97
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:32,483
I'm sorry

98
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:33,923
for letting you misunderstand us

99
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:34,882
all these years.

100
00:07:57,563 --> 00:07:59,442
Hold onto those beautiful memories,

101
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:02,603
and you'll never forget

102
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:03,723
what your mom looked like.

103
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:49,162
Dad...

104
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:54,483
Wen, don't worry.

105
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:55,682
Dinner will be ready soon.

106
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:58,400
Make sure the eggs are soft
and not overcooked.

107
00:08:58,402 --> 00:08:59,039
I know, I know.

108
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,880
You've told me already.

109
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:00,880
Wen likes them soft.

111
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:30,922
Really?

112
00:10:19,522 --> 00:10:20,203
What's the matter?

113
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:22,162
Is the chair too warm?

114
00:10:23,843 --> 00:10:24,642
Mom,

115
00:10:24,642 --> 00:10:26,603
I don't want to draw apples
and bananas anymore.

116
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:27,800
I've drawn them so many times.

117
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,856
They don't look good at all.

118
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,123
Then what do you want to draw?

119
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:33,562
I want to draw people.

120
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:37,000
You haven't even mastered
apples and bananas,

121
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,282
and you want to draw people?

122
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:40,243
So who do you want to draw?

123
00:10:41,443 --> 00:10:42,282
I want to draw you.

124
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:43,402
And Dad.

125
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:45,843
And Mona Lisa.

126
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:48,042
You know about Mona Lisa?

127
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:49,843
Who is Mona Lisa?

128
00:10:51,843 --> 00:10:53,042
She's the lady who sells cars.

129
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:25,003
Those

130
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,402
are the birthday gifts

131
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:28,723

(To my darling,)

135

(you'll be 29 years old.)

139

(Do you have a girlfriend
celebrating with you?)

140
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,123
(When you were little,)

141
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:38,762
(you wanted to draw Mona Lisa.)

142
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:42,003
(Of all the portraits you threw away,)

143
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:43,323
(this was your best one.)

144
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:46,003
(Is this)

145
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:47,360
(what your "Mona Lisa" looks like?)

146
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,003
(Let me guess)

00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:52,042
(what your girlfriend is like.)

148
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:54,642
(First,)

149
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:56,323
(she is a very cheerful girl.)

150
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:58,843
(After all, you)

151
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:00,243
(are such a mischievous boy.)

152
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:02,083
(A shy girl)

153
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,243
(would be scared off by you.)

154
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:05,963
(And,)

155
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,363
(she probably loves to laugh.)

156
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:10,483
(Because you love to laugh.)

157
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:12,443
(The two of you)

158
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:14,562
(would make each other laugh every day.)

159
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:17,522
(She's very patient,)

160
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:20,642
(able to tolerate your immaturity
and quirks.)

161
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,162
(She's also very smart,)

162
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:26,083
(and can help you become
a better person.)

163
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:28,682
(Most importantly,)

164
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:30,083
(she truly loves you.)

165

(She's willing to forgive you
when you make mistakes,)

166
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:36,922
(and when you lose your grip,)

167

(she'll guide you back on track,)

168
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:39,323
(be with you,)

00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,083
(protect you,)

170
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:42,240
(and light up your life.)

(I sincerely wish you both the best.)

175
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:55,042
(I will always love you.)

176
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:02,882
A little less,

177
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,402
otherwise it will wither.

178
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,840
(Are you busy? There's something
I want to tell you.)

179
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,965
(I've taken on a new job,
sorry I didn't tell you in advance.)

180
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:02,802
Xingxin,

181
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,040
have you read the script?

182
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:05,802
Yes, I have, Director.

183
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,483
No problems. Everything's clear.

184
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:08,723
Don't misunderstand.

185
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:10,963
The script is to help everyone

186
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:12,042
identify with their persona.

187
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,522
With your great looks,

188
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:14,443
you can go with

189
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:15,882
the "man-killer" route.

190
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:18,200
Once the topics from
the first few episodes pick up,

191
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:18,682
most likely

192
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:19,922
your past gossip

193
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:20,922
will get dug up.

194
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:23,802
We won't respond outside the show.

195
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:24,664
When you're on the show,

196
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,723
dial it down.

197
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:27,922
Go for the "pretty but dumb" persona.

198
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:30,522
The audience already has preconceptions

199
00:15:30,522 --> 00:15:31,323
about your private life.

200
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:32,522
Don't fight it.

201
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:33,843
Soft approach first,

202
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:34,522
understand?

203
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:36,642
Got it.

204
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:38,042
Clever girl.

205
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:40,282
No wonder Mr. Huang recommended you.

206
00:15:41,243 --> 00:15:41,922
Get prepared.

207
00:15:42,203 --> 00:15:42,922
Let's get started.

208
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:51,076
("Meeting My Heart's Desire")

209
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:00,292
(Yu Dule)

210
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,475
(I've taken on a new job.)

211
00:16:01,475 --> 00:16:04,459
(Studio No. 03)

212
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:14,203
You didn't have to come.

213
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,203
I agreed to do the shoot.

214
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:17,403
I won't mess it up.

215
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:23,122
Who said I was worried you'd mess up?

216
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,322
Let me tell you,

217
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:26,243
this show

218
00:17:26,683 --> 00:17:28,042
was made for you.

219
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:29,163
Three men.

220
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:30,443
Three backups.

221
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:33,483
What do you mean?

222
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:36,762
Don't you have four parents?

223
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:38,483
You should be used to

224
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,243
a life of choices, right?

225
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:41,842
Huang Wenda,

226
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:43,320
how much do you know about me?

227
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:44,683
Quite a lot, actually.

228
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:49,842
Let me be honest with you.

229
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:52,683
Your mom called me.

230
00:17:53,243 --> 00:17:54,723
I know everything I need to know.

231
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,643
You

232
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,200
come from a difficult family background.

233
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,136
If it weren't for the financial support
of your adoptive parents,

234
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:03,362
you wouldn't have been able

235
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:05,163
to escape that vegetable market
in your hometown.

236
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:05,880
Isn't that right?

237
00:18:07,602 --> 00:18:08,723
Your biological parents

238
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,040
were constantly anxious and insecure

239
00:18:10,562 --> 00:18:11,883
due to your blindness.

240
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:12,963
They're stubborn.

241
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:13,883
They think

242
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,919
the only way for you
to have a stable life

243
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,384
is to marry rich
and become a trophy wife.

244
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,042
As for your adoptive parents,

245
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:21,243
they project

246
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:22,522
their guilt

247
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:24,403
over their biological daughter onto you.

248
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:25,362
So they

249
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,280
invested money and effort,

250
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:27,432
and made great sacrifices.

251
00:18:27,883 --> 00:18:28,643
To put it bluntly,

252
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:31,003
they just treated you like a stand-in.

253
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:32,282
Sorry for being blunt,

254
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:34,443
but that is one twisted family.

255
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:36,522
You can look down on me,

256
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:38,320
but leave my parents out of it.

257
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:39,842
My family matters

258
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:41,122
are none of your business.

259
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:45,282
Just because I said
your family is twisted

260
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:47,243
doesn't mean I'm looking down on you.

261
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:48,802
Did I say anything wrong?

262
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:52,282
She paraded you around the park

263
00:18:52,282 --> 00:18:53,802
to look for a suitor

264
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:56,003
because you threw away a
4-million-yuan wedding house,

265
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:56,602
right?

266
00:18:57,122 --> 00:18:58,243
If you think it was out of love,

267
00:18:58,362 --> 00:18:59,562
why did you run away?

268
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:05,802
How are you going back?

269
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,600
(Meixia the Demon)

270
00:19:57,683 --> 00:19:58,562
Meixia.

271
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:01,802
You've improved.

272
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:02,923
Thumbs up for you.

273
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:05,602
You're answering calls
faster and faster now.

274
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:06,683
How?

275
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:08,480
Were you just sitting there
waiting for me?

276
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:09,762
Of course.

277
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:12,562
Forget about eating or sleeping,

278
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:15,122
all I want is to video chat with you.

279
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:17,762
Oh, stop it.

280
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:19,683
Did you drink today?

281
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:21,483
I did.

282
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:24,042
I'm experiencing
a "bloodline awakening."

283
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:25,483
I'm becoming a drunk

284
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:26,322
just like you.

285
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:29,280
How can you talk to your mom like that?

286
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:34,003
Where's Mr. He?

287
00:20:36,842 --> 00:20:38,082
He's old and slow.

288
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,272
I ran out of medicine

289
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:40,880
and asked him to pick some up
at the hospital.

290
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:41,919
He's still not back.

291
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,224
Maybe he's just hopelessly clumsy.

292
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:50,602
Mom,

293
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:52,723
why don't you lie down
while talking to me?

294
00:20:54,322 --> 00:20:55,839
If I lie down, I'll fall asleep.

295
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,592
If I fall asleep, who are you
going to talk to?

296
00:20:57,963 --> 00:20:59,403
Then just fall asleep.

297
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:01,322
When I was a kid, at this time,

298
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:02,883
you'd shoo me off to bed.

299
00:21:03,723 --> 00:21:04,963
Now it's my turn to tuck you in.

300
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:08,003
Oh, please.

301
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:09,723
Like you could tuck me in.

302
00:21:10,362 --> 00:21:11,522
Before you could get me to sleep,

303
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:12,872
you'd already fall asleep yourself.

304
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,483
I won't.

305
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:15,282
Just lie down.

306
00:21:17,683 --> 00:21:18,203
Alright.

307
00:21:22,842 --> 00:21:23,443
I'm lying down.

308
00:21:24,003 --> 00:21:25,203
Cover yourself with the blanket.

309
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:26,842
Close your eyes.

310
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:30,443
Alright, go ahead.

Isn't there

321
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:47,923
anything you want to ask me?

322
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:53,522
I...

323
00:22:56,082 --> 00:22:57,362
I don't know

324
00:22:58,362 --> 00:22:59,443
where to begin.

325
00:23:05,883 --> 00:23:06,683
Alright, I'll explain.

326
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:09,683
I went to that villa

327
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:11,322
for a shoot.

328
00:23:12,322 --> 00:23:13,362
Huang Wenda came to pick me up

329
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,923
purely for work-related matters.

330
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:17,203
I got kicked out

331
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,600
of the virtual girl group,

332
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:20,443
so this is my only chance.

333
00:23:21,403 --> 00:23:22,762
I have to rely on myself

334
00:23:22,762 --> 00:23:24,322
to break free from my family's control.

335
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:26,203
Only then can we truly be together.

336
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:28,923
Please trust me.

337
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:30,923
This time, I won't mess it up.

338
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:34,643
You're doing all this

339
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:36,562
for me?

340
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:42,723
Guan Xingxin,

341
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:46,082
there's one thing I don't understand.

342
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:48,403
I'm the one your parents dislike.

343
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:49,842
So why

344
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:51,842
are you the one trying to run away?

345
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,643
Your parents think I'm not good enough,

346
00:23:57,224 --> 00:23:58,240
that I don't deserve you.

347
00:23:58,683 --> 00:23:59,562
That's normal.

348
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:00,963
Compared to Huang Wenda,

349
00:24:00,963 --> 00:24:02,243
I really am lacking.

350
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:04,243
So I thought

351
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:06,163
I'd work hard.

352
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:07,963
Work hard

353
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:09,762
to prove myself to your parents.

354
00:24:11,122 --> 00:24:11,522
I...

355
00:24:11,522 --> 00:24:13,282
I don't want to hide forever,

356
00:24:13,282 --> 00:24:13,963
do you understand?

357
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:16,602
They won't listen.

358
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:18,282
You don't understand my parents.

359
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:21,656
You never intended for me
to understand them, did you?

360
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:29,723
So, do you plan

361
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,400
to just keep things like this forever?

362
00:24:34,802 --> 00:24:36,122
I'm fine living here.

363
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,360
At least this way, my parents

364
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:38,883
won't go after Jacqueline.

365
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:41,522
And with Huang Wenda
helping me deal with them,

366
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,683
I can focus on my work.

367
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,776
Only by earning money
can I live independently.

368
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:46,643
I have some savings. It's not much,

369
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:48,042
but you can have it
whenever you need it.

370
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:50,080
As for housing, I can help you
find another place.

371
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,144
There are so many problems...

372
00:24:51,176 --> 00:24:51,800
Alright, stop.

373
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:54,923
I know what I'm doing.

374
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:14,522
Unlocked.

375
00:25:47,082 --> 00:25:48,403
Liang Daiwen.

376
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:56,483

if you even remotely
considered me a rival,

463
00:33:55,522 --> 00:33:57,042
you wouldn't be asking me this, right?

464
00:33:58,243 --> 00:33:59,282
What are you thinking?

465
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:02,483
I don't have many options.

466
00:34:03,122 --> 00:34:03,963
You know Gu Yi.

467
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:05,923
Besides,

468
00:34:08,403 --> 00:34:09,763
when I wasn't around,

469
00:34:10,392 --> 00:34:11,688
you were the one taking care of her.

470
00:34:14,162 --> 00:34:15,843
Then ask your friends.

471
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:17,082
I did.

472
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:19,883

Another just wants to mess with me.

476
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:30,803
So how do you usually

477
00:34:31,242 --> 00:34:32,283
get along with people?

478
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,602
I've watched a lot of TV dramas.

479

Gu Yi doesn't like it
when I imitate TV dramas.

481
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:47,363
You can't manage a relationship

482
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,480
without imitating TV dramas?

483
00:34:55,242 --> 00:34:56,323
Not just a relationship.

484
00:34:57,803 --> 00:34:59,162
I want to become her family.

485
00:35:00,242 --> 00:35:00,963
To make her feel

486
00:35:01,722 --> 00:35:03,162
that she can always rely on me.

487
00:35:05,242 --> 00:35:05,722
Wait...

488
00:35:07,082 --> 00:35:07,923
Did something happen

489
00:35:08,003 --> 00:35:08,923
to Gu Yi's family?

490
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:18,082
If you want to become her family,

491
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:20,323
you need to make a statement.

492
00:35:26,763 --> 00:35:28,483
Even though I don't want to help you,

493
00:35:29,803 --> 00:35:32,443
I've seen Gu Yi having mood swings

494
00:35:33,082 --> 00:35:34,082
because of you too many times.

495
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:36,682
She's indecisive in love.

496
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:38,122
She really feels insecure.

497
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:41,602
If you want to become her family,

498
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:43,642
first of all,

499
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:45,443
she needs to believe
you've got the commitment.

500
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:51,042
Commitment?

501
00:35:53,722 --> 00:35:55,403
The commitment to give her a home.

502
00:36:17,483 --> 00:36:18,363
Commitment.

503
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:52,242
That's

504
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:54,242
a cat and a robot.

505
00:37:56,082 --> 00:37:57,042
It's you and me.

506
00:37:58,082 --> 00:37:59,323
Your bed is too low.

507
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,242
No matter how hard I tried,

508
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:02,682
I couldn't stick it under the bed.

509
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:05,080
So we can only look at it
while lying down.

510
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:13,363
There's something I want to tell you.

511
00:38:17,803 --> 00:38:19,963
After the last magazine interview
was published,

512
00:38:20,963 --> 00:38:22,722
we got several project proposals.

513
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:24,722
Li Ai said thank you.

514
00:38:30,403 --> 00:38:31,682
As for Mr. Lu's Fluffy Theater,

515
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:33,283
I've subleased it.

516
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:35,042
In the future,

517
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:37,283
there will occasionally be

518
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:38,642
accessibility design salons.

519
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:41,283
If you want to do a real
stand-up comedy theater,

520
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:43,522
I'll apply for the performance license.

521
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:45,682
Let's work hard together.

522
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:47,883
No one should give up on their dreams.

523
00:38:58,763 --> 00:38:59,483
I know.

524
00:39:02,242 --> 00:39:03,722
I still haven't developed enough.

525
00:39:05,483 --> 00:39:06,042
I'm clingy,

526
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:08,162
slow to react

527
00:39:09,642 --> 00:39:10,443
and have low empathy.

528
00:39:11,403 --> 00:39:12,202
But I promise

529
00:39:12,963 --> 00:39:14,483
I'll improve a little every day.

530
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,883
If I can't guess what you're thinking,

531
00:39:17,403 --> 00:39:18,363
I'll just ask you directly.

532
00:39:19,384 --> 00:39:20,360
If there's a misunderstanding,

533
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:21,883
I'll clarify it.

534
00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:24,323
If I miss you,

535
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:25,722
I'll come find you.

536
00:39:27,602 --> 00:39:29,363
If I feel something,
I'll share it with you.

537
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:32,363
I'll be your best friend,

538
00:39:33,363 --> 00:39:33,963
your family,

539
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:35,803
your partner,

540
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:38,082
and your teammate.

541
00:39:40,162 --> 00:39:41,042
I'll love you forever,

542
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:43,483
be by your side

543
00:39:44,763 --> 00:39:46,003
and allow you to be yourself.

544
00:39:52,242 --> 00:39:53,082
I may be

545
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:55,242
a confused robot,

546
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,202
but I always keep my word.

547
00:40:10,803 --> 00:40:12,082
It's my commitment to you.

548
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:20,963
You sound

549
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,283
as though you're proposing.

550
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:28,883
You don't have to say yes now.

551
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:32,082
I just want you to believe

552
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,843
that I can give you a home.

553
00:40:39,242 --> 00:40:41,122
It's not that I don't want a proposal.

554
00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:43,843
I just feel

555
00:40:44,602 --> 00:40:46,283
that you need
to take it one step at a time.

556
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:49,722
You haven't even asked me

557
00:40:50,162 --> 00:40:51,642
if I want to be your girlfriend.

558
00:40:56,602 --> 00:40:58,283
Aren't you already my girlfriend?

559
00:40:59,843 --> 00:41:01,202
When did I agree to that?

560
00:41:02,648 --> 00:41:04,104
When we were lying down here last time,

561
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:05,363
you said you loved me too.

562
00:41:06,803 --> 00:41:08,323
