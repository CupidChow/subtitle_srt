25
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:53,385
Mrs. Meixia,

26
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,105
what's wrong with you?

27
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:58,144
Why do you always wear a facial mask
when you video call me?

28
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:00,665
You say you miss me,

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,088
but you don't even want to
look at me.

30
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,080
I've been looking at your face
for more than twenty years.

31
00:02:04,088 --> 00:02:04,920
What's there to look at?

32
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,088
Hurry up and tell me

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,800
when you're coming back
to celebrate Chinese New Year.

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,448
Mr. He is waiting to treat you
to a meal.

35
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,665
Are you and Mr. He making any progress?

36
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:13,065
Don't be silly.

37
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:14,065
Can't friends

38
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:15,545
have a meal together?

39
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:18,864
I've never seen you
make fried cutlassfish

40
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:20,584
for any friend of yours.

41
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:23,505
I regret giving birth

42
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:24,945
to a sharp-tongued daughter like you.

43
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:27,265
Set a date.

44
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:29,512
I need to make a reservation
at the restaurant beforehand.

45
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:32,985
I'm not sure yet.

46
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:35,160
I don't know
how the company will arrange it.

47
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:36,420
If I still can't decide,

48
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:37,744
Mr. He and you

49
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,144
can come to Donghai.

50
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,945
Why are you setting an alarm
in the middle of the night, Mom?

51
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:49,424
Well.

52
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:53,825
It's midnight.

53
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:56,825
Happy birthday to my daughter.

54
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:58,505
Make a wish.

55
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:00,744
Why

56
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:03,825
do you have to do this?

57
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,464
Of course.

58
00:03:05,864 --> 00:03:06,985
Accept the red packet.

59
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:08,345
You've turned a year older.

60
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,985
May you be safe, happy,

61
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:12,584
and healthy.

62
00:03:14,265 --> 00:03:14,864
Thank you, Mom.

63
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:18,505
Can't you say something new?

64
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:19,584
I'm already 27.

65
00:03:19,624 --> 00:03:20,985
You always give the same wishes.

66
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:21,960
Yes, the same wishes.

67
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,660
That's it.

68
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:24,744
Don't think I'll prepare something new.

69
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:30,624
I wish you and Liang
a good life together.

70
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:38,464
What's wrong?

71
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,976
Did you two have an argument?

72
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:41,304
It's nothing like that.

73
00:03:41,904 --> 00:03:43,864
Who am I to argue with him?

74
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:45,864
We're not in a relationship to quarrel.

75
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:48,304
I've already moved out.

76
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:49,424
We're over.

77
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:51,945
Gu Yi,

78
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:54,464
do you know what the biggest no-no
in the relationship is?

79
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:56,904
That I can't make fried cutlassfish?

80
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,904
It's poor communication.

81
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:03,505
It's not that I don't communicate.

82
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,545
You haven't experienced his pain,

83
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:07,065
you won't know what he's been through.

84
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:08,985
Even if you can't be his painkiller,

85
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:10,624
you shouldn't add to his pain.

86
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:11,864
Did you hear me?

87
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:14,024
I did.

88
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,424
I know you won't accept it.

89
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:17,465
Rest up now.

90
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,785
You have to work tomorrow.

91
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:19,585
Fine.

92
00:04:19,744 --> 00:04:20,225
Good night.

93
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:21,064
Bye-bye, Mom.

94
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:32,985
What's wrong with the bed?

95
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:36,105
It's not as comfy as the sofa
in Van Gogh Manor.

96
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:44,424
Liang Daiwen, what spell
did you cast on me?

97
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,264
What are you doing, Liang Daiwen?

98
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:05,225
Are you sleeping?

99
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,960
(Mdm. Wang)

100
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:00,225
Liang,

101
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:02,465
why is it pitch black on your side?

102
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:03,785
I can't see your face.

103
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:15,864
I see you now.

104
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:17,345
What are you doing now?

105
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:19,424
I...

106
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:21,300
I'm watering the plants.

107
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,020
Why are you watering the plants
in the dark?

108
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:24,824
It's spooky.

109
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:26,624
Are you at home?

110
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,105
Yes, I'm at home,

111
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:32,225
but Gu Yi just moved out.

112
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:33,624
I know.

113
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:35,864
Liang,

114
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,184
Gu Yi's always been a stubborn mule

115
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:40,145
since she was a kid.

116
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:42,184
Don't get mad at her.

117
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:44,545
I'm calling you

118
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:45,928
about something trivial.

119
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:46,465
Well,

120
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,640
I noticed that you two

121
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:48,740
have been skipping meals.

122
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,184
Your complexion didn't look well.

123
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,584
So I plan to send you
some local specialties from my hometown,

124
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:54,465
like soy chips and pickles.

125
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:55,585
Put them in the fridge.

126
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:57,145
Heat them up, and it's ready to eat.

127
00:06:57,905 --> 00:06:59,905
I'm sending them to 1402.

128
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:01,300
Remember to receive the parcel.

129
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:13,160
Why are you

130
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:14,465
looking at me?

131
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:20,145
Mdm. Wang,

132
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:21,504
you've

133
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:22,824
lost some weight.

134
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,864
It's hard for people our age
to shed pounds.

135
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:28,264
But you young people

136
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:29,545
mustn't skip meals.

137
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:31,064
Enjoy the food.

138
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:32,504
Let me know if you finish it.

139
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:33,264
I'll send more.

140
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:35,785
Thank you, Mdm. Wang.

141
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:37,184
You're welcome.

142
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:38,744
Well. Get rest early.

143
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:45,425
Good morning.

144
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:46,065
Good morning.

145
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:48,305
Morning.

146
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:49,624
Morning.

147
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,585
Hey, comrade.

148
00:08:56,784 --> 00:08:57,904
Happy birthday!

149
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:05,544
How did you know I like this?

150
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:07,904
Of course, I know everything about you.

151
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:09,705
You're so thoughtful.

152
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:13,024
What is this?

153
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:14,624
Open it.

154
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:16,264
(Live Your Own Life)
I wrote this myself.

155
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,880
(Young Heart Never Grows Old)
I hope you'll like it.

156
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:19,864
Thank you.

157
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,138
(Air fryer)

158
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:23,624
Yi,

159
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:24,624
happy birthday.

160
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,144
I got you the latest edition air fryer.

161
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:28,945
It's a lifesaver
for those who can't cook.

162
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:30,985
It makes incredible sausages
from frozen.

163
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:33,945
How did you know I can't cook?

164
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:36,345
I really can't.

165
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:37,744
How does this thing work?

166
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,544
The frozen sausage.

167
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:41,384
Let me show you.

168
00:09:41,384 --> 00:09:43,384
(Liang Daiwen: Want to meet up?
Your mom sent you something.)

169
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:44,425
Here you go.

170
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:45,784
Don't be cheeky.

171
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:48,504
She always wakes up early
and goes to bed late.

172
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:51,384
Shouldn't you give her
something healthier?

173
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,464
(Come over tonight.
Let's celebrate your birthday at 1402.)

174
00:09:53,464 --> 00:09:55,140
Given Yi's condition,
it's crucial that she eats every meal.

175
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:55,740
(There are so)

176
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,784
(many options like restaurants,
parks, and cinemas.)

177
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:00,465
(But you chose to meet at home?)

178
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:04,105
(Is your home a place
for buddies gathering?)

179
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:06,585
I hope Gu Yi is as healthy as you are.

180
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:08,904
If that's what you think,

181
00:10:09,544 --> 00:10:10,504
(Gu Yi: Okay.)
do more work.

182
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:16,744
What are you talking about?

183
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,912
We're talking about the air fryer.

184
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:18,904
Air fryer?

185
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,465
It's like you haven't had enough to eat.

186
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,059
I quit.

187
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,664
Take it with you.

188
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,460
Keep it for yourself.

189
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:27,264
I'll accept it.

190
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:28,425
Thank you.

191
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,240
Don't mention it.

192
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:31,824
(Yuji Restaurant)

193
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:32,384
Okay.

194
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:36,500
Here you go, birthday girl.

195
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:38,065
Thank you.

196
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:41,904
Oh, right.

197
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:43,904
I almost forgot it.

198
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:45,825
Here's a gift from the Demoness.

199
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:47,985
Jacqueline?

200
00:10:48,305 --> 00:10:49,585
Who else could it be?

201
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:51,305
She bought us this meal.

202
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:07,624
Come on, let's eat.

203
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:09,544
We'll get back to work after eating.

204
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:13,144
Happy birthday, Gu Yi.

205
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:14,065
Thank you.

206
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:22,784
Come in.

207
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:27,425
Anything?

208
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:29,185
Nothing.

209
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,664
This is the cake for my 27th birthday.

210
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:32,985
I bring it to you.

211
00:11:33,032 --> 00:11:33,660
Leave it there.

212
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:53,744
Get back to your work.

213
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,225
Thank you.

214
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,680
The front-row seats are
all the actors we hired.

215
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:09,624
Thank you.

216
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:10,664
Happy birthday.

217
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:12,664
A microphone?

218
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:14,185
This is

219
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:15,264
custom-made.

220
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:16,339
(Gu Yi)

221
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:16,888
Do you like it?

222
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:17,860
Isn't it a fancy mic?

223
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:19,144
Beyond your imagination.

224
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:20,544
Not bad.

225
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:22,664
It's better than the snack gift pack
from last year.

226
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:25,585
My name is on it.

227
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:27,264
Isn't it too flashy?

228
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:28,585
That's what you need

229
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,784
to get rid of your bad luck.

230
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:32,345
Thanks a bunch.

231
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:36,864
Did Liang Daiwen
get the ticket for today?

232
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:39,024
No.

233
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:42,864
But your friend is in the audience.

234
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:46,065
The mic has been tested.

235
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:46,664
You can start

236
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:48,065
your performance straight away.

237
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,425
Remember to switch it on.

238
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:52,105
Go on.

239
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:55,048
The director only cast me as a corpse.

240
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:56,504
From then on,

241
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:58,180
I've become a professional corpse.

242
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,496
All right. That's all from me.

243
00:12:59,512 --> 00:12:59,912
Thank you.

244
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:01,185
Excellent!

245
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,345
So many people.

246
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,345
A familiar face, too.

247
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:07,784
We're all familiar faces.

248
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:08,744
Yeah, right.

249
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:09,744
My good friends.

250
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:11,744
Well,

251
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:13,624
let's not do comedy tonight.

252
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:15,384
Let's talk about celebrity gossip.

253
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:17,264
That's great!

254
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:19,700
What's with all the excitement?
You're so easy to fool.

255
00:13:19,904 --> 00:13:21,465
As expected of Ounce's audience.

256
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:23,619
I'm a stand-up comedian.

257
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,640
How could I know
any insider news of the show business?

258
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:28,144
Well.

259
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:30,105
Let's talk about some stand-up gossip.

260
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:31,784
Great!

261
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:33,425
You all responded in unison.

262
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:35,585
Well, stand-up gossips.

263
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:37,465
A while ago,

264
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:39,624
one of our audience here

265
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:40,585
almost got hit

266
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:42,825
by her husband.

267
00:13:45,904 --> 00:13:47,065
I didn't egg on him.

268
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:49,065
Why are you giving me that response?

269
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:51,580
It had nothing to do
with the stand-up show either.

270
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:53,825
That guy was simply drunk.

271
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,024
Forget about the stand-up show.

272
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:58,465
Even if his wife went to the bathroom,

273
00:13:58,744 --> 00:13:59,864
he'd question her,

274
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:02,144
"Why didn't you take me along?

275
00:14:02,305 --> 00:14:03,305
Are you leaving me out?"

276
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:06,465
That's why

277
00:14:06,465 --> 00:14:08,144
we should stay away

278
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:09,144
from a drunk man.

279
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:11,784
I realize

280
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:14,305
that men don't usually cry,

281
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:17,705
so their tears are
as precious as diamonds.

282
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:20,225
When they're drunk,

283
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:22,864
they either cry,

284
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:25,225
or make someone else cry,

285
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:27,744
or cry over

286
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,584
an expensive bill and go, "Wuuu".

287
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,384
So we call this type of man

288
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,784
"Mr. Diamond Wuuu".
[*Rich single man]

289
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:42,465
That's lame.

290
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:45,705
If they're not crying
when they're drunk,

291
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,144
they're usually apologizing.

292
00:14:48,985 --> 00:14:50,465
"Dear, it's my fault.

293
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:51,504
Please forgive me."

294
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,624
My eyes are looking at a lower position.

295
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:54,105
The wife

296
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:55,624
should be here.

297
00:14:56,744 --> 00:14:58,185
Right.

298
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:03,305
I've gotten used to
looking up at others.

299
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,264
"Dear, it's my fault."

300
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:06,345
And

301
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:07,860
when it's time to pay the bill,

302
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:09,624
"Sir, it's my fault.

303
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:11,144
I didn't bring enough money.

304
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,585
Could you give me a discount?"

305
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:33,384
Gu Yi.

306
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,060
Where are you rushing off to?

307
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,080
I want to celebrate your birthday
with you.

308
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:40,544
I'm meeting someone tonight.

309
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:41,624
Let's do it next time.

310
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:43,864
Is it Liang Daiwen?

311
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:50,264
Gu Yi,

312
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,105
do you enjoy being hurt?

313
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:59,105
Then why do you like him so much?

314
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:03,460
Isn't it better to like a person
who gives you a response?

315
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:09,744
It's not

316
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:11,744
that he doesn't give a response.

317
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:14,945
He's just

318
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:18,585
not good at expressing himself

319
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:20,384
and needs some way

320
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:21,904
to understand him.

321
00:16:23,425 --> 00:16:24,585
He's not good at expressing,

322
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,100
and you're good at understanding.

323
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,176
You both are like two matching
puzzle pieces, is it?

324
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:35,425
If you're so matching,

325
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,504
why do you always give this look

326
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:40,024
every time you mention him?

327
00:16:41,624 --> 00:16:42,425
You look dejected,

328
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:44,024
upset,

329
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:45,664
and unsatisfied.

330
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:49,664
You're not happy at all,

331
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:51,065
are you?

332
00:16:58,744 --> 00:16:59,504
Gu Yi,

333
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:02,985
the sky within your reach

334
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:06,296
is more reliable than the one
you need to raise your head.

335
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:10,808
If you're too obsessed
with something out of your reach,

336
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,665
isn't it pitiful for people beside you

337
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:17,225
whom you should've cherished?

338
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,705
He's waiting for me.

339
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:18,504
Sir,

340
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:19,905
are you

341
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:20,905
cold?

342
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:22,145
Pardon?

343
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,225
It's nothing.

344
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,572
(Searching for subway stations)

345
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:56,465
What

346
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:57,465
happened?

347
00:21:00,665 --> 00:21:01,264
Nothing.

348
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:03,584
Let's go in first.

349
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:25,465
Light the candle.

350
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:28,905
You should sing the birthday song.

351
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,584
Is there a lighter here?

352
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:33,064
Maybe.

353
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:34,740
I'll go look for it.

354
00:21:56,344 --> 00:21:57,024
It's lit.

355
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,264
Obviously.

356
00:22:00,504 --> 00:22:02,264
The fire is big enough to roast salmon.

357
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:05,225
I don't think we have salmon here.

358
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:06,824
I'll go look for it.

359
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:10,304
Don't go. Stay.

360
00:22:11,185 --> 00:22:11,945
Let's eat up.

361
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,145
Otherwise, the cake is melting.

362
00:22:22,185 --> 00:22:22,905
Sing.

363
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:46,824
Liang Daiwen,

364
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:48,865
did you

365
00:22:49,064 --> 00:22:50,104
get knocked over by a car?

366
00:22:52,064 --> 00:22:52,625
No.

367
00:22:54,104 --> 00:22:56,104
Did you steal this cake
from someone else?

368
00:22:58,465 --> 00:22:59,064
A comedic setup?

369
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:06,584
I took a bottle of alcohol from Mr. Yu.

370
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:08,392
Let's have a drink.

371
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:11,465
I don't drink alcohol.

372
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,344
Today is my birthday.

373
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,860
Let's drink a little.

374
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:28,425
That's cool.

375
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:29,985
I'll go get glasses.

376
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:44,705
Oh, my.

377
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:48,264
This is alcohol, not mineral water.

378
00:23:48,824 --> 00:23:50,264
You can't gulp it all down.

379
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:55,865
I'm mad

380
00:23:57,264 --> 00:23:58,225
today.

381
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:04,584
I took a cab after buying the cake,

382
00:24:05,225 --> 00:24:06,584
but the traffic was terrible,

383
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,472
and the temperature in the cab was high.

384
00:24:08,504 --> 00:24:09,540
I was worried the cake might melt,

385
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,616
so I stuck it out the window

386
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:11,940
to cool it down.

387
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:13,824
But then, a scooter passed by,

388
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,784
and the cake was gone.

389
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:17,024
I chased it for two streets,

390
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,040
and the delivery guy thought

391
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:19,425
I was trying to rob his food.

392
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:21,992
He showed me his delivery bag,

393
00:24:22,104 --> 00:24:23,385
and there was nothing inside.

394
00:24:23,905 --> 00:24:25,304
When I came back,

395
00:24:25,304 --> 00:24:26,865
I found the cake
was right by the car door.

396
00:24:27,225 --> 00:24:28,504
It was all smashed.

397
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,465
Later, I took the subway

398
00:24:31,824 --> 00:24:32,779
and tried a few more shops,

399
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,509
but it was too late,

400
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,080
they were all closed
and were not taking orders.

401
00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:35,465
I...

402
00:24:35,905 --> 00:24:36,304
I...

403
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:41,024
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:42,185 --> 00:24:43,465
I could only bring you

405
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:46,465
this smashed cake.

406
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:55,945
Liang Daiwen,

407
00:24:58,385 --> 00:24:59,985
I've never seen you

408
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:01,985
talk so much.

409
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:09,905
I truly hate it

410
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:11,465
when things get out of hand.

411
00:25:18,024 --> 00:25:19,104
Stop drinking.

412
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,064
Even since I met you,

413
00:25:42,784 --> 00:25:44,784
everything has been out of my control.

414
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:55,225
I haven't been able to
get tickets for Ounce lately.

415
00:26:00,945 --> 00:26:03,465
It's because you were too lucky before,

416
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:05,784
and you used it all up

417
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:07,584
to meet me.

418
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:11,264
That's why you're unlucky now.

419

Liang Daiwen,

This is Gu Yi speaking.

Gu Yi.

447
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:32,225
I've been thinking

448
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:34,264
about something
Guan and Shen talked about.

449
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:38,744
When Guan was blind,

450
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:42,064
she had no concept of colors.

451
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:44,064
She firmly believed

452
00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:46,104
that everything in this world was black,

453
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:48,985
including the sky and sea.

454
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:52,824
She had lived in the darkness
for too long.

455
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,220
She couldn't accept that they were
blue when her sight was restored.

456
00:28:58,376 --> 00:28:59,800
It was because
she had gotten used

457
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:00,900

when it comes to you.

461
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:13,584
I used to feel nothing.

462
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,145

in the monochrome world.

467
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:37,425
Perhaps when I was
drawing those images of you,

468
00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:40,344
my memory became distorted
and changed into something

Mdm. Wang said
there are local specialties

499
00:32:09,264 --> 00:32:10,945
like soy chips, pickles, and sausages.

500
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,185
You can keep them in the fridge.

501
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:17,860

didn't look well,

00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:24,660
and she was worried about me.

505
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,296
She told me to let her know
once the food ran out.

506
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:27,905
She also said

507
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:28,945
you're a stubborn mule,

508
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:30,425

00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:33,864
it was spooky
to water the plants at night...

Mdm. Wang said

514
00:32:41,912 --> 00:32:43,580

515
00:32:44,304 --> 00:32:45,425
Not this.

The fashion show special

569
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:50,224
has received higher demand online

570
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:51,504
than usual,

571
00:37:52,224 --> 00:37:53,945
so the highlight of our publicity

572
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:55,104
has to be flexible.

573
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,704
I don't wish to see any
negative tags about us

574
00:37:57,704 --> 00:37:59,345
on the trending search this time.

575
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:00,785
Understood.

576
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:02,224
I'll keep an eye on that.

577
00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:03,785
Gu Yi,

578
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,144
please work on the script.

579
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:15,064
Gu Yi,

580
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:19,504
did you hear
what the Deputy Director said?

581
00:38:23,144 --> 00:38:23,865
I'm sorry.

582
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,544
It's my fault.

583
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:27,624
Something went wrong with the foreign

584
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,776
band interview I'm working on.

585
00:38:28,945 --> 00:38:30,624
I've been asking her to look for
the band's videos

586
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:32,104
whenever she has time.

587
00:38:32,825 --> 00:38:33,825
You'll review it later.

588
00:38:34,168 --> 00:38:36,328
She's juggling many tasks right now,
so please understand.

589
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:37,345
But I promise

590
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:39,745
it won't affect the publication
during fashion week.

591
00:38:42,008 --> 00:38:43,660
All right. Let's move on
to the next topic.

592
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:44,184
Mi,

593
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:45,865
how's your topic
on the weight loss product going?

594
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:49,504
Currently, the market
is very competitive.

595
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:51,184
There are many brands

596
00:38:51,184 --> 00:38:52,745
in the market now.

597
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
(Guan Xingxin)

598
00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:04,064
Hello?

599
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:04,865
Gu Yi,

600
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:06,064
what are you doing?

601
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,104
Why? Nothing.

602
00:39:08,624 --> 00:39:09,504
Come to Ounce tonight.

603
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:11,385
I've asked Yu Dule to slot you in.

604
00:39:12,544 --> 00:39:13,265
Forget it.

605
00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:14,504
I'm not in the mood.

606
00:39:15,024 --> 00:39:16,024
Liang went to Shen's place

607
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:17,905
in the middle of the night last night.

608
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:19,465
If this keeps up,

609
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:21,584
the therapist will collapse first.

610
00:39:22,385 --> 00:39:24,064
I know you two
haven't talked it out yet.

611
00:39:24,985 --> 00:39:25,865
Liang is clueless.

612
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:27,785
You can tell him through jokes,

613
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:29,064
and he'll understand.

614
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:31,305
Please come, Gu Yi.

615
00:39:31,905 --> 00:39:33,184
Consider it an encore performance.

616
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:35,664
Give yourself a chance
to find the answer.

617
00:39:38,265 --> 00:39:39,385
I'll think about it.

618
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:40,664
I'm still at work.

619
00:39:54,664 --> 00:39:55,905
Hi, everyone. I'm Gu Yi!

620
00:39:55,985 --> 00:39:57,544
Hi!

621
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:01,224
A quick question before I start.

622
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:03,104
Has anyone here gone on a blind date?

623
00:40:03,385 --> 00:40:04,745
Yes!

624
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:05,825
So many of you.

625
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:06,825
All right.

626
00:40:06,825 --> 00:40:08,465
Put your hands down.
It's kind of embarrassing.

627
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:12,745
If love is good enough,

628
00:40:13,265 --> 00:40:14,825
everyone will naturally get married.

629
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:17,425
They say marriage is a rebirth.

630
00:40:18,104 --> 00:40:19,184
Some

631
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,100
are born prematurely,

632
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:21,905
while some

633
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:24,104
have been reborn multiple times

634
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:25,385
like crazy.

635
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:27,905
I say,

636
00:40:28,504 --> 00:40:29,785
if you love taking risks so much,

637
00:40:29,985 --> 00:40:31,584
you should go into finance.

638
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:34,265
Don't you agree?

639
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:37,104
Marriage is like speculation.

640
00:40:37,464 --> 00:40:38,264
It's like that.

641
00:40:38,425 --> 00:40:39,945
You go in happily,

642
00:40:40,664 --> 00:40:42,305
but you come out gloomy.

643
00:40:45,825 --> 00:40:47,345
If you have a happy marriage,

644
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:48,104
congratulations,

645
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:50,104
you've beaten 90 percent of the users.

646
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:52,385
If you're in an unhappy marriage

647
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:53,985
with kids,

648
00:40:54,305 --> 00:40:55,144
good for you,

649
00:40:55,945 --> 00:40:57,504
you're trapped.

650
00:41:00,664 --> 00:41:02,704
Parents urging us to get married

651
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:04,664
is just like financial advisors

652
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:05,785
recommending stocks.

653
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:07,385
If you lose,

654
00:41:07,905 --> 00:41:09,345
they won't admit they're wrong.

655
00:41:10,064 --> 00:41:11,184
They'll say,

656
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:13,345
"Marriage

657
00:41:13,945 --> 00:41:15,664
is a long-term thing,

658
00:41:16,345 --> 00:41:18,064
it may get better in the future,
who knows?"

659
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:19,144
And I'd say,

660
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:20,624
"Mom,

661
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,104
you and Dad..."

662
00:41:22,745 --> 00:41:23,544
"Don't even mention him.

663
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:25,104
Just talking about him irritates me."

664
00:41:27,305 --> 00:41:29,224
As I'm saying this,
I start to feel upset.

665
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:31,745
Everyone else's relationships

666
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:33,144
are full of blossoms,

667
00:41:33,664 --> 00:41:34,865
while mine

668
00:41:35,584 --> 00:41:36,624
is paved with cacti.

669
00:41:38,305 --> 00:41:40,785
I really wish the person I like
could hear this

670
00:41:41,385 --> 00:41:42,945
and kick those cacti

671
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:44,104
away.

672
00:41:56,945 --> 00:41:58,104
Speak of the devil.

673
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,345
He's here.

674
00:42:04,785 --> 00:42:11,544
Get up there!

675
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:33,265
(Please.)

676
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,385
(Liang Daiwen,)

677
00:42:36,584 --> 00:42:37,425
(please come.)

678
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:22,224
Come on.

679
00:43:22,305 --> 00:43:22,985
What do you mean?

680
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:24,224
Help her.

681
00:43:24,305 --> 00:43:25,704
Someone came.

682
00:43:25,745 --> 00:43:26,465
You're so clueless.

683
00:43:26,785 --> 00:43:27,624
Hurry up.

684
00:43:34,624 --> 00:43:37,385
Someone's helping her.
What are you doing?

685
00:43:38,236 --> 00:43:39,144
What about Liang?

686
00:43:39,504 --> 00:43:40,619
I don't care.

687
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,976
He should've come up if he wanted to.

688
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:21,745
Stop drinking.

689
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,064
She's biting me.

690
00:44:30,785 --> 00:44:31,584
Just let her be.

691
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:32,985
Come on,

692
00:44:33,425 --> 00:44:34,385
this is whiskey.

693
00:44:35,024 --> 00:44:36,865
She's a bad drinker.

694
00:44:37,104 --> 00:44:38,905
She'll start acting silly
after a couple of sips.

695
00:44:38,905 --> 00:44:39,425
That's enough.

696
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:40,104
Stop drinking.

697
00:44:43,945 --> 00:44:44,425
Ms. Gu.

698
00:44:45,504 --> 00:44:46,024
Ms. Gu.

699
00:44:48,064 --> 00:44:48,905
Stop drinking, please.

700
00:44:49,905 --> 00:44:50,624
Stop it.

701
00:44:50,664 --> 00:44:52,104
Go home and sleep, okay?

702
00:44:55,305 --> 00:44:56,104
Enough.

703
00:44:57,385 --> 00:44:58,345
What's wrong with you?

704
00:44:59,385 --> 00:45:00,385
You're tall.

705
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:01,504
Why didn't you

706
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,176
just carry her off
from the stage just now?

707
00:45:04,144 --> 00:45:06,144
She was so upset.

708
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:10,544
Darn. Liang Daiwen.

709
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:11,664
He's insane.

710
00:45:11,745 --> 00:45:12,905
Don't you mention Liang Daiwen!

711
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,144
Don't mention him.

712
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:19,544
Just hearing his name makes me angry.
I mean it.

713
00:45:20,704 --> 00:45:23,584
But don't criticize him either.

714
00:45:24,704 --> 00:45:26,825
You stand-up comedians

715
00:45:26,905 --> 00:45:29,825
need to have a bottom line
in your creation.

716
00:45:29,945 --> 00:45:31,624
See?

717
00:45:31,745 --> 00:45:34,584
Liang Daiwen is a nice person.

718
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:36,544
He's kind.

719
00:45:37,064 --> 00:45:38,024
And

720
00:45:38,504 --> 00:45:40,584
he never explains himself.

721
00:45:41,064 --> 00:45:43,544
He keeps everything to himself.

722
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,865
Don't make fun of him.

723
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:50,144
I can't make fun of him as well.

724
00:45:51,224 --> 00:45:53,024
No one can.

725
00:46:09,584 --> 00:46:10,584
Liang Daiwen,

726
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:12,945
why do you act like

727
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:14,985
you feel nothing at all?

728
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,144
Don't you feel bad

729
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:18,265
seeing Gu Yi suffer?

730
00:46:19,704 --> 00:46:21,465
If you don't like her, that's fine.

731
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:24,064
But at least

732
00:46:24,544 --> 00:46:25,664
show her some respect.

733
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:28,265
Who says I don't like her?

734
00:46:41,704 --> 00:46:42,825
Liang Daiwen,

735
00:46:44,265 --> 00:46:45,985
