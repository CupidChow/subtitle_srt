25
00:02:53,014 --> 00:02:53,833
They're burnt.

26
00:02:57,214 --> 00:02:58,393
You like

27
00:02:58,573 --> 00:03:00,433
tough textures, don't you?

28
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:02,034
Get out.

29
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:08,273
Gu Yi?

30
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:10,273
Where are you now?

31
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:11,914
Mr. Lu,

32
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:12,794
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,493
My mom suddenly came to Donghai.

34
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,034
I can't join you for camping.

35
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:17,993
Could you tell them for me?

36
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:20,453
I'm afraid
Mr. Yu would give me an earful

37
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:21,914
when I call him.

38
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:23,553
He's busy right now.

39
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:25,514
It's fine. You don't have to come.

40
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:27,713
The fewer people, the better.

41
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:55,243
(Daughter: Mrs. Meixia,
have you arrived? Need some company?)

42
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:57,514
There's no space for you here.

43
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:58,754
Leave me alone.

44
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:05,673
All right.

45
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:07,372
I have a stomach upset.

46
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:08,634
I want to get rest early tonight.

47
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:38,633
Gu Yi went to pick her mom up.

48
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:39,493
Why did Liang Daiwen

49
00:04:39,494 --> 00:04:40,513
tag along?

50
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,794
To give them a ride.

51
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:46,433
Are they already close enough

52
00:04:46,614 --> 00:04:47,873
to meet parents?

53
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:49,960
Given Liang Daiwen's CPU,

54
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,873
he probably didn't realize
he was meeting Gu Yi's parent.

55
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:53,212
However,

56
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:54,633
I'm not sure about Gu Yi.

57
00:04:58,854 --> 00:04:59,993
So cold.

58
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,474
It's so cold.

59
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,154
Why do you keep scooting over to her?

60
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:06,633
To stay warm.

61
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:11,132
It's on fire.

62
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:13,012
I didn't know
you were so afraid of the cold.

63
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,493
The wind over here is stronger.
Come warm me up.

64
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:16,933
The sparks are
flying all over there, so no.

65
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:17,960
It's not like I'm insane.

66
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:24,433
Fine, then.

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,892
What's wrong with you?

68
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:28,733
I'll leave you two alone.

69
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:29,433
I'm going to sleep.

70
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:31,154
Mr. Lu,

71
00:05:31,654 --> 00:05:32,733
don't be upset.

72
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:33,753
Let's have a drink.

73
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:35,794
No touchy.

74
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,313
I'm all right.

75
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:40,433
Where are you getting that from?

76
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:47,834
I used to be blind.

77
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:49,452
I relied on voices

78
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:50,993
to differentiate emotions,

79
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,553
so you can't lie to me.

80
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:55,753
You

81
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:58,234
were blind?

82
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:00,714
I was born that way.

83
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:04,714
When I was a kid, my parents took me
everywhere to seek treatment for my eyes.

84
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:06,812
Everyone said

85
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:08,034
it was a shame I couldn't see,

86
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:09,914
but I didn't think that way.

87
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:13,613
Later, I had a cornea transplant.

88
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:14,753
The operation went smoothly.

89
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,073
It took around a week
to remove the gauge.

90
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:19,594
Each layer was removed a day

91
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:20,993
to allow me to adapt to light.

92
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:23,474
When the gauge got thinner,

93
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:25,714
I began to get nervous.

94
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:28,873
Until the day the last layer
was removed,

95
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:30,993
I wasn't happy at all.

96
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:32,673
I realized

97
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,313
that the real world was completely different
from the one I imagined.

98
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:37,433
Afterward,

99
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,234
my relatives came

100
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,154
to congratulate me,

101
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,313
but instead, I felt observed.

102
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:44,933
They were observing

103
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:47,073
how a blind person resumes her sight.

104
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:50,914
I was like a specimen behind the glass.

105
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:55,252
Before my sight was restored,

106
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:56,673
I didn't know

107
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:59,433
I would have to face
so many examining eyes.

108
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:02,653
But you see,

109
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:03,553
now,

110
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:06,073
I'm an influencer, offstage actor,
virtual avatar performer,

111
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:08,193
and in that video as well.

112
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:12,794
I'm still living under scrutiny.

113
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,113
Yu Dule knows that.

114
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:16,812
Mr. Lu, you like Layla.

115
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:18,513
I suppose you know which video
I'm talking about.

116
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:26,553
Well,

117
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:28,433
if one

118
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:30,474
doesn't underestimate themselves,

119
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,954
others won't look down on them.

120
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:34,753
The people around you

121
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:36,394
love you,

122
00:07:36,614 --> 00:07:37,313
so

123
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:38,274
don't be afraid.

124
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:40,433
That's right.

125
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,794
No one's life is perfect

126
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,154
and hasn't been nitpicked.

127
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:46,433
Like me,

128
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:47,673
I'm in deep debt.

129
00:07:47,974 --> 00:07:49,034
Everyone beside me left.

130
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:51,794
Still, I'm facing
my life optimistically.

131
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:53,714
All right.

132
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:55,274
Let's not get into a heavy topic.

133
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:57,673
I run a small bar.

134
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:58,873
You're very welcome to come.

135
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:04,073
It's said

136
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:06,354
we could see stars from here, right?

137
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:07,474
I can see nothing here.

138
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:08,332
This camping site

139
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,274
is false advertising.

140
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:13,154
Look at that.

141
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:14,513
Oh, it's a plane.

142
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:45,954
Liang Daiwen.

143
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:54,273
Do you feel better now?

144
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,753
You haven't checked off the list yet?

145
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:10,273
Checked off the list?

146
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,834
You're giving me therapy.

147
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:13,793
Did you forget?

148
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:17,834
Of course not.

149
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:27,554
What else is left?

150
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:29,834
Sharing.

151
00:09:30,414 --> 00:09:31,273
Right.

152
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:32,793
Sharing

153
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:35,194
is to share your stories.

154
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:36,373
It's similar

155
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:39,314
to the weekly consultation
with Dr. Shen.

156
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,013
Now, your consultant

157
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,714
is someone around you.

158
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:45,554
Just tell me anything.

159
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:47,092
You can talk about the past,

160
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:48,554
the present,

161
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:50,972
or accessibility design.

162
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:51,793
Anything.

163
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:08,354
When I was a kid,
I went to the airport with my grandpa

164
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:11,434
to pick my dad up from a business trip.

165
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:15,793
My dad had a Nokia phone.

166
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:18,354
The ringtone was shrill.

167
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:27,513
After he got a phone call,
he started speeding.

168
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:30,554
I was terrified,

169
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:35,354
and I wasn't feeling well that day.

170
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:51,076
(Yu Dule: I have this strong feeling)

171
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:54,662
(that Guan Xingxin can
make me a better man.)

172
00:10:54,663 --> 00:11:02,782
(Gu Yi: Were you an ape before this?)

173
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,718
(Yu Dule: I'm not joking.
She's my star.)

174
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:07,243
(It's like what Liang Daiwen is to you.)

175
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:13,793
Was it your mom?

176
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:15,354
No,

177
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,273
it's Mr. Yu.

178
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,434
He said

179
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:23,812
he saw a star

180
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:24,873
at the camping site.

181
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,714
Do you want to watch stars?

182
00:11:33,615 --> 00:11:40,058
♪Twilight overtakes the sky
at the horizon♪

183
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:46,863
♪The stars arrive slightly late♪

184
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:50,153
Maybe

185
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:52,153
it's fine.

186
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:55,113
It's cloudy.

187
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:57,513
There aren't any stars to be seen.

188
00:11:59,534 --> 00:12:00,354
Get some sleep first.

189
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:01,659

Good morning.

218
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:56,554
The sun is up.

219
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:57,513
The sunrise

220
00:14:57,573 --> 00:14:58,314
is beautiful.

221
00:14:58,374 --> 00:15:00,480
It's my first time watching
a beautiful sunrise like this.

222
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:02,674
There weren't any stars last time.

223
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:04,400
Now, we're watching
the sunrise together.

224
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:13,513
Did you

225
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:15,434
park here the whole night

226
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:18,273
just to show me the sunrise?

227
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,113
Rule No. 3,

228
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:23,793

00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:24,993
Ms. Gu's order.

That's all?

231
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,513
Just as simple as that?

232
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:38,972
Do you really not resist me

233
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:40,434
when I ask you to?

234
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:43,393
You want me to resist?

235
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,753
(Ah, that sounds dangerous.)

236
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:47,594

(Nextmonday)

250
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:46,813
(Zhi: Yi, I screwed up.)

251
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:51,513
Morning.

252
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:54,234
Yi!

253
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:55,572
What happened?

254
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:56,253
Yi,

255
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:58,273
I sent the unauthorized posters
to the printing house.

256
00:16:58,693 --> 00:16:59,253
Did they start?

257
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:00,074
Yes.

258
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,133
I'm sorry, Yi. My dad gave me
an allowance to experience life,

259
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:03,572
I've transferred it all to you.

260
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:05,073
Don't tell me about that now.

261
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:07,093
You said you asked someone to help.
Who was that?

262
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:07,972
Mi.

263
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:09,753
We split the work before compiling them.

264
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,732
Through the office automation system
or through email?

265
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:12,772
I'm not sure what she sent.

266
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:14,212
Anyway, right after
she submitted the work,

267
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:15,154
something happened.

268
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:19,954
Gu Yi.

269
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:41,353
Out of eight posters,
three were unauthorized.

270
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:44,474
All the illustrators exposed this on Weibo
and have sent me private messages.

271
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:46,933
The first batch of magazines
has already been recalled.

272
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,394
Is this your first time
training rookies?

273
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:51,300
Don't you know it's necessary to recheck
the contents before sending them for printing?

274
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,252
Is the supplement too big a task for you,

275
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:56,194
or are you not a competent leader?

276
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:58,653
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhang.

277
00:17:58,654 --> 00:18:00,012
I just found out about that.

278
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:00,613
It was because...

279
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:01,674
Enough of your explanations.

280
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:04,313
Did I ask whom you assign the work to?

281
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:06,914
I only want to know
how you resolve this problem.

282
00:18:09,374 --> 00:18:10,674
I overlooked their work.

283
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:13,093
I'll contact every illustrator
to apologize

284
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,133
and resend the new content

285
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,993
to the printing house
before the end of the day.

286
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:18,313
Considering Nextmonday's circulation,

287
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:21,553
someone has to take responsibility
for this rookie mistake.

288
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:23,954
You'll wait for a notice from HR.

289
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:40,474
Yi,

290
00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:41,292
what did she say?

291
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:42,313
Leave me alone.

292
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:26,914
1042.

293
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:29,833
006, 002.

294
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:34,292
Isn't this Gu Yi's place?

295
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:35,434
Who are you?

296
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:39,993
A janitor?

297
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:47,993
You can't just throw everything away.

298
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:49,532
It's still usable.

299
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:50,833
Just wipe the mark off.

300
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:54,313
I'm taking the trash out.

301
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:55,634
Okay.

302
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:57,532
What is this?

303
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:58,714
All this scrabbling.

304
00:20:00,654 --> 00:20:01,993
He's so quiet.

305
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:03,993
I thought he was a thief.

306
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:24,993
See that?

307
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:27,280
This is what spick-and-span
should look like.

308
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:32,593
When did Gu Yi have so many cats?

309
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:00,972
I'm truly sorry.

310
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:01,674
Yes,

311
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,234
it's our problem.

312
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:06,573
We didn't expect such a rookie mistake.

313
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:07,012
Bye-bye.

314
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:08,033
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

315
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,474
See you tomorrow.

316
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:11,933
It won't happen again.

317
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:13,114
Please trust us.

318
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:15,753
Yes.

319
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:17,833
We're very sorry.

320
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:22,874
We've caused big trouble to you.

321
00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:25,573
It won't happen again.

322
00:21:25,574 --> 00:21:26,513
Please rest assured.

323
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:28,492
We'll compensate

324
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:30,394
for any losses.

325
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:32,914
Yes, I'm working on it.

326
00:21:33,174 --> 00:21:33,833
Right.

327
00:21:34,134 --> 00:21:35,692
We'll publish the apology statement

328
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:36,914
later.

329
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:40,513
The contract from last time, right?

330
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:43,874
Hi.

331
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:45,093
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:46,394
We're sending it now.

333
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:10,154
Dad, this is a special situation.

334
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:12,333
My boss got deducted ten thousand
because of me.

335
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:13,793
I can't leave her to dry,

336
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:14,553
right?

337
00:22:15,374 --> 00:22:15,914
Hello?

338
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:23,114
Zhi.

339
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:25,234
Where is she?

340
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:26,853
She just left.

341
00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:28,273
Her mom called for her.

342
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:35,313
Here.

343
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:37,914
Eat this and get off work later.

344
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:39,634
It's useless staying here.

345
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:41,114
Rui,

346
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,234
I know I'm to blame.

347
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:46,833
I shouldn't have asked Mi for help.

348
00:22:47,094 --> 00:22:49,634
I didn't know she sent it to me
without checking.

349
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:51,452
I wanted to confront her,

350
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,634
but Boss didn't let me.

351
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,434
She paid the penalty
with her 13th salary.

352
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,154
Just do what she says.

353
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:03,194
Learn from this lesson.

354
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:07,793
Do you have her address?

355
00:23:08,094 --> 00:23:08,833
I do.

356
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,234
I sent her a parcel before.

357
00:23:10,894 --> 00:23:11,954
Good. Send it to me.

358
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,073
You're back.

359
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:20,753
Yes,

360
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:22,073
I'm home, Mom.

361
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:24,154
Come and eat.

362
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:25,553
Where is your bag?

363
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:28,394
I need to head back to the office later.

364
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,394
You're back to work again?

365
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:33,634
Come, eat first.

366
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,954
You've made so many delicious dishes.

367
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:36,914
Do you like them?

368
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:38,674
They look great.

369
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:42,273
Why did you suddenly return to Donghai?

370
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,434
Did you have an argument
with Mr. He?

371
00:23:44,614 --> 00:23:45,954
I doubt he has the guts.

372
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:48,893
I just feel

373
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,394
that I'm in my fifties now,

374
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:51,793
but I didn't give you much.

375
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:53,313
I feel bad about that.

376
00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:57,553
Did my dad call you?

377
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:01,513
Mrs. Meixia,

378
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,154
the treasure you left me

379
00:24:06,854 --> 00:24:08,532
is the spirit of hard work

380
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,252
and the habit of respecting
and loving myself.

381
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:12,033
Don't listen to him.

382
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,033
What are you talking about?
It's my decision to come here.

383
00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:16,993
I'm doing quite well here.

384
00:24:24,414 --> 00:24:26,874
I saw the video about
you complaining about your housemates.

385
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:29,252
Did you move out

386
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:30,273
because of that?

387
00:24:30,973 --> 00:24:32,954
You should tell me
if you're short on money.

388
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:35,073
Says who.

389
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:37,513
I can't be living in a nice place
if I need money.

390
00:24:38,253 --> 00:24:39,993
That's just a joke

391
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,714
with some exaggeration.

392
00:24:42,174 --> 00:24:43,593
It's not true.

393
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:44,692
I'm totally fine.

394
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:45,753
You see,

395
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:47,212
except for a boyfriend,

396
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:48,154
I have everything.

397
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:52,593
I haven't asked you yet.

398
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:55,194
Why are you living
in such a big apartment?

399
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:57,993
Do you live here alone?

400
00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:01,194
My friend sublet it to me.

401
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,194
Those animals

402
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:04,954
and cats are my friend's pets.

403
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:06,234
I'm looking after them.

404
00:25:09,094 --> 00:25:09,813
When did you know

405
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:11,273
a well-off friend like this?

406
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:13,160
Did you meet
through telling nonsense jokes?

407
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:15,394
Mom,

408
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:18,012
why must you be sarcastic

409
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:18,972
when it comes to stand-up?

410
00:25:18,973 --> 00:25:20,993
I met friends everywhere.

411
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:24,093
Do you know people

412
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:25,720
people are gossiping about you
because of that?

413
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:27,613
Those comments are terrible.

414
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:29,073
They said you were a kept woman.

415
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:29,933
It's easy for them

416
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:30,772
to spread rumors.

417
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:32,173
I have to explain to them one by one.

418
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:33,653
I can't type fast.

419
00:25:33,654 --> 00:25:34,853
I feel so awful

420
00:25:34,854 --> 00:25:36,052
seeing those comments.

421
00:25:36,053 --> 00:25:38,073
Why even bother reading them?

422
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:40,114
There are all sorts of voices online.

423
00:25:40,134 --> 00:25:42,114
Don't you know your own daughter well?

424
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,874
That's exactly what bothers me.

425
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,833
I won't stop you from venturing out.

426
00:25:58,654 --> 00:25:59,333
When I was young,

427
00:25:59,334 --> 00:26:01,194
my naivety put me through a hard time,

428
00:26:01,453 --> 00:26:02,954
and that's why I support you.

429
00:26:04,253 --> 00:26:06,674
But you won't have a stable life
if you keep telling nonsense jokes.

430
00:26:10,614 --> 00:26:12,033
I won't force you to get married.

431
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,353
I just hope you'll find

432
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,753
a person whom you trust

433
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,914
and have someone to protect you
aside from me.

434
00:26:26,374 --> 00:26:27,353
What if

435
00:26:27,614 --> 00:26:29,593
I can't find a suitable man?

436
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,234
Why not?

437
00:26:33,854 --> 00:26:35,553
There are many people out there. Why not?

438
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:40,474
I'm still confirming it,

439
00:26:40,614 --> 00:26:42,073
but the chance is slim.

440
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,273
I don't think something
will happen between us.

441
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,234
Why is it impossible?

442
00:26:46,374 --> 00:26:47,732
As long as both of you are breathing,

443
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:48,874
nothing is impossible.

444
00:26:52,614 --> 00:26:53,394
All right.

445
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,154
Let me add something, Mrs. Meixia.

446
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:00,513
You've also left me another treasure.

447
00:27:01,174 --> 00:27:03,434
The determination to love.

448
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:07,353
I don't care who you love.

449
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:09,273
Mind you, prioritize yourself.

450
00:27:09,614 --> 00:27:10,593
Remember that.

451
00:27:11,973 --> 00:27:12,874
If anything happens,

452
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:15,373
tell me.

453
00:27:15,374 --> 00:27:16,313
I'm your mother.

454
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:20,434
Eat up.

455
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:24,434
Delicious.

456
00:27:27,293 --> 00:27:28,133
Sweet and sour fried pork.

457
00:27:28,134 --> 00:27:29,313
I've always wanted to eat this.

458
00:27:34,414 --> 00:27:36,234
It took you quite some time
to cook this, right?

459
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:38,394
I'm willing to.

460
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:41,434
So fragrant.

461
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:50,394
Is it nice?

462
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:51,553
Yes.

463
00:27:53,574 --> 00:27:54,353
My bowl is empty.

464
00:27:56,013 --> 00:27:56,692
Well,

465
00:27:56,693 --> 00:27:58,114
you've always skipped meals.

466
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:02,508
(Liang Daiwen: Are you home?)

467
00:28:03,213 --> 00:28:04,893
Mom, something came up in the office.

468
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:06,033
I need to head back.

469
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:08,513
Are you leaving already?

470
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:10,033
Yes.

471
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,434
I'll do the dishes.

472
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:17,200
Don't pretend
you're capable of doing anything.

473
00:28:24,094 --> 00:28:25,033
Yes?

474
00:28:25,814 --> 00:28:27,394
Can I watch

475
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:28,793
your show?

476
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:31,012
Sure.

477
00:28:31,013 --> 00:28:31,933
I'll keep a ticket for you.

478
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:33,273
Even though it breaks the rules.

479
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:34,993
Bye.

480
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:36,133
Don't wash the dishes.

481
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:37,033
I'll do it.

482
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:14,963
(User 5342: How could you spread rumors?
Do you even know Gu Yi?)

483
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,135
(File Transfer Assistant)

484
00:29:44,136 --> 00:29:47,503
(If you want a scapegoat, you don't have
to go to the market or online shopping.)

485
00:29:47,504 --> 00:29:52,296
(You can find one at your workplace.)

486
00:29:53,983 --> 00:29:56,476
(My balance: 562 yuan)

487
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,355

("No creation is needed

489
00:30:25,134 --> 00:30:26,234
If you keep drinking,

490
00:30:26,654 --> 00:30:27,714
you'll drop in five minutes.

491
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:34,073
What are you doing here?

492
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:35,714
To look for you.

493
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:39,674
How did you know I'm here?

494
00:30:41,414 --> 00:30:42,753
You didn't reply to my message.

495
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:44,753
I didn't see your bike downstairs.

496
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:46,313
So, you either went to Ounce

497
00:30:47,414 --> 00:30:48,753
or went out for carbs.

498
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,513
I don't take carbs today.

499
00:30:57,174 --> 00:30:59,353
I take whiskey.

500
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:02,394
Didn't expect that, right?

501
00:31:02,814 --> 00:31:05,634
Just after I got fined ten thousand,

502
00:31:05,894 --> 00:31:08,194
I went out for an expensive drink.

503
00:31:10,094 --> 00:31:11,513
I don't care.

504
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:15,793
I've accepted it, anyway.

505
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:20,634
Taking the fall
and paying the penalty is nothing.

506
00:31:22,053 --> 00:31:23,234
Whatever.

507
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:25,674
I'll accept it.

508
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:30,474
