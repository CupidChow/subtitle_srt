00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
(Adapted from Douban Read's work
"Smile Code" by Zhu Yue)

00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,160
=Episode 5=

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,859
Xin.

26
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,380
After you got your master's degree,

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,579
you were jobless for so long.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,579
Now, even though
you got the job at Nextmonday,

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,239
instead of going to work,

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,998
you're dating

31
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,979
a married man.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,598
Do you know what our relatives

33
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,479
think of me

34
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,899
and your father now?

35
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,660
I've said this many times.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,419
I didn't know he's married.

37
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,859
What do you know, then?

38
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,699
Your father and I have always taught you

39
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,299
that as a girl,

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,139
you need to protect your dignity.

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,179
Right?

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,299
Now that you've grown up,

43
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,239
you have a mind of your own,

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,699
and you won't listen to us anymore?

45
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,260
So, who's the one suffering now?

46
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,380
Is it me or your father?

47
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,540
It's you.

48
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:52,419
Xin.

49
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,340
This time,

50
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:58,859
you really...

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,459
Chen.

52
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:05,959
I listened to you
and let her come to Donghai.

53
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,699
That was a bad decision.

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,060
Look what she has become!

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,060
Lower your voice.

56
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,620
Is she capable of
taking care of herself?

57
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,299
Is she capable of planning her future?

58
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,340
My dear child.

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,419
Listen to me.

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,139
Let's go home.

61
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,340
You can find a good man

62
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,579
to marry

63
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,979
and settle down.

64
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,100
Just enjoy a simple, married life,

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,459
okay?

66
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,060
I'm not going back.

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,179
Say that again.

68
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,139
Mom.

69
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,699
Sorry, I did something wrong,

70
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,359
but

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,179
I have a job in Donghai.

72
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:06,878
I can't just leave like this.

73
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,699
You do know you have a job?

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,780
If you knew sooner,

75
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,979
you should have just gone to work!

76
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,940
Xin.

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,879
I can't see you

78
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,699
destroy your own future.

79
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,420
My child, come on.

80
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,779
Listen to me.

81
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,539
Go back to your room.

82
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,420
Get some sleep.

83
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,699
When you wake up tomorrow,

84
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,940
go and submit your resignation letter.

85
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,699
Your father and I
will be waiting for you here.

86
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,060
Go.

87
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,180
Go to sleep.

88
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,099
My good child.

89
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,260
Guan Xingxin.

90
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,219
Go to bed.

91
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:56,500
Hubby,

92
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,899
we need two more extension leads.

93
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,439
Remind me

94
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,759
when we're at the supermarket.

95
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,899
We need to buy them.

96
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,019
Do you think she cleans

97
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,899
the air-conditioner regularly?

98
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,319
If it's dirty inside,

99
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,699
it can trigger

100
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,278
allergic rhinitis.

101
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,579
You're sick.

102
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,699
You need help.

103
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,500
I'm not sick.

104
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,699
Why do I need help?

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,260
Yi died 20 years ago.

106
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,759
Why can't you

107
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,659
accept this fact until now?

108
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,539
She's not the same person as Xin.

109
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,339
Yi has always been playful,

110
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,139
while Xin has always been sensible.

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,219
Her surname is Guan, not Chen!

112
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:02,099
We have given
her family more than enough.

113
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:05,060
Just let her go.

114
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,639
You can't keep her around you forever,

115
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,500
you know?

116
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,139
Do you understand?

117
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:20,500
Hubby.

118
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,019
Didn't you tell me

119
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,139
that Xin is our daughter?

120
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,139
That's what you told me.

121
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,339
You said Xin is my daughter.

122
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:37,219
You told me that, remember?

123
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,940
That's what you said.

124
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,659
I have already lost my daughter once,

125
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,940
and I can't lose another one.

126
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,300
I can't.

127
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,339
Xin is my daughter.

128
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,820
About your manuscript,
before I talk about the content,

129
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:19,219
have I told you
how important formatting is?

130
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,519
If you print this in such a format,

131
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,940
the whole booklet would go to waste.

132
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,820
I'll adjust the format now.

133
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,759
Also, I've circled some photos here.

134
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,380
The source is unclear.

135
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,019
Replace all of them.

136
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:33,220
If you don't have other photos,
just leave them blank.

137
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,598
I asked for a structural film,

138
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,019
not a picture book.

139
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:47,459
(Jacqueline: Next week's
theme selection will be rescheduled.)

140
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,194
(Contract Writer (Xu Guanrui):
Gu Yi, meet me in my office.)

141
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,419
I've got some work to do.

142
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:10,860
Come in.

143
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,539
Sit down.

144
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:22,460
I'll keep this short.

145
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,500
Jacqueline has approved your article,

146
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,059
but I can't approve it.

147
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,399
Is there anything wrong?

148
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,380
I can make some changes.

149
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,419
Gu Yi.

150
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:33,539
Have you read any music critiques?

151
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,380
Do you like bands?

152
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,059
Have you done any research?

153
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,998
How many of the band's songs
have you listened to?

154
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,460
Even if you've never
listened to them live,

155
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,779
how many of their videos
have you watched?

156
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,279
This band

157
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,478
started off by
busking in a public plaza,

158
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,059
when they didn't even
have a proper sound system.

159
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,480
Today, they're capable

160
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,559
of holding concerts that can
attract tens of thousands of people.

161
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,419
Do you think
what they did was meaningful?

162
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,819
I know

163
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,939
you're the best
copywriter in Nextmonday.

164
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,560
Your articles tend to get approved.

165
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,959
I also understand that you're used to
writing for luxury brands,

166
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,819
and you've internalized a writing style

167
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,598
that's fancy

168
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,980
but lacks substance.

169
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,899
To me,

170
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,980
it's soulless.

171
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,500
If you want to complete this task,

172
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,299
you need to do it my way.

173
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:33,700
Don't just change it.

174
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,260
Rewrite it.

175
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,059
Okay.

176
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,130
(Xu Guanrui's Information)

177
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,960
(10 years ago,
when I graduated from college,)

178
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,779
(I became an intern in a music company.)

179
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,740
(My drawers were filled with CDs,)

180
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,939
(walkmans,)

181
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,299
(and CD players.)

182
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:21,939
(I alternated between them.)

183
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,500
(There were tons of music online,)

184
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,460
(not just metal and punk.)

185
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,019
(All those songs)

186
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,340
(were more than our bygone youth)

187
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:31,580
(and romance.)

188
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,659
(VCDs)

189
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,580
(opened everyone's eyes to the fact)

190
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,118
(that music)

191
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,500
(has a lot more technicalities)

192
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,899
(and possibilities.)

193
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,620
(Back then, I thought that passion)

194
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,460
(was an inextinguishable
form of energy.)

195
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,280
(Alas, all the heat and warmth
the world has to offer)

196
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,500
(may not reach the intended audience.)

197
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,620
I'm back.

198
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,260
You're back.

199
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,740
Want to have dinner?

200
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,419
Your treat?

201
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:14,779
Sure.

202
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:16,640
You've been eating
a lot of unhealthy food,

203
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,419
so it's good to eat
healthily once in a while.

204
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,860
Is this like feeding me
canned food instead of kibbles?

205
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:23,700
Is that the punchline?

206
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,559
Mr. Liang.

207
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,319
Normally, when you
treat someone to dinner,

208
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,819
you don't let your
guest order their food.

209
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,478
You live here too,

210
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,539
so strictly speaking,

211
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,500
you're not a guest.

212
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,659
(Strictly speaking,
you're still a robot.)

213
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,899
You're having the same as mine?

214
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,539
I tend to go for simple food.

215
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,740
This restaurant will do.

216
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,500
(Right.)

217
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,238
(Not eating power banks in front of me)

218
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:10,700
(is already good enough.)

219
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,260
Do you recommend any TV dramas?

220
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,439
I didn't know

221
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,799
you'd watch TV dramas

222
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,460
while having dinner too.

223
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,019
That's what modern youngsters do.

224
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,500
I live in modern times.

225
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,860
I didn't expect you

226
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,539
to send me home because
you learned that from TV dramas.

227
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,380
Seriously.

228
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,019
I often speak plainly.

229
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,539
My friends told me that it's hurtful,
and that I should learn from TV dramas.

230
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,419
Does that work?

231
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,700
You look like you had a failed face job.

232
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,380
Sorry if this offends you,

233
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,980
but have you ever been diagnosed

234
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,059
with facial paralysis?

235
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,500
No.

236
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:38,819
I did see a doctor to confirm.

237
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,539
Why do you look so robotic, then?

238
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,779
You're born with
complete facial features.

239
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,478
You can laugh, cry,

240
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,980
and get mad whenever you want.

241
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,959
Whatever you feel,

242
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,399
you can express it through your face.

243
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,819
Shouldn't that be natural?

244
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,819
Why do you need to mimic other people?

245
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,120
I don't experience the same
range of emotions as you do.

246
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,340
So,

247
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,299
it's not that you can't laugh,

248
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,860
but you're unable to feel joy?

249
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:15,700
I guess so.

250
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:31,151
(Guan Xingxin)

251
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,620
Where are you going?

252
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,939
Wait for me!

253
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,980
Liang Daiwen!

254
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:19,620
You might as well
grow a pair of four-meter legs!

255
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:26,980
Hey!

256
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,100
I haven't gotten in yet!

257
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:06,919
(Shen Zhimin)

258
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,299
I heard about

259
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,660
what happened to Guan.

260
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,460
I'll be there soon.

261
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,819
You're driving?

262
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,379
Is there anyone with you?

263
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,379
Gu Yi.

264
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,019
Whether there's anyone with you or not,

265
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,260
control your driving speed.

266
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,260
Liang Daiwen.

267
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,019
Slow down, now!

268
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,140
I know you're feeling awful,

269
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,798
and that you can't handle

270
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,619
these messy emotions.

271
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,460
But first, you need to
control yourself physically.

272
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,220
Look at the people on the streets.

273
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,339
I'm slowing down.

274
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:10,943
(Inpatient)

275
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,700
Thank you.

276
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,900
Liang Daiwen!

277
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:36,523
(Outpatient)

278
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,539
You're literally confirming the rumors.

279
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,420
The dead won't talk.

280
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,619
I can't even talk clearly now.

281
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,379
Over the past two days,

282
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,379
I've been constantly apologizing

283
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,140
to my four parents,

284
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:30,980
to Nextmonday,

285
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,140
and to Tianhe.

286
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,140
Layla's account

287
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,619
has been banned.

288
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,500
Had I not resigned earlier,

289
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,059
who knows how much I have
to pay for breaking the contract.

290
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,339
So, that's why you went to a hotel

291
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,260
to burn some charcoal?

292
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,779
Weren't you worried that the hotel
might ask for compensation too?

293
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,619
I didn't want to live,
but I didn't feel like dying today.

294
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,579
Before I started burning,

295
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,059
I messaged a bunch of people.

296
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,940
You,

297
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:26,420
and some media reporters
who messaged me in private.

298
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,038
Proving my innocence

299
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,099
is a trap.

300
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:39,379
Instead of doing that,

301
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,220
I chose to retaliate.

302
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,639
Everyone, we're now at the hospital.

303
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,599
We haven't seen Layla yet.

304
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,959
Stop filming.

305
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,038
She seems to be a fan too.

306
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:54,639
Stop filming.

307
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,180
You're being rough.

308
00:20:57,999 --> 00:20:58,679
Everyone,

309
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,758
the hospital workers told me

310
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,959
that Layla is fine now,

311
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,278
but we need to be careful

312
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,740
of any false rumors.

313
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:05,420
We're the only ones Layla has now.

314
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,478
She's fine.

315
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:07,318
She's doing okay.

316
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,998
Be careful of anyone

317
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:10,859
who might spread rumors.

318
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,718
She's inside now.

319
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,099
She's doing fine.

320
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,558
Is Guan Xingxin

321
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,619
all right?

322
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,180
She's all right.

323
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,180
She's resting.

324
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,140
What's wrong with you?

325
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,099
What's wrong with me?

326
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,940
Nothing.

327
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,099
I'm doing great.

328
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,260
I'm healthy and fit.

329
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,220
I could even run a marathon now.

330
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,980
Is that the punchline?

331
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,900
Do you think I'm in
the mood for punchlines now?

332
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:09,140
You...

333
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,940
You're mad?

334
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,539
Yes.

335
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,019
I am mad.

336
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:21,460
Why did you leave me all alone?

337
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,099
If you didn't want me to follow,
you could have said so.

338
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,579
I ran 14 floors down

339
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,059
until I almost broke my legs.

340
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,758
Do you really think

341
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,278
that I'm your depressed pet dog?

342
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,180
Is that how you walk me?

343
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,900
I was worried that it'd be dangerous.

344
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,940
Dangerous?

345
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:41,819
Sometimes, when I drive,

346
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,260
I tend to speed.

347
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,518
You mean,

348
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:49,940
like today?

349
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:52,900
There are many emotions

350
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,579
that I can't explain.

351
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,619
It's safer for you to call a cab.

352
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,900
I didn't expect you
to get mad over this.

353
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:06,579
I'll tell you in advance next time.

354
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,619
So, you were speeding just now

355
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,740
because of Guan Xingxin?

356
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,980
I guess so.

357
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,819
This is my first time
seeing you worried.

358
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,859
You do have human emotions, after all.

359
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,119
It just depends on who it is.

360
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,220
That will be 35 yuan.

361
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,099
I don't have many friends.

362
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,819
She's special to me.

363
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,359
Back then, our lab was doing

364
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,819
a barrier-free concept experiment.

365
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,779
She joined us as

366
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,099
a blind volunteer.

367
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,579
I shielded her from harassment,

368
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,420
and she shielded me from hassles.

369
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,420
That's why I don't want anything
bad to happen to her.

370
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,779
A blind volunteer?

371
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:01,660
Her eyes seem fine to me.

372
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:05,660
She was blind when she was young.

373
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,099
Later, she received a cornea transplant

374
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,859
and regained her sight.

375
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,619
So,

376
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,819
you guys are long-time friends?

377
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,980
Just friends.

378
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,819
Why explain that to me?

379
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,880
Worried that I'd get the wrong idea?

380
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,500
Yes.

381
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,619
You're frightening when you ramble.

382
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,779
I'm getting a cup of water.

383
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,980
How come I didn't frighten you to death?

384
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,859
Is it really okay

385
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,099
to leave her alone?

386
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,420
Yes.

387
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,619
She knows what she's doing.

388
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:04,660
The noodles are done.

389
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,399
A good joke just came to my mind.

390
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,260
I'd better jot it down.

391
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:13,859
You're still writing jokes

392
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,779
on a night when someone almost died?

393
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,299
No,

394
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,220
my jokes are free of prejudice.

395
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,660
Besides, I actually

396
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,779
feel bad for her.

397
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,059
I thought she's a cool, nonchalant girl,

398
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,019
but I didn't know

399
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,339
that a pretty girl like her
can be bogged down by troubles.

400
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,339
Everyone has troubles.

401
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,980
Her family had
her whole life planned out,

402
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,460
but she chose to rebel

403
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,140
and came to Donghai alone.

404
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,379
Pursuing freedom too much

405
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,299
made her lose her freedom instead.

406
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,639
I thought she's like a cool

407
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,740
main character from a fairy tale,

408
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,619
but reality does hit hard.

409
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,579
Don't you find her troublesome?

410
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,539
Not at all.

411
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,159
Even though we use a lot

412
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,700
of sarcasm in stand-up comedy,

413
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,420
but we don't bear
any ill will most of the time.

414
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,420
Sarcasm is not prejudice.

415
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,399
Besides, I don't want my jokes

416
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,740
to amplify current female stereotypes.

417
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,019
She can solve her problems.

418
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,660
I just hope she gets well soon.

419
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,779
Why are you staring at me?

420
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,059

It's not convenient for
a guy to watch over you.

433
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,859
Liang Daiwen has gone back home.

434
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,660

Also,

439
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,220
don't worry.

440
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:48,099
Daiwen and I are just friends.

441
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,460
I'm not your romantic rival.

442
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:54,660
That's pretty obvious.

443
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,539
Is that so?

444
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:06,940
Liang Daiwen

445
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,339
isn't my type.

446
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:11,059
My preferred type is usually

447
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,940
artistic.

448
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:17,900
When I was at school,

449
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,420
I didn't fancy anyone

450
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,639
because I found boys my age

451
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,779
to be childish.

452
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:28,518
After college, the first guy I fancied

453
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,019
was an artist.

454
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,679
I met him at 798 Art Zone

455
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,260
while visiting an exhibition.

456
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,558
He was very talented,

457
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,700
but also seclusive.

458
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,478
As for the second guy,

459
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,740
you know him.

460
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,819
That was embarrassing.

461
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,980
Liang Daiwen has never
been my type, though.

462
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,500
To me, he is

463
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,299
a friend who will never leave me.

464
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,099
Was that artist

465
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,740
good-looking?

466
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,000
I guess he's like a male
protagonist from a comic book.

467
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,220
Really?

468
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,278
How does he look like?

469
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,220
Show me.

470
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,579
He's like a comic book character?

471
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,180
What kind of comic?

472
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,700
Horror comics?

473
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,099
I guess you haven't met Chen Yijin.

474
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,420
I saw him on the Internet.

475
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,260
Heard of him.

476
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:36,619
How should I put it?

477
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,579
His personality aside,

478
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,260
he looks like

479
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,339
a literal joke.

480
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,220
Gu Yi.

481
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,019
Do you believe those rumors online?

482
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,299
I trust Mr. Yu,

483
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,140
and he trusts you too.

484
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,099
Let me tell you a secret.

485
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:09,940
Actually,

486
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,460
even until now,

487
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,478
I still have a screenshot of our chat

488
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,420
in which he claims that he's single.

489
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,099
Even though I've broken up with him,

490
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,859
he's still trying
to contact me on all platforms,

491
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,980
saying that

492
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,500
he doesn't love his wife anymore.

493
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,159
He's just worried that
if this goes out of hand,

494
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,600
he might lose his current project,

495
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,180
so he wanted me to take a step back.

496
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,260
Knowing that I had loved

497
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,740
a man like him...

498
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,980
It's pretty disappointing.

499
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:46,099
That's why I broke off
all contact with him.

500
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,059
He even went to Nextmonday to see me,

501
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,539
and I threw some coffee at him.

502
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,819
To tell the truth,

503
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,220
if you do take revenge
on him with these,

504
00:30:58,719 --> 00:30:59,599
you'd be pushing yourself

505
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,819
further into an abyss.

506
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,740
I know.

507
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,859
I just don't want you
to have the wrong idea about me.

508
00:31:17,023 --> 00:31:18,359
(Is everything okay?)

509
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,059
Despite his robotic demeanor,
he does know how to worry.

510
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,180
You mean Liang?

511
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,038
He may not be on
the same dimension as we are,

512
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,940
but his soul is with us.

513
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:32,443
(Yes, save for
Guan Xingxin's taste in men.)

514
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:34,900
Liang and I are old friends.

515
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,260
Recently, he's been talking about

516
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,740
an interesting guest in his house.

517
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,339
I didn't expect that it's you.

518
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:44,859
He said

519
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,199
that having someone to talk to at home

520
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,339
feels so new to him.

521
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,740
An awkward remark like that

522
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,660
does sound like him.

523
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,260
Liang and I have known
each other for years.

524
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,740
We used to argue until
we almost broke our friendship

525
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,318
because it's impossible to get

526
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,940
any emotional feedback from him.

527
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:07,099
Since you're staying with him,
you should know

528
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,460
that he's keeping a bunch of frogs,

529
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,199
lizards,

530
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,779
and snakes at home.

531
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,859
It's like a tropical rainforest
in his home.

532
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,260
Gu Yi.

533
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,859
Don't get too engrossed.

534
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,359
Liang Daiwen

535
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,539
is not someone you should
spend your whole life with.

536
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:33,579
What do you mean?

537
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:38,220
You've been living with him.
Haven't you realized yet?

538
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,460
He's suffering from emotional blindness.

539
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,940
There's no hope for him
when it comes to love.

540
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,019
What in the world

541
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:23,420
is emotional blindness?

542
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,339
Mr. Yu?

543
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,339
What a coincidence.

544
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,339
What are you doing here?

545
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,220
I...

546
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,800
I drank too much the night before,

547
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,480
and I fell into a drain
while riding my motorbike.

548
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,360
I came here to get my injuries treated,
and I just had a fresh change of dressing.

549
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,460
Why are you here?

550
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,679
Guan Xingxin is in hospital,

551
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,900
so I'm watching over her.

552
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,059
Is she okay?

553
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,460
She's fine,

554
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:55,940
but she's depressed.

555
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:58,460
And it's your fault.

556
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:01,460
Yeah.

557
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,758
Well, I got

558
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,639
my retribution,

559
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,339
right?

560
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,439
Keep watching over her.

561
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,558
I'm going.

562
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:10,518
Sure, take care.

563
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,620
Don't fall into any more drains.

564
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,660
I hope so.

565
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,060
That was good acting.

566
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:23,678
Cut the crap.

567
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,260
I've texted you everything.

568
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,407
(Famous actress Layla's relationship
with married man exposed.)

569
00:34:38,408 --> 00:34:40,123
(She is believed to have
attempted suicide following the rumors.)

570
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,547
(I'm not sure
if she did attempt suicide,)

571
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:43,939
(but Mrs. Chen
uploaded this ultrasound photo.)

572
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,463
(I found an exact same version of it.)

573
00:34:45,464 --> 00:34:48,259
(Don't you think it's distasteful
to steal someone's photo, Mrs. Chen?)

574
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,208
(Oh my god, here comes the plot twist!)

575
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,579
(I've always been, and will always
be a fan of Layla, so I trust her.)

576
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,280
(There's the truth.
I knew she's not that kind of person.)

577
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,021
(Mrs. Chen)

578
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,059
(Wish you get well soon.
I believe you're wronged.)

579
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,260
(The B-scan ultrasonic image posted
by Mrs. Chen is actually other's)

580
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,360
(Nextmonday)

581
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,598
Xu Guanrui has approved your write-up.

582
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,819
Why are you still worried?

583
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,779
Have you heard about
what happened to Guan Xingxin?

584
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:32,859
I have.

585
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:35,478
She's being accused of being a mistress,

586
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:36,400
and by attempting suicide,

587
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,379
she's doing exactly
what those rumor starters want.

588
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,319
She's the victim.

589
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,379
She showed me some screenshots,

590
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,620
but I think it'll still be hard
to turn things around.

591
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:47,158
Emotions are weapons for the weak.

592
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,919
Anyone who gets them
has the initiative.

593
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,959
Right now, no one cares
whether the rumors are true.

594
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,040
Everyone is just curious to know
why a beautiful woman like her

595
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,939
would fall in love
with a tacky-looking guy.

596
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,640
Controversy and gossip go hand in hand.

597
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,158
People love it when
it's juicy and scandalous.

598
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,399
Layla has a huge fan base.

599
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,700
If this fiasco keeps up,
it won't do anyone good.

600
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,459
So, you're saying that...

601
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,439
While everyone is still hyped up,

602
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,879
Guan Xingxin managed to play the victim

603
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,678
and expose another
scandal juicier than this.

604
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,899
Someone proved that
the ultrasound photo was stolen.

605
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,620
If the rumor starters
continue to pressure her,

606
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,260
they'd get backfired instead.

607
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,180
Why are you still concerned about her?

608
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,299
Get ready for the meeting.

609
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,140
Let me take my stuff.

610
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,700
We're publishing our music column soon.

611
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,198
Make sure to maximize our online

612
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,239
and physical resources.

613
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,078
By that, I mean

614
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,638
the entire magazine, including the ads.

615
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,359
Understood.

616
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,959
Also,

617
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,558
highlight the music articles'

618
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:37,478
number of clicks and views.

619
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,399
Before our next meeting,

620
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,339
boost the articles'
popularity and visibility.

621
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,118
Highlight the gap between

622
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,740
our goal and the actual results.

623
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,959
Allow me to remind you again

624
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,140
that I signed Xu Guanrui here.

625
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,100
Keep an eye on
his progress next edition.

626
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,998
Dismissed.

627
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:52,899
Get back to work.

628
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:04,140
You are good

629
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,620
in packaging the idea.

630
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:08,339
You too.

631
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:28,603
(Xu Guanrui: Thank you for rewriting
the article. Let's grab lunch together.)

632
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:33,883
(Yuji Restaurant)

633
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,620
When's our turn?

634
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,020
Let's wait a while.

635
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,939
Here's some snacks.

636
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:44,419
And drinks.

637
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,359
Xu.

638
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,339
Ms. Mei.

639
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,518
This is my go-to spot for food.

640
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,499
Who...

641
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,279
Who's that?

642
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,279
Table for two, please.

643
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,799
- My colleague.
- I've saved a good spot for you.

644
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,740
Okay, let's go.

645
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,038
Come on.

646
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,003
(Balance: 974 yuan)

647
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:04,680
(Liang Daiwen:
Guan is getting discharged tomorrow.)

648
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,483
(I have something to do,
can you send her back instead?)

649
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,220
Guan, huh?

650
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:16,379
I need to reply to the message
from my boss.

651
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:27,539
(Me: Relax, I'll send your dear
Guan back home.)

652
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,840
(Liang Daiwen: Thank you.)

653
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,499
(Thank you?)

654
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,459
(Can't you see that I'm teasing you?)

655
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,399
(Liang Daiwen transferred you can fare)

656
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,419
(What's this, cab fare?)

657
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:44,620
(He's so calculative.)

658
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,959
(If we ever break up,)

659
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,819
(does that mean I need
to return the money?)

660
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,540
(What do you mean, break up?)

661
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:52,100
(Why am I)

662
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,299
(imagining myself to be his girlfriend?)

663
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:09,723
(It's nothing.
You don't need to pay me.)

664
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:12,819
Jacqueline?

665
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,899
Don't worry.

666
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,819
You're still in a dormant phase,

667
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,580
and your opportunity hasn't arrived.

668
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,939
Don't get influenced
by your boss and colleagues.

669
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,939
When you're overqualified
for your current position,

670
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,660
you can just leave.

671
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,419
I'm hoping for a promotion, though.

672
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,060
That doesn't make sense.

673
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,419
Your boss is so controlling.

674
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,499
She'll just suppress you
as long as you stay,

675
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,060
and she won't share
any benefits with you.

676
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,560
In the end,
all you'll get is 15,000 yuan,

677
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,540
and that's the maximum
monthly salary you'll ever get.

678
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:50,759
You should be paid by the hour.

679
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,160
The higher your monthly salary,
the more you'll need to work overtime.

680
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,140
It's a bad deal.

681
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,540
You really do

682
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,499
speak in simple and plain terms.

683
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:03,939
I don't open up to anyone.

684
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:05,598
Got it.

685
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,299
I'll pretend that I didn't hear you.

686
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,260
My comrade.

687
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,620
Slow down.

688
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:12,779
Do what you love.

689
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,759
But, it seems like

690
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,779
I don't have that much time to spend.

691
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,198
If you work 24 hours a day,

692
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,779
do you think you'd
have time for yourself?

693
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,220
Isn't it tragic to work

694
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,260
like a robot?

695
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:43,459
Come in.

696
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,660
These...

697
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:49,839
Don't touch them.

698
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,859
There's something dirty inside.

699
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,979
Gu Yi.

700
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,959
I...

701
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,459
I don't have many girl friends.

702
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,419
There's something

703
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,779
that I'd like to get your input on.

704
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:08,979
I love you.

705
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:11,700
I really love you.

706
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:13,620
I've thought about it.

707
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,180
Jacqueline's right.

708
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,859
I didn't want to blow things up

709
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,260
because I didn't want
to hurt another woman.

710
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:26,459
But now, I don't want to be
considerate anymore.

711
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,620
They ruined my life.

712
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,819
If you want to publish this,

713
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:41,859
