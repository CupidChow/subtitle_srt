=Episode 4=

25
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,730
My goodness, who's this about?

26
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:52,792
Who did this?

27
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:01,152
What happened?

28
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:03,491
This bad?

29
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:04,551
Mistress.

30
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:07,709
(Cheap whore, awful witch, mistress die)

31
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:15,792
What is this?

32
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:19,151
Nextmonday just did a feature
on shaming

33
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,891
and my employees gave me

34
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:23,151
a period-shaming after-sales service?

35
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:24,491
What's the deal with the sanitary pad?

36
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:25,570
Some anti-demon talisman?

37
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:26,752
No one's going to say anything?

38
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,312
Who's feeling the guilt?

39
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:31,592
How stupid can one be?

40
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:34,640
Why are you people
still standing around?

41
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,771
Are you waiting for me

42
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:37,192
to invite you to your desk one by one?

43
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:50,111
Guan Xingxin is on medical leave.

44
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,232
You'll take over her topic.

45
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:53,871
Submit it to me

46
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,151
with the updated materials
for re-approval.

47
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:57,352
Also,

48
00:02:57,772 --> 00:02:59,352
cease communications with Tianhe.

49
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:01,752
We'll let the virtual idol idea

50
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:03,632
cool off before giving it another go.

51
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,120
Why are you looking at me like that?
Just speak your mind.

52
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:13,072
I thought you didn't like Guan Xingxin.

53
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,871
I didn't expect you'd back her up.

54
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:16,671
Those are two different things.

55
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:18,312
Haven't you heard of this saying?

56
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:20,711
The person who started the fire
is the heretic,

57
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:22,111
not the one who got burned.

58
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:24,271
Shakespeare.

59
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:27,551
Not bad.

60
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:28,451
I guess

61
00:03:28,452 --> 00:03:30,632
you're not relying solely
on ads for materials.

62
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:32,632
That's good.

63
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:34,011
Someone was afraid

64
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:35,352
I'd work you too hard.

65
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:36,912
Who?

66
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:38,151
Remember him?

67
00:03:38,612 --> 00:03:39,831
Your new colleague,

68
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:41,551
the person-in-charge
of the new column.

69
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:11,151
Why didn't you answer my calls?

70
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:18,912
My phone is off.

71
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:20,232
I wanted some peace.

72
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,152
Shen just left.

73
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:24,871
Your mom called me.

74
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:29,272
Which one?

75
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:39,832
It's not your fault.

76
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't be so hard on yourself.

77
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,712
Liang Daiwen.

78
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:12,111
Do you know the amount of news
I've received today?

79
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,671
You're the only person
who said that to me.

80
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:25,431
At the beginning,
I really didn't know he was married.

81
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:28,751
When I found out,
we had already broken up.

82
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:31,631
I don't know why

83
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:33,952
no one is willing to accept
my side of the story.

84
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,010
You knew

85
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,792
how the Internet operates
when you chose to stream.

86
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,232
There's no need to get stuck in a rut

87
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:50,311
or put yourself down.

88
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,111
This will pass.

89
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:25,478
(Announcement: The performances are
the result of the actors' hard work,)

90
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:30,192
(and unauthorized filming is
strictly prohibited!)

91
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:49,851
You're not scheduled for today.

92
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:50,751
I know.

93
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:52,671
I just dropped by to take a look.

94
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:54,311
Are you that free?

95
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:56,912
Guess cohabitation is pretty good, huh?

96
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,832
What are you talking about?

97
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,210
We talk show hosts follow
the code of ethics,

98
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:02,272
okay?

99
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:03,370
The first one being,

100
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,171
no improper relationships with fans.

101
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:06,051
Okay, okay.

102
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,570
He's not your fan anyway.

103
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:09,272
No need to feel pressured.

104
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:14,392
Guan Xingxin?

105
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,191
Yu Dule.

106
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:18,472
Liang Daiwen.

107
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:20,232
You guys know one another?

108
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:26,792
Didn't expect to see you again.

109
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:29,311
Perfect.

110
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:31,392
Here's your staff pass.

111
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,712
I broke up with Chen Yijin.

112
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:34,871
Thank you for your help,

113
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,871
although I'm not sure
what your motive was.

114
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,250
You probably also think

115
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:40,130
that I'm a homewrecker.

116
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:41,272
But I swear,

117
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:43,551
I was the last person
to know that he has a wife.

118
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,751
If your intention was to ridicule me,

119
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:47,712
well, you got your wish.

120
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:51,191
I never wanted to ridicule you.

121
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,392
Neither did I expect

122
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:55,472
things to get to this point.

123
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,152
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,311
Hello everyone, I'm Daodao.

125
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:07,690
I have a PhD in Chemistry.

126
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:09,712
Many people think
that chemicals are poisonous.

127
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:11,291
When they're promoting their products,

128
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:13,040
they say they're without
any chemical components.

129
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,690
The most ridiculous instance
was of a pesticide.

130
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:17,912
They claimed it did not contain
any chemicals.

131
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:19,912
Won't you go on stage today?

132
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:21,971
Guys, are they wanting to suicide?

133
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:22,991
No.

134
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:25,751
My boss caught me

135
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:27,232
stealing the video.

136
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:29,472
She almost made me become
a full-time talk show host.

137
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:31,171
So I'm calling it quits.

138
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:33,031
What do you think you're drinking?
Coca Cola?

139
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:35,271
If it's because of Guan Xingxin,

140
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:36,832
you needn't be so worried.

141
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:38,952
She's not close with your boss.

142
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:41,051
I can tell,

143
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,232
she's closer to you.

144
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:46,352
But she's not my girlfriend.

145
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:48,192
We've never dated.

146
00:09:03,532 --> 00:09:04,391
My daughter.

147
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,592
Why did you only pick up my call now?

148
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:08,490
Go on.

149
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:09,472
What's up?

150
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:10,791
Nothing major.

151
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,271
I just wanted to tell you,

152
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:14,111
the pair that's renting your room

153
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:15,151
has been chased out.

154
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:16,051
It's just not right.

155
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:17,850
They were fighting
and started brandishing knives.

156
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:19,271
It was so scary.

157
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:20,911
What?

158
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:22,791
You're not hurt, are you?

159
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:25,672
Oh, I'm not hurt.

160
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:27,432
It's just that,

161
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:29,352
your wall is covered

162
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:30,631
in blood

163
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,610
Mom, can you not take gulps of air
while speaking?

164
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:35,151
You really scared me.

165
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:36,312
As for the wall,

166
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:37,832
give it a coat of paint.

167
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:39,810
Still, I should let you know.

168
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:41,411
In case you suddenly

169
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:42,391
came back.

170
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:43,791
You'd be shocked.

171
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,432
Dear Meixia.

172
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:50,391
Are you perhaps missing me?

173
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,192
Of course not.

174
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:54,232
I'm enjoying the peace
and quiet at home.

175
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:57,871
Okay, sure. But I'm missing you.

176
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,911
I'll find a time to ask my boss
for a break

177
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:01,871
so I can go back to see you.

178
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:05,352
It's a deal then.

179
00:11:22,372 --> 00:11:24,232
Did I wake you up?

180
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:26,051
Sorry about that.

181
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,712
I'm packing my luggage.

182
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,072
I can tell.

183
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:31,352
Your packing skills
are as awful as ever.

184
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:38,151
When you open your bag at home,

185
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,160
your mom might just think you
were scavenging in the East China Sea.

186
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:43,531
When I moved,

187
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:45,511
I should've packed a whetstone

188
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,271
and grind your mouth a little.

189
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:49,312
How long will you be gone?

190
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:51,151
Why?

191
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:53,271
Are you going to feel lost without me?

192
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:57,931
If it's less than a week,

193
00:11:57,932 --> 00:11:59,751
you don't need so many pairs of shoes.

194
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,651
I think at most it'd be

195
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:04,672
a couple of days.

196
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:08,031
Truth is, I haven't asked my boss
about the leave yet.

197
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:10,631
Don't you have annual leave?

198
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:13,712
Mr. Liang,

199
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:15,531
not every person is like you,

200
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:17,271
able to get all your leave approved.

201
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:21,511
And not everyone is like you,

202
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:23,192
having a family to go back to.

203
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,312
My family isn't all that great.

204
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:33,871
My parents divorced a long time ago.

205
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,111
I was brought up solely by my mom.

206
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:38,651
She's a typical

207
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:40,391
free and easy kind of person.

208
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:42,490
She drinks, gets into fights,

209
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:44,271
has no care for public order and morals.

210
00:12:44,892 --> 00:12:46,011
She married my dad

211
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:47,330
all because of a plate

212
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:48,871
of dumplings with egg and chive filling.

213
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:51,631
She couldn't eat eggs before.

214
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,592
So my dad very confidently assured her,

215
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:55,210
if you're willing to marry me,

216
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:56,712
you'll have enough eggs
to last a lifetime.

217
00:12:57,851 --> 00:12:58,730
Later,

218
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:01,312
they hardly had any time
to think about eggs.

219
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:04,672
My mom worked day and night
to support my education.

220
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:07,151
It was pretty bad back then.

221
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:09,832
But my mom always sees the bright side.

222
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:13,232
She was working at a factory then.

223
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:15,991
I'd wait for her to get off work
at the parking lot entrance.

224
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:19,832
One time, an old pervert touched my leg.

225
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:22,931
My mom immediately took out a saw

226
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:24,552
and whacked the guy's leg.

227
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:26,570
As a result,

228
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:28,210
both she and the tool

229
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:30,031
got taken to the police station.

230
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:32,991
At the time, I thought to myself,

231
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,911
when I grow up,

232
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:37,232
I won't ever let my mom suffer again.

233
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:01,352
Liang Daiwen.

234
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:05,352
Liang Daiwen!

235
00:15:12,731 --> 00:15:13,371
Ma'am.

236
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,391
You're back, Gu Yi.

237
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:33,151
Mrs. Meixia.

238
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:35,352
Is this what you called
"covered in blood"?

239
00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:38,171
No matter the amount, it's still blood.

240
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,192
It's gross.

241
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:42,352
Coming.

242
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:53,651
Look at you.

243
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,271
Why did you pack so much stuff again?

244
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:57,991
You're almost out of rice
at home, right?

245
00:15:58,172 --> 00:15:59,751
I got some more for you.

246
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:02,771
I found this at the market.

247
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:04,690
It's the old-school cake
you're able to eat.

248
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:06,072
I bought you two catty's worth.

249
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:08,051
I haven't paid you for the fish
you brought last time.

250
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,072
You're spending too much.

251
00:16:09,532 --> 00:16:11,251
Well, I basically polished off

252
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:13,072
all the fried hairtail you made.

253
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:15,991
There's no need to talk about money
between us.

254
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:20,072
Are you Yi?

255
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,552
Hello, sir.

256
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:30,031
Who's that?

257
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:31,832
He Yunjun.

258
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:34,031
He used to be a member
of the same drama club.

259
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:35,631
The one who acted as Justice Bao.

260
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:37,271
You had called him Uncle Dark Skin
back then.

261
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:03,111
You've eaten,

262
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:04,311
watched your drama.

263
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:05,751
Let's begin then.

264
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:08,712
Begin what?

265
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,472
We've done many sessions.

266
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:15,271
Could you be a little more

267
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:16,432
self-aware?

268
00:17:29,652 --> 00:17:31,071
She's currently living in my house.

269
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:34,311
Who?

270
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:37,791
The talk show artist?

271
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:39,351
She has a name.

272
00:17:40,612 --> 00:17:41,311
Gu Yi.

273
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:45,392
Liang Daiwen.

274
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,751
You should know

275
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,371
that you're in no state to get involved

276
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:51,071
in an intimate relationship right now.

277
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:54,112
I'm not in love.

278
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:55,991
Nor am I planning to be.

279
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,031
She needed help, so I helped her.

280
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:00,991
Nothing more.

281
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:03,271
There are plenty of people
who need help.

282
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:05,472
Are you going to bring
every one of them home?

283
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,551
She's an adult,

284
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:09,152
not a stray cat.

285
00:18:09,892 --> 00:18:11,751
Do you know the misunderstandings

286
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:14,712
your actions might have caused for her?

287
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:18,392
You asked me to follow
what TV dramas do.

288
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:19,872
Well,

289
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,071
"Full House".

290
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:22,672
He let her stay in his house.

291
00:18:24,332 --> 00:18:25,232
Mister,

292
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:26,891
why did you think

293
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:28,991
the title is "full"

294
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:30,672
"house"?

295
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:39,712
First of all,

296
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,591
I'm happy to see that
you're open to socializing.

297
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:45,952
Even going as far as letting her
stay in your house.

298
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:47,912
This shows you're taking

299
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:50,712
the initiative to establish connections
with the outside world.

300
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:54,071
I've always encouraged you

301
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:55,672
to meet new people.

302
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:57,591
And I hope

303
00:18:57,612 --> 00:18:59,371
someone would be able to help you

304
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,311
build your trust and sense of security.

305
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:04,311
But you can't use a person
as the remedy.

306
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:06,472
That's not fair to her.

307
00:19:08,771 --> 00:19:09,991
Secondly,

308
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:10,851
I don't know

309
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:12,712
the story of you and Gu Yi.

310
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:16,271
But if the feelings aren't there,

311
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,551
you shouldn't give her false hope.

312
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:21,712
Otherwise,

313
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:24,392
both you and her
would end up getting hurt.

314
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:35,730
Got it.

315
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:36,511
Don't worry.

316
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:38,632
Can I not worry?

317
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:41,392
Anything else you want to talk about?

318
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:43,791
One more thing.

319
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:45,912
I'm planning to resign.

320
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:49,751
Planning?

321
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:51,432
Are you considering it,

322
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:53,232
or have you already decided?

323
00:19:53,771 --> 00:19:54,511
I have decided.

324
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,071
There's something else
I want to do more.

325
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:00,311
Do you think

326
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:03,232
Zhang Qingya would let you go?

327
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:08,071
A job is a two-way cooperation.

328
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:09,991
I don't have any beef with her.

329
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:12,112
She'd understand.

330
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:24,271
Why are you looking at me?

331
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:29,311
Your treatment

332
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:32,392
still has a long way to go.

333
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,311
Running away isn't going
to solve the problem.

334
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,351
Mrs. Meixia.

335
00:20:58,612 --> 00:20:59,730
Leniency to those who confess,

336
00:20:59,731 --> 00:21:01,112
severity to those who resist.

337
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:02,851
Confess what?

338
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:05,031
He's just a former colleague
who sometimes comes to help.

339
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:07,511
That's all?

340
00:21:08,612 --> 00:21:11,331
He seems to know
our family condition pretty well.

341
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:13,152
He even knows where the rice jar is.

342
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:14,651
Rubbish.

343
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:16,071
The house is only this big.

344
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:17,112
It's obvious where it is.

345
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:18,331
Besides, it's only right to treat him

346
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:19,952
for all the help he's given me.

347
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:22,751
Yeah, treat him
by making him fried hairtail?

348
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:24,690
What did you tell me when I wanted
to eat fried hairtail

349
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:25,290
last time?

350
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,571
You're the hairtail.

351
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:27,551
Really now.

352
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,811
Stupid girl,
don't smash into me so hard.

353
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,071
It hurt.

354
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:35,591
It feels soft and comfy to me.

355
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:37,672
Did you gain weight?

356
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:39,311
Watch your mouth.

357
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,751
This is not gaining weight.

358
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,472
This is gaining prosperity.

359
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:45,192
It's good to gain weight.

360
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:47,271
This youth hasn't developed
any wrinkles yet.

361
00:21:48,092 --> 00:21:50,112
You're forever youthful.

362
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,091
Mom. Whatever is going on
between you and Mr. He,

363
00:21:55,092 --> 00:21:56,872
you don't have to worry about me.

364
00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:59,351
You are in charge of your own happiness.

365
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,392
You're the one who needs to take charge
of your happiness.

366
00:22:02,491 --> 00:22:03,970
Sleep early tonight
and get up early tomorrow.

367
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:05,991
6 AM, your third aunt set up
a blind date for you.

368
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,831
Another blind date?

369
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,371
What kind of person

370
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,152
agrees to a blind date at 6 AM?

371
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:14,271
Are we supposed to go for a morning run
at the park?

372
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:17,010
If you start earlier,
you'll be able to meet a few more.

373
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:18,571
So going on blind dates is a race?

374
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:19,912
What do you think?

375
00:22:20,332 --> 00:22:21,770
Finding a suitor
isn't any less important

376
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:23,392
than building a career.

377
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,160
You may not think so now
because you're still young.

378
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,530
When you're older, you'll understand

379
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,912
why it is that the wedding day
is called the big day.

380
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:31,091
Why are you just like me,

381
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:32,392
never serious.

382
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:34,351
Telling jokes on stage?

383
00:22:34,531 --> 00:22:35,891
You'd become the joke when you're older

384
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:36,952
and unable to marry.

385
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:39,392
Now this you don't get.

386
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:40,712
Laughter

387
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:42,632
is the power of stand-up comedy.

388
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:45,112
It's life's painkiller.

389
00:22:45,971 --> 00:22:47,232
To me, your other half

390
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:48,912
is the painkiller.

391
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:51,071
Your mom is the painkiller.

392
00:22:51,451 --> 00:22:52,232
Go to sleep.

393
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,551
Morning...

394
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:26,232
(This is where I was born and raised.)

395
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:28,872
(A place that has yet
to be a hot spot,)

396
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,811
(nor will it ever be.)

397
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:32,192
(An 18-tier town.)

398
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:34,152
(Ragged.)

399
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:35,472
(Old.)

400
00:23:36,051 --> 00:23:38,831
(Filled with the trivialities
and family matters.)

401
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,050
(It's raised me, my parents,)

402
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:42,450
(my third aunt)

403
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:43,672
(and several relatives.)

404
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:46,730
(People working in big cities
are regarded)

405
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:48,591
(as urban scavengers
by their relatives.)

406
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:50,331
(So every time I returned home,)

407
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:51,931
(they'd come up with all sorts of ideas)

408
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,591
(to get me out of the rut.)

409
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:56,112
(As for how...)

410
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,210
My eldest niece!

411
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:01,651
Third Aunt.

412
00:24:01,652 --> 00:24:03,371
I've brought you two potential suitors.

413
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:04,970
Come on, you're in a hurry, right?

414
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:06,071
Well, go on then.

415
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:07,490
Go.

416
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:07,931
Mom...

417
00:24:07,932 --> 00:24:08,872
Don't just stand there.

418
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:10,712
What's the matter, Meixia?

419
00:24:10,771 --> 00:24:12,952
How is she supposed to handle two guys?

420
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:15,010
Well, she can choose whom she likes.

421
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:16,530
You can't do this even if time is tight.

422
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:17,611
She should meet one at a time.

423
00:24:17,612 --> 00:24:19,152
Having to meet two at once
would be so awkward.

424
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,563
(Van Gogh Manor)

425
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:32,912
You're back.

426
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:35,192
Yes.

427
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:42,912
What are you doing?

428
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:44,271
Can't you see?

429
00:24:46,412 --> 00:24:47,511
Yes, I see.

430
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:50,152
Why can't you talk like a proper human?

431
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:54,791
There are foods I bought in the fridge.

432
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:55,952
Help yourself.

433
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:04,411
Anti-oxidants.

434
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:05,551
Strengthen the immune system.

435
00:25:05,731 --> 00:25:06,831
Anti-tumor.

436
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:08,071
Lower cholesterol.

437
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,171
Well,

438
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:12,271
what a way of life.

439
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,672
Are these gifts to welcome me back?

440
00:25:17,372 --> 00:25:19,331
Gifts that can be bought with money

441
00:25:19,332 --> 00:25:20,351
are simple and crude.

442
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:21,970
One shouldn't read too much

443
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:23,271
into it.

444
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:26,392
Most people feel happy
when they see presents.

445
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:28,171
If they see a nice shopping bag,

446
00:25:28,172 --> 00:25:29,791
they think it's
a carefully-selected item.

447
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:31,912
In fact, it's because
the seller prepared it.

448
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:33,351
Aesthetic marketing.

449
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:35,551
Mr. Liang.

450
00:25:35,852 --> 00:25:37,530
At this time, all you had to do
was shut your mouth

451
00:25:37,531 --> 00:25:39,791
and say, yes.

452
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:41,551
How do I say yes if my mouth is shut?

453
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:44,511
Then just shut your mouth.

454
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:22,152
Why did you shout
when I knocked my head?

455
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:23,912
Because it was loud.

456
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:42,472
What... What are you doing?

457
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:45,991
Patting the head.

458
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:52,271
Pat the head, no more dread.

459
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:06,912
Are you going to clean up or me?

460
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:11,611
I just brushed the cat

461
00:27:11,612 --> 00:27:12,751
so I want to clean up.

462
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,551
You go ahead.

463
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:27,831
Away with these unpure thoughts!

464
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:55,392
Working out

465
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:57,311
and exercising

466
00:28:58,011 --> 00:29:01,351
are good for the body.

467
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:04,271
Fruits

468
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:06,751
and vegetables

469
00:29:08,892 --> 00:29:10,632
are

470
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:13,472
treasures.

471
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,572
(Van Gogh Manor)

472
00:30:06,332 --> 00:30:07,432
Liang Daiwen.

473
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,311
Liang Daiwen.

474
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:19,551
Liang...

475
00:31:30,623 --> 00:31:33,643
(Nextmonday)

476
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:36,490
This time, the public account's tweet

477
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:37,632
is a topic essay,

478
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,152
fashion in film and television.

479
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,392
We'll select 10 films

480
00:31:41,572 --> 00:31:43,031
and do an in-depth analysis.

481
00:31:43,412 --> 00:31:45,271
The films shouldn't be a rip-off,

482
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:46,872
and the tone should be elegant.

483
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,490
For instance,

484
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:49,450
it has to show off

485
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:51,091
the different fashion styles

486
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:52,152
in different eras.

487
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:55,351
You can choose from movies
with different historical backgrounds.

488
00:31:55,491 --> 00:31:57,250
Such as lace and chiffon

489
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:58,171
or

490
00:31:58,172 --> 00:31:59,331
elements showcasing nobility

491
00:31:59,332 --> 00:32:01,651
from the Victorian period.

492
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:03,131
Or you can find dark
and mysterious elements

493
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:03,651
in Gothic films.

494
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:04,530
Jacqueline is acting weird.

495
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:07,171
Or maybe rock-n-roll
from the 60s and 70s.

496
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:08,472
You have no idea.

497
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:09,672
For such essays,

498
00:32:09,892 --> 00:32:11,411
we'll have to review films.

499
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:12,392
Then compile images,

500
00:32:12,412 --> 00:32:13,851
and even get
the posters' publishing rights

501
00:32:13,852 --> 00:32:15,351
from the production companies.

502
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:16,770
It's a lot of work.

503
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:18,050
You'll basically be working overtime,

504
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:19,271
so no one wants to do it.

505
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:23,031
This tweet is relatively simple
to execute.

506
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:24,511
That's all the requirements.

507
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,031
Who will do it?

508
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:28,432
(Shall we have dinner at home tonight?)

509
00:32:28,898 --> 00:32:29,930
(Yes.)

510
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:31,271
Yes!

511
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:32,991
Gu Yi,

512
00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:34,192
you'll do it.

513
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:37,591
Is there a problem?

514
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:40,031
I have a question.

515
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:43,392
I'm doing an exclusive
with a band this afternoon.

516
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:44,530
You should assign me

517
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:45,891
the best editor to write the manuscript

518
00:32:45,892 --> 00:32:46,751
for this first issue.

519
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,050
The music column's first issue.

520
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,112
The interview has to be good.

521
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:53,791
Gu Yi, you'll go help Xu Guanrui.

522
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:55,472
Okay.

523
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:57,472
Then,

524
00:32:57,491 --> 00:32:58,591
who's going to do it?

525
00:32:59,531 --> 00:33:00,392
Zhi?

526
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,472
I think Penny will do a good job.

527
00:33:22,092 --> 00:33:22,891
I'm so sorry

528
00:33:22,892 --> 00:33:23,751
for being late.

529
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:25,351
It's okay, we're just early.

530
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:26,591
We started chatting.

531
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:28,751
Okay, let me grab a chair.

532
00:33:29,852 --> 00:33:30,751
Your girlfriend?

533
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:32,672
My comrade.

534
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:33,872
Let me introduce her.

535
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:34,632
Gu Yi.

536
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:36,050
Hello, hello.

537
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:36,672
Hi.

538
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:38,530
Let me find the interview outline.

539
00:33:38,531 --> 00:33:39,250
No rush.

540
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,751
So you guys are doing...

541
00:33:41,372 --> 00:33:42,311
Still the same stuff.

542
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,450
There will be several shows abroad.

543
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:46,730
Still doing offline shows, yes?

544
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:47,432
Yes.

545
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:48,091
Here,

546
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:48,952
take a look.

547
00:33:50,011 --> 00:33:51,250
Okay, after you have a look through,

548
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:52,551
we can begin the interview.

549
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:53,551
Alright? Okay.

550
00:33:53,771 --> 00:33:55,511
Today, we'll be mostly

551
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:57,050
talking about

552
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:58,351
your new album, Blooming.

553
00:33:58,652 --> 00:33:59,891
I've listened to the album

554
00:33:59,892 --> 00:34:00,991
and I think it's great.

555
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:02,131
After listening to the songs,

556
00:34:02,132 --> 00:34:02,912
I'm curious

557
00:34:03,211 --> 00:34:03,770
to know

558
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:05,232
if certain events transpired to...

559
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:44,331
Okay, that about concludes

560
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,411
the interview today.

561
00:34:45,412 --> 00:34:46,050
Thank you both.

562
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:46,931
Thank you.

563
00:34:46,932 --> 00:34:47,490
Thank you.

564
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:48,471
Thank you.

565
00:34:48,532 --> 00:34:50,211
The fact that Mr. Xu chose
to do an interview with us

566
00:34:50,212 --> 00:34:51,672
is like we got a lesson for free.

567
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:52,851
No, you flatter me.

568
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:54,811
I only know a few chords.

569
00:34:54,812 --> 00:34:56,871
Compared to you guys,
I'm just a keyboardist.

570
00:34:57,372 --> 00:34:58,291
You're too humble.

571
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:00,512
We heard about your skills. Here.

572
00:35:00,571 --> 00:35:01,490
I'm no good.

573
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:01,891
Show us.

574
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,152
- I haven't played in a long time.
- Play us something.

575
00:35:04,412 --> 00:35:04,992
Okay.

576
00:35:13,852 --> 00:35:14,672
Heard this before?

577
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:15,951
Nokia.

578
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:17,032
Yes.

579
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:19,152
When I was studying abroad,

580
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:21,672
almost everyone used
Sony Ericsson phones.

581
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:22,871
Or Sharp.

582
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:24,871
I was the only one using a Nokia.

583
00:35:25,412 --> 00:35:27,130
I would stay up late talking about music

584
00:35:27,131 --> 00:35:28,672
and dreams with a girl.

585
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:30,951
Later, the girl

586
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:32,032
became a mother,

587
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:33,291
and yet here I am

588
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:34,911
still feeling attached
to the Nokia jingle.

589
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:36,271
Do you guys

590
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:37,490
have any jingles or tunes

591
00:35:37,491 --> 00:35:38,632
that you just can't forget?

592
00:35:39,252 --> 00:35:39,831
Yes.

593
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:42,771
My family used to sing nursery rhymes
to me when I was little.

594
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:43,970
We sampled them

595
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:45,512
and used them in our album.

596
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:48,592
That's where I got the inspiration.

597
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:09,791
Excuse me.

598
00:36:12,812 --> 00:36:13,552
Yes, sir?

599
00:36:14,692 --> 00:36:16,152
I'm looking for an indigo bowl.

600
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:17,471
What color?

601
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:19,072
Indigo.

602
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:20,831
Won't indigo

603
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:22,751
affect one's appetite?

604
00:36:26,091 --> 00:36:27,112
A little I guess.

605
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:30,271
But she wants an indigo bowl.

606
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:38,211
Can you find it for me?

607
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:38,911
Thanks.

608
00:36:41,051 --> 00:36:42,032
I'll scan yours.

609
00:36:42,051 --> 00:36:42,570
Thanks.

610
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:43,512
Thanks for your patronage.

611
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,871
Good job today, Mr. Xu.

612
00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:48,992
Thank you for getting me
out of a pickle today.

613
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:50,152
You're welcome.

614
00:36:50,332 --> 00:36:51,152
How will you thank me?

615
00:36:52,971 --> 00:36:54,032
Buy me a meal.

616
00:36:54,051 --> 00:36:55,672
I know a really good place.

617
00:36:56,892 --> 00:36:57,891
Maybe not today.

618
00:36:57,892 --> 00:36:59,592
I want to go home and recuperate today.

619
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:00,351
Next time.

620
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:01,871
Is that a deal?

621
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:03,871
It's a deal.

622
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:05,112
Okay.

623
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:05,970
I'll be off, bye-bye.

624
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:06,911
Bye-bye.

625
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:09,271
Ride safe.

626
00:38:35,932 --> 00:38:37,192
I'm back.

627
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:49,871
What is... this?

628
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:51,311
What you wanted.

629
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:52,311
An indigo bowl.

630
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,391
Liang Daiwen.

631
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:01,592
Did you download some sequence
into your brain?

632
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:03,351
You really do as you're told, huh?

633
00:39:04,372 --> 00:39:06,271
You need to learn
to read in between the lines.

634
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:10,951
I went to a few shops
before I finally found it.

635
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:30,471
Want some?

636
00:39:34,491 --> 00:39:35,431
Pour it in my bowl.

637
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:00,951
That's a whiskey stone.

638
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:04,351
Spit it out.

639
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:31,391
