Yi,

39
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:55,630
Guan Xingxin is brutal.

40
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,300
When the hotel room video was uploaded,

41
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,840
it became so popular
that it was on the Hot Search.

She's something else.

46

She dropped two bombshells at one time.

Hello, everyone. I'm Daodao.

52
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,431
You did a great job.

53
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,751
I thought it was a bit hasty.

54
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,180
What about you?

55
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:04,910
When do you plan to make a comeback?

56
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,991
I'll wait for a little longer.

57
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,711
The world has been
too treacherous lately.

58
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,031
I'm in no mood to tell jokes.

59
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,270
Liang Daiwen and Guan Xingxin
came together last time.

60
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:18,791
What's their relationship?

61
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:24,080
They're friends who block each other's
romantic prospects.

62
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,270
Aren't they an item?

63
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,191
They aren't.

64
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:31,470
You don't need to worry about me.

65
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,390
I'm worried about myself.

66
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,231
I'm going to court her.

67
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,111
Huh?

68
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:44,871
I'm going to court her.

69
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,070
I wish you success.

(Van Gogh Manor)

71
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,680
Are you doing a scientific experiment?

72
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,950
I'm cooking.

73
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,991
Why are you preparing dog food?

74
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,070
This is our dinner.

75
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,791
Oil is less dense than water.

76
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,630
If you pour water into a hot pan,

77
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,751
oil will continue to burn
on the surface of the water.

78
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:22,871
The impact will cause oil to splatter.

79
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,231
Next time, remember to cover the lid.

80
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,231
Did you scald yourself?

81
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,871
You'll remember the lesson if you did.

82
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,320
I still wish to live here
for a few more years, you know?

83
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:41,980
(You may be a decent being,)

84
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,150
(but your insults are like no other.)

85
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,590
Let me do it.

86
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:07,510
Didn't you say that you couldn't cook?

87
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,911
What?

88
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,940
Seems like you're not sweating.
That's good.

89
00:07:44,941 --> 00:07:45,911
That's pretty good.

90
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,351
You think I'm performing surgery here?

91
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:51,191
Good question.

92
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,699
(As long as I don't feel awkward,)

93
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,911
(you'll be the awkward one.)

94
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,630
Hand it to me.

95
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,710
What do you mean?

96
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,950
The bowl. What else do you think?

97
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,470
The bowl, huh?

98
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,630
The bowl.

99
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:26,751
It's...

100
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,551
It's so salty.

101
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,710
Why is it this salty?

102
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,511
Yeah. Why is it this salty?

103
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:45,590
I only put a pinch of salt.

104
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,579
You already dropped half a can of ham
into the porridge.

105
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,830
Did you put salt after that?

106
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:51,830
Ham is already salty in the first place.

107
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:05,382
(Is ham salty?)

108
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:09,672
(It is. Ham is the cured
or smoked leg of an animal with salt.)

109
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:10,940
You see?

110
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,191
I didn't lie to you, right?

111
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,431
Is this wheelchair a project of yours?

112
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,710
It's an inclusive design.

113
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:26,191
Recently, I've been working on home
and smart products for people with disabilities.

114
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,391
Wow.

115
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,311
You're an artist, huh?

116
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,230
Nope.

117
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:36,391
An artist's creation heavily
relies on talent and emotion.

118
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:39,710
We focus more on making
human-centered designs for products.

119
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:42,440
There's an established set of rules.
It's not considered art.

120
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:48,830
You're flattering me for no reason.

121
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:51,120
Do you intend to ask me for a favor?

122
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,431
Yeah.

123
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,990
Actually, I do
have something to ask you.

124
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,459
Do you know about
Guan Xingxin's views on love

125
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,911
and her criteria for choosing a partner?

126
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,391
Guan Xingxin?

127
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,990
That's right.

128
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:14,990
A friend of mine wanted to know.

129
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:22,551
For Guan Xingxin,

130
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,710
she only loves
the notion of love itself.

131
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,631
What does that mean?

132
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,391
Mr. Chen and Mrs. Chen

133
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,031
wanted me to go on blind dates
and get a husband.

134
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:45,271
But after the hotel room video
was uploaded,

135
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,551
they stopped answering my calls.

136
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:50,990
Mr. Chen said

137
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,791
Mrs. Chen hid at home and
didn't dare to leave the house.

138
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,870
She felt that her daughter
was too disgraceful.

139
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:58,511
She couldn't stop crying.

140
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,031
So, this is your goal.

141
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:05,590
You take revenge on all those
who were in a relationship with you.

142
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:09,859
I didn't need to suffer
this much humiliation

143
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,710
if I only did it
to take revenge on them.

144
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,470
I just hate it
when people try to control me.

145
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:22,110
No matter if it's getting married
at my hometown or working at Nextmonday,

146
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,040
I don't feel like doing anything
that I don't feel like doing.

147
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:31,271
Tell me, then.
What do you feel like doing now?

148
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,470
I'll continue doing live streams
and dating other people.

149
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,070
Although I have a questionable past,

150
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,830
I still desire the love of many.

151
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:52,631
Getting into a relationship
is easy for you.

152
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,380
But are you sure

153
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,791
a relationship is what you need?

154
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,191
Shen,

155
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,819
I don't like it

156
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,870
when a psychotherapist like you
asks me rhetorical questions.

157
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,750
Alright. I'll put it
in the form of a statement.

158
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,110
From the perspective
of Emotion Focused Therapy,

159
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,830
what you need isn't a relationship.

160
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:21,710
Instead, you need to accept yourself
and console yourself.

161
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:22,710
Understood?

162
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,391
You should find
someone trustworthy for now.

163
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,511
Are you sleeping on the sofa tonight?

164
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,191
I...

165
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,911
I don't occupy much space.

166
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,191
Sorry about that.

167
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,830
I didn't know that you would sleep here.

168
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:31,031
So,

169
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:33,271
I'll go and get changed.

170
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:35,070
You can continue sleeping.

171
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:13,130
(Gu Yi: Mr. Yu, do you know how it feels
to reach a crucial moment in one's daydream?)

172
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:21,022
(Yu Dule: Breaking down because the assets
are missing when you render them?)

173
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:26,363
(Gu Yi: What a strong sense of immersion.)

174
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,911
Is it embarrassing?

175
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,600
If embarrassment
is a parabolic trajectory,

176
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,710
I've been thrown to the peak of that parabola
by Liang Daiwen several times already.

177
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:57,431
You see, Liang Daiwen

178
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:59,710
is just like a high-ranking monk.

179
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:01,950
His character setting wouldn't be right

180
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:03,511
if he didn't abstain from women.

181
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,511
That's a great joke. I'll jot it down.

182
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,950
No.

183
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:09,350
I shouldn't talk about him here.

184
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,940
He's almost a regular at Ounce now.

185
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:13,311
If he hears about it,

186
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,350
he might take it personally.

187
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:19,710
What do you mean by
taking it personally?

188
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,300
He already brought you home, you know?

189
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:23,311
Can you please be proactive for once?

190
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,791
What if he kicks me out of the house?

191
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,950
I don't wish to part with his sofa yet.

192
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,260
If so, you should go all the way,

193
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:33,660
win Liang Daiwen's heart,

194
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:35,300
and become the sofa's female owner.

195
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:36,900
Even if you two do
get a divorce one day,

196
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,431
you can share it with him
by sawing it in half.

197
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,551
Yule, look at my face.

198
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,870
What's wrong? Is your expression frozen?

199
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:48,191
Frozen?

200
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,940
At this moment, if tears flow from my eyes,
there'll be a total of four streams.

201
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:54,431
I think I can flood the room
with my tears.

202
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:55,950
What do you mean by that?

203
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,680
You don't get it? Forget it.

204
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,350
But speaking of which,

205
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,230
even if your assets are missing,

206
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,019
I don't think he's a disabled person,
am I right?

207
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,259
What are you saying?
Don't teach me all that nonsense.

208
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,660
I'm not trying to be someone like this.

209
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,631
What kind of character
are you trying to be, then?

210
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:12,259
An intelligent girl.

211
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,710
You don't have any intelligence.

212
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,871
Really?

213
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:19,019
Is she intelligent?

214
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,871
Just look at him.

215
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:25,270
I couldn't care less.

216
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,710
But I understood something.

217
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,900
It's not that he didn't laugh
because I wasn't funny.

218
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:33,200
It's because he couldn't understand
how funny I was for the time being.

219
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,391
What does that mean?

220
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,710
Anyway, I, Gu Yi,

221
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,270
the top female comedian at Ounce,

222
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:45,580
am going to Liang Daiwen's

223
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:47,470
accessibility designer in the future.

224
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,030
I'm even more confused now.

225
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,710
Could you understand her?

226
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,030
You see?

227
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,391
Try to be more intelligent next time.

228
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,270
Sexy Yu.

229
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,739
Speaking of sexy,

230
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,550
I do excel in that field.

231
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:04,431
I'm out of alcohol.

232
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:05,790
Duo, get me another bottle.

233
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:06,750
That's enough.

234
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,831
I'll be fine.

235
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,191
You're back.

236
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:57,230
Yeah.

237
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,871
Are you heading out?

238
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:02,840
I have a business trip.

239
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:05,019
I am working on
an accessibility modification plan

240
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,470
for a new five-star hotel.

241
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,191
I need to be there by tomorrow morning.

242
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:12,071
What's wrong with you?

243
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,191
My hair is getting long.

244
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,080
Are there any other barber shops
still open around here?

245
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:20,900
It's already 11 P.M.

246
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:22,351
All of the shops are closed.

247
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,460
They'll be going against the labor law
if they operate until now.

248
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,950
But the convenience stores
should be open.

249
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,831
Why don't I buy a hair clipper for you?

250
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:30,710
I'll give you a haircut.

251
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:31,391
No need for that.

252
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,391
I have one.

253
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:07,831
Why are you avoiding me?

254
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,151
I haven't even started yet.

255
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:11,071
I feel a chill on my back.

256
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,191
Don't worry. I'm a veteran.

257
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,631
When I was studying, our school didn't
allow us to retain long hair.

258
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,071
I always gave myself a haircut
with a clipper.

259
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:24,219
For some reason, I don't think

260
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,270
my hair is that long.

261
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,790
I've already come up
with a hairstyle for you.

262
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,831
I'll help you to trim the back first.

263
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,071
As for your bangs,
I'll trim it a little.

264
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:38,539
Do you prefer layered bangs

265
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,831
or straight bangs?

266
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:42,680
Just get it done quickly.

267
00:20:58,941 --> 00:20:59,790

That's a burden to me.

It's fine.

Taking you in?

285
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,270
Do you think I see you as a weak person?

286
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,550
That's not true.

287
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:40,710
I'm just providing you
with some assistance.

288
00:22:43,581 --> 00:22:45,019
If so, can I know

289
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,071
how many people
you've provided assistance to?

290
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,151
Were all of them girls?

291
00:22:53,821 --> 00:22:55,631
Are you testing me to see
if I'm a pervert?

292
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,140
That's not it.

293
00:22:57,141 --> 00:23:00,030
I'm just testing
your level of intelligence.

294
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,111
Including you, I've helped
a total of girls.

295
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:06,030
The first girl was Guan Xingxin.

296
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:08,030
The second girl was
a coursemate of mine.

297
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:11,550
Her roommates ganged up on her just
because she came from the countryside.

298
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,911
I helped her pay the rent for a while.

299
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,591
She repaid me the money
after she started working.

300
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,990
We didn't keep in touch.

301
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,100
Do you help out everyone

302
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,470
who looks pitiful to you?

303
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:25,710
Do you treat everyone the same?

304
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,270
I'll tell you this again.

333
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,111

She's doing much better now.

337
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,431
She told me

338
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,871
that you organized
the statement for her

339
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,030
and threw away the parcels
at her doorstep.

340
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,550
Thank you.

341
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,111
Don't mention it.

342
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,470
She also

343
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:06,750
told me something about you.

344
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:12,710
It's emotional dysregulation, right?

345
00:26:15,101 --> 00:26:16,071
She told me about it.

346
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:20,710
She didn't tell you anything else,
right?

347
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,710
That's right.

348
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,831
I was worried that you might not
want me to find out.

349
00:26:27,101 --> 00:26:28,391
That's why I didn't tell you about it.

350
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:29,990
Sorry about that.

351
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:32,111
When we were having a meal,

352
00:26:34,141 --> 00:26:35,431
you asked me if I felt uncomfortable

353
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,071
because I was sick.

354
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,750
I might not know
how to answer your question

355
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:42,351
if the phone call wasn't cut off.

356
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,431
I don't like to lie.

357
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:50,071
And, I don't think that it's embarrassing
to have emotional dysregulation.

358
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,351
But for some reason,

359
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:56,710
I didn't want you to find out.

360
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,950
Is it because

361
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,071
I'm special to you?

362
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,710
What's so special about you?

363
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,710
Back then, you said

364
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,030
sarcasm is not the same as prejudice.

365
00:27:22,661 --> 00:27:24,230
When Guan Xingxin was in trouble,

366
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,640
you didn't develop
any prejudice against her.

367
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:29,400
Therefore, I hope you won't develop

368
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,351
prejudice against
my emotional dysregulation.

369
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,030
I promise I won't.

370
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,631
May I know

371
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,631
what you're feeling?

372
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,911
You mean now?

373
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,760
I mean, what you always felt.

374
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:52,550
I can't put it in words.

375
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,391
Even so, that doesn't mean
you didn't feel anything.

376
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,230
You should have felt something

377
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,191
when Guan Xingxin was in trouble,

378
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:04,750
right?

379
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:09,831
I'm just curious about your feelings.

380
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:11,900
Actually, there were moments

381
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:13,510
when I couldn't feel anything either.

382
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,351
According to my personal experience,

383
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,071
it was a terrible feeling.

384
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,950
Being unable to feel
is actually more painful.

385
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:24,979
You came to Ounce

386
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,431
so that the shows here could help you
to guide your emotions.

387
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:29,820
But I think my set

388
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:31,431
didn't work on you.

389
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:36,660
Actually, I've encountered
many situations

390
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:38,270
where the audience didn't
react to my jokes.

391
00:28:38,621 --> 00:28:40,019
But none felt as defeating

392
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,270
as the moments you didn't laugh

393
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,871
during my sets.

394
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:49,151
I've already
explained the reason to you.

395
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,071
Now, you know the reason.

396
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,320
It's emotional dysregulation, right?
I understand.

397
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,431
It's not your fault.
It's not my fault either.

398
00:28:57,181 --> 00:29:00,230
But I'm telling you all these

399
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,351
because I still want to make you laugh.

400
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:08,310
I wish to make you laugh
through your emotional dysregulation.

(describing, and interpreting one's own

to establish social connections.)

419

(For example, they cannot)

420
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,871
(empathize with the feelings of others.)

421

with that person.)

424
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,790
(Anyway, they give the impression
of being different)

425
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:25,431
(and out of sync with society.)

426
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:27,871
(It's as if they come from a world
