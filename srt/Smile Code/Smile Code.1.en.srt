00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,916
I beg your pardon.

26
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:23,796
Well,

27
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,596
my reception isn't good here.

28
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,156
Could you please repeat that?

29
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:32,916
Which session needs amendments?

30
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:43,356
Okay.

31
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:44,716
Wait.

32
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:45,855
Please give me a moment.

33
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:47,836
I'll find a place to fix it.
Is that okay?

34
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:49,635
Okay.

35
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:52,995
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:54,515
It's all right.

Where's my earphone?

Where's my earphone?

39
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:05,356
Good grief.

40
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:55,499
Any fun stories to share?

00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,415
(Shen Zhimin)

42
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,596
Nothing much fun.

43
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:00,515
I've read through your report.

44
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:02,615
Except for the dates,

45
00:07:02,616 --> 00:07:04,195
everything is just repeating.

46
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:07,195
If you're not doing that
to brush me off,

47
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:08,836
it means

48
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,935
your current
cognitive behavioral therapy

49
00:07:10,936 --> 00:07:12,396
isn't making any progress.

50
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:15,836
The series isn't working for me, though.

51
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:16,916
Not working for you?

52
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:18,195
What did you watch instead?

53
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:20,796
Professor Do, the alien.

54
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,175
Oh, come on.

55
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,374
You should pay attention
to the caring type.

56
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,735
Professor Do

57
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:28,396
is more stoic than you are.

61
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:42,236
All right. I'm hanging up.

62
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:45,635
Remember to watch the show
I got for you.

63
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:48,095
Stand-up comedy has a stronger
emotional impact

64
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,195
than dramas.

65
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,615
Feel emotions
before you can express them.

66
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:53,875

68
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:00,635
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

69
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:03,755
It's nothing serious.

70
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:06,195
I just want to know if you're busy.

71
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,635
Can you come back to visit your dad?

72
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:11,055
(Madam)
He hasn't been feeling well lately.

73
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,515
(Madam)
He just had a checkup,

74
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:13,836
and he keeps mentioning you.

75
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:14,956
All right.

76
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:22,196
I'm talking to you.

77
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:23,716
Yes, you.

78
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:25,236
Come.

79
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,755
Stop here.

80
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:28,795
Be careful.

81
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:32,995
Please hear me out, officer.

82
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:34,596
I didn't steal this bike.

83
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:36,814
I owned it three years ago.

84
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:37,854
Except for the bike lock,

85
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:39,316
everything else is mine.

86
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:41,956
I have a record on
the second-hand selling platform.

87
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:43,015
Please have a look.

88
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,596
Did I say you stole it?

89
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:46,676
Did I say the bike isn't yours?

90
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:48,694
Then why did you stop me?

91
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:50,515
You're using the non-motorized lane.

92
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:51,716
You're being fined.

93
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,015
Is it wrong for a bike

94
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:57,035
to use the non-motorized lane?

95
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,356
Was the bike moving?

96
00:09:58,575 --> 00:09:59,676
Were the wheels moving?

97
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:01,236
It's your legs that are moving.

98
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:03,055
Look around here.

99
00:10:03,056 --> 00:10:04,295
They are all motorcycles.

100
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:05,476
It's dangerous.

101
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,836
If there's any mistake,
you'll disrupt public safety.

102
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:08,875
Get your identity card out.

104
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:13,115
Gu Yi?

105
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,556
What an interesting name.

106
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:17,035
The fine is fifty yuan.

107
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:19,556
Thirty.

108
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:21,875
Seriously?

109
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:23,236
Are you bargaining?

110
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:25,236
How about thirty-five?

111
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:26,755
Fifty.

112
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,175
You can pay the fine,

113
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:29,454
or go to the station with me.

114
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:30,236
Make your choice.

115
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:33,734
Don't repeat the same mistake.

116
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:34,614
Be careful.

117
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:35,356
Over there.

118
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,076
Can you see the turn up ahead?

119
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:38,956
You'll see a lock service
right after the turn.

120
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:42,814
Stop your car.

121
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,676
Stop.

122
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:53,614
Sir,

123
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:54,494
thank you so much.

124
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:56,334
You saved my life.

125
00:10:56,335 --> 00:10:57,055
Thankfully,

126
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,415
you stopped me.

127
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,454
If you had been a second late,

128
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,175
it wouldn't have just been
the car passing by.

129
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:03,515
Well, stop joking with me.

130
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:05,655
If you have nothing else, leave now.

131
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:06,196
Over there.

132
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:08,236
Take a turn and you'll see
the lock service, okay?

133
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,356
Okay.

134
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:10,755

my mom has been very strict with me.

whenever I made a mistake,

176

I'd have to kneel and face the wall
to reflect.

00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,854
Once, my dad couldn't stand it anymore,

178
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:13,676
he said,

I didn't dare to move.

182
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:18,596
Then my dad said,

183
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:20,295
"Does my word

184
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:22,395
not matter at all now?"

why don't you stand up?"

00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,755
At least 1.85 meters tall,

190
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,556
toned body,

191
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:32,995
wearing famous brands.

192
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:36,155
He's too handsome to be
in the stand-up comedy show.

193
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:37,316
Why?

194
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,516
Are you interested in him?

195
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:40,676
I'm not good enough for him.

196
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,395
Luckily, you have a healthy self-regard.

197
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:44,596
Next time,

198
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:46,814
you can carry my mom in your arms

199
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:48,375
and take her out.

200
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:49,956
I've been observing him.

201
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:52,356
My second-hand camera

202
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,716
is enough to capture his long face
in extremely high definition.

203
00:15:55,136 --> 00:15:58,115
He's such an eyesore to the performers,
sitting in the first row, not moving.

204
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:00,854
We called this kind of person
a "stand-up assassin".

205
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:01,415
Believe me,

206
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,476
don't mess with him.

207
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:07,196
I like messing
with those stand-up assassins.

208
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,956
Do you know what my target was

209
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:12,895
while riding here?

210
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:14,596
Make more money,
and make fewer stupid mistakes.

211
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:18,196
I'll work harder,

live every happy moment,

213
00:16:20,376 --> 00:16:21,515
and

214
00:16:21,735 --> 00:16:25,035
make everyone here laugh tonight.

Hi!

218
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:39,915
Perhaps some of you are curious

219
00:16:39,936 --> 00:16:41,255
about why I'm wearing

220
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,035
this loud, red dress today.

221
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:45,076
Am I too desperate to get attention?

222
00:16:47,016 --> 00:16:48,436
Well, yes.

223
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,275
My red dress is hard to ignore.

224
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:55,196
Even a car stopped
when I was crossing the road earlier.

225
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:57,556
It's good, anyway.

226
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,035
Had I worn a green dress,

227
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:01,836
the car would've run me over.

228
00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:19,396
You came here to watch the show
on a workday.

229

No.

do you have a job?

233
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:31,275
It's your first time here, right?

234
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:34,035
You didn't expect to get picked
sitting on the front row?

235
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:35,315
It's fine.

236
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:37,716

00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:45,974
That's fine.

than my light diet lifestyle, right?

with the existing one like Layla?

366

During live streams,

367
00:26:52,055 --> 00:26:53,415
she normally sings, chats,

368
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:55,494
and sometimes gives relationship advice.

369
00:26:55,495 --> 00:26:57,075
Her audience is broad.

370
00:26:57,455 --> 00:26:58,716
But there's one problem.

371
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:01,515
Tianhe's management
of its virtual performers is loose.

372
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:03,636
Their marketing is
poorly planned at times.

373
00:27:03,775 --> 00:27:05,214
They don't make clarifications

374
00:27:05,215 --> 00:27:06,755
even when there's negative news.

375
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:08,676
So if we collaborate with them,

376
00:27:08,856 --> 00:27:10,716
we need to be strict
about their artists' reputations.

377
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:11,835
All right.

378
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:13,995
You'll deal with Tianhe.

379
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:15,636
Forget about Guan Xingxin.

380
00:27:15,656 --> 00:27:16,716
Choose someone else.

381
00:27:17,096 --> 00:27:18,795
Top-tier live-streamers are difficult
to manage.

382
00:27:21,295 --> 00:27:22,716
Let me try.

383
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:26,595
Get back to your work.

384
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:35,483
(Accessible Handrail Donation)

385
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:44,476
Mr. Zhou,

386
00:27:45,376 --> 00:27:47,595
have the accessible handrails
donated by Xinya

387
00:27:48,656 --> 00:27:50,035
been helpful?

388
00:27:53,735 --> 00:27:55,375
The targeted subsidy program

389
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:56,880
launched by
the Disabled Persons Federation

390
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,595
is announced on the news.

391
00:27:58,255 --> 00:28:00,795
(Qiguang Special Education School)
A few design companies came by

392
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:03,236
to check on the accessible handrails
you donated.

393
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:04,595
The media also asked about

394
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,636
what other support we might need.

395
00:28:07,215 --> 00:28:08,335
The thing is,

396
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:09,835
there aren't many kids here
who use them,

397
00:28:10,176 --> 00:28:11,916
so we're not sure what to tell them.

398
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:15,315
I've looked around.

399
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:16,755
You may need

400
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:17,876
connecting corridors,

401
00:28:18,055 --> 00:28:18,876
ramps,

402
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:20,196
sliding doors,

403
00:28:20,295 --> 00:28:21,275
and lifts.

404
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:22,355
I'll jot that down.

405
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,035
I'm sorry.

406
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,555
I'll report it to the company

407
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:29,236
and request more facilities.

408
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,400
We'll also modify the handrails
to fit the load-bearing tracks.

409
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,040
It'll be easier for students
to use the staircases.

410
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:35,876
You don't have to apologize.

411
00:28:35,896 --> 00:28:37,095
We're very glad

412
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:38,476
that someone is willing to help.

413
00:28:39,495 --> 00:28:41,636
It's a common challenge
in special education.

414
00:28:42,215 --> 00:28:44,694
We have over thirty students here.

415
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:47,156
Each of them has different
physical or intellectual disabilities.

416
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:49,515
We're facing problems
more than we can expect.

417
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:51,196
It's always better

418
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:52,676
to have handrails than none at all.

419
00:28:58,376 --> 00:28:59,995
People who have never experienced

420
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:02,595
the life of a disabled person
will never understand.

421
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:11,156
Let's go to the front and take a look.

422
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,716
The editing is fine,

423
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:26,275
but the thing is,

424
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:27,835
it lacks some vibes.

425
00:29:28,455 --> 00:29:29,355
What do you think,

426
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:30,956
director?

427
00:29:32,975 --> 00:29:34,035
True.

428
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:35,935
That's what I think.

429
00:29:35,936 --> 00:29:37,396
It's missing

430
00:29:37,896 --> 00:29:39,676
some content and depth.

431
00:29:40,975 --> 00:29:42,315
That's just my opinion.

432
00:29:42,695 --> 00:29:45,956
How about we get someone to write
a few touching quotes

433
00:29:46,096 --> 00:29:47,156
and

434
00:29:47,455 --> 00:29:48,795
add some music?

435
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:52,476
Sure. We can consider it.

436
00:29:55,735 --> 00:29:56,476
Hello?

437
00:29:56,576 --> 00:29:57,655
What are you doing?

438
00:29:57,656 --> 00:29:59,156
Why didn't you reply to my message?

439
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:02,355
I'll talk to you later.

440
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,355

The monitor reflects light.

442
00:30:09,616 --> 00:30:10,916
I saw you rolling your eyes.

443
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,156
Be careful.

444
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:14,676
We're coursemates, you know?

445
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,555
Why did you introduce
such a stupid client to me?

446
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:19,876
You should learn from him instead.

447
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:21,655
Do you know who his girlfriend is?

448
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:23,014
I don't care.
It has nothing to do with me.

449
00:30:23,015 --> 00:30:23,876
It's Layla.

450
00:30:24,535 --> 00:30:25,515

but she's famous now.

Besides, she has never shown
her face in public.

454
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:36,214
I only got to see her once

536
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:31,755
Sure.

537
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:40,695
Mr. Liang, you're a famous

538
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:42,475
budding furniture designer.

539
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:44,054
Would you mind sharing

540
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:45,395
your design concept with us?

541
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:48,014
I've already answered this

542
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:49,236
in many other interviews.

543
00:35:50,055 --> 00:35:51,475
I don't think
it's necessary to repeat it.

544
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:58,516
We don't have much time.

545
00:35:58,816 --> 00:36:00,315
I suggest you skip the basic questions.

546
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:03,355
All right.

547
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:05,375
You mentioned

548
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:06,855
that design is about dismantling

549
00:36:06,856 --> 00:36:08,996
folded spaces in daily life.

550
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:10,534
However, some people say

551
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:11,974
that compared to general design,

552
00:36:11,975 --> 00:36:13,196
you're better

553
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:15,116
at designing huge mansions.

554
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:17,076
Any comments on that?

555
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:20,395
Design is a comprehensive creation

00:36:20,575 --> 00:36:21,395

00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:24,516
and artistic style.

559
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,275
There's no denying

560
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:28,315
that cost affects the final outcome.

561
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:30,355
However, as a furniture designer,

562
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:32,516
my focus isn't
on extravagance or elegance.

563
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:35,755
So your preference for mansion design

564
00:36:36,055 --> 00:36:37,116
is because of

565
00:36:37,216 --> 00:36:38,355
the cost?

566
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:46,775
Questions that won't be published

567
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:48,236
aren't worth asking.

568
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:50,395
If you can't remember your scripts,

569
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:52,174
you might as well

570
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:53,755
ask me about my thoughts
on the latest product.

573

for your reference.

574
00:37:06,696 --> 00:37:07,676
All right.

575
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:10,596
Regarding the practicality
and aesthetic value of furniture,

576
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:12,636
they are all the same to me.

577
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:13,955
Pure function

578
00:37:14,256 --> 00:37:15,755
without design

579
00:37:15,936 --> 00:37:17,236
or vice versa

580
00:37:17,495 --> 00:37:19,355
goes against the humanistic principles
of design.

581
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:31,076
I can't read facial expressions.

582
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:33,076
Just ask me if you have any questions.

583
00:37:35,135 --> 00:37:36,275
No, not at all.

584
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:41,516
I just find you

585
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:43,915

586
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:45,996

587
00:37:46,216 --> 00:37:47,516
Are you the same as you were that day?

00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:53,156
Mr. Liang,

589
00:37:53,736 --> 00:37:55,596
did you feel offended that day?

590
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:56,955
If you did,

591
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:58,116
I'll apologize.

592
00:38:02,856 --> 00:38:03,955
No, I didn't feel offended.

593
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:05,280
You don't have to apologize.

594
00:38:06,095 --> 00:38:07,556
This is the way I work.

595
00:38:12,296 --> 00:38:13,196
