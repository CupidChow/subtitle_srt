1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,260
   

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,170
   

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,800
   

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,500
   

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,040
   

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:35,040
   

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,610
   

8
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,610
   

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,500
 Love is... 

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,410
a damned thing.

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,950
I mean, it once was.

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,640
I mean,

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,910
relationships, not love.

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,870
Breakups, regrets, and lingering feelings.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,710
What causes problems is always what comes after love.

16
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,450
Love is completely innocent.

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,480
   

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,030
   

19
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,820
   

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,030


21
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,340
 All you did was fall in love with a total stranger, 

22
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,990
 but the challenges and the cost you have to face are too cruel. 

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,810
 You learn about each other's personalities and preferences 

24
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,100
 and overcome the differences. 

25
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,900
 And to do that, you fight, argue, hurt, get hurt, and in the end... 

26
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,250
 you break up. 

27
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,800
Where are you going? Talk to me first.

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,220
- Why am I the only one trying? 
 - I'm trying, too.

29
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,450
You always think you are, but I'm not.

30
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,540
I just need one call or text.

31
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,000
Is that so difficult?

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,030
 I was like that, too. 

33
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,550
 Just like everyone else, 

34
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,640
 my relationships always ended up failing. 

35
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,640
 They were exactly as you'd expect. 

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,200
 It was from cheating, becoming obsessive, 

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,470
 or falling out of love way too quickly. 

38
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:38,160
 All the men I loved were two-timers and cheaters. 

39
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,250
 My relationships always ended with betrayal and pain. 

40
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,580
 Why does that keep repeating in my life? 

41
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,430
 Is it because I'm not attractive? 

42
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,950
 Or is it my fault for loving more for longer? 

43
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,650
 What exactly did I do wrong? 

44
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,280
And I finally realized that it's not my fault that my relationships keep failing.

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,740
And I finally realized that it's not my fault that my relationships keep failing.

46
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,280
Neither I nor the ones I loved are to blame.

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,330
If we have a fault,

48
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:24,140
it's that we didn't know we weren't meant to be together.

49
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,780
And the secret of that fate is in DNA.

50
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,640
The moment Watson first discovered the double helix,

51
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,820
he was certain he had discovered something huge.

52
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,640
It was too beautiful to be a failure.

53
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,190
However, there were secrets we never would've imagined hiding in this double helix.

54
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,130
These secrets map out our lives and determine our fates.

55
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:02,430
Your DNA predetermines the DNA lover, the one you were  
    

56
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,960
meant to love since you were born.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,890
So if you decipher the DNA code,

58
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,020
you'll be able to find the one you're meant to be with.

59
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,010
My DNA lover is...

60
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,760
 tall and thin. 

61
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,520
 He has double eyelids and a full head of hair. 

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,330
He can't handle the heat so he gets very irritable in summer.

63
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,450
And because of the BBS12 gene,

64
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,470
 mosquito bites will make his skin very itchy and swell. 

65
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,600
This is a shame, but he loves drinking because of his decomposition ability.

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,160
He will likely get lung cancer when he's 60.5 years old.

67
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,150
He will very likely get dementia when he's 70.3 years old too.

68
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,080
   

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,780
He will die...

70
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,950
when he's 73.

71
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:13,350
 But he won't be lonely or sad until the day he dies 

72
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,940
because I will live longer.

73
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,020
That will mean...

74
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,300
the predetermined lover who loves him more than anyone else

75
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,720
will stay with him until the end.

76
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm so happy to present my research to you and the world

77
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,320
because we will no longer have to feel hurt.

78
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,060
You don't have to prove your decisions by

79
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,610
wasting emotions and time unnecessarily.

80
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,330
Your love is completely innocent.

81
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,940
I hope you meet the lover chosen by your DNA

82
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,230
and love passionately.

83
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,220
Did you meet the lover predetermined by your DNA?

84
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,890
Yes.

85
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,790
I found him.

86
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,470
What? Was it a dream?

87
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,740
How could that be a dream?

88
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,140
Maybe it was a clairvoyant dream.

89
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,720
   

90
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,150
Gosh, I'm late!

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,890
   

92
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,000
   

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,270
   

94
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,400
Are there three of you?

95
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,100
When did you get here?

96
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,440
No, I'm at Kafka.

97
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,360
There's a club in the basement.

98
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,310
What do you say? I'll get you something tasty.

99
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,660
Oppa.

100
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,610
You'll come to get me, right?

101
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,340
You said it's your friend's birthday.

102
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,080
Have fun with your friends.

103
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,590
 I love you, Oppa. 

104
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,500
- Okay. 
  - Don't you love me? 

105
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,520
I'll wait outside just for 30 minutes. I'm gone if you don't come out.

106
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,140
 Let me know when you're here. 

107
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,740
Okay.

108
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,270
I'm sorry! I'm late.

109
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,830
I'm so out of it!

110
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,410
Hold on.

111
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,980
Ta-da. 
    

112
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,010
I can completely cure your hair loss.

113
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,680
Wow. Do you mean this?

114
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,830
It's a hair growth solution customized to your DNA.

115
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,520
It hasn't been tested yet, but it works really well this time.

116
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,730
The rat with severe hair loss suddenly got as fluffy as a rabbit in seven hours.

117
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,400
How does it feel to have a girlfriend who studies DNA?

118
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,090
This is really funny.

119
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,120
- What? 
 - I keep thinking this, but you aren't my type.

120
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,370
Come on. Will you say you were attracted for no reason again?

121
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,500
That's the...

122
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,500
- power of DNA. 
 - No.

123
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,870
I'm saying I was never attracted to you.

124
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,560
- All of a sudden? 
 - Yes.

125
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,810
I might've been thinking about other women while dating you.

126
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,810
This woman and that woman.

127
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,230
Come on. You've never cheated on me.

128
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,040
You've been very hurt by your cheating exes.

129
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,730
I don't want to become like them.

130
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,850
Gosh. Do you know what they say to people like us?

131
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,650
"You found the one."

132
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,280
No.

133
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,840
No.

134
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,620
So Jin, let's break up.

135
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,020
I want to quit being "the one" for you starting today.

136
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,500
No, you can't.

137
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,410
We are a great match in terms of DNA.

138
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,150
DNA, DNA, DNA! I'm so sick of you talking about DNA.

139
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,990
I got so completely sick of you.

140
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,110
To find our predetermined match,

141
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,510
you always collect my hair, earwax, and tissues I blow my nose with.

142
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,690
You do tests or whatever with those gross things.

143
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,820
Do you know how I feel? Whenever I go to the bathroom,

144
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,570
I can't do business comfortably because my heart races.

145
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,480
You aren't my girlfriend. You're a stalker.

146
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,200
It's because I love you.

147
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,230
I was just checking how good of a match we are in terms of DNA.

148
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,650
Just see a fortuneteller or a shaman.

149
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm a Type T, okay? 
  (T/N: MBTI reference, T is the 'Thinking' type) 

150
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,040
But whenever I see you,

151
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,860
I can't control myself.

152
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:02,830
Breaking up now will be more beneficial for both of us.

153
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,130
And you'd better date a nerd just like you.

154
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,260
Then you'd understand how I feel.

155
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,170
Be well. I'm leaving.

156
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,410
Hold on.

157
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,530
- I've been working days and nights on this– 
 - Yes.

158
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,590
You know,

159
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,540
instead of a woman who makes my hair grow,

160
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,820
I'd prefer a woman who likes me despite my lack of hair.

161
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm leaving.

162
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,560
 At some point, 

163
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,390
 I started hearing the siren in the worst moments of my life. 

164
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,560
 - Hey, Oh Sang Min! 
 - What? What? 

165
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,880
Wh-What? What is it?

166
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,390
So what if we broke up?

167
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,350
Does breaking up end everything?

168
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,550
What's this? A melodrama?

169
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,730
Is it a movie? Action? Romantic comedy?

170
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,950
I'm not fit at all, but I learned inline skating because of you.

171
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,900
Should I throw away the rollerblades?

172
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,100
I started putting cilantro on my rice noodles because of you.

173
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,150
I can't eat rice noodles anymore either

174
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,800
because cilantro will remind me of you.

175
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,280
It was a melodrama.

176
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,550
It's okay. I don't eat cilantro anymore

177
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,910
so feel free to eat it.

178
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,150
1990s.

179
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,680
What about our couple's bank account?

180
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,480
We were going to get dental implants for your mother.

181
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,950
When did I ask you to pay for it?

182
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,060
You're the one who wanted to so badly.

183
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,010
- No, no, no. 
 - Anyway.

184
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,920
It's all your money, anyway.

185
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,490
Take out all the money and leave.

186
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,000
No, you need to have self-respect.

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,240
Did you forget what happened while we were dating?

188
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,160
What happened?

189
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,890
She should've had self-respect, at least.

190
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,840
I caught your nephew Dam Yul's first poop at the postnatal center.

191
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,140
How could we become strangers?

192
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,320
Your dad and I went to so many trails wearing matching hiking shoes.

193
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,520
I can't even say hello to him if I run into him on a trail.

194
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,280
You're breaking up with just one person,

195
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,300
but I'm breaking up with your family of five.

196
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,440
You're mean.

197
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,200
You're such a jerk.

198
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,670
See?

199
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,590
You were dating my family up until the last moment of our breakup, not me.

200
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,070
Be good to your family instead.

201
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,050
Stop caring about mine. I never asked you to.

202
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,860
   

203
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,660
It's over.

204
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,370
You should've ended it before this happened.

205
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,440
   

206
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,110
Losing sanity must be her specialty.

207
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,070
   

208
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,400
- Hey, Ri Na. 
  - Oppa, aren't you neglecting me too much? 

209
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,390
 I'm 22 years old. 

210
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,000
 Your younger girlfriend went clubbing. How could you not pick me up? 

211
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,170
If age is your weapon, date someone who cares.

212
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,870
I said I would only wait for 30 minutes.

213
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,000
 I was wasted. Weren't you worried at all? 

214
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,300
I left because I wasn't happy about it. Didn't you know?

215
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,940
 I will take revenge tonight. 

216
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,080
 What time should we meet? 

217
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,300
 I made a plan with a friend of mine. 

218
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,370
 You can cancel it. 

219
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,490
 - I can't. 
 - Why not? 

220
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,080
 I don't want to lie to him. 

221
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,280
 - You've changed, Oppa. 
 - Ri Na. 

222
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,910
We didn't plan to meet today.

223
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,990
 Do you want to see your girlfriend only on certain days? 

224
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,130
 And why do you know so many people? 

225
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,040
 You're good for nothing. 

226
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,390
 What am I to you? Well? 

227
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,930
 Am I really your girlfriend? Do you even love me? 

228
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,040
 Just one second. 

229
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,370
 Whether I'm hanging out at a club or with another man, 

230
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,970
 weren't you curious when I went home? 

231
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,790
 What if I actually hung out with another man? 

232
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,030
 What if that happened? 

233
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,070
 Oppa, answer me. 

234
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,150
 What am I to you? Well? 

235
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,570
We will be strangers in 30 seconds.

236
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,140
 - What?  
 - I'll break up with you right now.

237
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,630
And I'll hang up in 30 seconds.

238
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,710
 - Are you kidding me?  
 - This is our third time having the same fight.

239
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,360
You won't get what you want from me.

240
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,460
And I'm not interested in becoming the man you want.

241
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,840
I'm even less interested in changing you. You get the idea, right?

242
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,800
 - Oppa.  
 - 28.

243
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,140
29. 30.

244
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,790
 - Take care. 
 - Oppa! 

245
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,260
Mr. Shim, you broke up, right?

246
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,120
You're making that face now. The face you make when you break up.

247
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,590
How does my face look? Is it still sexy and handsome?

248
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,290
Like someone who speeds when there's no speed limit.

249
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,860
I like that. You know what, Hyung?

250
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,050
Fewer accidents happen in those places as long as you follow the rules.

251
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,310
- But... 
 - What?

252
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,620
is it that hard not to change lanes?

253
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,780
I don't know. People usually pass me.

254
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,630
"You've changed. Do you even love me?"

255
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,570
- What? 
 - Why is it always the same line at the end?

256
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,510
Are they AI? Even AI isn't like that.

257
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,980
They all start differently in the beginning.

258
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,440
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. They all had different colors at first.

259
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,490
Even the ice cream company with 31 flavors comes up with new flavors every year. Why?

260
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,900
Why is it always the same line?

261
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,240
Sorry, Hyung.

262
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,830
How did she cross your lane?

263
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,150
Welcome, Dr. Shim.

264
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,080
- Hello, Dr. Shim. 
 - Dr. Shim.

265
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,430
There's a new roastery café in front of the hospital.

266
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,040
I got you the specialty Mandheling coffee.

267
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,180
Wow, Mandheling?

268
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,240
How did you know I was into this these days?

269
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,180
How thoughtful. Thank you.

270
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,880
- How about for me? 
 - My gosh.

271
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,480
Do you drink drip coffee, too?

272
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,170
Is my mouth a big pot only made for instant coffee?

273
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,470
Don't worry about him. Thank you.

274
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:26,040
My original recipe for breast cancer patients with BRCA 1 and 2 genes. 
    

275
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,270
Ta-da.

276
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,380
It's a tomato and beet salad.

277
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:36,150
It will promote dopamine production and make you forget about the breakup momentarily.

278
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,920
Ah Ri, are you sick?

279
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,660
It's a medicine that helps with sociophobia and decision paralysis.

280
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,760
How about you?

281
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,270
Did you cry yesterday?

282
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,910
Your face is still puffy.

283
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,620
- The thing is— 
 - Aigoo...

284
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,180
So Jin was dumped by the piece of trash, Oh Sang Min, yesterday.

285
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,980
Oh Sang Min?

286
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:09,270
You mean your boyfriend who came when we had a meal together?

287
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,390
Don't call him a piece of trash.

288
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,600
They used to love each other.

289
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,750
Yes, Ah Ri. He's not a piece of trash.

290
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,210
At least, he didn't cheat on me.

291
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,930
Sunbae, you're supposed to move on from a man with another man.

292
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,400
Would you like me to arrange a blind date?

293
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:36,780
He was my best DNA match so far.

294
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,660
Wait and see. Oh Sang Min will definitely come back.

295
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,650
His body will refuse to meet someone new.

296
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,860
S-Sunbae.

297
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,740
This is Oh Sang Min's test result, right?

298
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,480
   

299
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,940
 DRD4. 

300
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,960
 A gene that affects the dopamine hormone level 

301
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,260
 that affects the brain nerve cells to feel pleasure. 

302
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,160
 The ones with this gene will likely seek pleasure, thrill, and excitement. 

303
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,030
What? What was the result?

304
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,210
The piece of trash, Oh Sang Min, also had a cheater gene.

305
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,230
Come on.

306
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,000
He didn't look like the type.

307
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,360
No way. He has never done that.

308
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,570
We can say your type is someone with the cheater gene.

309
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,820
Why is this here?

310
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,250
How many of your exes were like this?

311
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,160
No. It's not true.

312
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,030
He never cheated on me while we were dating.

313
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,370
It didn't end because of cheating this time.

314
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,460
You've got to be kidding me!

315
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,370
Respond, HQ.

316
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,310
Send a firefighter to go to the rooftop on a ladder.

317
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,140
 Make entry and check on the resident inside 

318
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,130
 and provide entrance for the other firefighters. Over. 

319
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,080
Rope secured. Entering.

320
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,720
Is anyone in here?

321
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,510
Please answer if you can hear me!

322
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,410
Wake up!

323
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,160
Let's get out of here first.

324
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,600
What happened?

325
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,430
Someone reported a fire, but it wasn't a fire.

326
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,030
I searched the house and found you passed out in the bathroom.

327
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,600
Are you the firefighter from that time...

328
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,470
I swear I didn't attempt suicide this time.

329
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,960
That's a relief.

330
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,350
When I came in, she was passed out in the bathroom.

331
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,700
Okay.

332
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,390
You and I will check if there's anyone else.

333
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,640
You should knock on each door all the way to the top floor.

334
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,890
Do you feel discomfort anywhere?

335
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,300
I'm pregnant.

336
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,570
Maybe I'm anemic due to that,

337
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,810
or I was dehydrated because of enteritis.

338
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,820
I suddenly blacked out.

339
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,680
I think that's why I passed out.

340
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,300
Let me check your blood pressure.

341
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,290
You have the phone number I gave you last time, right?

342
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,970
I will write it down for you again.

343
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,990
If you need help or feel down,

344
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:24,850
please call this number instead of writing a suicide note just once, okay?

345
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,590
   

346
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,980
Okay. Thank you.

347
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,610
 What are you going to do? 

348
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,880
You're about to lose your paycheck from damage compensation.

349
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,230
I know why you're doing this,

350
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,870
but shouldn't you move on by now?

351
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,870
Sunbae, I still want to go back.

352
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,780
To five minutes before the accident.

353
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,250
Well done.

354
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,710
You, too.

355
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,210
   
 What are you doing this evening? 

356
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,300
 Should we get a drink? 

357
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,250
 Again? 

358
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,410
- What do you mean, again? 
  - Do you know when you suggest drinking together? 

359
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,810
 After you're done being mistreated by those jerks. 

360
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,780
 It's always the same types of jerks. 

361
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,790
Hey. It's not like I date them, knowing they're jerks.

362
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,320
- Han So Jin. 
 - Don't.

363
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,670
You scare me whenever you call me like that.

364
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:40,560
Are you interested in surviving instead of dating?

365
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,390
You cry because of men.

366
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,370
Others cry because they can't get a job, get fired, or get sick.

367
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,500
You think starvation kills people, right?

368
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,090
It's actually because they have no one to talk about being hungry.

369
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,710
Tell me if you're hungry.

370
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,410
I'll eat with you for the rest of your life.

371
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,230
You're such a simpleton.

372
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,880
I'll go to your restaurant to have a drink, okay?

373
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,600
 Again? Again? 

374
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,740
 You're supposed to eat there, not drink. 

375
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,680
Seriously.

376
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,540
I won't be there today.

377
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,860
I have a plan. Come tomorrow.

378
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,700
Don't come. Don't come. Don't come.

379
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,890
It's way more fun to drink alone. You'd better not show up.

380
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,070
   

381
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,640
 Hey! 

382
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,520
Oh, Sang Min, you *****. ****. *****!

383
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,650
Ahjussi, give me another bottle of sake.

384
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,190
You should drink when you want to.

385
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,060
There's no better friend than alcohol.

386
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,160
That son of a bitch. A parasite.

387
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,620
I'll cause a scene and punish him. Son of a bitch.

388
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,520
You son of a... I'll f*** you up, you little *****.

389
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,850
You ****. ******. ******.

390
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,080
What are you, cursing sisters?

391
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,530
Why not just have a cursing competition together?

392
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:16,110
- Ahjussi, why won't you do as I say? 
 - What?

393
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,900
That fish. I told you to wash it and kill it.

394
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,170
I washed this with salt water, So Ri.

395
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,770
Should I have used dish soap?

396
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,290
Yes.

397
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,820
Unni.

398
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,340
Isn't my crooked tooth ugly?

399
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,680
No.

400
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,580
It isn't ugly at all.

401
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,370
By the way, who are you?

402
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,610
So Ri.

403
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,770
Do you two know each other?

404
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,720
She's a friend who's a model.

405
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,290
Son of a bitch.

406
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,640
He kept telling me to smile, complimenting my crooked tooth.

407
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,110
He was making fun of it.

408
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,550
He could've actually found it pretty.

409
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,550
But he got sick of it because he fell out of love.

410
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,470
Strangers in a minute?

411
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:07,560
How could we become strangers in a minute?

412
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,970
Strangers?

413
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,530
Did that bastard say, "strangers"?

414
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,780
- What do I do? 
 - How cruel.

415
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,950
I even love the dirt under his toenail.

416
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,410
He was the first man who was so good to me.

417
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,510
He was good to me, and he was fun.

418
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,900
He was so fun, but he was cool, too.

419
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,370
He was so cool when we broke up, too. So annoying.

420
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,510
You want me to help you fall out of love?

421
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,450
Hey, what's his name?

422
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,550
Tell me. I'll reveal his true identity.

423
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,640
Shim Yun... Woo...

424
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,050
What? Shim what?

425
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,370
Stop crying and tell me.

426
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,850
Shim Yun Woo!

427
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,730
Shim Yun Woo! Shim Yun Woo!

428
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,240
She said, "Shim Yun Woo." Can't you hear her?

429
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,380
What does he do?

430
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,340
The Shim Hospital in Cheongdam-dong.

431
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,730
He's the director's son.

432
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,040
Guys!

433
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,210
There's a doctor who's way too handsome there.

434
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,310
Excuse me.

435
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,550
There's someone with offensive DNA in Shinchon.

436
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,980
Guys, I caught this myself–

437
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,790
There's a cheater with the octopus DNA.

438
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,230
It's so annoying.

439
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,170
How annoying.

440
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,470
Should I punish the bastard who dumped you?

441
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,900
How?

442
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,880
How?

443
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,940
How?

444
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,470
Let's see.

445
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,080
Gravity is the force of loneliness that draws people together.

446
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,040
Guys,

447
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,970
there's no such thing as coincidence. I'm telling you.

448
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:28,540
A billion light years ago, a man and a woman

449
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,150
drew each other here because they felt so lonely. But...

450
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,970
Let's go. To take revenge.

451
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,730
Yes, Dad.

452
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,380
Is she at the restaurant? You didn't give her alcohol, right?

453
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,880
The three of them are totally wasted right now.

454
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,210
 Dad! 

455
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,200
I told you not to give her alcohol.

456
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,560
 You know she's dangerous when she's drunk. 

457
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,950
 Like when she put the 

458
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,700
 lemon powder and Cola in her mouth and spat it out as an experiment? 

459
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,480
 That was when she was a kid. 

460
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,660
 She had an alchemy experiment last year and almost started a fire. 

461
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,380
 She becomes someone else when she's drunk. It's like she's possessed. 

462
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,700
What number?

463
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,350
You can find him, right?

464
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,010
Of course.

465
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,620
No, I'm the leader today.

466
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,020
Okay, then. Charge ahead!

467
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,610
One, two. One–

468
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,330
Shit.

469
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,430
Tell him what you need to tell him.

470
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,820
Let's go.

471
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,380
Let's go!

472
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,830
Oppa.

473
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,440
Why won't you answer my call?

474
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,990
So what if you break up with me? So what? I can't!

475
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,340
I have nothing more to say, Ri Na.

476
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,690
- Geez, should we talk inside? 
 - Pardon?

477
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,240
No need to get reported for the noise.

478
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,870
Do you realize you're trespassing right now?

479
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,700
Yes, I don't plan to stay long, either.

480
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,580
Hey, tell him everything you want to say.

481
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,730
Could you please make it quick?

482
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,200
I'll be good, Oppa. Please?

483
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,480
I'll adjust to your needs. Let's start over.

484
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,060
This is why we broke up, Ri Na.

485
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,840
You only care about your feelings now.

486
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,490
How could we have any chance together?

487
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,740
Shit, what a crazy place.

488
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,230
You think you'll find a woman who likes you as much as me?

489
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:07,470
I didn't like you for liking me. I just liked you.

490
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:13,580
When I fell for you, you weren't childish and unreasonable like this.

491
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,500
Could you leave? I have a dinner plan.

492
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,290
- I don't want to. 
 - Who is it?

493
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,780
Is it a woman? No, right?

494
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,670
I'll die without you.

495
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,000
 You won't die. You don't die because of love. 

496
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,230
 - What? 
 - "This too shall pass." 

497
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,780
 "Love as if you've never loved before." 

498
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,140
You'll post that on social media again, right?

499
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,300
I won't!

500
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,660
I'm destined to be with you. I am.

501
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,300
Destiny?

502
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,320
I think I told you I don't believe in stuff like that.

503
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,520
Let me tell you again for the last time.

504
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,840
There's no such thing, Ri Na.

505
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,560
There's no such thing, Ri Na.

506
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,660
That's only for unattractive and insecure people.

507
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:09,230
Destiny is like a flying newspaper on the street.

508
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,340
Just like you right now.

509
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,400
Why are you so mean like that?

510
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,100
Are you really the person I know?

511
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,220
When someone speaks of destiny...

512
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,140
they're betting their life on it.

513
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,450
You're obviously insincere.

514
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,890
Everything was easy for you because you were insincere.

515
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:43,180
A bastard like you doesn't deserve to be loved!

516
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,160
   

517
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,520
Get ugly.

518
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,490
Get ugly. Get ugly. Get ugly.

519
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,650
Get hairy!

520
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,450
 Get hairy! 

521
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,020
Now she's done it!

522
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,930
- Let's go. 
 - No!

523
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,460
My experiment starts now.

524
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,250
- Let's go. 
 - Welcome! Welcome!

525
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,010
Welcome to Han So Jin's world of experiments!

526
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,140
My puzzle...

527
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,090
Hey, aren't you going to answer?

528
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:05,030
Answer me. Welcome!

529
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,940
Hold on. Hold on!

530
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,560
How can I just let that bastard be?

531
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,130
What's the deal with that bastard?

532
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,140
I really can't forgive him.

533
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,740
We can't just let this slide.

534
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,290
- We at least care about justice, right? 
 - Okay, okay.

535
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,290
Please.

536
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,340
Hello? Is this Mars?

537
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,030
Pardon? My DNA match lives there?

538
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:02,330
I knew it. I knew he wasn't on earth.

539
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:06,770
By the way, is he weird-looking?

540
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,030
It's okay. I don't care about the looks.

541
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:17,660
By the way, do Martians love only one person at a time?

542
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,530
I do, too.

543
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,720
I'm an earthling,

544
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,040
but I only love one person at a time, unlike other earthlings.

545
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,850
Let's meet now.

546
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,440
I'll send you a signal.

547
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,240
You need to find me, okay?

548
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,710
   

549
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:03,050
Why does she always have to be so extreme?

550
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,350
Beep, beep, beep, beep...

551
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,180
- Hey, hey, hey. Come. 
 - Beep, beep, beep, beep...

552
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,590
- I love you. 
 - Seriously!

553
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:22,240
Do you want to be punished by Kang Hoon?

554
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,630
Geez, I feel so icky, seriously...

555
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,530
What the heck is this? Damn it!

556
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,000
Geez, so icky!

557
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,390
It doesn't seem to have chemicals in it.

558
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,260
Super Te-ol? Super Te-wool? 
  (T/N: Teol means body hair in Korean) 

559
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,470
Super... Til?

560
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,100
What the heck is this?

561
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,490
Why won't he answer?

562
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,780
Hyung, I'm here.

563
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,690
- You came. 
 - What's going on?

564
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,620
What happened to the living room? Why was this shoe stuck in the doorway?

565
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:40,440
I'm sorry, Kang Hoon. Please get her a taxi and send her away.

566
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:51,390
- I'm not supposed to be in a taxi right now. 
 - Hey, your phone.

567
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,230
Sit still!

568
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,500
- Can we drive a little slower? 
 - Where is it?

569
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,570
Beep. Can you hear my voice?

570
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:05,150
I... I'm waiting for your signal.

571
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,780
- Please answer me. 
 - Kang Hoon is looking for us.

572
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,340
Don't answer your phone.

573
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,820
- I want to answer! 
 - You can't answer, okay?

574
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,880
- I'm sorry. 
 - Can I answer?

575
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,740
I think I'll throw up.

576
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,200
I think I'll throw up, too.

577
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,720
Signal. I'll wait for your signal. Beep.

578
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,190
What do I do?

579
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,990
How am I supposed to live now?

580
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,150
Think of it as a good thing.

581
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,780
You'll have a chance to meet someone who'll love only you.

582
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,450
You should prepare to get a job.

583
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,520
Focus on studies and self-improvement for now.

584
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,980
And there are so many things to do while you're young.

585
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,110
You should travel around the country and the world too.

586
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,490
If you were a man, I'd tell you to work a day labor job

587
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,220
and get yourself a bowl of seoleongtang. 
  (T/N: Ox bone soup) 

588
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,230
- How old are you? 
 - I'm 29.

589
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,190
Oppa, do you want to try dating me?

590
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,480
I'll refuse.

591
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,120
It doesn't mean she will die.

592
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,140
She's just asking for love.

593
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,170
Love commandment No. 1.

594
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:53,080
"Don't love anyone but yourself."

595
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,800
"Think of yourself and focus on yourself"

596
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,660
"and live for yourself only." That's the truth.

597
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,640
What? Why do I feel like you're in a bad mood?

598
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,080
Didn't you date the lawyer at Byeon and Jang last year?

599
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,180
- Yes, I did. 
 - Earlier this year,

600
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,140
you dated a ballet and yoga instructor,

601
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,370
and you dated a voice actor afterward, right?

602
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,050
- Did I tell you that too? 
 - Why have you had so many women?

603
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,130
Is that bad?

604
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,530
You should devote yourself to only one woman as a man.

605
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,330
- Devote? 
 - Yes, devote.

606
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,990
I want to fall in love, too. How can I do that?

607
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,500
- What are you saying? 
 - Geez.

608
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,680
Mr. Fireman. You should've been a woman.

609
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,540
Why?

610
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,810
Hyung, do you know what kind of people I hate the most?

611
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,750
No. What kind? I'm curious.

612
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,950
The selfish kind.

613
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,920
Selfish.

614
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,930
Do you think that woman you dumped looked fine?

615
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:49,310
See how deeply hurt she is because of you.

616
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,850
I'm leaving.

617
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,800
What's wrong with him?

618
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,400
I was hurt, too, because she suddenly barged in.

619
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,450
What did I do?

620
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,840
   

621
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,820
Hello?

622
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,700
 What's with your voice? Do you remember last night? 

623
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,260
What? Last night?

624
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,900
I drank at your restaurant until late.

625
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,160
How did I get home? My head...

626
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,360
 Do you really not remember? 

627
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,880
 Dad said you and So Ri left together. 

628
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,410
So Ri?

629
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:58,100
Yes, I guess she might've dropped me off.

630
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,900
 Did you cause trouble somewhere again? 

631
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,480
 You cause trouble when you get drunk. 

632
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,300
 It's basically an illness at that point. 

633
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:11,970
Me? Trouble? Not at all.

634
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,680
 Think carefully. 

635
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,260
Nothing happened, I said.

636
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,820
   

637
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,230
Hang up. I need to get ready for work.

638
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,370
 - Hold on! 
 - So Ri! 

639
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,610
What was that?

640
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,180
Did I go somewhere with So Ri?

641
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,760
I just shaved. What happened?

642
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,810
Why only on this side?

643
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,930
 Get hairy! 

644
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,070
You.

645
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,780
Super Teol?

646
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,590
- You drank last night, didn't you? 
 - Yes...

647
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,840
I asked Ahjussi Hyung Chul, and

648
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:29,040
we had fun drinking, and So Ri took me with her.

649
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,400
But one of my shoes was gone in the morning.

650
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,790
My goodness.

651
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:38,360
I should drink less.

652
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,510
What?

653
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,610
- It's gone. 
 - Missing something again?

654
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,470
The hair growth solution.

655
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,120
Super Teol is gone.

656
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,550
Super Teol?

657
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,030
You haven't been spraying at people all night, right?

658
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,380
Spray?

659
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,640
 Get ugly. Get ugly. 

660
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,490
 Get hairy! 

661
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:20,150
No, it must be a dream.

662
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,630
It might not be a dream.

663
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:28,180
When you got drunk last year, you couldn't remember the night before at all.

664
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,870
I've always noticed this.

665
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,020
I think you have REM sleep disorder.

666
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,520
With REM sleep disorder, you act out your dreams unconsciously.

667
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,380
 What time do you get off work today? 

668
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,220
 I'll pick you up at work. Let's eat. 

669
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,300
This punk.

670
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,330
Food isn't my concern right now.

671
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,160
Is it Han So Jin again?

672
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,690
Yes. We are eating together later.

673
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,350
Hey, we are having a team dinner tonight.

674
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:06,350
I'm sorry. I don't think I could come tonight.

675
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,620
Seriously.

676
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:13,250
You two seem to be dating, but you keep denying it.

677
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:19,200
Sunbae, I'm friendly with you, but we aren't dating.

678
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:25,290
I'm not exactly a woman, you know.

679
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,770
I suppose.

680
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,990
I'm kidding.

681
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,750
I will treat her the same way even if she gets married.

682
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,460
Whatever.

683
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,270
Which one?

684
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:45,930
With rosemaries...

685
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,250
this is the most popular size.

686
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,720
That's Hui Yun.

687
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:09,920
Why are you out in this cold?

688
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,500
If you like subtle scents, I recommend eucalyptus too.

689
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,140
 Really? 

690
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,710
- Let's go. 
 - Shall we? Let's go.

691
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,460
Sunbae.

692
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,630
Was Hui Yun's boyfriend...

693
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,330
you?

694
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,830
We broke up and...

695
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:39,260
 Would you like me to arrange a blind date? 

696
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,640
Were you two-timing, by chance?

697
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,160
Seriously. So annoying.

698
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,990
Why? Are you annoyed that you got caught?

699
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:53,550
Sunbae, you must've done something wrong in the past, too.

700
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,570
You don't break up because of just one person.

701
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,620
We didn't break up. He was cheating and deceiving me.

702
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,200
Ask people on the streets.

703
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,540
When the girlfriend talks about destiny and obsesses over you,

704
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,390
what man wouldn't get sick of it?

705
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,400
You're the one who made me this way.

706
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,590
Your ex-boyfriend and the one before him.

707
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,660
You drove them to cheat. Do you know that?

708
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,490
You'd better not do anything negative to Hui Yun.

709
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,900
Hey, Oh Sang Min!

710
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:31,920
Just one moment.

711
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,700
- What? 
 - You...

712
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,630
- You... 
 - You what? Tell me!

713
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:41,440
You aren't losing hair due to stress.

714
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,240
You have a hair loss gene.

715
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,520
You'll lose all of it in three years, and it won't grow back.

716
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,370
Your child's child will lose hair, too.

717
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,950
Did you know you have a prostate cancer gene?

718
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:54,030
You'll likely get it when you're 42.3 years old.

719
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,090
Right, you have a diabetes gene too.

720
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:00,340
You'll get it when you're 45.3 years old.

721
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,890
You know that genes determine fates you can't avoid, right?

722
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:06,240
Don't worry. Science is more powerful than genes.

723
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,850
I hope you get treated.

724
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,980
Might as well pronounce me dead.

725
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,860
Do you think you can hurt me like this?

726
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,950
No, but let me tell you this.

727
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:21,050
Predictions don't normally affect you at all.

728
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:25,660
But as you age year by year,

729
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,810
you'll be tormented slowly.

730
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:34,090
You'll think, "The test result that woman read me was my future."

731
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,850
Are you out of your mind?

732
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,760
Don't deal with a scoundrel like him.

733
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,520
S-Scoundrel?

734
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,150
You bastard! Come here.

735
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,690
Come here, you bastard! You little...

736
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,600
Oppa, my gosh!

737
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,470
Let's go, Noona.

738
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,900
Hey, where are you going? Where do you think you're going after hitting me?

739
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,430
I didn't like you from the moment I saw you!

740
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,940
What are you Leon? Are you? Seriously...

741
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,080
You little...

742
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,650
I'm holding back because of you.

743
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:15,470
See you next time! You're dead meat!

744
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:20,990
Okay. Here's the sushi you ordered.

745
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,510
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

746
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,060
She's drunk.

747
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:02,280
Gosh, are you drinking again after getting drunk last night?

748
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,870
What's so great about him? Move on quickly.

749
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,850
"Always with you."

750
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,120
What?

751
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,620
Did she pass away ten years ago already?

752
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,110
He cared for her when she was sick for over ten years. 
    

753
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:21,960
She's still everything to Ahjussi.

754
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,590
It's a wedding photo, not even a family photo.

755
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:29,880
Mom is still alive in Dad's heart, you know.

756
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,300
I wonder if my dad is still in my mom's heart.

757
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,800
They should've never met.

758
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,580
Mom and Dad wouldn't have been so miserable

759
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,290
if they had met someone else.

760
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,920
If they did...

761
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:52,740
he wouldn't have left like that, either.

762
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,130
Come on. Seriously.

763
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,470
Eat. Eat and think.

764
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:03,920
Only date someone who's devoted to you, okay?

765
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,400
Bring everyone you're interested in.

766
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,880
I'll tell you if they're jerks, assholes, or cheaters.

767
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,350
Instead, you can't date someone I don't approve of, okay?

768
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,950
What are you talking about out of the blue?

769
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,710
You'd better not cry because of a man again. You'll be in trouble.

770
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:24,260
It's my love life, okay?

771
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,120
Just eat.

772
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,690
Is it good?

773
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:41,320
 The reason my dad was miserable until he died 

774
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,270
 was because he was with the wrong person. 

775
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,990
 That's when I found out 

776
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:54,460
 that you need to find the perfect other half to save each other 

777
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,500
 and redeem each other. 

778
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,370
 The samples I got from Oh Sang Min's body. 

779
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,990
 I wanted to prove that he was my DNA lover, 

780
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:12,110
 but all I got out of this was a hair loss medicine for him. 

781
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:18,340
   

782
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,080
 Your DNA... 

783
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:25,070
 tells you the perfect person you'll stay with forever. 

784
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:31,630
 I call that perfect other half the "DNA lover." 

785
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:40,170
 My DNA lover, whose name and face are in the dark. 

786
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,110
   

787
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:55,750
 Will I be able to find my DNA lover before I die? 

788
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:00,070
Where could he be?

789
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,410
How old is he?

790
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,170
He can't...

791
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,250
already be...

792
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,470
dead, right?

793
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:45,020
What kind of dream was that?

794
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:56,760
What's this?

795
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,330
- Dr. Shim. 
 - Gosh!

796
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:24,980
- What's wrong? 
 - Lately, I...

797
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:29,250
I've been getting a massage on this side since it got puffy.

798
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,530
How about you? Why don't you get a massage?

799
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:35,810
Why don't you do it? You have to. Of course, you have to!

800
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,670
It must be because of this. 
    

801
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,130
So Jin.

802
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,060
How do I find this person?

803
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,660
   

804
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,630
I still need to work.

805
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,860
 - Yes, Dr. Shim.  
 - I'll check Patient Yoo Yeong Ah's prenatal test results

806
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,210
at the DNA center.

807
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,810
 Get ugly. Get ugly. 

808
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:33,490
 Get ugly! 

809
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,340
 Get hairy! 

810
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,360
Who are you?

811
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,400
BK.

812
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,930
I just arrived.

813
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,450
I'll meet you there. Yes.

814
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:06,630
 We have a meeting with the gynecologist 

815
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,560
 from Shim Hospital, who's collaborating with us. 

816
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,030
 Come to the auditorium. 

817
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,030
Shim Hospital?

818
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,080
Shim Hospital...

819
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:19,270
Shim Hospital.

820
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,310
 The Shim Hospital in Cheongdam-dong. 

821
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,850
 Shim Yun Woo! Shim Yun Woo! 

822
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,530
What was that?

823
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,420
I'm busy.

824
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,460
So Ri, tell me everything that happened the day I was wasted.

825
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,580
I don't think you want to hear it.

826
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,100
You should be sued for what you did.

827
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,350
That can't be.

828
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,990
I don't start fights when I'm drunk.

829
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,470
Do you really want to hear it?

830
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,780
Hey.

831
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,400
 It's destiny. It's destiny. It's destiny. 

832
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,460
 There's no such thing, Ri Na. 

833
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,980
 A bastard like you doesn't deserve to be loved! 

834
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,950
 Get ugly. Get ugly. 

835
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:12,870
 Get hairy! 

836
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,830
You're crazy! You're crazy! So crazy!

837
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,630
Are you out of your mind?

838
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,610
I knew this would happen. I've finally lost my mind!

839
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:28,000
You're crazy. You're crazy. You're crazy.

840
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,460
But why don't I remember his face?

841
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,970
You're crazy! You're crazy!

842
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:48,440
What do I do? What do I do?

843
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,630
- I'm going crazy. 
 - Team Leader Han, you came.

844
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,690
- Yes, yes. 
 - Give me a moment.

845
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,800
I'm going crazy!

846
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:02,130
What is it this time?

847
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:04,690
Ah Ri, it wasn't a dream. I remember everything.

848
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:06,550
I think I sprayed Super Teol on him.

849
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:08,340
What?

850
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,160
 Who's that man? 

851
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,630
 Shim Yun Woo? 

852
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:13,600
But I don't remember his face.

853
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,510
 How could you not remember his face? 

854
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,040
 That's why I'm going crazy. 

855
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,750
Hold on. Dr. Shim just arrived. He will be here soon.

856
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,870
Pardon? Dr. Shim?

857
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,910
Oh, there he is.

858
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:34,750
Over here, Dr. Shim Yun Woo! Over here.

859
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,660
Shim Yun Woo?

860
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,910
Dr. Shim, over here!

861
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,910
 When someone speaks of destiny, 

862
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,780
 they're betting their life on it. 

863
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:55,850
 A bastard like you doesn't deserve to be loved! 

864
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,870
♫  Everyday, would you give me all your heart tonight?  ♫

865
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:45,090
♫  Yeah, I’ll never give up on your love  ♫

866
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:48,320
♫  In my heart, you’re always with me  ♫

867
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,480
♫  Forever, you and I  ♫

868
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,520
♫  Wherever you are  ♫

869
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,870
♫  No matter how far you've gone  ♫

870
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:01,890
♫  Everyday, would you give me your heart tonight?  ♫

871
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:06,270
♫  I’ll get you, your heart  ♫

872
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,300
♫  Will you hold me in your arms?  ♫

873
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,670
   

874
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:27,260
 Women can recognize the man's immunity gene for their offspring. 

875
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,970
 Shy, I made this perfume using my favorite scents. 

876
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:32,920
 You must bark if you smell it on a man. 

877
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,740
 Where are you going? Shy! 

878
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:37,010
 It looks like you just broke up with your boyfriend. 

879
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:39,450
 It's okay. I got a new boyfriend just now. 

880
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,830
 - Just now? 
 - Did you get caught showing interest in me? 

881
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:45,160
 - Dr. Shim? 
 - We've met before, right? 

882
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,140
 Your Super Teol is mutating my genes. 

883
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,280
 It seems that I like her, 

884
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,450
 but I don't like her. 

885
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:57,520
 Ms. Han, find an antidote for Super Teol. 

886
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:01,060
♫  I've fallen into  ♫
