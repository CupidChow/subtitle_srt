1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,380
   

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,600
   

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,020
   

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,530
   

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,280
   

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,020
   

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,670
   

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,230
   

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,310
 I'll break up with you right now. 

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,440
 And I'll hang up in 30 seconds. 

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,370
 Love is a game where the one who keeps a distance wins. 

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,890
 That's what I believed. 

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,470
 So Jin! 

14
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,330
 It finally worked. The telepathy. 

15
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,730
 Until I met that strange woman. 

16
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,950
 She keeps making me want to lose. 

17
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,580
Bye.

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,730
Hold on, So Jin.

19
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,300
Huh?

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,220
Didn't you forget something?

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,190
I think you did.

22
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,840
I love you, Yun Woo.

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,000
I said I love you. So very much.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
Well...

25
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:07,060
I think you left this in the car.

26
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,730
What's this, by the way?

27
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,830
This is for calling someone, right?

28
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,070
You push it, and it goes, "Ding, ding, ding."

29
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,880
Give me.

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,930
See you at the meeting, So Jin.

31
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,500
I won't see you, okay?

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,900
Go in safely.

33
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:38,930


34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,950
 I'm at the crossroads of a decision right now. 

35
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,830
 Honey, is that you? 

36
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,110
   

37
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,840
   

38
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:29,950
 When you grow up, don’t say "I love you" to just anyone too easily. 

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,310
 You might as well live freely. 

40
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:45,180
 Don't ruin someone's life like your dad did. 

41
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,420
 In the end of the love I observed, 

42
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,510
 there was no such thing as happiness. 

43
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,500
   

44
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,350
Hey! What are you doing right now?

45
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,550
What if your reckless behavior caused an accident?

46
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,200
Don't you know the respirator means life?

47
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,520
How could you give that to someone else?

48
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,110
It was a studio apartment, and the fire went out quickly. It was fine.

49
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,820
What do you mean it was fine?

50
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,140
Just look at yourself right now.

51
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,680
I don't know what's going on with you these days,

52
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,530
but quit if you'd behave recklessly like this.

53
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,300
Hey, Seo Kang Hoon.

54
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,510
Seo Kang Hoon!

55
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,590
I'm here.

56
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,270
Hey.

57
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,190
Hey, why are you walking like that?

58
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,270
Did you get injured?

59
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,970
No.

60
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,350
Have you eaten?

61
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,370
I'm not hungry.

62
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,660
Gosh, my son looks so skinny.

63
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,420
Have a seat for now.

64
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,400
Sit down. Sit down.

65
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,760
I said I'm not eating.

66
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,430
You little.

67
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,410
Something's up, huh?

68
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,830
No.

69
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,240
Your face says you were rejected by a woman.

70
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,650
Is it that woman who brought a book, by chance?

71
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,750
No, it isn't.

72
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,330
Kang Hoon, you regret nothing if you meet someone good.

73
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,890
I couldn't spend a lifetime with your mom,

74
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,310
but our memories keep me going.

75
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,110
You need to meet someone like that, too. Someone who won't let you regret it.

76
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,140
I can manage myself.

77
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,410
Aigoo! Then, why have you been like this for 29 years?

78
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,570
Seriously.

79
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,470
Go stop So Jin after you're done eating.

80
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,850
She's running outside for hours now.

81
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,950
No, I can't. I can't.

82
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,890
 I love you, Yun Woo. 

83
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,000
 I said I love you. So very much. 

84
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,970
The more I think, the weirder it is.

85
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,670
His girlfriend told him she loved him.

86
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,100
She said it twice, even.

87
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,450
What kind of reaction was that?

88
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,250
"I love you, too." "I love you more." Or...

89
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,740
"Me, too."

90
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,050
Is it that hard to say those two words?

91
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,860
Let's run.

92
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,510
Slowly, slowly.

93
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,390
One, two.

94
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,070
One, two, three...

95
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,920
This story is so you, Jang Fox.

96
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,650
Hello, I'm a 37-year-old polyamorist with a worry.

97
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,900
I started living with a polyamorist woman recently.

98
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,250
But it's getting harder to listen to her dating history.

99
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,040
Does my jealousy mean I'm not a polyamorist?

100
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,090
Or am I changing because I like her too much?

101
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,590
Why don't you try coaching him?

102
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,940
A man and a woman who used to have open relationships,

103
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,640
but one of their view on relationships changed.

104
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,020
Why do they live together, then?

105
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,320
They can just break up.

106
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,960
This is so not you. What's with that face?

107
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,330
I suppose it's not so easy.

108
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,830
He found out how much he loved the other person.

109
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,060
How could he leave her?

110
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,450
If one finds happiness,

111
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,050
their view on relationships can change anytime.

112
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,440
This is your new consent, Jang Fox?

113
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,020
So Ri, it's a concept, not consent.

114
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,860
I said, concept. Didn't I?

115
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,650
Are you here to sell cosmetic products?

116
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,640
If I put everything here,

117
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,300
I'll have no choice but to come here to take a shower.

118
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,780
And if I do,

119
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:25,870
I'll force myself to work out. That's the idea.

120
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,820
That stupid poster.

121
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,590
You're diligent. So very diligent.

122
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,110
Sung Mi, teach me one-two today.

123
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,920
Okay, if you haven't warmed up yet,

124
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,710
let's start with 50 jumping jacks.

125
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,680
- Okay. 
 - Ready, go!

126
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,320
One, two, three! One, two, three!

127
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,260
Do 30 burpees when you're done doing jumping jacks.

128
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,750
Burpee?

129
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,160
No, let's do 15 instead.

130
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,060
Well, okay.

131
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,530
Restart the jumping jacks!

132
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,370
Oh, shit.

133
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,110
My legs. Gosh, my back.

134
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,920
Let's go.

135
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,410
- Jung Tam. 
 - Thank you.

136
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,370
You should rest for now...

137
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,020
and focus on the regular program only from now on.

138
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,350
How about the poster, then—

139
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,720
The poster isn't the issue right now.

140
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,600
I got greedy and came up with a plan that's too much for you.

141
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,420
I...

142
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,020
like you the way you are...

143
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,050
right now.

144
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,940
Jung Tam!

145
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,100
Come on, what are you doing?

146
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,150
So, you're not doing the poster photoshoot either?

147
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,800
Pardon?

148
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,880
So, you won't work out with Sung Mi at dawn anymore?

149
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,500
No poster photoshoot, either? Why?

150
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,630
Don't ask. We'll go to a pottery studio to make matching pottery.

151
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,820
Why do you try to do so many things together?

152
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,310
You feel uncomfortable because you try to work out with her.

153
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,160
Doesn't she feel uncomfortable sharing your hobbies, too?

154
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,410
We want to do things together because we like each other.

155
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,850
I'm willing to do anything for Sung Mi.

156
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,660
I'll go anywhere with her,

157
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,640
and express my love for her plenty.

158
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,950
Do you have to say you love someone?

159
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,660
Why would you ask such an obvious question?

160
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,310
You need to express love.

161
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,000
How would anyone know otherwise?

162
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,080
That's why I tell Sung Mi I love her over 50 times a day.

163
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,890
- Fifty times? 
 - Yes.

164
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,600
Is that some kind of condition?

165
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,130
What do you know about love? You don't know anything.

166
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,070
   

167
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,920
- Ms. Jang Mi Eun. 
 - Yes.

168
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,610
Did you request the melasma course care?

169
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,250
O-Oh, n-no...

170
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,620
it's not that I have it.

171
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,130
It's to prevent it since I might have it later.

172
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,720
I see. Come this way.

173
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,130
Could I see Team Leader Han So Jin for a moment first?

174
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,890
Sure.

175
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,880
They say you die if you suddenly change.

176
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,840
I wonder if I'd die at this rate.

177
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,840
Aigoo.

178
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,480
Why are you so tired today?

179
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,500
I started running recently.

180
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,060
Who? You?

181
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,270
You don't work out at all normally. Why are you suddenly running?

182
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:05,610
I think Yun Woo and I will go on a long trip this summer.

183
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,040
Being fit is a basic requirement for a trip.

184
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,820
♫  Let me show you what I got. Got, got, got.  ♫

185
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,150
♫  Yeah, let me show you what I got  ♫

186
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,530
Of course...

187
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,130
love definitely changes a person.

188
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,350
♫  So, let me show you what I got. Show you what I got.  ♫

189
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,670
♫  Let me show you what I got  ♫

190
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,550
♫  Let me show you what I got  ♫

191
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,400
♫  You're gonna love what I got  ♫

192
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,110
What's wrong with her?

193
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,510
Ah Ri had a major change in her state of mind.

194
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,980
Change in her state of mind?

195
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,140
Hold on. Let's do this in order.

196
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:46,000
First of all, the homebody Han So Jin started running.

197
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,190
Aren't you changing yourself too much for Yun Woo?

198
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,040
She thinks the Sewer won't apply PGS otherwise.

199
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,540
The Sewer?

200
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,660
 In order to acquire Dr. Shim's sample, 

201
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,720
 Seven! 

202
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,630
she stole his basketball uniform.

203
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,460
I mean, she extracted his pheromone from his DNA,

204
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,770
but to me, it smelled like the sewer.

205
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,800
To me, it smelled like heaven's garden.

206
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,740
You found a sample from Yun Woo's uniform?

207
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,730
Yes, I extracted the precious sweat.

208
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,530
So? How's the PGS working this time?

209
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,760
I definitely think his playboy gene was

210
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,740
suppressed a bit since he applied the PGS.

211
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,280
It somehow feels like he loves me more.

212
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,220
Although he hasn't told her he loves her yet.

213
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,180
So, it hasn't worked yet.

214
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,270
Send me Yun Woo's PGS data, then.

215
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,680
I need to see it myself to believe it.

216
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,020
But it's not that I don't believe you, Team Leader Han.

217
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,390
Uniform?

218
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:57,440
Let's hear about the change Ah Ri is going through now.

219
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,250
What changed?

220
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,220
What changed?

221
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,870
What changed?

222
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,060
 The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep... 

223
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,270
She hasn't been answering since yesterday.

224
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,030
   

225
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,960
   

226
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,480
   

227
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,550
- Dr. Yuh. 
 - My goodness.

228
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,670
Hello.

229
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,810
Is something going on?

230
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,630
No, it's nothing.

231
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,280
By the way,

232
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,270
Yun Woo is in the outdoor garden.

233
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,480
Oh, okay.

234
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,520
I'm sorry.

235
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,250
- Yun Woo. 
 - I'll call you back.

236
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,940
I don't see the bracelet.

237
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,550
I left it at home.

238
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,350
I took it off while taking a shower and forgot. I'm sorry.

239
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,030
It's okay to just keep it on.

240
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,510
I'm not used to it.

241
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,190
I'm sorry. I'll be better from now on.

242
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,410
Should we get matching sneakers for our trip?

243
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,150
I found a pair I really like.

244
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,360
- Looks like you love matching items. 
 - Yes.

245
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,670
It means we feel the same way even when we're apart.

246
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,490
Do you feel the same way just because you wear matching stuff?

247
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,430
Anyway, I'll remember to wear it.

248
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:22,010
You got a call from your mother the day we saw the movie.

249
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,440
I keep worrying about the way you looked that day.

250
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,660
Everything is okay with her, right?

251
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,610
Yes, she's fine.

252
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,000
- That's a relief. 
 - Yes.

253
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:46,070
I want to hear about your family, too.

254
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:52,570
I'm curious about how you were when you were three, seven, 14, or 20.

255
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,580
Why?

256
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,900
Why shouldn't I be? Because it's about you and your family.

257
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,790
You're dating me, not my family.

258
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:09,280
But still. Wouldn't it be nice if we knew each other better than anyone?

259
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,180
The more we know, the better we'd understand each other.

260
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,450
We'd be able to rely on each other, too.

261
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,880
Is that so? Is it necessary?

262
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,290
Pardon?

263
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,160
Everyone must be waiting. Let's go in.

264
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,530
Okay.

265
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,300
Ms. Han was with the assistant director earlier. I think they had a fight.

266
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,890
Look at her face.

267
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,440
Their time together is running out.

268
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,850
Although it happens all the time.

269
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,120
I heard you're seeing someone these days.

270
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,450
The hospital doesn't mind,

271
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,220
but all the doctors attend gatherings with their spouses.

272
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,960
You should get married first...

273
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,550
and continue dating her.

274
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,580
Having a relationship for display isn't my style.

275
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,990
Looks like you still blame me.

276
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,750
Why would I blame you?

277
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,160
We each have our lives.

278
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,490
Yun Woo,

279
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,740
it doesn't matter whether you believe me or not,

280
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,680
but I loved your mother at first, too.

281
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,890
I just didn't know things would change.

282
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,240
Love?

283
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,320
Do you ever think that word,

284
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:04,030
"love" trapped Mother forever?

285
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,500
It's just that I've always been true to my feelings.

286
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,960
You shouldn't have said you loved her if you'd change so easily.

287
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,470
I'll leave now. Pardon me.

288
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,100
   

289
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,760
I'm kicking! Shoot!

290
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,190
Father!

291
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,980
I'm sorry.

292
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,640
Are you okay?

293
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,710
You're bleeding too much.

294
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:04,280
The ball was flying toward your face. Weren't you scared?

295
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,180
I was more scared about you getting hurt.

296
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,140
You don't hide anywhere anymore, right?

297
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:27,660
I strangely feel at ease ever since I confessed to you.

298
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,620
That's a relief.

299
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,990
Who do you confide in when you struggle?

300
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,930
I confide everything to the Lord.

301
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,350
Because he always protects me by my side.

302
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,160
Can't it be a person?

303
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,850
Pardon?

304
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,680
I wish I always had you...

305
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,050
by my side whenever I struggled, too.

306
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,850
You got a haircut.

307
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,380
Yes, I did.

308
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,450
I'll enjoy this.

309
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,760
It's tasty.

310
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,980
Really?

311
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,310
What a relief.

312
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,300
I put more water celery in it this time.

313
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,900
   

314
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,650
   

315
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,200
   

316
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,200
Sunbae, you told me once that...

317
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,860
the person who could get me out of the armoire is probably my DNA lover.

318
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,790
I don't totally believe that,

319
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,750
but I think I found that person.

320
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,680
I talk to him about my feelings more than I do with you.

321
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,530
If I were his DNA lover,

322
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,580
could I become his healer, too?

323
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,070
Tell me more in detail.

324
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,910
No, I need to finish reading this book today.

325
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,960
It's about a woman who only loved a priest her whole life.

326
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,720
I'm the opposite.

327
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,770
It's getting harder to talk about my feelings with him.

328
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,390
I'm afraid that things would get uncomfortable.

329
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,880
I have so much fun when I'm with him,

330
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,770
but it feels strangely cold after we say goodbye.

331
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:14,360
It feels like I don't know anything about him.

332
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,940
The Sewer only wants to enjoy dating, but you demand him to be sincere.

333
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,700
He must feel so pressured.

334
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,540
You... How could you say that...

335
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,880
It's not like that, okay?

336
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,550
 Noona, take the main street until the streetlight gets fixed... 

337
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:29,000
   

338
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,660
   

339
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,600
What the heck!

340
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,290
 This happened because I ran into the glass door when I got to work. 

341
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,310
Why is she sharing all this?

342
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,090
 Tell me everything that happened today, too. 

343
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,340
 Oh, the photographic evidence is mandatory. 

344
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,270
 Be sure to go to the hospital. Your nose bone might've been damaged. 

345
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:49,490
 And don't forget we're working out at Han River this afternoon. 

346
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,560
 See you later, So Jin. 

347
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,680
♫  Like a shimmering light across the distant universe  ♫

348
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,890
What are you doing?

349
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,530
You should try walking backward, too.

350
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,580
It feels very strange to walk backward in the crowd.

351
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,410
This is how scientists come up with innovative ideas.

352
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,550
Come on and try it.

353
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,000
- Like this? 
 - Yes.

354
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,570
- Is this it? 
 - You're good.

355
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,290
Should we bet who gets to the rest area over there first?

356
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,790
- The winner gets their wish granted. 
 - Deal!

357
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,780
- Do you mean it? 
 - Yes.

358
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,440
I'll actually run, then.

359
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,810
I'm walking right now.

360
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,320
I'm going. Here I go.

361
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,090
Darn it. Geez!

362
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,770
Seeing the river makes me want to see the ocean.

363
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,410
Should we go see the ocean?

364
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,340
Is that your wish?

365
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,300
We'll eat something tasty and watch the sunrise, too.

366
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,710
Sunrise?

367
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,360
Really?

368
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,270
Hey, Seo Kang Hoon!

369
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,390
Hey, I told you to text me if you're wearing that.

370
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,120
I couldn't have worn it if I did.

371
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,320
I shouldn't have fallen for the buy one get one free thing...

372
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,780
You're wearing a T-shirt inside, aren't you?

373
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,730
- What are you doing? 
 - Take it off.

374
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,130
We look the same.

375
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,430
How about we just...

376
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,970
go get dinner together?

377
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,400
- I'll just— 
 - Take it off. Off!

378
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,720
- Yun Woo, look at this. It's alive. 
 - It's moving.

379
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,410
Will it flip if I did this?

380
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,590
This is what it means to flip.

381
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,700
- Be careful. 
 - My gosh.

382
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,050
Do you like radish?

383
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,000
 - Yes. 
 - That's right. 

384
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,930
 - For the next trial... 
 - Until now... 

385
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,290
 Do you need brutally honest advice? 

386
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,570
- It's So Ri. 
  - We're here to give you relationship advice. 

387
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,460
 - "Relationship Advice" starts now.  
 - Noona.

388
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,930
You know it's So Ri's birthday soon, right?

389
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:59,750
You remember my family's birthdays better than the multiplication table.

390
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,190
Because I've celebrated them every year.

391
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,300
 Not having a significant other to yourself... 

392
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,460
So Jin, could you get me the abalone from the fridge?

393
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,690
- Okay. 
  - Polyamory. 

394
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,160
 It's one of countless relationship styles. 

395
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,150
 It's all about making things work with the other person. 

396
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,970
 It's about sharing with other people. 

397
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,370
 By saying, "I'm a polyamorist," 

398
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,920
 the girlfriend can argue back. 

399
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,970
 There are many polyamorists abroad and... 
   

400
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:40,480
 I'm also a polyamorist in Korea. 

401
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,410
 I think it's... 

402
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,800
I'll prep the abalone, Hyung.

403
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,520
Huh?

404
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,560
- Okay. 
 - Go over there.

405
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,650
I've done it a lot at Dad's restaurant.

406
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,440
Okay, then.

407
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,600
 Polyamory isn't about having many... 

408
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,620
 I think the man still has feelings, too. 

409
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,340
 I don't think the test was important from the beginning. 

410
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,170
 And don't think, "Why is she sending me this?" 

411
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,870
 - looking at your phone.  
 - How does it taste?

412
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,170
 Just ignore it. 

413
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,410
- It's tasty. 
  - Let's move on to the next letter. 

414
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,760
 "Hello, I'm a woman who's been dating her ideal type for 10 months. 

415
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,070
 We have very different ideas about expressing affection. 

416
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,160
 I like expressing my affection with words and physical contact. 

417
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,060
 But my boyfriend is different than me. 

418
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,450
 When I say I love him, he only says, 'Okay.' 

419
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,310
 I feel so embarrassed whenever that happens. 

420
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,970
 I keep telling him I love him, 

421
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,590
 but my boyfriend never tells me he loves me. 

422
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,170
 Can I trust him and keep seeing him?" 

423
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,770
 That was today's third letter. 

424
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,530
He didn't say "I love you" back to the woman?

425
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,380
I don't understand it.

426
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,800
I know.

427
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,260
It's not like he's never said it before, right?

428
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,080
You can sense a person's feelings, too.

429
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,020
You can just feel it. There's no need to hear it.

430
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,800
I'm on the man's side.

431
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,690
But isn't it natural to express it when the feelings grow?

432
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,830
Your feelings grow the more you express them, too.

433
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,910
You decide to confess your love to someone.

434
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:41,280
And it's a promise not to have a change of heart.

435
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,270
Is he not confident? Why did he start dating her?

436
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,770
 What's so hard about saying, "I love you"? 

437
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,590
 It clearly means it's not love. 

438
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,880
What's easy for someone...

439
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,980
can be difficult for someone else, So Jin.

440
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,920
 You try to alter yourself when you're with someone... 

441
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,840
Why?

442
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,720
You can just say it if you want to.

443
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,910
 They're polyamorist. But polyamorists aren't about exclusivity. 

444
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,560
 Expressing affection is... 

445
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,850
But you confess your love a lot.

446
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,470
I think you started doing that when you were in fourth grade.

447
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,790
When she played a dwarf in a musical,

448
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,540
she fell for the boy who played the prince, I think.

449
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,590
Was his name Ji Hoon?

450
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,680
You were totally smitten by the pianist at the church then.

451
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,490
I think he made 1,000 paper cranes with his own hands.

452
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,890
With these hands. These hands.

453
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,160
What? What? I didn't confess my love like you, at least.

454
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,680
Give me a break. Giving her 1,000 cranes is the same.

455
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,710
What are you talking about?

456
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,130
I'll go wash my hands.

457
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,230
This photo was inside the ice box.

458
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,570
I think So Jin saw it, too.

459
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,250
It's okay to throw it away.

460
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,150
I'm worried.

461
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,360
About what?

462
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,440
That your memory with So Jin would get discarded like that, too.

463
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,050
Let's eat.

464
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,540
Eat the abalone.

465
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:43,840
 Respect the other person's relationship style. 

466
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,930
 That way, you'd be respected for your relationship style, too. 

467
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,790
Yes, Yun Woo. I finished shooting just now.

468
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,240
Should we get a drink?

469
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,400
♫  You're quiet today, too  ♫

470
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,540
♫  I ask you questions, but you won't answer  ♫

471
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,960
♫  I'm so frustrated about it  ♫

472
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,710
♫  What are you thinking, exactly?  ♫

473
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,320
♫  I know you like me  ♫

474
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,040
♫  But I'm not sure sometimes  ♫

475
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:59,460
♫  What I want is hearing how you feel  ♫

476
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:13,170
♫  Why do you refuse to speak?  ♫

477
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:18,520
♫  I feel like I'm the only one who tries  ♫

478
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,660
♫  Do you find love that difficult?  ♫

479
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,660
♫  Why can't you express it?  ♫

480
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:32,660
♫  Do you have the same thoughts as I do?  ♫

481
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,540
♫  I'm curious about that sometimes  ♫

482
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:44,020
♫  Tell me at least once that you...  ♫

483
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,380
So Jin saw this.

484
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,200
Please be careful from now on.

485
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,970
She might get the wrong idea.

486
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,240
Right. I thought you had feelings for Kang Hoon.

487
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,330
Why don't you tell him how you feel?

488
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,880
There's someone I'm interested in,

489
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,010
but it's not Kang Hoon.

490
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,490
He's someone I've known,

491
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:14,780
but he makes me feel like I'm getting to know him again.

492
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,930
A man I want...

493
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,970
for the first time.

494
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,720
Mi Eun,

495
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:35,410
what do you think when you see So Jin and Kang Hoon?

496
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,730
What about them? Are you worried about them?

497
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,920
No, it's not that.

498
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:52,540
They make me wonder if destiny actually exists.

499
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,870
Some people have to try so hard,

500
00:39:54,870 --> 00:40:00,380
but those two probably had a connection since birth.

501
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,630
Is that how they look?

502
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,060
Yes.

503
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:11,200
But aren't you supposed to be So Jin's DNA partner?

504
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,930
DNA lover?

505
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,610
Did So Jin say that?

506
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,870
Yes. I go to the DNA center for skincare. She told me there.

507
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:24,020
She said the DNA she got from your basketball uniform

508
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,110
revealed that you're her DNA partner.

509
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,140
Oh, that?

510
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,650
Long time no see, Coach.

511
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:50,430
I thought you were upset with Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist.

512
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,980
Didn't our poster turn out well?

513
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,730
   

514
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,700
Jung Tam.

515
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,450
Didn't it turn out well?

516
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,460
- Is this why you've been so busy, Sung Mi? 
 - Yes.

517
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,640
Did you say I didn't have to work out, so you can take the photo with another man?

518
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,840
With a c-c-chunk of muscles like him?

519
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,910
I thought you didn't want to do the photoshoot.

520
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:44,110
But still, you did it with another man. How could you do that?

521
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:47,280
Did you think I wouldn't see this? Or you don't care if I do?

522
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,100
You aren't breaking up with me or cheating on me,

523
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,200
but a body profile shoot with someone else?

524
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,320
You don't like working out...

525
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,970
and it was tough for you to come to the gym.

526
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,930
But I already promised Coach to be on the poster.

527
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,550
I had to be responsible and do my best.

528
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:09,180
Once I promise someone, it becomes a promise to myself.

529
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,010
I have to keep it, no matter what.

530
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,220
What are you mistaken about?

531
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,050
Mistaken, my foot.

532
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,400
Jung Tam.

533
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,480
Jung Tam!

534
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,230
 ­  

535
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,880
 Which beach do you want to visit tomorrow? 

536
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,390
Beach I want to visit?

537
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,290
 The water temperature here is the warmest. 

538
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,470
Warm ocean.

539
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:58,050
 Right, there's a red lighthouse on the seawall path there. 

540
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:03,370
 If lovers walk there and return, their love will come true. 

541
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,570
Hold on. He wanted to see the sunrise.

542
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,060
He's suggesting taking an overnight trip, right?

543
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,370
It's moving too fast.

544
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,260
So Jin.

545
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,150
My gosh.

546
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:27,580
Mi Eun, did you have a skincare session?

547
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,370
Could we talk for a moment?

548
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,510
Sure.

549
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,590
I heard you saw the photo of Yun Woo and me.

550
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,630
The photo?

551
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,920
Do you have a photo with Yun Woo, too?

552
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,310
Not yet.

553
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,770
It won't be easy.

554
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:07,890
He never takes photos with his girlfriends, no matter what.

555
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,430
I'm not sure.

556
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,010
We'll have to wait and see about that.

557
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:22,690
Yun Woo and I will go to the beach tomorrow.

558
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:32,400
I'm grateful for the advice you gave me, Mi Eun.

559
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,950
But I won't worry about what kind of relationships he's had before.

560
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:44,110
I'll become his special one and only person.

561
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:49,170
So Jin, are you very anxious about your relationship with him?

562
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,530
- Pardon? 
 - So much...

563
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:57,790
so you'd apply a chemical product called PG or something?

564
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,060
How do you know that...

565
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,470
 I'm sorry. I overheard by chance when I was at the center. 

566
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:10,990
But do you really think he can be changed by that?

567
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:14,030
- That's— 
 - You even did a DNA test...

568
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,790
to prove that he's your DNA partner.

569
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,900
I don't know if that person actually exists,

570
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,400
but if Yun Woo is that person,

571
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,780
I don't think he'd confuse you.

572
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,840
It has nothing to do with Yun Woo.

573
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,890
That's just what I do in relationships.

574
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,860
You're an anxious type.

575
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,030
A woman with an anxious attachment

576
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,800
a man with a commitment issue

577
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,890
make the worst couple.

578
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,660
Commitment issue?

579
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,740
He runs away in critical moments.

580
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,850
Yun Woo and I think relationships are a game.

581
00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:00,740
But no matter how fun, you don't bet your life on a game.

582
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,150
He's not that kind of person.

583
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,970
Are you sure?

584
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:11,120
He never told me he loved me while I dated him for three years.

585
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,010
Because we...

586
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,840
Yun Woo and I didn't try to possess each other.

587
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,170
But you're different.

588
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:24,270
You're the only impassioned one. Can you sustain it?

589
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,900
Yun Woo and I are DNA partners.

590
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,160
We're DNA lovers.

591
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,660
If you really are his destined partner,

592
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,210
he'd do things with you that he's never done with other women.

593
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,470
You can test your destiny with that.

594
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,860
Test my destiny?

595
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:52,200
Shall we talk later? I need to go to my session.

596
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,850
Wait...

597
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:03,400
What's the thing he never did with other women?

598
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,350
Are you curious?

599
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,950
- Yes. 
 - One. He never wears...

600
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,110
matching items.

601
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:17,930
I passed that.

602
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,840
You see this, right?

603
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,790
Two.

604
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,850
He never shares his friends or acquaintances with his girlfriend.

605
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,010
I passed that, too.

606
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:33,240
Yun Woo and I already have many acquaintances in common.

607
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,360
   

608
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:42,830
   

609
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,060
Three.

610
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,210
He never talks about his family.

611
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:58,210
 I want to hear about your family, too. 

612
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,060
 You're dating me, not my family. 

613
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,370
 That'd mean crossing the forbidden line. 
   

614
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,070
And lastly,

615
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:14,650
as I just mentioned, he'd never say...

616
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,770
he loves you.

617
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,800
 I said I love you. 

618
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,800
 I said I love you. So very much. 

619
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,680
He'll do things with me that he's never done with other women.

620
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,590
I'm sure of it.

621
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,520
Good luck.

622
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,290
You need to actually become cool...

623
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:00,170
instead of keep pretending, Han So Jin.

624
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,930
Hand me the suitcase.

625
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,710
Why do you have so much stuff?

626
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,900
It's still an overnight trip.

627
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,430
But I'm not bringing much.

628
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,100
 The mini humidifier you gave me. 

629
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,280
 I need my pillow because I can't sleep if it's too tall. 

630
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,150
The toiletries.

631
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,810
- I packed some bath products, too, and... 
 - Go in! Go in!

632
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:41,390
Sunbae, the Sewer has the promiscuous Octo-gene.

633
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,920
He must be working on his strategy right now.

634
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,170
So, don't forget to play hot and cold.

635
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,020
Hot and cold.

636
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,850
I don't need to do that with my DNA lover.

637
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,120
So pretty.

638
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,000
It's a day trip.

639
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,100
- Pardon? 
 - I said we'll see the ocean.

640
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,900
I don't think I mentioned staying over.

641
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,830
Gosh, the hill is so steep. It's dangerous.

642
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,410
So Jin,

643
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,550
it's a day trip.

644
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:36,500
Stop that, I said.

645
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,340
♫  Every day, would you give me all your heart tonight?  ♫

646
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,590
♫  Yeah, I’ll never give up on your love  ♫

647
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:46,740
♫  In my heart, you’re always with me  ♫

648
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:50,020
♫  Forever, you and I  ♫

649
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,800
♫  Just like this fluttering feeling  ♫

650
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,170
It's looking great.

651
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:59,360
It really looks amazing.

652
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,700
Jump. One, two, three.

653
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:08,700
♫  Like a small dizziness, you shake me up  ♫

654
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,830
   

655
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,300
- Here. 
 - I can't.

656
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,120
You don't know what I'd do. Just come.

657
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,140
Smile.

658
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,110
I'll take one of you from the back.

659
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,370
Okay. Like this.

660
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:29,660
Here.

661
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,610
- Does it look nice? 
 - Take a look.

662
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:34,280
♫  Yeah, I’ll never give up on your love  ♫

663
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,670
Gosh, seriously.

664
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,020
♫  Forever, you and I  ♫

665
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:47,790
♫  Oh, wherever you are, no matter how far you’ve gone  ♫

666
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:50,200
♫  Every day, would you give me all your heart tonight?  ♫

667
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,510
He's actually sweet.

668
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:56,520
♫  I’ll reach you, your heart  ♫

669
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,830
- Should we... 
 - Yes?

670
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,940
walk all the way to the lighthouse right now?

671
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,990
Let's just walk holding hands now...

672
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:05,980
and go later?

673
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,590
Okay.

674
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,320
It's so pretty.

675
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,200
I didn't know you liked ice cream so much.

676
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,800
Should we put this in the middle and take a couple's photo?

677
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,820
- Couple's photo? 
 - Okay.

678
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,710
Look over here.

679
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,600
One, two...

680
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,030
Oh, sorry.

681
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,170
I'm sorry.

682
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,430
It hurts.

683
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,720
What? Let's take another one.

684
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,570
Look here. One, two...

685
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,570
Excuse me. Um...

686
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,970
Could I have a band-aid?

687
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:01,530
Come on. You hate taking photos so much.

688
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,500
How did you and Mi Eun take one?

689
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,540
What?

690
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,340
Are you jealous right now, by chance?

691
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:14,120
When you and Kang Hoon were wearing the matching purple hoodies,

692
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,470
I didn't read into it at all.

693
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,340
You probably weren't curious.

694
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,940
Because you never feel jealous at all.

695
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,620
It's not like that.

696
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:26,150
Your relationship with Kang Hoon is a part of you. So, I didn't want to intrude.

697
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:29,700
 We're a couple. How could you not care? 

698
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,310
 He's so cool that he's about to freeze to death. 

699
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,820
Welco—

700
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,810
Drink slowly. It'll give you heartburn.

701
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:11,200
Did you know those two went on a trip together today?

702
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,710
I'm talking about Yun Woo and So Jin.

703
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:20,050
They left for an overnight trip to the seaside.

704
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,990
What about it?

705
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:28,150
I know.

706
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,330
What's the big deal?

707
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,820
Yun Woo went on a trip with another woman.

708
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,590
It's nothing new.

709
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:40,090
I've always found it strange.

710
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,370
But it's even stranger today.

711
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:45,620
Do you really like Yun Woo?

712
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,110
If so, you'd better give up.

713
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:55,840
Yun Woo and So Jin love each other, and they'll stay together.

714
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,540
How about you?

715
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,650
Do you think you could give up on So Jin?

716
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:06,000
Will you no longer have feelings if you keep ignoring them?

717
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,880
I'm sorry, but you're not that type, Kang Hoon.

718
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,540
I didn't say my feelings would disappear.

719
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,140
I'll go if you're done.

720
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,030
Those two...

721
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:31,440
Do you think they're really meant to be?

722
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:39,040
Are they...

723
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:44,400
really destined partners?

724
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,610
It's really nice to see.

725
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:00,670
I hope I'll be like that, too.

726
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,250
After the children grow up,

727
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:09,650
I'll walk holding hands with my husband at sunset.

728
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:13,320
Looks like you've been here often.

729
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,160
No, I've been here just once.

730
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:21,000
It was a family trip.

731
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,190
But I keep seeing it in my dreams these days.

732
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:29,530
I looked very happy in my dream.

733
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:32,240
That's why I wanted to come back.

734
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,260
 Catch me, catch me. 

735
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,520
 I'll catch you! I'll catch you! 

736
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,690
 I'll catch you! 

737
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:08,350
It feels like my bad memories will get erased when I'm here.

738
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:11,230
Is it because the water is the warmest here?

739
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:24,740
Yun Woo, should we send a postcard through the slow mailbox?

740
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,750
   

741
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,310
It will arrive a year later if you send it now.

742
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,890
A year later? What should I write?

743
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:46,410
You can write a promise, maybe.

744
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:48,600
One you want to keep a year later.

745
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,270
I don't believe in promises.

746
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,470
Just write what you want to write now.

747
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,740
I can write to you one year in the future, right?

748
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,130
   

749
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:22,630
I think we should keep an eye on her.

750
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:25,430
Yes, I'm out right now.

751
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:29,290
Yes, I think it might be an issue.

752
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,840
If so,

753
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,450
keep an eye on her condition and let me know.

754
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,530
   

755
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,560
 To So Jin from a year in the future. 

756
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:51,670
 I wish I could be by your side a year later, 

757
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:54,420
 but if it's not me, 

758
00:58:54,420 --> 00:59:00,400
 I hope he's someone who could care for you for the rest of your life. 

759
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,900
Okay.

760
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,870
So Jin?

761
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,450
Do you have...

762
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:25,880
so little hope for our future, Yun Woo?

763
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:30,250
- What do you mean— 
 - A relationship that can end anytime.

764
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:36,600
I suppose that's the relationship style you prefer.

765
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,620
What do you mean by that?

766
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,160
It's because I'm not certain.

767
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:47,010
You never said you loved me throughout the relationship.

768
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:51,130
You're always ready for the moment to break up.

769
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,520
- Do you not trust me? 
 - I want to.

770
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,770
So, prove yourself to me.

771
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,890
I want to hear it.

772
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:05,180
I want to hear you say you love me.

773
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,560
Just one moment.

774
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,100
- Yes. 
  - I gave her the emergency treatment as you said, 

775
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,760
 but the mother's condition looks serious. 

776
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,380
 I think the placenta is blocking the uterus opening. 

777
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:23,930
 Dr. Choi stepped out, but I can't reach her. 

778
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:26,310
Okay, I'll be right there.

779
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:27,760
Okay.

780
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,340
- I'm sorry, So Jin. 
 - Let's go.

781
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:08,640
Hey, hey.

782
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,250
Looks like something's going on.

783
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,570
You should go comfort her.

784
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:18,110
You know her. Will you just let her get drunk alone like that?

785
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,420
What's going on?

786
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:33,730
W-What's wrong?

787
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:37,600
This happens sometimes these days. Is it because I'm tired?

788
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:45,970
You don't have a narrower vision...

789
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:49,840
or having difficulty identifying objects, right?

790
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,460
Are you thinking about the RP gene right now?

791
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,070
You have the RP gene, Yun Woo.

792
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:00,560
You never know when it'll get activated.

793
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,110
I'm okay, So Jin.

794
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,750
I'm okay.

795
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,480
Let's keep holding hands.

796
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,780
I just want to.

797
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,810
Okay.

798
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,500
Your temperature drops when you drink.

799
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:28,350
You know what?

800
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:34,670
Dr. Shim... I mean, Yun Woo.

801
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:36,610
Yun Woo's destiny...

802
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,550
isn't...

803
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,510
meant to be with So Jin.

804
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:46,070
Well...

805
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:51,520
the uniform So Jin stole and tested...

806
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,290
That's...

807
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:57,110
yours.

808
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:03,670
It's your DNA, I mean.

809
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,100
 That wasn't my uniform. 

810
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,000
- What? 
 - She took Kang Hoon's uniform...

811
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,610
thinking it was mine.

812
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:20,150
 Who wore this one, by the way? 

813
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:24,700
This is the one I wore. It got torn in the last game.

814
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,070
You should've given this to me.

815
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,950
Oh, it's okay.

816
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:33,650
It's not my DNA, but Kang Hoon's.

817
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:38,180
Is that why they're so in sync?

818
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:43,820
So, So Jin's DNA lover is...

819
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:46,390
not Yun Woo, but...

820
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,670
it's you, Seo Kang Hoon.

821
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,790
You get it now, right?

822
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:56,990


823
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:05,680
 And there was another hurdle between us. 

824
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:12,100
♫  Oh, baby, tell me now, say that nothing will change  ♫

825
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:18,410
♫  I can’t escape, hold me tight  ♫

826
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:25,050
♫  I was wandering alone, but you came to me like a dream  ♫

827
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:31,590
♫  I just want to rest in your embrace  ♫

828
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:34,870
♫  I fell for you like someone who is bewitched  ♫

829
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:38,000
♫  Hesitant steps, though I wish for more  ♫

830
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,530
♫  I was so afraid of falling deeper  ♫

831
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,170
♫  Now, even the smallest space without you  ♫

832
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,340
   

833
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,950
 The uniform wasn't Yun Woo's, but Kang Hoon's? 

834
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:56,600
 Yun Woo, should we meet using the telepathy? 

835
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,220
 Sounds good. 

836
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,940
 It wasn't a coincidence. 

837
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:04,430
 He's been pretending to be my DNA lover for me. 

838
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:06,330
 How can you say that was for me? 

839
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:08,570
 He probably didn't do that on purpose, either. 

840
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,570
 It's because he likes you. 

841
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:14,190
 Yun Woo, are you confident you won't hurt So Jin? 

842
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:17,700
 She's looking for the one she'll spend the rest of her life with. 

843
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,880
 What's important is that I don't want to break up with her yet. 

844
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:26,060
♫  Oh, baby, tell me now  ♫
