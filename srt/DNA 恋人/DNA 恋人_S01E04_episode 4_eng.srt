1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
   

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,610
   

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,990
   

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,580
   

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,040
   

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,040
   

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,850
   

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,470
   

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,500
He may not be visible,

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,200
but our resurrected Lord is always with us through the Holy Spirit,

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,860
and He has been protecting and comforting those of us who are weary of life.

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,440
Let us remember once again.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,380
Our Lord said His world doesn't belong in this world.

14
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,850
Thus, the people of heaven, where our Lord is king, are living in this world,

15
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,340
but we don’t belong to this world.

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,090
The people who worship our Lord as their king listen to Him,

17
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,640
keep His words in their hearts, and live by them.

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,030
What brings you here?

19
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,280
I wanted to ask God something.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,240
What could that be?

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,860
Our Lord, who comforts...

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,050
The Octo-gene was found.

23
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,770
In my man of my pheromone.

24
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:33,150
- Dear Lord. 
 - Let us pray before we rest.

25
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,380
 Amen. 

26
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,000
Who will cure and comfort me, God?

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,920
We look forward to your sermon next week.

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,750
Yes, get home safely.

29
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,060
Let's go.

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:02,090


31
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,410
Thank you. Take care. 
    

32
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,260
Sister.

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,400
You often come, but you always sit in the back.

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,680
Take care.

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,280
 There's no way. 

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,150
No, something went wrong.

37
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,450
His immune system was a perfect match for me.

38
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,850
Sunbae, won't you get ready for work?

39
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,200
   

40
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,900
   

41
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,230
Oh Sang Min was just a preview.

42
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,320
This man...

43
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,570
What's the answer?

44
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,620
What am I supposed to do?

45
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,380
What do you mean?

46
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,810
Your DNA lover likely has the cheater gene.

47
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,900
Just accept it. It's easier to just accept it.

48
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,430
A cheater is my DNA lover?

49
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,470
If I get involved with a cheater again,

50
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,480
I’ll get hurt, and if I get dumped again...

51
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,800
No, that can't happen!

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,190
That can't happen!

53
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,310
   

54
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,680
It really can't happen.

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,060
Not this time.

56
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,040
Why must it be me?

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,590
   

58
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,270
 Shim Gynecology puts the parents and children first. 

59
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,810
 I'll be there throughout pregnancy and childbirth. 

60
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,270
 I'll alleviate the pain and concern in the process... 

61
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,130
 We're doing our best so you can trust us during childbirth. 
   

62
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,020
 The medical professionals with various experiences are on stand-by 24/7. 

63
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,970
 Shim Gynecology provides all kinds of 

64
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,990
 post-natal care. 
   

65
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,230
You haven't heard from Lucky's mom yet, right?

66
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,640
I can't believe her.

67
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,310
Where did she go while she was still swollen?

68
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,310
Have you contacted the priest who visited the hospital as her guardian?

69
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,230
Yes, he paid for all the hospital bills.

70
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,320
Looks like he's looking for Lucky's mom everywhere.

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,230
I got a call from Nurse Park.

72
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,350
Lucky was apparently moved to ICU since he was sick all night.

73
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,430
Let's go there together.

74
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,870
Together?

75
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,680
Lord, please protect our beloved child with your grace.

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,800
In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray, amen.

77
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,450
You'll end up becoming Lucky's dad at this rate.

78
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,880
Is Lucky doing okay?

79
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,530
He was sick all night,

80
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,950
but he’ll hang in there because you worry about him every day.

81
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,490
He's the priest I just mentioned.

82
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,920
I've heard a lot about you.

83
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,120
I'm Shim Yun Woo, Lucky's doctor.

84
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,610
I'm Andrea.

85
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,320
I'm so grateful for your care,

86
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,470
but if we can't reach the mother by next week,

87
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,540
Lucky will be sent to a child welfare institution.

88
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,530
He'll go through an adoption process immediately.

89
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,840
Adoption?

90
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,690
Yes, he'll find good parents who won't abandon him this time.

91
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,340
He'll be full of luck, just like his name, too.

92
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,180
We ask you to pray for him.

93
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,490
- Okay. 
 - Well, then...

94
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,140
They're marsh marigolds.

95
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,720
Can you just tell?

96
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,500
You really know everything, Assistant Director.

97
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,710
Who sent it?

98
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,720
It doesn't have a sender's name,

99
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,320
but Ms. Oh gave out fruit juice to our department because she gave birth today.

100
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,700
Maybe she sent that plant to you as a gift.

101
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,200
That eye symbol must be a flower shop logo.

102
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,740
There's a pre-meeting for the lecture with the DNA center today.

103
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,660
Okay, got it.

104
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,170
Why is she so quiet today?

105
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,440
The test results must've come out already.

106
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,560
This is actually the most important agenda of the day.

107
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,920
We’ll have a presentation with Shim Hospital regarding

108
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,480
egg freezing and pregnancy.

109
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,530
So I'll send someone to Shim Hospital

110
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,390
as a consultant and speaker for the DNA testing lecture.

111
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,010
Team Leader Yoon, what do you say?

112
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,020
I have a conference at the Female Cancer Center.

113
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,180
Conference? If so...

114
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,400
Team Leader Han should do it.

115
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,980
Team Leader Han?

116
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,760
Yes...

117
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm busy because I'm doing pre-birth tests for Shim Hospital.

118
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,800
Right, right. You've been working with Shim Hospital.

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,750
It'd be nice to work with them for this event, too. Don't you think?

120
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,730
I'll go with Ah Ri, then.

121
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,490
Ah Ri?

122
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,400
Can you go?

123
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,920
Don't worry, BK.

124
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll take good care of her and the event.

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,850
I'd love for Ah Ri to join you.

126
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,820
Let's say everyone agrees and end the meeting now.

127
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,720
Hey!

128
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,950
Ah Ri!

129
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,980
Why should I deal with strangers for days?

130
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,040
He has the promiscuous Octo-gene, but I can't move on from him yet.

131
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,900
You can just date him, then.

132
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,870
Anyway, I won't go.

133
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,400
It's because I don't have the confidence to date the Octo-gene!

134
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,380
What am I supposed to do?

135
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,200
It must've been difficult.

136
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,610
Wear slippers instead of sneakers from now on, okay?

137
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,300
And don't put on socks or cut toenails yourself.

138
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,680
What's a husband good for? He's supposed to do this stuff.

139
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,750
Please let me know if you need anything.

140
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,660
What's with that knowing look?

141
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,360
Well, a doctor should be friendly to his patient.

142
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,380
Illnesses and developmental issues of the fetus 
    

143
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,590
that we didn’t know about can be diagnosed.

144
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,550
It allows early treatments and the mothers to decide.

145
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,990
Through collaboration with Irowoon DNA Center, increasing the pregnancy rate

146
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,850
and providing mothers with options and happiness has become possible. 
    

147
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,560
Here are the ones who will be the DNA test consultants and lecture speakers.

148
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,920
Irowoon DNA Center's Team Leader, Han So Jin, and researcher, Son Ah Ri.

149
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,240
A round of applause, please.

150
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,430
They're only interested in the reward.

151
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,820
Is this how you manage your women?

152
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,080
Manage women?

153
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,750
A lot of single women are inquiring about egg freezing these days.

154
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,750
Being able to extract eggs while they're healthy, freeze them to preserve them,

155
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:23,550
and get pregnant when they choose should be a woman's right.

156
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,260
We can choose a healthy embryo through the PGT test,

157
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,800
increasing the pregnancy rate and the chances of giving birth to a child with healthy genes.

158
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,690
The PGT-A test is...

159
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:39,750
recommended to older women and women who failed IVF treatment before.

160
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,280
That's why Shim Hospital and the DNA center will 
    

161
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,600
give a presentation to the members. 
    

162
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,500
Team Leader Han So Jin.

163
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,480
Team Leader Han So Jin?

164
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,900
- Yes. 
 - You'll give...

165
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,650
a lecture on preimplantation genetic testing, correct?

166
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:04,220
Yes, PGT. Preimplantation genetic testing is...

167
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,520
a pre-test done before IVF and implantation

168
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,500
when genetic diseases from the parents were confirmed.

169
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,000
 The test result must've come out, but she won't contact me. 

170
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,680
 She came all the way here, but she won't even mention it. 

171
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,800
 What's going on? 

172
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,200
I'm planning to prepare PGT-SR and PGT-M for each case.

173
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,330
I'm very much looking forward to it, Team Leader Han.

174
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,070
Another round of applause, please.

175
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,510
   

176
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,100
Why did you bring me here and give me a hard time?

177
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,970
Was I supposed to come alone, then?

178
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,780
Gosh.

179
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,960
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

180
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,850
Gosh.

181
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,600
The Sewer must've seduced them so much that all women think of him as a man,

182
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,780
not a colleague.

183
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,000
Seriously.

184
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,240
- Gosh, here he comes! 
 - Let's hurry up.

185
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,650
Hurry, hurry!

186
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,270
What's wrong with her?

187
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,570
   

188
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,150
Yes?

189
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,030
- Hello, Doctor. 
 - Hello.

190
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,010
Aren't you the one from the gym?

191
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,770
So you remember me.

192
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,800
I saw your name on the chart and wondered if it'd be you.

193
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,290
Let me introduce myself formally.

194
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,740
I'm Yuh Jung Tam, a neurosecretion specialist.

195
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,860
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

196
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,030
- Have a seat. 
 - No, I'm okay.

197
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,740
Have a seat. Have a seat.

198
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,180
- Thank you. 
 - Of course.

199
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,770
So, you want estrogen shots?

200
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,740
Well, yes.

201
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,480
Maybe it's because I've been training for an MMA match.

202
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,280
I haven't had a period in two and a half months.

203
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,020
It's probably due to the hypothalamic-pituitary disorder.

204
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,240
It's a normal condition. You don't have to worry.

205
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,230
Get a period-inducing shot instead of an estrogen shot, and—

206
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,620
No! I really want it.

207
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,890
I really want the estrogen shot.

208
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,170
Why? Is there a reason why you have to?

209
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,200
The thing is...

210
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,890
Feel free to talk to me.

211
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,800
I've been told I was boyish since I was a kid.

212
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,590
- I see. 
 - I don't think I've been into...

213
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,590
men as much as other women.

214
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:02,310
So, I often wonder if I'm actually a woman.

215
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,080
W-Who? You do?

216
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,100
Yes.

217
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,790
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

218
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,980
You're the coolest woman I've ever met.

219
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,480
I can't believe you don't know...

220
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,940
How could you possibly not know that?

221
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,950
I'll make sure to treat what you're concerned about. Don't worry.

222
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,990
Okay, thank you.

223
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,720
Sure.

224
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,460
 Didn't you hear the fire warning? 

225
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,240
 Is the emergency speaker just a decoration? 

226
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,870
 You can't just disconnect that. 

227
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,250
- Yes, Mi Eun. 
  - Yun Woo. 

228
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,640
 There was a fire at my office. 

229
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,680
What? Fire?

230
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,110
Yes, but I met a brave firefighter.

231
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,290
Are you okay? Are you hurt at all?

232
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,140
 You should confirm that in person. 

233
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,930
Buy me something tasty since I almost died.

234
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,750
 What a relief. What are you craving? 

235
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,240
- Sushi? 
 - I'll have dinner before I go home.

236
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,600
The food truck is coming today.

237
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,710
No, the Hillside Twisted Potatoes aren't just potatoes.

238
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,540
The food truck owner grows them with love and devotion at a high altitude in Gangwon-do,

239
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,640
and he preps the yellow potatoes himself.

240
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,340
Unfortunately, he travels around the country.

241
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,470
He only comes by my chapel only on the first and third Fridays.

242
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,020
The fluffy, sweet, and fresh high-altitude potatoes.

243
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,030
The owner calculated the gap and thickness perfectly.

244
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,920
The perfect temperature of the oil and sizzling. All of these...

245
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,500
can be enjoyed in person.

246
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,300
It's God's grace.

247
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,230
I'll see you later.

248
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,250
Here you go. Enjoy.

249
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,580
Get home safely.

250
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,120
Thank you. Take care.

251
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
Hello.

252
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,840
The honey butter one.

253
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,740
Thank you so much.

254
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,650
Hello, which flavor would you like?

255
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,740
One original, please.

256
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,530
What a great choice.

257
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,880
It's very hot. Be careful.

258
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,160
Okay, thank you. Get home safely.

259
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,320
- Yes, hello. 
 - One honey butter, please.

260
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,640
I'm sorry, we ran out of the ingredients.

261
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,820
Come back two weeks later.

262
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,410
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

263
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,540
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

264
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,630
Are you okay?

265
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,310
- Sorry! 
 - I'm sorry.

266
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,060
My twisted potato...

267
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,270
Are you okay?

268
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,110
Have this, Sister Anna.

269
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,540
   

270
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,050
It's okay. Take it.

271
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,800
Thank you.

272
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,640
Thank you!

273
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,170
Father.

274
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,420
- Hey, you came. 
 - Yes.

275
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,530
Father, I'm here. Hyung, you came.

276
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,790
You save people during the day

277
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,570
and help Father at night. When do you go on dates?

278
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,360
I know, Yun Woo. You should get him a girlfriend.

279
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,940
This punk refuses to date.

280
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,500
Why don't you?

281
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,750
I said I didn't want to start what I couldn't be responsible for.

282
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,530
What is this, the Joseon era?

283
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,140
What does the era have to do with this?

284
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,300
You're aging too quickly. You need to get married quickly.

285
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,850
We're all aging, anyway. Why does it matter?

286
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,190
And I resemble you, okay?

287
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,980
You can't age if you resemble me.

288
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,680
- I'm aging because I resemble you. 
 - He looks old, doesn't he?

289
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,510
He looks a bit older than me.

290
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,270
- Did you come alone? 
 - Well...

291
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,290
- Someone will be joining me. 
 - Who?

292
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,370
There she comes.

293
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,210
Hey, Yun Woo.

294
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,040
Can't believe I'm meeting the man who saved my life here.

295
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,450
Did he save your life? Do you know each other?

296
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,690
I said there's a brave firefighter who saved me.

297
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,050
She's the one I saved from the fire yesterday.

298
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,370
Let me introduce you. This is my favorite friend, Seo Kang Hoon.

299
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,600
This is...

300
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,770
Mr. Seo Kang Hoon.

301
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,820
Hello, I'm Jang Mi Eun.

302
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,590
Did you fix the emergency speaker?

303
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,920
Not yet.

304
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,520
It's a perfect spot to hang a frame.

305
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,950
You'll hang a frame where the speaker goes?

306
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,110
I was kidding. I fixed it.

307
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,830
I noticed you were burning a scented candle with the windows closed.

308
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,500
Remember that scented candles release more carbon monoxide than regular candles.

309
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,380
You can't burn it for more than 15 minutes.

310
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,190
Yun Woo, does he usually worry a lot?

311
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,350
He used to be worse... Have a seat.

312
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,840
But what's he doing at a sushi restaurant—

313
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,650
He's helping his father's business.

314
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,330
I see. He's his father.

315
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,710
What a nice restaurant.

316
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,890
I'll come often from now on.

317
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,540
How old are you?

318
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,480
It must be a secret.

319
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,740
28? No, 29.

320
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,930
He's a baby.

321
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,730
I'm not a baby, and I don't like people talking to me semi-formally.

322
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,140
- What would you like? 
 - A salmon and tuna combo.

323
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,970
And warm sake, too.

324
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,820
Okay.

325
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,660
No, come on.

326
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,230
He'll never fall for it.

327
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,410
I resemble you, okay?

328
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,110
Come on.

329
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,930
Someone like him gets aggressive once he crosses the line.

330
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,440
 Everyone has a right to be forgotten. 

331
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,200
 You barely remember him. Did you already forget? 

332
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,320
What are you thinking about?

333
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,270
It's nothing.

334
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,030
I know.

335
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,250
Is it the nerdy researcher?

336
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,750
No.

337
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,020
 If prenatal education is necessary, 

338
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,240
 I recommend that the father be in charge of it. 

339
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,770
 The mother feels happiest when her husband protects and loves her. 

340
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,250
 And the fetus will feel that inside her, too. 

341
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,780
 You get to see a man’s true love for a woman 

342
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,230
 during pregnancy, not while they’re still dating. 

343
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,560
Why would a man like this have the Octo-gene?

344
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,180
Why? Why?

345
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,440
Why?

346
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,230
His public comment doesn't reflect his personal life.

347
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,540
You can't trust a man who speaks...

348
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,780
way too beautifully.

349
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:36,370
Maybe his Octo-gene went dormant while he was experiencing

350
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,650
the miracle of childbirth as a gynecologist.

351
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,770
What a beautiful story is that?

352
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,480
How are you?

353
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,620
Will you be attending this lecture, Director?

354
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,820
You do fine on your own. Why should I?

355
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,950
I'm thinking of having a prenatal genetic consultant symposium early next year.

356
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,910
You can let Dr. Choi be in charge.

357
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,070
I'll be taking a break next year.

358
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:56,240
- A break? 
 - I should have fun before I go independent.

359
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,650
Independent? This is your hospital.

360
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,140
No way.

361
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,340
Should I be an obstetrician my whole life?

362
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,280
Are you free this evening? Should we have dinner together?

363
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,670
I have a plan.

364
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,370
Really?

365
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,320
Let's have dinner sometime soon, then.

366
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,180
Okay.

367
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:35,500
Oh, right, Director! Looks like you have a long-term girlfriend this time.

368
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,310
I never intended to have short-term relationships.

369
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,750
You're my son.

370
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,250
You probably can't live with a woman without love.

371
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,360
Not all women are the same.

372
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,850
There's someone who drives you crazy.

373
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,410
Bye.

374
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm addicted.

375
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,510
I'll never have rose carbonara again.

376
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,900
Are you okay?

377
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,470
I'm okay.

378
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,690
Ms. Yum, you requested the anti-aging food therapy program.

379
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,160
You're severely underweight. The food therapy won't be—

380
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,500
I don't like having extra fat.

381
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,940
Extra fat?

382
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,710
Your body fat percentage is way below average.

383
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,100
Let me just do it.

384
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,390
In addition, you can't take an anorectic like this.

385
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,500
Hormonal imbalance might cause depression—

386
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,360
I hear you. I just...

387
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,500
I just want you to do it.

388
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,070
My husband doesn't like women with extra fat.

389
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,460
He likes model-like women.

390
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,410
Not someone wrinkly and flabby like me.

391
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,740
He has a woman who's younger than his son.

392
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:56,390
Can you imagine what he must think of me?

393
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,370
Is your husband...

394
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,130
At first,

395
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,600
he acted like he'd only look at me.

396
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,380
He wasn’t interested in women,

397
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:20,400
and he couldn’t handle liquor, either. But...

398
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,850
it first happened when I was pregnant.

399
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,150
It wasn't necessarily cheating.

400
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,650
He got caught right away and begged for forgiveness.

401
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,130
But that was just the beginning.

402
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,030
They're the problem.

403
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,520
Looking at another woman because the wife gained weight from childbirth.

404
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,840
They age, too, but they hate to see women aging. Those bastards!

405
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,450
Promiscuous Octo-gene is the cause of all evil.

406
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:53,620
I should chew up all those evil bastards...

407
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,410
Is the Sewer also evil, then?

408
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,780
Who's this?

409
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,700
Who keeps talking about me?

410
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,900
   

411
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,750
Da Mi! Da Mi! Da Mi, listen to me!

412
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,130
Who's Kim Hui Yun, then?

413
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,620
You said you broke up. Why does she text you?

414
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,460
She's always been obsessive. Do you know what her nickname is?

415
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,000
It's the French bulldog. The French bulldog.

416
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,740
Once she bites, she never lets go.

417
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,590
Call her right now, then.

418
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,540
I want her to tell me whether you're seeing her or not.

419
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,090
You're the only one for me.

420
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,820
Should I write that in blood or something?

421
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,290
Call her, you bastard!

422
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,570
I'll call her for you.

423
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,120
I'll call Ms. Kim Hui Yun.

424
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,720
What are you doing right now?

425
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,040
Hey, Hui Yun?

426
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,400
 Yes, Sunbae? 

427
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,850
Oh Sang Min is in front of me right now.

428
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:09,310
I was curious if you were still dating.

429
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,540
 Why is Sang Min Oppa with you, Sunbae? 
   

430
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,540
Well, I happened to run into him.

431
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,760
 Of course, we're still dating. 

432
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,350
 We planned to visit Iceland to see the northern lights next year. 

433
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,830
Oh Sang Min, have you been two-timing?

434
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,800
You suggested we go to Iceland, too!

435
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,700
 Oppa? Who are you with right now? 

436
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,970
 Who's that woman? Huh? 

437
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,380
 Hello, hell— 

438
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,280
Hey, Oh Sang Min!

439
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,830
You said you found true love when you broke up with me.

440
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,260
You said that was Hui Yun.

441
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,070
But you cheated on Hui Yun with someone else again?

442
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,310
- Shut your mouth. 
 - You've always done this, haven't you?

443
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,810
How many women were you seeing while with me?

444
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,480
Never mind. I don't want to know.

445
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,250
I don't even want to remember my time with trash like you.

446
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,510
I said shut up.

447
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,710
Han So Jin, I won't forgive you. Wait and see.

448
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,890
Da Mi! Da Mi!

449
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,240
Da Mi, no! No, no.

450
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,710
I didn't mean it like that.

451
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,760
- So... 
 - Hold on, you can't leave like that. Please...

452
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,280
I should definitely end this.

453
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,610
Falling for the promiscuous Octo-gene is the end of me.

454
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,480
 According to the DNA test, 

455
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,700
 you have DRD4-7R, the promiscuous Octo-genes. 

456
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,510
 You have seven Promiscuous Octo-genes. 

457
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,070
Only 2% of the world's population has that many.

458
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,350
What I recommend you is...

459
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,000
meditating and staying at a temple to reflect on your actions.

460
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,380
Food items I don’t recommend are eel, chives, and oysters.

461
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,280
What's she talking about now?

462
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,050
This isn't right. This isn't right.

463
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,960
 Ms. Han, I think you owe me an explanation. Where are you? 

464
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,110
 Let's meet at the park we went to last time. 

465
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,480
- Ms. Han. 
 - Yes.

466
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,230
I think you need to explain the test result to me.

467
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,480
E-Explain?

468
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,810
Isn't explaining your duty as a researcher?

469
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,560
You know...

470
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:12,740
I plan to stay with my other half, even if

471
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,250
he catches a rare or incurable disease.

472
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,970
But...

473
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,850
he can't have the Octo-gene.

474
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,690
I only agreed to be tested.

475
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,660
But you were already dating me while running the test.

476
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,470
I don't know what those Octo-gene bearers did to you,

477
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,580
but you're supposed to put trash in the trash can.

478
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,450
You can't meet someone nice if you live with wounds.

479
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:50,660
Some wounds can last forever if you are too devoted to love.

480
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,230
Being wounded requires consent, too.

481
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,310
I'm doing this experiment...

482
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,060
because I don't want to get hurt, either.

483
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,710
I don't want to be wounded without consent and hurt anymore.

484
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,320
I'll test every man I meet from now on, too.

485
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,930
Rather than someone's feeling— I mean, my feeling,

486
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,110
I trust DNA more.

487
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,590
Because DNA is the only thing that doesn't change.

488
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:34,250
But this is kind of shocking and unfair.

489
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:40,380
I was labeled as a cheater even before we started.

490
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:47,030
You might not cheat now,

491
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:51,780
but you definitely will someday.

492
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,850
You might cheat the rest of your life as long as the gene is activated.

493
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,230
It's not whether you do or not.

494
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:02,520
It's only a matter of time.

495
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,950
That's why I can't start a relationship with anyone who has the Octo-gene.

496
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,730
I think I told you this isn't how you start a relationship.

497
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,760
Besides the promiscuous Octo-gene,

498
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,230
what do you know about me?

499
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,630
I believe in DNA.

500
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,020
 You're my son. 

501
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,800
 You probably can't live with a woman without love. 

502
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,900
If you frame people and make up your mind like this,

503
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,710
I'm no longer interested.

504
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,460
Hold on.

505
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,960
Yun Woo!

506
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,870
We keep running into each other.

507
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,050
Aren't you here with someone?

508
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,810
Go to the man who's waiting for you.

509
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,240
I'd rather be alone today.

510
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,490
I'll have the one I reserved.

511
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,080
Okay.

512
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,290
Something happened, right?

513
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,610
It's not much.

514
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,630
I feel angry for some reason.

515
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,270
Mi Eun.

516
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,920
Yes.

517
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,800
Do you think I'm a cheater, too?

518
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,140
You're good at noticing what's attractive about a woman.

519
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,930
Whether she's old or young.

520
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,020
Your exes probably can't forget you.

521
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,530
Why does it always end so badly, then?

522
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,380
Breakups are always dirty.

523
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,800
Relationships are dirty. That means it's love.

524
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:21,210
By the way, who's bothering you this much?

525
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,180
I wonder.

526
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,400
She bothers me for some reason.

527
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,510
Cheers.

528
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,310
How about him?

529
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:39,120
He knew we'd break up the moment we came here.

530
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,790
I'll just enjoy the music tonight.

531
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,530
Noona.

532
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,670
What are you doing up there this time?

533
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,440
What are you doing?

534
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,800
Kang Hoon.

535
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,570
Yes, tell me what's going on.

536
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,760
Do you think so, too?

537
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:29,530
That you need to say goodbye when you feel bad and sad?

538
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,340
 That's when you're supposed to say goodbye. 

539
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,120
 When you feel bad and sad. 

540
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,720
 Not when you grow tired and angry. 

541
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,630
What do you mean by that?

542
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,020
I just remembered what someone told me.

543
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,540
Who said that?

544
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:55,590
I guess I don't know when to say goodbye.

545
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:01,440
I stay with men until I obsess over them.

546
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,790
So I planned to end it before that this time.

547
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,700
But...

548
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,810
I still don't feel so good.

549
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:26,250
Geez, you fool! You're thinking too much.

550
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,980
You caused trouble again, didn't you?

551
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,410
When will you stop regretting things?

552
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,290
It's not like that. I've been busy experimenting these days.

553
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:37,820
It was to find my DNA lover.

554
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,560
I told you not to experiment with people.

555
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:49,780
"Experience is the mother of all knowledge. Wisdom is the daughter of experience."

556
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,970
Leonardo da Vinci.

557
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,470
Han So Jin.

558
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,150
What?

559
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,210
You can't discover fate through experiments.

560
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,100
When you know someone, you see your fate, too.

561
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,730
Let's get going.

562
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,790
Come on.

563
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,650
Did you change the fabric softener?

564
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,680
You smell floral.

565
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,130
Noona. Don't do that to other men.

566
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,680
They'll call you a pervert.

567
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,460
I've been told that already.

568
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,900
You've been slacking off from training, haven't you?

569
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,110
You fell while catching me.

570
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:58,590
You must've grown this much more.

571
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,720
Excuse me, I stopped growing at age 16, and my weight hasn't changed.

572
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,370
Oh, really?

573
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:08,250
Is that why your taste in men hasn't changed?

574
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,800
Follow me.

575
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,300
 Everyone has someone with genes who gives them hell. 

576
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,850
 If someone has genes like that, 

577
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,440
 you have to cut ties with them. 

578
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,090
♫  A dream within a dream within a dream within a dream  ♫

579
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,320
 Say hello, Team Leader Han. It's Dr. Shim Yun Woo. 

580
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,440
   

581
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,830
♫  Passing through a long oblivion, it’s my dream  ♫

582
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,920
♫  Time has crumbled on the horizon  ♫

583
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,020
 This is the normal hair, and the other is the Super Teol hair. 

584
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,020
 If you could figure it out by touching— 

585
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,850
♫  Look at me walking through the long desert, following your footsteps  ♫

586
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,980
♫  You shatter and appear everywhere  ♫

587
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,070
♫  You shatter and appear everywhere  ♫

588
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:18,500
♫  In the eyes of a girl, in the entrails of a beast  ♫

589
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,170
♫  With the branches swaying in the harsh northern wind  ♫

590
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,990
♫  Scatter, disperse  ♫

591
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,670
   

592
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:50,970
♫  Where is the key that opens the door to the sky?  ♫

593
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:54,380
Optimism 7?

594
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,130
This is an optimistic gene.

595
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,370
Yun Woo had an optimistic gene?

596
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,230
Really?

597
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:16,020
 Everyone is born with a gene that makes them unhappy, like an Achilles' heel. 

598
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:32,140
 And everyone has someone with the genes that could heal them. 

599
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:39,260
 I call that gene "Healer." 

600
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,320
 I call it the healer. 

601
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,040
 Out of countless men, 

602
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,800
 I found the man with a gene that could heal me. 

603
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:59,080
OPTG7 is a healer gene that can heal my dying gene.

604
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,730
 The man with the promiscuous Octo-gene 

605
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,120
was my healer.

606
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:16,280
 If you frame people and make up your mind like this, 

607
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,970
 I'm no longer interested. 

608
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,100
But we're over now.

609
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,080
Shinhon's heartbeat is so strong, isn't it, Doc?

610
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,830
It is.

611
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:47,840
Your prenatal test result will come out tomorrow.

612
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,060
Meet me at the DNA center directly.

613
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,600
The nurse will tell you when and where.

614
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,370
- Okay, Doctor. 
 - See you tomorrow.

615
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:04,540
What a pretty plant, by the way.

616
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,210
- Noona. 
 - Gosh!

617
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,700
Why are you so scared?

618
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,930
I mean, I thought someone was following me.

619
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,610
Don't take this route for now.

620
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:52,440
A female college student was kidnapped here and called in for rescue.

621
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,950
Should I just stay at home? Huh?

622
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:59,800
All of Seoul is a dangerous zone for you.

623
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,650
Did you put a tracker on me or something?

624
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,130
Your routes are so predictable.

625
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,240
You're carrying the alarm bell, right?

626
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,320
Of course I am.

627
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,680
Ta-da.

628
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:17,270
Let's go to the restaurant. I'll make you udon.

629
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,720
Hyung, what made you come without telling me?

630
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,840
When did I ever tell you I was coming?

631
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,300
Have a seat.

632
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,630
Aren't you closed?

633
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,990
You're always welcome.

634
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,840
- You want something? 
 - I'll have a bowl of udon.

635
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,000
Udon? Just one moment.

636
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,410
Hyung, why don't you join So Jin? You know each other.

637
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,980
- No. 
 - Well...

638
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,640
Why are you acting shy?

639
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,430
Okay, hold on.

640
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,120
It's hot. Be careful.

641
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,310
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy.

642
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:57,020
Why are you picking at food?

643
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,070
What? No, I'm eating.

644
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:05,210
Come on. Hey, roll your sleeves before you eat.

645
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,800
You’ll dip it into the broth, you klutz.

646
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:14,080
Hold on. Isn't this the retreat shirt I gave you in high school?

647
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,440
Really?

648
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,550
It's all stretched. Why don't you throw it away?

649
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:21,430
It's the most comfortable shirt. Why would I throw it away?

650
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,050
I sleep so well in it.

651
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,650
I'll get you a new one.

652
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,140
I know your size. But the color...

653
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,290
You like pink, right?

654
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:35,470
You cried when you were a kid because your mom got

655
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,430
a pink bag for So Ri and a blue one for you.

656
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:39,850
How do you remember all that?

657
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:43,030
I was always there when you cried.

658
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,730
Although, you always cried over silly things.

659
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,710
You've cried in front of me, too.

660
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,120
- Me? 
 - Yes.

661
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,420
No way.

662
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,450
Well... Anyway, you have.

663
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,110
This is no good. I should apologize first.

664
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,860
Kang Hoon, I'll go.

665
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,000
It was tasty. Thank you.

666
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,100
- Leaving already? 
 - Yeah.

667
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:21,660
He's more talkative than usual today.

668
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,130
Thank you!

669
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,900
Gosh, you smell like the sewer.

670
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,320
I need to clean the car because of you.

671
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,460
Do you need to rescue a puppy from the sewer now?

672
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,000
He's a stray dog that everyone in the neighborhood knows.

673
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,730
Things could only look up from here for him.

674
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,570
Just go take a shower.

675
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,660
That smell will last at least a month.

676
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,200
Really?

677
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,460
Hey, hey! Geez...

678
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,120
- Good work. 
 - Thank you.

679
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,230
Mom.

680
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,950
What are you doing here without notice?

681
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:36,040
It's someone younger than you this time.

682
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,040
I put you in touch with a lawyer.

683
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,020
Why don't you get divorced?

684
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,650
He's a talented fellow.

685
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,400
He can easily put Father out on the streets.

686
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,640
He has had countless women,

687
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:11,110
but he came back whenever he broke up.

688
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,920
I'll make that happen.

689
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,220
Grandpa and both uncles had two families.

690
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,460
Do you still expect Father to live differently?

691
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,910
They all ended up coming back, too.

692
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,970
That's how they are genetically.

693
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,900
They never abandon the women who gave birth to their children.

694
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,100
Talking about damn genes again.

695
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:48,580
How much more must you ruin yourself to stop this?

696
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:55,030
Start living your life now. I beg you.

697
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,780
Loving, blaming,

698
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:01,350
and waiting for your dad...

699
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,670
That's my life.

700
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:19,190
There still isn't room for me.

701
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:29,340
I have an appointment offsite. Get home safely.

702
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:22,530
   

703
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,310
I'll get started now.

704
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:36,040
   

705
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,600
   

706
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:44,240
Is something seriously bad, Doctor?

707
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,480
Well... according to the DNA test, your fetus—

708
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,320
Shinhon.

709
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,170
My baby's name is Shinhon.

710
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:59,250
Yes, there's a bit of an issue with Shinhon.

711
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:07,070
Your father's gene you were concerned about was found with Shinhon, too.

712
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:11,350
Do you mean he'll turn blind?

713
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,060
No way. That can't be.

714
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,070
His father's eyes are normal.

715
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:18,140
I can't guarantee that it will lose his eyesight.

716
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:22,970
With RP, there are so many possibilities for genetic and clinical conditions.

717
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:28,000
It might get detected early, but it might not become active.

718
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:35,460
Ms. Ha, it's still a relief we found out through the prenatal test.

719
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:41,870
Although still in clinical trials, I heard that stem cell medicine for RP is being developed.

720
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,160
No way.

721
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,960
That can't be.

722
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,980
My baby can't be the only blind one.

723
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,560
You share the same DNA. How come you're perfectly fine?

724
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,030
Your face...

725
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:07,840
tells me you already know whose baby Shinhon is.

726
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:18,750
Just like the fact that you came here knowing who I was?

727
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,650
 It's someone younger than you this time. 

728
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,530
 Could you tell me what your prenatal name was? 

729
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:33,380
 I want to have a son like you. 

730
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,920
 It was "Shinhon." 

731
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:40,810
 My mother named me that because she wished they would be like newlyweds forever. 

732
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:43,430
 Shinhon? That's pretty. 

733
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:45,810
 I'll name my baby that, too. 

734
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,210
You have to know.

735
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,740
Because we're a family.

736
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,260
Family?

737
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,600
I'm not sure.

738
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,600
You're having an affair right now, Ms. Ha.

739
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,340
No, I'm marrying the Director soon.

740
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,990
He proposed to me.

741
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:04,490
Does he also know you chose me as your doctor?

742
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,190
Do you think your father wouldn't know?

743
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:15,300
I grew up caring for my siblings without parents.

744
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:20,350
He's the only man who proposed to me in my life.

745
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:23,170
Here's a piece of advice.

746
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,350
The Director changes his mind about women all the time

747
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:29,560
 and he cares about his public image a lot. 

748
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,650
 So please be careful... 

749
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:35,020
how you behave. And... 
    

750
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,280
you don't have siblings.

751
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:45,800
I can't believe this.

752
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,690
Did you do a background check on me?

753
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:52,050
The Director has been with many women like you.

754
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:57,710
You need him the most now, but he's probably not by your side.

755
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:03,470
Do you not know, or are you just pretending?

756
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:08,610
Do you really not know why your father gave me his sperm?

757
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:10,220
Why? Are you scared?

758
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,930
Because Shinhon and I will own your house and hospital?

759
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,920
I'm sorry.

760
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,630
Please keep this meeting confidential.

761
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:30,010
- I— 
 - It's my parents' personal life.

762
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:32,410
It has nothing to do with me.

763
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:46,590
 You might not cheat now, 

764
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:50,280
 but you definitely will someday. 

765
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,360
 You might cheat the rest of your life as long as the gene is activated. 

766
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,690
 It's not whether you do or not. 

767
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:00,950
 It's only a matter of time. 

768
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:09,680
I told him he'd end up like his father.

769
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:13,290
What have I done?

770
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,720
Dr. Shim!

771
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,550
Dr. Shim!

772
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,430
Dr. Shim...

773
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,290
Here.

774
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:37,060
If you aren't busy today,

775
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:40,720
would you like to have a drink? I'll pay.

776
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,950
Are we close enough to drink together?

777
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,730
Please give me a moment, then.

778
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,150
I want to apologize. Last time, I—

779
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,570
I don't know what it's about, but let's say I accept it.

780
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:53,430
I said you'll definitely cheat.

781
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:56,140
I said you'll cheat for the rest of your life.

782
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,780
I apologize for that.

783
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,360
It must've sounded like you'd live like your father.

784
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,130
But you can live differently if you find your DNA lover

785
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,300
even though you share the same genes.

786
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,030
It's just my parents' personal life.

787
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:13,010
I believe I said it has nothing to do with me.

788
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:19,290
And I don't care about the Octo-gene or DNA.

789
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,300
I don't believe in them, either.

790
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:28,420
Here's a piece of advice, Ms. Han.

791
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,770
Your relationships always fail

792
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:37,340
because you only talk about DNA.

793
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,250
Keep that in mind.

794
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,570
Did I go too far?

795
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,760
 Don't take this route for now. 

796
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,540
 A female college student was kidnapped here and called in for rescue. 

797
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,280
 It's a safety bell. 

798
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,540
 It works at your apartment, this area, and all the way to my restaurant. 

799
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,590
 I designated you a special table No. 0 at our restaurant. 

800
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:14,970
   

801
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,810
   

802
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,510
   

803
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,400
   

804
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,110
Noona!

805
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:24,920
Kang Hoon, someone's following me!

806
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,020
- Where are you? 
 - I'm near Shinan Elementary School.

807
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,040
Han So Jin!

808
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,330
Hey, hey, hey! Seo Kang Hoon!

809
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,350
Please! Please, help me!

810
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,290
Help me! Help me...

811
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:56,390
Help me! Please help me!

812
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:02,080
Please spare me!

813
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,290
Please! Please spare me! Please...

814
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:10,620
- Ms. Han. Ms. Han! 
 - Spare me!

815
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,370
Please spare me!

816
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:15,660
So Jin, are you okay?

817
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,170
So Jin!

818
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,880
This is Shim Yun Woo.

819
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,820
So Jin, are you okay?

820
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,060
Are you okay?

821
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,530
Noona!

822
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:30,690
Did you see him?

823
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:32,740
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

824
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:34,580
- Where did that bastard go? 
 - That way.

825
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,280
Please take care of her.

826
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,820
- Who are you? 
 - Let go. Let go.

827
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:57,120
It hurt! Seriously!

828
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,670
Are you doing this now, you bastard?

829
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,350
What did I do? What did I do?

830
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:07,890
I was exposed, and my girlfriends dumped me because of Han So Jin.

831
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:09,790
I was just going to tell her that.

832
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:11,610
I was only going to tell her that!

833
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:14,420
She could've gotten hurt because of you!

834
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,570
Hey. Did I hurt her?

835
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:19,060
- Did I hurt her? 
 - Are you serious?

836
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,830
- Are you okay? Can you get up? 
 - Yes.

837
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,550
Okay.

838
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,320
Do you feel better now?

839
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,860
Thank you...

840
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,070
Pardon?

841
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:41,160
Thank you for helping me, I said.

842
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:46,560
I'll walk you home.

843
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:52,030
I know this is so random...

844
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,720
but there's something I need to tell you.

845
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,540
Your promiscuous Octo-gene—

846
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:04,730
I thought I told you this isn't how you get to know someone.

847
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:09,050
What do you know about me besides the Octo-gene?

848
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:10,750
I found out.

849
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,270
Besides the Octo-gene,

850
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:17,190
you have a healer gene.

851
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,210
That's not what I meant.

852
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:28,160
Do you still want to tell me about DNA?

853
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,740
The DNA you have can give life to someone who wants to die

854
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:37,540
and you can make someone smile when he wants to cry.

855
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:40,980
For someone with extremely miserable genes, your genes are...

856
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:45,180
your genes are very crucial.

857
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:51,060
That's why I need to...

858
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:54,660
learn more about you.

859
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:58,790
Do you want to learn more about me?

860
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:06,420
Please let me continue my experiment.

861
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:20,780
 This woman keeps calling attraction experiments. 

862
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:25,620
This is how you experiment.

863
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:58,370
♫  Somewhere in the dreams you and I have been building  ♫

864
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:02,010
♫  I’ll always look at you  ♫

865
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:05,650
♫  And smile  ♫

866
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:11,290
♫  When you suddenly turn around  ♫

867
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:14,490
   

868
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:18,110
 - Let's go. 
 - You like Han So Jin, don't you? 

869
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,930
 So Jin Noona is like family to me. 

870
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:22,890
 Stop being interested, then. 

871
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:26,600
 Family can't get involved in a relationship. 

872
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,100
 You're suddenly acting like a different person. 

873
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,420
 You're making my heart flutter. 

874
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,930
 Did your heart flutter for me? 

875
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,410
 One, two... 

876
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:36,980
 Dumpling soup. 

877
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,590
 That was telepathy. 

878
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:40,340
 - I want to confirm. 
 - What? 

879
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:44,170
 I want to see if DNA lovers can communicate through telepathy. 

880
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,940
 Han So Jin.
