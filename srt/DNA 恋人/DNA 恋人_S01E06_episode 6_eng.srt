1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,640
   

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,480
   

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,770
   

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,980
   

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,210
   

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:35,000
   

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,550
   

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,060
   

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,650
Thank you.

10
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,080
It was a great time.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,460
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,340
- Get home safely. 
 - Get home safely.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,730
- Yes, see you. 
 - Bye.

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,800
Get home safely.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,460
- See you next time. 
 - Bye now.

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:08,260


17
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,600
♫  I know you right  ♫

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,470
♫  I know, you think I'm odd enough  ♫

19
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,170
I have...

20
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,440
a bad feeling for some reason.

21
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,590
♫  Just take my hand  ♫

22
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,350
♫  Something lately, I know you feel the same  ♫

23
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,940
♫  Never been through this path  ♫

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,090
♫  Damn I like this way  ♫

25
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,300
♫  Say you want it babe  ♫

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,240
♫  All the things we’ll ever do is right  ♫

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,300
♫  So wait for my sign  ♫

28
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,510
It's obviously Han So Jin.

29
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,850
Han So Jin!

30
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,660
Yun Woo!

31
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,800
♫  What I mean to do, yeah no more disguise  ♫

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,230
   

33
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,840
What brings you here?

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,090
I was supposed to meet someone, but I think we missed each other.

35
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,680
Han So Jin will be disappointed again.

36
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,560
Han So Jin?

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,290
Why...

38
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,640
Why are you at Han River...

39
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,130
Why? Am I not supposed to be here?

40
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,690
It's weird.

41
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,470
It's dinnertime. And you don't come to Han River alone.

42
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,920
Well, it's true.

43
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,000
But I had no appetite today. So I came for a run.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,890
I'm asking why you had to be at Han River at this moment.

45
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,870
I just felt like running today, okay?

46
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,750
Are you happy now?

47
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,100
- Hey, watch out. 
 - On my way. On the Han River submersible bridge.

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,320
He's not even wearing a helmet.

49
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,470
You mean that nerd?

50
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,880
- So, what brings you here? 
 - I had a lecture nearby.

51
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,170
But how did I run into you here?

52
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,330
I think the telepathic message was sent wrong.

53
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,580
Telepathic message?

54
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,170
Your message wasn't for me?

55
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,630
Looks like you got stood up.

56
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,120
Should we grab a drink?

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,660
I don't think I can today. I have another plan, too.

58
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,620
Okay, then. Right.

59
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,600
You're coming to the gathering this week, right?

60
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,800
I'll need to check my schedule around then. Bye now.

61
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,580
Han So Jin...

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,500
Everyone's there?

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,060
I'll be right there! Just wait a moment.

64
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,900
Yes. Why do you always get dumped?

65
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,920
Are you okay, ma'am? Are you hurt?

66
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,160
- I'm just startled. I'm okay. 
 - Okay.

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,150
Hey. Being on the phone while riding a scooter will kill you. Don't you know?

68
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,710
And why aren't you wearing a helmet?

69
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,820
How could you speed without checking the road?

70
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,300
You aren't the only one getting hurt.

71
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,300
This lady almost got injured because of you.

72
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,510
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ma'am.

73
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,340
He came to Han River to save that lady.

74
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,640
- Take care, ma'am. 
 - Thank you.

75
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,370
It should be near here.

76
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,160
She should be back from the Han River by now.

77
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,990
She didn't have to turn her phone off.

78
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,440
   

79
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,420
Han River?

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,020
Okay.

81
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,380
The sewer Octo-gene?

82
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,360
Han River.

83
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,340
 I'm at the Han River, too. Where are you? 

84
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,900
   

85
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,270
   

86
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,960
It's not easy.

87
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,830
I said I can apply it later.

88
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,340
You always get scars because you don't treat them right away.

89
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,700
There. Done.

90
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,530
Okay. Let me see your leg now.

91
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,620
Huh? Come on!

92
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,070
Only my wife will see my bare legs, okay?

93
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,650
Do that when you get married.

94
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,920
- Hey. 
 - Come on.

95
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,600
You little. Stay put.

96
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,800
Your mom would've told you to quit being a firefighter if she were still alive.

97
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,370
"A man having one job is just like marrying one woman."

98
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,190
She would've said that if she were alive.

99
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,220
Did you switch shampoos?

100
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,740
It smells nice.

101
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,810
I've been using the same kind for three years.

102
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,170
You used to say I smelled burnt.

103
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,760
Right.

104
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,940
Oh, hey. We're done now.

105
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,320
Thank you. Let's go home now.

106
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,620
Hey, your face is still—

107
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,960
I'll care for it at home.

108
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,190
What are you doing? Hurry up.

109
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,090
Okay, I'm coming.

110
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,420
Isn't he handsome?

111
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,610
I never would've thought...

112
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,720
I'd meet my true love at my age after divorcing three times.

113
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,430
Jang Mi, you should also dump your husband and find your other half.

114
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,290
He's been switching women countless times,

115
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,800
but he came back to me every time he broke up.

116
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,100
I feel like he'd come back with a smile even now.

117
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,190
You mean he'll crawl back to you once he's old and sick?

118
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,160
You'd be old by then, too.

119
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,900
You were so pretty and talented, but you chose the wrong man.

120
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,000
You're living alone in this huge house, like a taxidermied animal.

121
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,180
Gosh, Yun Woo.

122
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,590
Aunt, welcome back.

123
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,960
- Oh, my gosh! 
 - Have you been well?

124
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,510
Yes.

125
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,740
I worked so hard at sending it to him. But he didn't get it?

126
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,600
Telepathy would work if you had a relationship.

127
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,120
There aren't any events or memories you share.

128
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,730
Why would telepathy work?

129
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,000
There's a case of twins who were separated at a young age

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,770
who were telepathic with each other, okay?

131
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:59,020
Sunbae, souls are the only things that move beyond time and space.

132
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,450
- Souls? 
 - Yes, souls.

133
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,070
That's what Father Andrea said.

134
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,760
Souls or telepathy...

135
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,080
It didn't work.

136
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,530
 Our experiment failed. 
   

137
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,890
   

138
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,950
 Failed. 

139
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,820
   

140
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,650
 Failed. 

141
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,930
Failed! Failed! Failed!

142
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,060
Did she work late last night, too?

143
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,940
 "I want to see him. 

144
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,380
 I really want to see him." 

145
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,560
 You send a signal like that. 

146
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,390
Just come.

147
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,670
Come even if you worked late.

148
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,640
Come even if you don't want to.

149
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,900
Show up in front of me.

150
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,650
It's suddenly pouring out there.

151
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,270
It looks like a shower.

152
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,340
Take this with you. It might rain again later.

153
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,680
It stopped raining already.

154
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,870
I'll take that umbrella.

155
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,680
- Hello, doctor. 
 - Hello.

156
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
I put out a fire all night last night. I must have the flu.

157
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,850
Do you want to work out?

158
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,260
The flu will go away if you sweat it out with a workout and sauna.

159
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,590
It worked.

160
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,600
- Pardon? 
 It's nothing.

161
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,380
Telepathy worked.

162
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:08,840
   

163
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,590
From 7 to 8 o'clock.

164
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,890
 He'll receive the telepathic message... 

165
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,630
 and come. He's coming. 

166
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,000
I sent the telepathic message to Yun Woo.

167
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,750
 But at 8:30... 

168
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,460
 Han Seo Jin! 

169
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,400
But why?

170
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,320
My telepathic message...

171
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,980
   

172
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,370
Did it veer off...

173
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,090
and go to Kang Hoon?

174
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,800
Why?

175
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,880
   

176
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,530
 Our experiment failed. 

177
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,240
 Failed! Failed! Failed! 

178
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,900
Why did she send so many?

179
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,860
I don't think it's a good idea to call.

180
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,260
I need a twist.

181
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,900
   

182
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,830
   

183
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,600
This isn't Han River.

184
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,350
Where's this place?

185
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,710
I think it's fun. But what's with the comments?

186
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,650
Ah Ri. Do you know where this place is?

187
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,750
That's the Han River Snacks.

188
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,880
A new snack shop just opened near your house.

189
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,380
Snack shop?

190
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,800
Oh, right!

191
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,680
 I saw the Sewer in front of Han River Snack last night. 

192
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,450
Was it around 10:30?

193
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,200
But what was he doing there?

194
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,570
He must've gotten hungry waiting for you.

195
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,350
Han River? 
    

196
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,850
So, Yun Woo was in front of Han River Snacks?

197
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,840
Ah Ri!

198
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,130
I think my telepathy worked.

199
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:19,600
 Yun Woo did receive my telepathic message. 

200
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,750
 But the Han River... 

201
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,620
 Maybe he received those words instead. 

202
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,000
 Instead of the image. 
   

203
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,960
You don't need to experiment anymore since you have a conviction.

204
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,090
Something like that actually happened.

205
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,520
Seriously.

206
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,070
All the commenters are acting like mother-in-laws.

207
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,340
You don't even understand the character, but you keep interfering.

208
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,660
That's why the artist can't write the story he wants!

209
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Interfere?

210
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,690
Interference. Cross-talk.

211
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:58,340
A communication device getting interfered by a signal from another.

212
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:03,650
The signal was interrupted because someone was connected by accident.

213
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,790
That might be why he didn't receive my telepathic message.

214
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,870
Did someone else try sending a bizarre signal to the Sewer?

215
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:31,280
   

216
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,440
 Between 7 and 8 o'clock. 

217
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,280
 What if someone else's strong interference caused cross-talk? 

218
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,610
 Yun Woo must've met someone else in Namsan. 

219
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,150
 If so, that person is... 

220
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,340
Who could it be?

221
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,310
Why does it feel like you're gradually going crazy?

222
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,590
You need at least one crazy gene to be called a genius.

223
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:06,470
Scientists make great discoveries when they're called crazy.

224
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,270
Who could it be?

225
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,310
Who could be that someone?

226
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,930
Why am I wondering about this?

227
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,210
I can just ask him.

228
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,710
We need a twist.

229
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,460
   

230
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,810
 Did you receive the Han River photo I sent? 

231
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,580
Yun Woo, I think there was an interference.

232
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,210
Should we talk seriously for a second?

233
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,880
Sounds good. Should we meet up today?

234
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,050
No, I need to look into a team tour for Perth Park in Australia.

235
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,150
Are you going to Australia?

236
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,080
I guess you like to travel.

237
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,750
I know of a very nice travel club. Why don't we—

238
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,010
 No, I don't like to travel. 

239
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,770
I just want to check out the DNA tower at Perth Park.

240
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,130
How about this weekend, then?

241
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,440
 This weekend? 
   

242
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,060
I have a meeting with a producer and writer on Saturday.

243
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,600
They're working on a TV show that looks for significant others using DNA.

244
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,330
I'm attending the meeting as an advisor.

245
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,430
 Was she always this busy? 

246
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,120
Right, Sunday. I was only free on Sunday.

247
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,340
Sunday?

248
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,430
I'm getting a call from the producer.

249
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,800
I'll call you back in a bit, Yun Woo.

250
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,820
H-Hello? Hello?

251
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,460
What's this? Why am I begging her? What just happened?

252
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,410
What's with this ridiculous situation and position I'm in?

253
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,670
   

254
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,710
- It'd be tastier. 
 - Thank you.

255
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,820
- Hello. 
 - Two cheese ones, please.

256
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,670
Two cheese ones.

257
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,670
 My twisted potato. 

258
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,900
 Are you okay? 

259
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,230
 My twisted potato... 

260
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,450
 Sister Anna, 

261
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,070
 have this. 

262
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,490
 It's okay. Take it. 

263
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,250
Father?

264
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,500
I know what you're thinking right now.

265
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,130
Do you think confessing your sin to God will save you?

266
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,230
Do you think that will save you?

267
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,360
You can only be saved by atoning. Please stop. Please.

268
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,710
Our club members will go stargazing this Sunday. Want to join us?

269
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,330
To where?

270
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,350
At the Hwaak Camping Site. Bring Yun Woo.

271
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,290
Okay, sounds good.

272
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,290
Nice.

273
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,290
Santos!

274
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,950
Aigoo, Noo Ri!

275
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,110
Have a seat. Have a seat.

276
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,630
Have you been well, Mi Eun?

277
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,210
- I missed you, cutie. 
 - Noo Ri is marrying Woo Joo.

278
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,160
What? Woo Joo?

279
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,680
Gosh, she could do so much better.

280
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,100
Have you been well, Mi Eun?

281
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,160
I'm producing a documentary these days.

282
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,930
It's about polyamory.

283
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,920
Would you be able to be in it?

284
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,760
A documentary?

285
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,370
You aren't even a polyamorist. So why?

286
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,370
Do you have to be gay to make a gay film?

287
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,670
The books you published, your TV appearances, and social media...

288
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:33,540
Aren't they for dismantling prejudice and misconceptions about polyamory?

289
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,220
I think making a film about it might help.

290
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,180
You can reach more people, too.

291
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,390
Yes, Mi Eun. I love it.

292
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,800
We haven't gone on a trip as a group in a while.

293
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,350
Let's go camping, have a barbecue, and go stargazing, too.

294
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,940
If we miss this, we'll have to wait 16 years.

295
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,070
Stargazing?

296
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:08,410
By the way, since when did you see multiple men at once?

297
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,380
I'm sorry.

298
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,810
Gosh, was my question too direct?

299
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,650
Since I was 28.

300
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,100
Relationships are nice, but I didn't like how we hurt each other

301
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,530
by trying to possess one another. That's when I first realized it.

302
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:32,080
By chance, if you're a polyamorist,

303
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,880
do you tell the man you're dating upfront or hide it?

304
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,810
Telling someone you're a polyamorist after going exclusive would be a scam.

305
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,200
And that's not something you can convince someone about.

306
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,530
If you do, that'd be gaslighting.

307
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:56,270
Have you been sexually abused or assaulted as a child?

308
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,040
You date multiple men at once.

309
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,230
I wonder if you were deprived of affection.

310
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:10,030
You know how abnormal people tend to have traumas.

311
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,890
Who decides what's normal and abnormal?

312
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,860
Am I abnormal because I'm different than you?

313
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,390
Let me ask you a question, then.

314
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,430
Are you normal, Director Byun?

315
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,710
Why do you think that's my opinion?

316
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,610
Most ordinary men would think that.

317
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,450
I'm saying that's what people think.

318
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,440
What's the real reason you're making this film?

319
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,640
You must think a story about a woman like that becoming a polyamorist

320
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,820
would get a lot of people's attention.

321
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,530
You're acting weird today.

322
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:56,130
You aren't usually like this. Why are you getting worked up?

323
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:00,610
Are you sure you don't have childhood trauma?

324
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,830
I'm sorry, I don't have it.

325
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,280
Hey...

326
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,100
Let go.

327
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,860
What are you doing?

328
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,670
Let go, I said!

329
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,020
Just one more drink. Gosh!

330
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,860
I'm sorry.

331
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,070
Hey, Shim Yun Woo!

332
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,430
Sorry, sorry.

333
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,370
- Shim Yun Woo! 
 - I'm sorry, Hyung.

334
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,490
I fell. I'm sorry.

335
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,640
You used to ignore stuff like that.

336
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,530
I know.

337
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,450
Why did I do that?

338
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:40,680
I thought you chose this path, knowing it'd be hard.

339
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,200
Don't worry about them. I love how confident you are, Mi Eun.

340
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,990
Don't get discouraged.

341
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,170
How did you feel?

342
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,330
Huh?

343
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:59,080
How did you feel when I first told you...

344
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,870
I was a polyamorist?

345
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,800
At first, it was difficult to adjust myself...

346
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,030
But I liked it.

347
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,820
Did you really like it?

348
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,500
I like keeping a little distance.

349
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,890
A relationship that's not too detached or attached.

350
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,510
I liked it.

351
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:33,080
I chose to date a polyamorist myself.

352
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,090
Whether you're a polyamorist or not,

353
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,930
I looked forward to seeing you more than anyone.

354
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,490
Why did we break up again?

355
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,690
It felt like...

356
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:57,290
we were in a film that was approaching the end.

357
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:03,490
And it was you who ghosted me, not me.

358
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,830
It even went on for six months.

359
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,650
Six months.

360
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,960
Ah Ri, aren't you sick of that?

361
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,830
How can you always get one on your way back?

362
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,730
Are you from Gangwon-do or something?

363
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,780
Are you from Gangwon-do if you like potatoes?

364
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,610
You're strangely regionalistic.

365
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,390
Where are you from?

366
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,180
Gangwon-do.

367
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,890
Ah Ri,

368
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,220
something's bugging you, huh?

369
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,650
Have you felt this way, too?

370
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,610
- About what? 
 - Have you had someone

371
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,510
you wanted to approach the moment you met?

372
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,660
Did you finally find someone like that?

373
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,800
Father Andrea.

374
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,590
- Father? 
 - Yes.

375
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,170
But I'm worried about something.

376
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,660
What is it?

377
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,560
It's nothing. I'll go to bed.

378
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,380
   

379
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,440
- You're here. 
 - Hey.

380
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,790
I'm happy because the psychiatrist told me I improved a lot.

381
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,090
I'll be diligent about getting anti-aging treatment, too.

382
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,630
I have many plans. So many.

383
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,100
That's a relief.

384
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,710
You look great, too.

385
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,850
I have a good plan, too.

386
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,990
She must be watching her weight for the competition.

387
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,790
- What are you doing? 
 - Jesus Christ!

388
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,200
You scared me!

389
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,870
I stopped by to have lunch with you if you were around.

390
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,140
- With me? 
 - Yes.

391
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,620
How about Yun Woo?

392
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,320
He's busy.

393
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,460
He's working on a plan to win Team Leader Han over.

394
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,390
He's a pro, but he's working hard on it, too.

395
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,280
Kang Hoon!

396
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,490
- Hello, doctor. 
 - Hello.

397
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,200
What brings you here?

398
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,110
This is lactose-free protein.

399
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,240
It's important to have enough protein.

400
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,940
I think you can have it with salads.

401
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,890
Thank you. You shouldn't have.

402
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,290
Aren't you late? You said you had a lunch plans?

403
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,660
Pardon?

404
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,420
Yes. Sunbae, I'm leaving.

405
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,720
Okay. Hey, we were supposed to eat together.

406
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,420
Aigoo, too bad he can't join us.

407
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,920
Oh, y-yes. Too bad...

408
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,730
I'll get back to you next week.

409
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,670
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

410
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,770
 Yes? 

411
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,480
- Did the meeting go well? 
  - Yes. 

412
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,220
So Jin, do you want to go stargazing tomorrow night?

413
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,640
 I know you love stargazing. 

414
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,100
If you miss this opportunity to see all five planets at once,

415
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,540
you'll have to wait about 18 years, apparently.

416
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,470
You mean we'd be able to see...

417
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,380
Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Mars, and Jupiter together?

418
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,930
We could see them without a telescope? Really?

419
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:37,560
It's a bit early because it's before sunrise.

420
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,630
But you're the only person who'd go out of the way to go with me.

421
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,240
Not out of my way at all!

422
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,480
I'll prepare hot packs and blankets immediately.

423
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
We need a tripod, too, right? What else do we need?

424
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,800
It's a bit far because it's in Gapyeong.

425
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,510
How about we leave at 10 tomorrow night?

426
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,080
Yes, sounds good.

427
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,460
Great. Let's meet up tomorrow in a cheery mood, okay?

428
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,800
I'll pick you up.

429
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,880
Okay, see you tomorrow.

430
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,600
Daebak!

431
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,690
Tripod. Tripod.

432
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,830
   

433
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,810
   

434
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,150
   

435
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,210
One soondae, please.

436
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,680
I see you often.

437
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,040
Do you work in your office today?

438
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,360
I checked the sprinkler and

439
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,410
I installed three additional locks. Don't worry.

440
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,140
Good job.

441
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,960
I want to live feeling safe now.

442
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,810
   

443
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,230
   

444
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,520
I'll have another fishcake, ma'am.

445
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,640
   

446
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,230
   

447
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,270
Here you go, ma'am. I'm paying for his, too.

448
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,420
It's on me today.

449
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,480
Here's your to-go order.

450
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,020
 I like keeping a little distance. 

451
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,340
 A relationship that's not too detached or attached. 

452
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,070
Mi Eun!

453
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,550
I'll win you over with details, Han So Jin.

454
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,510
 This morning's splendid planet sighting featuring five planets will happen in the eastern sky at dawn. 

455
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:16,440
Make sure to keep it out of sight.

456
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,530
- Aren't you going home? 
 - I'm leaving now.

457
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:24,370
 You have to wait until the five planets gather again in September 2040. 

458
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,280
The stargazing sites will be busy tonight.

459
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,500
Nothing would happen, right?

460
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,950
Do you like stargazing, too?

461
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,890
Sitting still and watching stars can't be fun.

462
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,500
But I'd like to go glamping using stargazing as an excuse.

463
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,850
These days, nice tents come with a big TV, sofa, and a bed by default.

464
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,940
And you get a wine cooler and a bar, too.

465
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,690
It's not a tent. It's basically a hotel.

466
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,490
I'll answer this, Sunbae. 
    

467
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,800
Hey, Kang Hoon.

468
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,520
I won't be home because I'm going stargazing tonight.

469
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,510
- What? 
 - So, could you...

470
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,330
take Shy out on a walk tonight?

471
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,780
Ah Ri went to bed early because she's got the flu.

472
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,940
Stargazing?

473
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,440
With whom? Alone?

474
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,190
No, with Yun Woo.

475
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,960
- What? 
 - We'll be camping while we're there, too.

476
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,800
 Yun Woo is busy. 

477
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,760
 He's working on a plan to win Team Leader Han over. 

478
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,000
 He's a pro, but he's working hard on it, too. 

479
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,980
You mean you two will sleep over... I mean...

480
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,120
You'll stay the night together?

481
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,290
No, it's not like that. We'll be camping without a tent.

482
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,290
We're just stargazing.

483
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,530
Anyway, thank you.

484
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,150
Sunbae, I'll get going now.

485
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,410
Okay, bye.

486
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,530
What's wrong with them?

487
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,550
Why?

488
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,810
You can...

489
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,680
You can just see the stars at home!

490
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,280
 Emergency dispatch. 

491
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,980
Wow.

492
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,550
- So Jin. 
 - Yes.

493
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,550
- It's a bit heavy. 
 - Okay.

494
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,900
Gosh, it's so pretty.

495
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,180
That goes on the bottom.

496
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,190
Okay, give it to me.

497
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,590
This goes on top, right?

498
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,240
- There. 
 - Not too shabby.

499
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,160
- Relax here. 
 - Can I help with anything?

500
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,990
Watch the stars. Watch the stars.

501
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,340
Daebak!

502
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,450
Yun Woo, there are so many stars in the sky!

503
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,090
Right?

504
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,520
It's so pretty.

505
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,640
What's wrong with her?

506
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,850
How could she fall for someone like him?

507
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,650
What's she trying to do?

508
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,940
She's hopeless once she falls for someone.

509
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,810
This happens all the time. All the time.

510
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,420
 You arrived at the destination. 

511
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,130
 - Cheers.  
 - I can't wait.

512
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,630
Cheers.

513
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,280
It's so nice.

514
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,650
When should we have our next gathering?

515
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,320
Where is she hiding?

516
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,530
Seo Kang Hoon?

517
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,160
   

518
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,000
Okay, Site A.

519
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,800
   

520
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,630
- So Jin. 
 - Yes?

521
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,440
- Eat a lot now. 
 - Why?

522
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,560
When we're on the top of the mountain,

523
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,490
we can't eat anything because of air pollution.

524
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,720
Here. Say ah...

525
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,380
Let me...

526
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,310
Noona!

527
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,900
Kang Hoon, what are you doing here?

528
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,870
What a coincidence.

529
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,360
Can't believe I ran into you here.

530
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,960
Hey, this isn't right.

531
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,640
It's not like that.

532
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,270
I just stopped by because Noona made such a big deal.

533
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,720
To see the stars.

534
00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:00,680
You thought there'd be an accident because of the crowd. That's why you came.

535
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,020
That's one of the reasons.

536
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,630
Seriously.

537
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,850
Let's see.

538
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,400
The planets will be visible in 3 hours, 45 minutes, and 32 seconds.

539
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,410
Kang Hoon, you can see stars so well here. Join us.

540
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,710
- Really? 
 - That'd be okay, right?

541
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,420
No, we can't do that.

542
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,580
- He's joking. 
 - You think?

543
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,230
Thank you.

544
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,130
It sure is cold.

545
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,960
It is, right? When it's cold,

546
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,720
put on a blanket.

547
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:40,220
It's cold because we're in the mountains.

548
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,240
I know. It's really cold.

549
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,790
Are you cold?

550
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,650
Hold on.

551
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,060
I'm cold, too.

552
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,880
How cozy and warm.

553
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,190
Should we have tripe stew now?

554
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,500
Pardon?

555
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,720
This was tripe stew?

556
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,520
So Jin doesn't eat tripe. Didn't you know?

557
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,900
My tripe stew is different.

558
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,760
It's probably tasty and fantastic.

559
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,610
I'll try it, Kang Hoon.

560
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,970
Good choice.

561
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,150
It's because I had indigestion after eating it once.

562
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,620
I should overcome the trauma.

563
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,700
Here. Say ah...

564
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,700
Do you want to have diarrhea and throw up all night again?

565
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,600
I said it's dangerous when you think you're safe.

566
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:44,990
They say if you enjoy the food, it becomes your blood and flesh.

567
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,310
Gosh, it's hot.

568
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,820
It tastes like blood and flesh.

569
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,640
Excuse me.

570
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,220
I'll go to the restroom.

571
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,000
What is this, a bromance?

572
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,280
It's hot. I'm impressed.

573
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:24,000
Hey, hey. It wasn't easy for me to get that champagne.

574
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,490
You should've brought a non-alcoholic one.

575
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,410
You won't drink because you have to drive.

576
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,260
It's non-alcoholic, okay?

577
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,300
Hyung, why did you prepare a bed if you're stargazing? What's with the tent?

578
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,710
You need to sleep if you get tired after stargazing.

579
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,460
I don't like it.

580
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,710
Where am I? Where is this place?

581
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,470
Please get a signal.

582
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,260
Okay, timeout.

583
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,970
What?

584
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,130
Why are you taking things so far?

585
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,570
What do you mean?

586
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,050
Why are you butting in so much?

587
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,490
So Jin will meet a good man.

588
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:13,830
Someone who'll stay by her side and love her until she grows tired.

589
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,990
I'm standing guard until a man like that shows up.

590
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:23,660
Don't you think it's too much, even if you considered her family?

591
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,720
Hyung, if I had an older or younger sister,

592
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,990
I'd never let them date you. Never.

593
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,670
Gosh, it's freezing.

594
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,380
So cold.

595
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,050
- Sunbae. 
  - Kang Hoon, we got an emergency order. 

596
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,250
- Pardon? 
  - You need to come now. 

597
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,130
Okay, I'll be right there.

598
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,600
What's going on?

599
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,410
There's an emergency. I need to go now.

600
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,340
My gosh.

601
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,030
It's okay. Get going now.

602
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,590
You can't get injured, okay?

603
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,460
I'll never see you if you do.

604
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,330
Okay, bye.

605
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,900
Bye.

606
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:04,000
I think he's a bit... How should I say it...

607
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,590
Take good care of Noona.

608
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,260
You two are closer than I thought.

609
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,650
Maybe because we grew up together?

610
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,730
I get sick whenever he gets injured.

611
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,300
That's why he can't get hurt.

612
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,970
 The first time I saw her, she was crying. 

613
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:41,030
 She's not allowed to get hurt ever. 

614
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,390
Should we go see the stars?

615
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,080
Shall we?

616
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,150
Where am I?

617
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,020
There's light.

618
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,120
Should we turn these off?

619
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,750
Sounds good.

620
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,440
I can see them so well.

621
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,540
The shiniest one is Venus.

622
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,960
It's a straight line.

623
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,830
Come here, So Jin.

624
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,910
- Huh? 
 - Over here.

625
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,590
- Have a look. 
 - Can you see?

626
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,620
It's Io!

627
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,090
It's so pretty.

628
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,710
But hundreds of volcanoes are erupting on it.

629
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,670
Do you want to see, too?

630
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,680
People think Io is hot because of the volcanic eruptions,

631
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,040
but it's actually cold because it doesn't get sunlight.

632
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:21,540
Is Io's DNA lover the sun, not Jupiter, then?

633
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,150
Did you bring that with you?

634
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,840
It seemed like a meaningful object to you.

635
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,930
So, I got it fixed.

636
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,050
Should we listen together?

637
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,310
♫  After an exhausting day  ♫

638
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:13,620
♫  Two people under the moon creating one shadow  ♫

639
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:23,500
♫  I think I could touch the faint happiness if I closed my eyes  ♫

640
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,270
It's strange, isn't it?

641
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,390
After I broke up with the two-timing boyfriend,

642
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,370
I cried whenever I heard this song.

643
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,720
But...

644
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,660
it's very nice now.

645
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,650
By the way,

646
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:44,890
is telepathy that important?

647
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:53,560
If I'm telepathic with my other half,

648
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:59,000
I'd be able to sense it when he's suffering the most.

649
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,420
For instance,

650
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,340
when he feels so hurt that...

651
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,230
he wants to die.

652
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,590
Since we listened to this song together,

653
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,570
I'm the man of your fate, right?

654
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,850
Come on.

655
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,660
Yun Woo?

656
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,770
I can't believe I ran into you here.

657
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,900
This happened at Namsan, too.

658
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,860
Namsan?

659
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,130
I came here with my travel club members,

660
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,910
but I got lost and ended up here.

661
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,500
Why don't we walk down together?

662
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,150
L-Let's go. Okay.

663
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,360
Here. Okay.

664
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:09,360
 He said she was a nerd. But she's cute. 

665
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,590
 She must've made many nerds cry with her sparkly eyes. 

666
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,770
 Jang Mi Eun, right? 

667
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,120
 She's a very famous relationship columnist. 

668
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,430
 Her skin is like marble, and her eyes are like espresso beans. 

669
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,310
 She's not just pretty. 

670
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,670
So Jin, say hello. This is—

671
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,780
Hello, I'm Jang Mi Eun.

672
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,660
I'm also Yun Woo's ex-girlfriend.

673
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,070
Pardon?

674
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,380
I heard a lot about you, So Jin.

675
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,640
Nice to meet you.

676
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,430
Nice to meet you.

677
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,870
- Okay. 
 - Would you like some fruit?

678
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:48,170
- Sounds good. 
 - I'll go wash some.

679
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,840
Sounds good.

680
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:08,300
While I was sending the telepathic message,

681
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,420
did she run into Yun Woo at Namsan?

682
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,820
If so...

683
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,930
 is she the third signal sender 

684
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:22,380
 who caused interference between 8 and 9? 

685
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,260
Is she the one who caused the interference?

686
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,010
You didn't attend the club gathering. I wondered what was going on.

687
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,410
I see you were with So Jin.

688
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,090
Anyway, how did we run into each other here?

689
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:45,050
This happens to us often, you know.

690
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,680
You remember.

691
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:52,960
 Gosh, what are the odds of this happening? Look at me now. 

692
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,280
 The fire at S Apartments in Haengdang-dong was put out. 

693
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,450
 We're searching if there are additional victims. 

694
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:09,020
 Also checking on the crew going between the floors. 

695
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,170
No other victims were found here.

696
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:34,800
Thank you.

697
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,570
Why take photos? The investigation team will do it.

698
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:42,290
Things get damaged by water often.

699
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,080
I always take them out of habit.

700
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,710
No one came in before and after the fire

701
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:51,370
and the door was double-locked.

702
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,730
It's weird that the fire started.

703
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:58,260
If they targeted the victim, the evidence should be in here.

704
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,730
According to the witnesses nearby,

705
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:04,710
there were bad rumors about her because she got pregnant from an affair.

706
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,480
Do you think that might have something to do with that?

707
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:29,010
   

708
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,420
 If I'm telepathic with my other half, 

709
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:43,890
 I'd be able to sense it when he's suffering the most. 

710
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:50,200
 For instance, when he feels so hurt that... 

711
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,380
 he wants to die. 

712
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,990
That little nerd.

713
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,890
   

714
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,850
   

715
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,360
 "A Man Who Peels King Crab." 

716
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,340
You asked about relationships with nerdy people.

717
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,920
If your love interest is nerdy,

718
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,500
you need to find out what her favorite line is.

719
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,060
And you have to say it to her.

720
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:38,440
Because if you give her what she likes,

721
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,060
it'd be game over.

722
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:45,930
 And secondly, remember that nerdy people have 

723
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:49,800
 higher expectations for love than most. 

724
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,380
 She'd be very disappointed if you didn't meet her expectations. 

725
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,580
Enjoy her favorite song together.

726
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,380
Meet her expectations.

727
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:04,390
She wants a telepathic connection. What can I do?

728
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:09,490
No.

729
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,940
Coincidence isn't necessary.

730
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,000
I can make it look like it was a coincidence.

731
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,480
   

732
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:21,850
   

733
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,310
   

734
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:35,470
   

735
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:56,150
   

736
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,650
They seem like a great match for some reason.

737
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,210
Why did they break up?

738
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,700
She's so pretty.

739
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,370
   

740
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,580
I need to go.

741
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,830
So punctual.

742
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,400
Huh? Yun Woo!

743
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,810
Am I allowed to experiment, too?

744
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:19,340
Experiment?

745
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,710
I set the rules this time.

746
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:25,170
Instead, we'll officially go out on a date if the experiment is a success.

747
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:32,850
You don't think my experiments are a joke, right?

748
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:36,300
I don't joke around with a person's sincere heart.

749
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,860
Let's test our telepathic connection properly for one last time.

750
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,710
   

751
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:59,000
Why do you have so many single-use products? Is this a hotel?

752
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,380
Is this what the meeting was about?

753
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,990
You'll help, right?

754
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:08,260
Why do I smell capitalism?

755
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,750
A stay at the Grand Hotel. A room with the Han River view.

756
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:12,060
I know you like staycations.

757
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,420
You get a city view while swimming at night.

758
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:19,340
Grand Hotel, Han River view, night swimming, my foot.

759
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,310
What is it? What's the strategy?

760
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,030
When will it happen? Tell me right now, Mr. Customer.

761
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:27,200
- Tomorrow night. 
 - Deal.

762
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,000
 She'll probably take the subway because it'd be rush hour. 

763
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,860
 Follow closely. You know, right? 

764
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,140
Uh-huh. She's at the subway station as expected.

765
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,240
You can never get caught, okay?

766
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,520
Don't you worry.

767
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,850
I'm completely blended into the crowd.

768
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:50,150
So annoying. What's wrong with him?

769
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,180
So, is it Line 2 or Line 5?

770
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,670
   

771
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,030
   

772
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,270
   

773
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,970
   

774
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:28,030
Okay, it's Line 2.

775
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:31,090
If it's the Cultural Arts Center, she'll get off at Gyodae and transfer to Line 3.

776
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,440
Call me when she gets off at Gyodae Station. No,

777
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,070
call me even if she doesn't. She's going to the aquarium, then.

778
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,150
Okay.

779
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:41,510
I'm sorry.

780
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,190
It hurts.

781
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,320
What? My wallet.

782
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,970
Hey!

783
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,680
Hey, stop right there!

784
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,020
Catch him! Catch him!

785
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,270
That bastard took my wallet!

786
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,400
Why is everyone just staring?

787
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,750
How could you?

788
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,070
Darn it...

789
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,890
That's mine! That's mine! That's mine!

790
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,750
Thank you, sir.

791
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:24,440
Shit.

792
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,560
Thank you—

793
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,840
I thought I heard your voice. It really was you.

794
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,850
It's me, Nam Sung Mi.

795
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,410
Nam Sung Mi...

796
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,950
I know. Of...

797
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,880
Of course, I know.

798
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,620
   

799
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,550
Where is he? Where is he?

800
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,410
   

801
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,330
What? Did you lose her?

802
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,860
Why? Where? Why?

803
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,470
Who's with you?

804
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:24,520
Hello? Jung Tam. Hyung.

805
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,150
Is it the Aquarium or the Cultural Arts Center?

806
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,830
I think she could go to either.

807
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,220
Telepathy.

808
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,930

809

810
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,960

813
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,070

814
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:01,080
Fishy smell.

815
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,850
 Although they're in different places, 

816
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:06,940
 they feel the same thing at the same time. 

817
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:12,470
 I call the person you can communicate with a "DNA partner." 

818
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,190
How does this make sense?

819
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:42,750
Should I go for it?

820
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,740
Hello?

821
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,400
 Yun Woo, where are you right now? 

822
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,540
- This is... 
  - Let me introduce you to the next piece. 

823
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,710
 For this piece, by painting only one side of the face, 

824
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:30,610
 it lets the viewers imagine... 

825
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:34,180
I'm sorry. I left late because I had many patients.

826
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,600
But the cars aren't moving at all.

827
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,810
I don't know where you are, but I'll be right there. I'm so sorry.

828
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,470
 Let's stop now. 

829
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:51,470
 You'll change, too. 

830
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,550
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

831
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:29,560
I'm sorry, but the show ends at 8.

832
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:33,170
Oh, okay.

833
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:36,010
I'm sorry.

834
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,010
Should we meet here by chance after 10 years?

835
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:58,190
We'll meet anywhere by chance because of our memories together.

836
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:01,610
I told you not to say stuff like that.

837
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:05,160
You're making me sad.

838
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:13,630
 Do we not have a telepathic connection as expected? 

839
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,630
 What's causing the interference? 

840
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:23,700
 Is it because Yun Woo and Mi Eun share more memories together? 

841
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,390
 I got lost and ended up here. 

842
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,180
 Or if there wasn't an interference, 

843
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,860
 Yun Woo and I are... 

844
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,340
So Jin!

845
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,960
So Jin!

846
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:53,800
It finally worked. The telepathy.

847
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,450
I know.

848
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:59,180
We get to create our fate.

849
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:02,570
You know what?

850
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:07,290
This is the first time you said "fate."

851
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,350
Should we get something to eat? I'm hungry.

852
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:13,770
Yes.

853
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:20,010
 That's how my first date with my favorite nerd started. 

854
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,220
♪  Daddy shark, doo, doo, doo, doo  ♪

855
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:26,840
♪  Grandma shark, doo, doo, doo, doo  ♪

856
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,830
It smells like fish.

857
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:31,750
Fishy smell.

858
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:39,100


859
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:44,400
♫  I will only look at you for countless days  ♫

860
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,720
♫  Reach out and hold my hand  ♫

861
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,440
♫  Say that you love me, babe  ♫

862
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:55,610
♫  That dream I’ve been drawing with each starlight  ♫

863
01:01:55,610 --> 01:02:00,700
♫  You came to me like fate  ♫

864
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:06,790
♫  After waiting through all those slow hours  ♫

865
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,500
♫  I’ll come closer to you  ♫

866
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,650
   

867
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:14,490
 How about when the experiment is over? 

868
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:18,630
 This is no good. I need to make him eat the same food as me. 

869
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:21,480
 Hey, birds of a feather flock together. 

870
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,280
 - It looks so tasty. 
 - I'm hungry. 

871
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,160
 Yun Woo is more of a picky eater than you think. 

872
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,970
 - Let me go. Please... 
 - So Jin! 

873
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:31,680
 They don't just have the same taste in food. 

874
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,160
 Did their moods, personalities, taste, and thoughts become similar, too? 

875
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,460
 He has things in common with her, but not with me. 

876
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:44,660
 Encountering my fate and taking charge of fate are different things.
