1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,310
   

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,430
   

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,820
   

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,480
   

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,090
   

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,990
   

7
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,510
   

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,970
   

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,740
 Good to see you. 

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,460
 More people than I expected came to Share Hope Fundraiser 

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,960
 with Shim Hospital. Thank you. 

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,810
 I'd like to introduce the pride of our hospital. 

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,390
 It's this tree right here. 

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,410
 This tree is called a Wish Tree. 

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,260
 If you write down your wish and hang it here, 

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,600
 I'm sure it will come true. 

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,210
 Just as mine did. 

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,240
 My wish is the same every year. 

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,660
 I hope I can be happy with the family I love for a long time. 

20
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:23,380
 I hope your wish comes true with this Wish Tree, too. 

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,200
 Thank you. 

22
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,910
   

23
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'm not a thief. 

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,290
 But you are. 

25
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,790
 You stole my happiness. 

26
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,960
   

27
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,650
 I'll take every single thing from you, too. 

28
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,380
 Han So Jin. 

29
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,580
 Come alone if you want to save this woman. 

30
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,580
 Come to the place where you and I first met. 

31
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,650
Father Andrea?

32
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,340
Yes, Sister.

33
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,160
You aren't a priest, are you?

34
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,800
Who are you?

35
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,180
Why are you doing this to me? What do you want?

36
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,330
I'm waiting for the person who'd come to save you.

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,400
Let's wait together, Sister.

38
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,400
 The place we first met. 

39
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,260
 M-Mom. 

40
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,360
   

41
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,850
   

42
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,630
 Starting route to the destination. 

43
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:11,120
   

44
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,950
Don't try to do anything funny.

45
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,360
What is it you're doing?

46
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,890
You'd better tell me!

47
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,890
Kang Hoon, let go!

48
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,460
You're mistaken, I swear!

49
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,790
It's probably my brother.

50
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,560
I have an identical twin brother.

51
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,330
I don't know where he is. We lost touch a long time ago.

52
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,000
But he'll start doing bad things again.

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,230
I know that.

54
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,230
- How dare you with that nonsense? 
 - Kang Hoon!

55
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,240
Father...

56
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,210
 He has a twin? 

57
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,980
 Then, where is the man I saw? 

58
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,230
   

59
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,400
   

60
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,540
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to... 

61
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,890
So Jin. She's in danger.

62
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,180
Why her, all of a sudden?

63
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,670
Where's your brother right now?

64
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,560
Where is he?

65
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,110
There's no time.

66
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,340
The fire will start soon.

67
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,830
Where did you find my bible? Where's that place?

68
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,850
Both of you, report this to the police for now.

69
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,070
A-Are you okay, Father?

70
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,460
   

71
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,130
What's this?

72
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,370
   

73
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,770
   

74
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,240
   

75
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,420
   

76
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,160
   

77
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,560
So Jin!

78
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,260
So Jin!

79
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,280
So Jin!

80
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,820
So Jin. So Jin!

81
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,330
Are you okay? Are you injured?

82
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,640
Yun Woo, how did you find me—

83
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,040
What happened? Tell me.

84
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,840
We're in danger. We need to run away now. Yun Woo...

85
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,930
- Yun Woo, turn around. 
 - What?

86
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,300
Turn around, I said!

87
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,850
Yun Woo!

88
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,550
Yun Woo!

89
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,860
Yun Woo!

90
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,400
We finally meet.

91
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,910
You—

92
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,470
 Seongbuk-dong. 

93
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,710
 If this is Yun Woo's parents' house, 

94
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,050
 this is Ha Ga Hui's house. 

95
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,650
 He marked the places where he started fire. 

96
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,340
 This is my neighborhood. 

97
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,950
 It's So Jin's house, the place he's planning to burn. 

98
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,500
 If so, this place and this place are either the ones he already burnt... 

99
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,630
 or where he's planning to start a fire. 

100
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,020
Yes, this is Andrea. I reported to the police.

101
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,470
But we need to find where Ms. Han is...

102
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,220
We need to find where Yi Myung is.

103
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,120
I sent a map just now. Have a close look at it.

104
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,330
 I think the map shows connections to the fires. 

105
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:03,380
 All the places are where he set on fire or the ones he's planning to. 

106
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,280
Except for two, which I'm not sure about.

107
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,940
One is in Pojin, and the other one is in Yeoncheong-gun.

108
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,570
Pojin is...

109
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,810
 Does it ring a bell? 

110
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,930
The camping site where he set his former adoptive family on fire when he was 16.

111
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,270
Pardon?

112
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,740
 That must be a former arson site, then. 

113
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,120
How about Yeoncheon-gun?

114
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,000
That's where our mother's greenhouse used to be.

115
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,530
Greenhouse?

116
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,780
 That's where Yi Myung saw a fire for the first time. 

117
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,210
Pardon?

118
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:46,750
Our mother died in a fire right in front of him.

119
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,850
Let go!

120
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,720
Mom, don't go!

121
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,830
Mom! Mom!

122
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,510
 What's the address to that place? 

123
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,480
I'll look it up and send it to you.

124
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,490
We'll be right there with the police.

125
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,910
 He's finishing it up where it started. 

126
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,930
Yun Woo.

127
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,190
Yun Woo, are you okay?

128
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,760
Who are you?

129
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,870
Why are you doing this?

130
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,300
My mom died because of you.

131
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,150
What?

132
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,220
My mom died because of you, I said.

133
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,940
- What are you talking about? 
 - Stop asking me and try to remember.

134
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,240
You're tied down. Try harder.

135
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,000
The day you destroyed all of her pots in this greenhouse,

136
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,570
my mom died.

137
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,830
Because of you.

138
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,590
 You thieve. 

139
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,950
 - What did you say? 
 - Your family is a bunch of dirty thieves. 

140
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,470
 - Thieves? 
 - Go! Go and ask about it. 

141
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,700
 Ask your mom what you stole from us. 

142
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,800
 You said he'd be our dad. 

143
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,360
 You said we'd become a perfect family. 

144
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,450
 Don't worry, Yi Myung. 

145
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,530
 He is your dad. 

146
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,190
 He'll get divorced and join us soon. 

147
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,530
 So, let's wait a little longer. 

148
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,040
 Mom, 

149
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,130
 were you having an affair with a married man? 

150
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,710
 You know how much he loves us, right? 

151
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,300
 What was your late dad like? 

152
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,600
 He hit you and So Myung every day. 

153
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,620
 It was like hell for all of us. 

154
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,480
 You getting dirty is worse than all of those things. 

155
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,270
 You're dirty and gross. 

156
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,680
 How— How could you talk to me like that— 

157
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,520
 I'll go to him immediately. 

158
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,370
 I'll face him and ask him to get out of our lives. 

159
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,640
 - No. No, Yi Myung! 
 - Let go! 

160
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,930
 - You can't! 
 - Let go! 

161
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,210
 Mom! Mom! 

162
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,620
 - No, no. 
 - Let go! 

163
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,650
 Mom! 

164
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,020
 Mom! 

165
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,010
 Because of you, my mom died. 

166
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,310
You remember, right?

167
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,150
That was my fault?

168
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,940
Of course, it was.

169
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,470
I would've never known if you didn't come here.

170
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,610
My mom wouldn't have died, then.

171
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:29,290
I'm not saying I'll kill you and take revenge because I'm so sad.

172
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,710
I was sad at first.

173
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,670
I was, but...

174
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,250
 when I looked carefully, 

175
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,640
 I realized my mom was being cleansed by fire. 

176
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,940
 Brightly and splendidly like a saint. 

177
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,060
 While in pain. 

178
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,420
It'd be a shame if only she got to experience that.

179
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,600
Are you the one who killed my father, too?

180
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,110
Yes!

181
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,110
You should've asked that sooner!

182
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,660
Your father, who proudly committed adultery his entire life,

183
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,520
and Ha Ga Hui, who had his child just to get his money...

184
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,970
Both of them must have died in that fire, repenting.

185
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,280
Ha Ga Hui?

186
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,920
 Why? Are you scared? 

187
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,320
 Because Shinhon and I will own your house and hospital? 

188
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,880
 Ga Hui and my child died. 

189
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,420
 I thought it was an accident. 

190
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,770
Crazy bastard.

191
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,570
I didn't plan it from the start,

192
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,830
but I never expected your mom to jump into the fire.

193
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,990
 Honey! Honey! 

194
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,030
I was very moved by the fact you suspected your mom.

195
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,340
How about you?

196
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,380
What did you do?

197
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,500
As you said, my mother jumped into the fire.

198
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,570
Because he wanted to save my father.

199
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,700
Because she loved him. But how about you?

200
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,320
What were you doing when your mother was dying?

201
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,590
Were you...

202
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,640
afraid you'd get hurt? Were you scared?

203
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,930
While your mother was burning to death?

204
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,440
- Shut up. 
 - Your loved one was dying,

205
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,030
and all you could do was watch.

206
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,340
Now, you're pretending to be a psychopath and a great murderer.

207
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,190
Doesn't that disgust you?

208
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,630
You can't even admit what you did wrong

209
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,080
because you're too caught up in your trauma. You're a miserable,

210
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,620
pathetic punk. Such a loser.

211
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,440
Shut up, I said. Shut up!

212
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,960
Please stop!

213
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,320
- Die. 
 - Please stop!

214
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,590
- Shut up! Shut up! 
 - Please!

215
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,760
- Die. Die! 
 - Please don't! Please...

216
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,750
Please stop!

217
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,320
I'm sorry, Sister Anna.

218
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,360
Why would you apologize?

219
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,940
Everything my brother did...

220
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,310
I should've prevented it.

221
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,480
Even after Yi Myung went to jail for arson and his adoption was terminated,

222
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,390
all I told him was to repent.

223
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,350
 I know what you're thinking right now. 

224
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,450
 You think that will save you? 

225
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,600
 You can only be saved by atoning. Please stop. Please. 

226
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,800
I might be...

227
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,100
even worse than my brother.

228
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,020
I became a priest to atone for his sins,

229
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,800
but I was actually just running away.

230
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,790
Somewhere, I can't hear his voice.

231
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,370
I...

232
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:44,190
was able to stop blaming myself and feeling guilty

233
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,600
after 10 years, thanks to you.

234
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,200
Just like what happened wasn't my fault,

235
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,390
none of this is your fault, Father.

236
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,000
No...

237
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,300
even if we are to blame for what happened,

238
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,960
we just need to stop repeating our mistakes.

239
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,400
Sunbae will be okay.

240
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm...

241
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,970
sure of that.

242
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,360
Are you okay?

243
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:45,540
I got beaten too much to say I'm okay, didn't I?

244
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:52,280
So, why did you come here, anyway?

245
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,640
Right.

246
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,430
It's not like we have a telepathic connection.

247
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,120
But that psycho told me where you were.

248
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,740
How could you joke in this situation?

249
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,420
Why did you come to me when I was by the ocean?

250
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,080
- It's because— 
 - I felt the same.

251
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,690
I just came because you were here.

252
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,410
Although we don't share a telepathic connection,

253
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,130
and we aren't...

254
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,900
DNA lovers.

255
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,170
I thought understanding the world through DNA

256
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,500
would make my life easier.

257
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,890
I kept having misfortunes in life,

258
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,930
and I didn't think I could endure it.

259
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:19,080
But if all of this was happening because my fate was predetermined by my DNA,

260
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,950
then I figured that someday,

261
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,510
because of that same DNA, I'd find happiness again.

262
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,900
So, I studied my DNA and that of the people around me to prove it.

263
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:38,630
I also wanted to predict what might happen in the future, because that,

264
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,660
I believed, would allow me to be happy.

265
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,170
But...

266
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,770
whenever I see you,

267
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,990
my world, where DNA was everything, keeps crumbling.

268
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,480
You're someone I can't predict,

269
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,970
but I keep wanting to believe what you say.

270
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,070
- So Jin. 
 - I know...

271
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,600
- you don't believe in stuff like this. 
 - I do.

272
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,670
I've been thinking the entire time coming here.

273
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,410
By lying that I was your DNA lover

274
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,890
and lingering by your side,

275
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,280
I might've put you in this danger.

276
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,700
I regretted it so much.

277
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,030
I'm so sorry I put you in this situation.

278
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,140
No.

279
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,950
Yun Woo, to be honest, I—

280
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,910
So, I'll turn everything back to normal.

281
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,310
Let's make it out alive first.

282
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,950
Our DNA didn't say we'd die early, right?

283
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,660
Did it?

284
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,820
You might've seen it.

285
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,500
It didn't.

286
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,860
Hello, Mother. This is Mi Eun.

287
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,730
I introduced myself last time.

288
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,110
I wonder if you remember.

289
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,540
I'm not here to see Yun Woo today.

290
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,770
I came to say goodbye because I heard you were going to the US.

291
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,420
You have to wake up while you're there, okay?

292
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,820
I'm sure you'd miss Korean food.

293
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,130
I'll send a list of restaurant recommendations to Yun Woo.

294
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,790
Forget all the bad memories...

295
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,150
and live happily with Yun Woo there.

296
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,470
Excuse me!

297
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,270
Excuse me!

298
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,350
Ms. Yum?

299
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,930
Are you awake?

300
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,020
Do you know where you are?

301
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,570
Please answer.

302
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,640
 The customer is not available at the moment. You'll be connected... 

303
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,620
 Yun Woo, your mother just woke up. 

304
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,210
 Call me as soon as you see this. 

305
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,280
 She's waiting for you. 

306
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,860
Stop this and let her go.

307
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,140
She has nothing to do with me.

308
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,590
I'm the one you want to kill.

309
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,210
Both you and your father lie habitually.

310
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,930
 Yeah, an invite. 

311
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,830
 It's from me. 

312
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,930
 I'll go to the restroom real quick. 

313
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,800
 Okay. 

314
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,850
 Hello, I'm Yi Myung. 

315
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,480
 You remember Shin Yi Myung, right? 

316
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,870
 Who are you? 

317
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,130
 I don't seem to recall. 

318
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,380
 You don't recall? 

319
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,760
 I don't know who you are, but could you give me space? 

320
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,440
 I'm having a meal with my son. 

321
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,550
 Who was that? 

322
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,680
 Huh? A stranger. 

323
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,720
I knew he wouldn't think of me as family,

324
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,080
but I was shocked he called me a stranger.

325
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:45,120
Don't you think your father was a worse asshole than I am?

326
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,440
Here's the last question.

327
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,820
I have a lot to say to you, but there's no time.

328
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,120
You needed a family, right?

329
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,410
I asked a question. Answer it.

330
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,190
No. That's my answer.

331
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,860
You wasted your last question.

332
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,540
You're lying.

333
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,920
What?

334
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,520
Are you a good liar because you're his son?

335
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,320
But you don't inherit the ability to lie.

336
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,430
What are you trying to pull?

337
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,740
You want to be happy.

338
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,400
You needed a family to love you.

339
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,380
I know it well because I've wanted that my whole life.

340
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,700
I know how that feels.

341
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,860
See?

342
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,700
- I can't let her go when she says that. 
 - So Jin.

343
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,070
But you have a family.

344
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:09,030
Why do you think your twin brother became a priest?

345
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,840
 You don't seem happy to see me at all. 

346
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,320
 I started hearing your voice recently. 

347
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,400
 What sin are you trying to commit now? 

348
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,000
 You aren't just hearing things. You and I are one. 

349
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,900
 I know what you're thinking right now. 

350
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,920
 Do you think you could be saved by confessing your sins to God? 

351
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,780
 When Mom was burning, I saw her soul being saved. 

352
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,520
 I'll cleanse everyone my way. 

353
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,300
 I'll save everyone. 

354
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,830
 Do you think that will save you? 

355
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,690
 You can only be saved by atoning. 

356
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,250
 Please stop. Please. 

357
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,420
 Please. 

358
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,890
While you were starting fires, killing people,

359
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,020
and using your wound as an excuse,

360
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,940
Father has spent his entire life praying for that wound to heal.

361
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,790
Even though he's your twin, who shares the same DNA.

362
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,360
How could you two be so different?

363
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,560
That's enough, So Jin.

364
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,030
Hey, talk to me instead!

365
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,370
She has nothing to do with this!

366
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,940
That accident...

367
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,640
wasn't your fault.

368
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,900
It was just an accident.

369
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,950
It was just an accident, but...

370
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,430
you're blaming yourself, thinking your mom died because of you.

371
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,000
So?

372
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,750
You want me to go back to my family and live happily?

373
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,640
Yes.

374
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,020
Stop now.

375
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,870
You can go back.

376
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,370
It's too late.

377
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,980
 Four, three, two, one. 

378
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,190
So Jin!

379
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,670
So Jin!

380
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,640
So Jin, stay with me. Are you okay?

381
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,350
Stay alert.

382
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,990
Let's go, So Jin.

383
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,550
Be careful.

384
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,380
- Yun Woo! 
 - You go first, So Jin.

385
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,970
Go first.

386
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,200
So Jin! Yun Woo!

387
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,540
Kang Hoon.

388
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,880
Yi Myung!

389
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,370
Yi Myung!

390
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,660
- Yi Myung! 
 -No!

391
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,230
Yi Myung!

392
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,840
Yi Myung!

393
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,700
You have to die for this to end.

394
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,730
Kang Hoon!

395
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,850
Get out now!

396
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,940
So Jin.

397
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,990
Be careful.

398
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,020
Sunbae! Sunbae, are you okay?

399
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,640
Are you okay?

400
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,310
Ah Ri, keep waking her up so she doesn't pass out, okay?

401
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,780
Sunbae, wake up.

402
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,190
Stop him!

403
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,550
Seo Kang Hoon! Seo Kang Hoon!

404
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,140
I missed you, Mom.

405
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,330
Let's get out for now.

406
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,520
Live and pay for your sin.

407
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,770
Shin Yi Myung.

408
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,690
Shin Yi Myung!

409
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,560
Move!

410
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,580
Over here!

411
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,330
- Take him. 
 - So Jin!

412
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,880
Excuse me. One, two, three.

413
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,550
We'll take her to the hospital.

414
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,520
Let's lift. One, two, three!

415
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,680
Where's my brother?

416
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,650
 We'll go inside! 

417
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,740
- Hey. 
 - My brother is in there.

418
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,320
Yi Myung! Yi Myung!

419
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,060
Yi Myung! Yi Myung!

420
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,140
My brother's inside, I said!

421
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,670
- Yi Myung! 
 - You can't go!

422
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,380
- Yi Myung! 
 - Are you okay?

423
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,740
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

424
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,120
Hey...

425
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,640
- Hold his legs. 
 - Okay.

426
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,150
One, two, three!

427
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,850
Hurry up!

428
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,370
Excuse me! Please move!

429
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,490
 A man in his 30s started a fire 

430
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,110
 at a greenhouse in Yeoncheon-gun, Gyeonggi-do, 

431
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:38,010
 and then committed suicide. 

432
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:42,570
 Two people were seriously injured in the fire and sent to the hospital. 

433
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:46,220
 The deceased has now been identified as the culprit behind the fire that killed a pregnant woman, 

434
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,010
 which was initially ruled as an accident, 

435
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:53,560
 and the fire in Seongbuk-dong that claimed the life of Mr. Shim. 

436
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,190
 This new development has shocked the nation. 

437
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,110
 Yun Woo. 

438
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,650
 No! 

439
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,620
 Yun Woo! 

440
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,270
Yun Woo...

441
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,250
- Noona! 
 - Yun Woo...

442
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,490
Where's Yun Woo...

443
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,430
Where's he? Is he okay?

444
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,680
He's in the OR right now.

445
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,810
OR?

446
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,330
You can't move right now!

447
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,320
Yun Woo. 
    

448
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,550
Yun Woo.

449
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,180
No.

450
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,980
Yun Woo!

451
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,380
Yun Woo...

452
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,330
Please... No...

453
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,010
Yun Woo!

454
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,280
Yun Woo...

455
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,890
Please... Yun Woo.

456
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,270
   

457
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,020
Are you Mr. Shim's family?

458
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,940
Yes, he's okay, right?

459
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,280
The other wounds weren't serious, but his right arm was badly burnt.

460
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,690
The muscles and ligaments were seriously damaged.

461
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:22,370
I operated an emergency surgery on them, but we need to see how he recovers.

462
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:26,190
He needs to recover from the wound and inflammation for skin and ligament transplant.

463
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,520
Did he regain consciousness?

464
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,180
His oxygen saturation level went down due to the smoke.

465
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,280
He's connected to a respirator.

466
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,200
Most people wake up while connected to a respirator,

467
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,750
but Mr. Shim strangely hasn't.

468
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,900
Noona.

469
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,730
They say you can go home tomorrow if you feel better.

470
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,430
I need to go to the police station to make a witness statement.

471
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,030
I got you crab porridge.

472
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,570
Eat it if you don't like the hospital food.

473
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,100
Don't worry.

474
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,160
You should rest at home afterward.

475
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,920
Ah Ri will stop by and bring me clothes tomorrow.

476
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,690
Both of you are here right now.

477
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,690
How could I rest at home comfortably?

478
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,920
Mi Eun said she'd switch with me tomorrow morning.

479
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,490
There's no one to care for Yun Woo right now.

480
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,690
Still, you should get some sleep.

481
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:00,250
It'd be a disaster if you passed out, too.

482
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,500
I heard you got stabbed, too.

483
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,400
What do you mean I was stabbed?

484
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,870
I'm all healed. Just look at me.

485
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:12,050
Where was it? How badly were you hurt?

486
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,870
Look at this. You were seriously injured, weren't you?

487
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,020
It's not like that.

488
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,150
Don't worry about me, and care for yourself.

489
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,020
♫  Every empty spot  ♫

490
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,780
♫  Of my heart  ♫

491
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,470
♫  Is colored by you  ♫

492
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:55,240
♫  Who came to me without words  ♫

493
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,830
♫  The story we will paint together  ♫

494
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,950
 Why did you come to me when I was by the ocean? 

495
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,060
 I felt the same. 

496
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,690
 I just came because you were here. 

497
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,420
 Although we don't share a telepathic connection, 

498
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,090
 and we aren't... 

499
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,020
 DNA lovers. 

500
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,780
♫  I’ll always look at you  ♫

501
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,230
♫  And smile  ♫

502
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,380
Yes, sir.

503
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,350
Yun Woo?

504
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:51,090
   

505
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,930
Yun Woo.

506
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,500
Please wake up now.

507
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,420
I still...

508
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,040
have something to tell you.

509
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,380
Kang Hoon...

510
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,360
Kang Hoon.

511
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,830
Kang Hoon.

512
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,270
Hyung.

513
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:13,150
Hyung, are you okay? Are you awake?

514
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:15,640
- Where's So Jin? 
 - She's okay.

515
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,790
Hold on a moment. I'll bring the doctor.

516
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,540
- I have my clothes down there. 
 - Are you done yet?

517
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,070
I'm all done.

518
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,660
Yes.

519
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:46,590
M-Mom.

520
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,790
So Ri called me.

521
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,590
I attended an event nearby.

522
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,140
I thought I'd stop by.

523
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,780
Does she have to say that?

524
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,990
Carry on. No need to worry about me.

525
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,850
Have a seat here.

526
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,900
There are drinks in the fridge. Do you want one?

527
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,440
Oh, I'm okay.

528
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,810
Kang Hoon told me that...

529
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:16,510
you almost got killed by the kidnapper.

530
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:20,050
I heard stuff like that can traumatize you.

531
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,900
What a shame.

532
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,060
I'm okay.

533
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,110
Stay at my place if you'd like to.

534
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,920
For a month or two.

535
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:44,990
Well, I have a shoot abroad.

536
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:47,900
I could use a dog sitter.

537
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,760
I'll step out for a second.

538
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,240
What for? I've already processed your discharge.

539
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,850
Well, no. Well, um...

540
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,780
I wanted to say goodbye.

541
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,940
I'll be right back.

542
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,000
Kidnap? How does that make sense?

543
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,940
What are the police doing?

544
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,740
My goodness.

545
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,860
How...

546
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,180
Pardon? What did you say?

547
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:35,180
I'll get going now.

548
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:40,630
Tell your sister to use this to care for herself.

549
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,540
She's looking terrible right now.

550
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,720
Noona!

551
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,460
I was on my way to you.

552
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,630
Yun Woo woke up just now.

553
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,160
What?

554
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,540
Yun Woo.

555
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,240
So Jin.

556
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,250
Are you okay?

557
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,330
What did the doctors say? Your arm...

558
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,860
I think it's okay.

559
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,690
How about you, So Jin?

560
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:27,620
I was so worried that things might go wrong for you.

561
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,080
I'm sorry you got hurt because of me.

562
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,270
You shouldn't feel bad.

563
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,990
Everything happened because of me.

564
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,010
Thank you...

565
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:53,100
for hanging in there while you were there and

566
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,180
for being alive.

567
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:06,370
What do they say about your arm?

568
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:09,180
Is it really okay?

569
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,470
It will heal quickly once I get the reconstructive surgery.

570
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,320
Don't worry.

571
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:22,100
What happens after you recover?

572
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,750
You were going to the US.

573
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,890
Are you still doing that?

574
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:42,300
By chance, if you were leaving because of me,

575
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,900
I wanted to tell you not to do that.

576
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:53,540
I've always thought that I was the only one who got hurt in relationships.

577
00:51:53,540 --> 00:52:00,090
But I think in our relationship... I'm the one who hurt you.

578
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:03,140
I'm the one who suddenly entered your life,

579
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,770
and I'm also the one who wanted to experiment.

580
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:12,080
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable because of me anymore.

581
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,870
The reason I'm going to the US...

582
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,510
isn't just because of you, So Jin.

583
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,500
I said I'd turn things back to normal.

584
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,090
My mother and I

585
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:37,550
also want to start fresh somewhere new.

586
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,100
And who knows?

587
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,880
I just might meet my real DNA lover there.

588
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,840
Yun Woo, I...

589
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,220
You came.

590
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,200
"You came"? Do you know you almost died?

591
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,510
What's going on? Are you feeling okay?

592
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:08,870
I'm okay, as you can see.

593
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,760
How could something like this have happened?

594
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,780
Who's that bastard?

595
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,670
 Should I teach him a lesson? 

596
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,240
 I'm in good shape these days. Look. 

597
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:39,970
 There was a book left where Yi Myung had been. 

598
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:44,290
 It must have been my Bible that he took at some point. 

599
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,600
   

600
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,430
 Despite everything being burned, 

601
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:53,360
 this was the only thing left untouched. 

602
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:59,610
 Maybe it's because he truly wanted to return it to me. 

603
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,810
 Your Bible says "Father" hundreds of times. 

604
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:12,910
 In my life, I had three fathers. 

605
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:16,290
 Though all of them eventually abandoned me, 

606
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,970
 my second father was a bit different. 

607
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,700
 He granted me a wish and supported it. 

608
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,600
 Even though it was brief, 

609
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,140
 he was the only one I called "Father" with joy. 

610
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:39,840
 I wanted to ask him one last time 

611
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,190
 if he truly didn't remember me 

612
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:48,490
 and if I truly meant nothing to him. 

613
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,630
 Who are you— 

614
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,370
 What are you doing here? 

615
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:09,340
 You told me to call you "Father" back then. 

616
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:15,360
 Why didn't you tell me you had a wife and son? 

617
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:23,390
 We aren't even blood-related. What father? 

618
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:29,300
 It happened 20 years ago. What does that have to do with me now? 

619
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:34,740
 Did you even know my mother had passed? 

620
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,530
 I did. 

621
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:42,750
 That's why I sponsored you, brothers, so you grew up nicely at the orphanage. 

622
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,000
 I thought I paid you back by doing that. 

623
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:50,970
 What else can I do? 

624
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,490
 Do you need money? 

625
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:00,860
 If you were going to forget us so easily, 

626
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,850
 why did you even start? 

627
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,820
 I'll call the police if you don't leave immediately. 

628
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,900
 I never had a son like you. 

629
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,770
 So, don't ever show up in front of me again. Do you understand? 

630
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:14,150
 Get out! 

631
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,340
 I'll never see you again. 

632
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,110
 Goodbye, Father. 

633
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:41,180
   

634
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,970
Yes?

635
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,790
- Hello. 
 - Hello, Doctor.

636
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,170
How are you feeling?

637
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:07,380
You must be in pain.

638
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,280
It's not too bad.

639
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,590
How is my condition?

640
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,080
The emergency treatment went well.

641
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,060
Regarding your current condition,

642
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:22,330
the muscles and ligaments connecting your palm, fingers, and forearm were damaged.

643
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:26,090
This may cause your fingers to lock up.

644
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:30,640
- Lock up? 
 - To put it simply,

645
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,000
you might not be able to move the damaged area.

646
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,930
Of course, that's the worst-case scenario.

647
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:39,410
He won't be able to move them?

648
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,000
When will the symptoms start?

649
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,080
Even if they don't lock up immediately,

650
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,640
the condition might worsen.

651
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,990
Get intensive care at Shim Hospital for now.

652
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,550
You'll have to keep a close look at it.

653
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,680
Yun Woo!

654
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,840
You can't be standing just yet.

655
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,960
What happened?

656
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,980
- Did you get injured? 
 - It's nothing.

657
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,630
Sit down.

658
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,820
I didn't know, but...

659
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:29,510
it sounds like everyone thought I killed your father.

660
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,890
I heard they caught the culprit.

661
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:35,460
They want to hear what happened that day.

662
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,630
While you were unconscious,

663
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,850
you've been smiling the whole time. Did you know?

664
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,410
I saw your father in my dream.

665
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,610
Is it because of that music box?

666
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:03,500
It's the piece I played on the first day I met your father.

667
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:10,250
 He was young and handsome like when we first met. 

668
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,560
 He was at my first recital and... 

669
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:17,040
 he said he fell in love with me hearing me play. 

670
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,120
He kept saying that in my dream.

671
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,760
Mi Eun got you a good gift.

672
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,230
Mi Eun?

673
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,670
Oh, that young lady?

674
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,310
She's pretty.

675
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,400
- You like her, right? 
 - She's a friend.

676
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:41,000
Yun Woo, I hated your father so much, but...

677
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,970
all I could think...

678
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:49,270
was that I should save him then.

679
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:57,160
 Honey! 

680
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,950
 Honey! 

681
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:01,170
 - Don't come. 
 - Honey! 

682
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:03,810
 - Don't... 
 - Honey! 

683
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:18,170
 That was our ending. 

684
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:20,780
Because we wanted to save each other,

685
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:26,830
we weren't afraid to die at all.

686
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:34,030
 Yun Woo! Yun Woo, your hand! 

687
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,600
 You go first, So Jin. 

688
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:41,260
I've become confident in living my life since then.

689
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:47,790
What's been binding me my whole life...

690
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:50,960
wasn't love.

691
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,930
It must've been hatred.

692
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,750
I'm almost all healed, right?

693
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,100
But what happened to your arm?

694
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,280
It's really nothing.

695
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,570
I think it's something.

696
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,250
This is...

697
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,240
I'm sorry.

698
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:33,780
I didn't do my job as a mother.

699
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:37,970
I have no memory of spending time with you.

700
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:42,790
It means I did nothing for you.

701
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,510
It's all in the past.

702
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:04,900
I've already forgotten it all.

703
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,580
Have you really forgotten it all?

704
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,880
When you get discharged,

705
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,690
cook for me.

706
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,700
Don't make it too spicy.

707
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,780
Okay.

708
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:32,110
   

709
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:38,700
I ended up coming here again.

710
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:45,710
I wondered if I was being nosy on the way here.

711
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,380
It turns out I changed a lot.

712
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:54,130
Yun Woo is taking the 8 o'clock flight to the US tonight.

713
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,500
I see.

714
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:10,120
The accident made me think he might really love you.

715
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,940
He knows a surgeon's life depends on his hand.

716
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:18,540
But he gave up on it for you.

717
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,240
I think it was a miracle.

718
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:26,800
Did he give up his hand?

719
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,990
Didn't you know?

720
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:37,910
He may never hold the scalpel again because of the injury.

721
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,300
Pardon?

722
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:42,770
He said he was okay last time...

723
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:45,800
He probably didn't want you to know.

724
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,700
You said the flight is leaving at 8, right?

725
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:05,360
What? Are you expecting someone?

726
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,210
No.

727
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:11,680
Dr. Shim.

728
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,960
Hello.

729
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,760
Ms. Yoo.

730
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,370
- This is my mother. 
 - Hello.

731
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:23,140
Little princess. You got so healthy.

732
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:27,130
But you shouldn't be traveling yet.

733
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:29,410
We aren't going anywhere.

734
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:35,800
I came as soon as Yo Han said you were leaving for the US.

735
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:39,700
So Purumi could see your face.

736
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:44,340
She might never see you again.

737
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,980
Why would you say that?

738
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:48,330
We can do video chats.

739
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:50,480
Purumi, let's talk once a year.

740
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,590
You have to be healthy until then, okay?

741
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:55,810
Purumi and I...

742
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,520
will never forget you for the rest of our lives.

743
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:06,340
I feel the same way.

744
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,460
 You have to see Yun Woo. 

745
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:23,040
 The fact that he'd have a woman he'd never forget... 

746
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,100
 bothers me more. 

747
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,070
Sir, please drive a little faster.

748
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,800
 Here's an announcement. 
   

749
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,580
- Yun Woo. 
 - Yes.

750
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:47,110
I think we should go in now.

751
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:49,930
Is it already time?

752
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:41,170
 Yun Woo said... 

753
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:45,960
 he learned about love because of you. 

754
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:52,420
 So, meet him and tell him what you want to tell him, So Jin. 

755
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,300
Yun Woo...

756
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,230
Yun Woo.

757
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,950
Yun Woo! Yun Woo!

758
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:13,820
No way.

759
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,680
Yun Woo...

760
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,730
Yun Woo...

761
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,000
Yun Woo...

762
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:33,250
Yun Woo...

763
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,100
Yun Woo...

764
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:55,990
♫  You'll be here another tomorrow  ♫

765
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:59,840
♫  You'll be here another tomorrow  ♫

766
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,350
♫  Just like you were meant to be  ♫

767
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:07,340
♫  Just like you were meant to be  ♫

768
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:11,340
♫  My mind  ♫

769
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:14,160
♫  And my heart  ♫

770
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,350
♫  Is completely filled with you  ♫

771
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:24,690
♫  Someday, when I  ♫

772
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:28,150
♫  Circle around you  ♫

773
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,770
♫  You hold my hand  ♫

774
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:33,060
   

775
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:37,420
 Your life was a success since you loved one woman with your entire soul. 

776
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:40,960
 Dr. Shim must've arrived safely, right? 

777
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,330
 He's probably doing fine there. 

778
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:47,710
 If there is a designer of our lives like our DNA, 

779
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:50,260
 some people aren't supposed to meet. 

780
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,020
 It looks like everyone from Shim Hospital is here today. 

781
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:56,580
 Probably. 

782
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:59,150
 There's fate in coincidence... 

783
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:01,450
 and there's DNA that controls fate. 

784
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:07,480
 The DNA lovers the heaven helps are bound to meet someday.
