1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,410
   

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,400
   

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,870
   

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,900
   

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,170
   

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:35,020
   

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,600
   

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,030
   

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,990


10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,910
 There are two types of men in my life. 

11
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,010
Shame, shame. You're unbelievable. What a fool.

12
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,760
 My DNA is crazy about him, but he keeps hurting me. 

13
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,590
 Are you okay? 

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,660
 My DNA doesn't react toward him at all, 

15
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,650
 but he keeps saving me. 

16
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,040
 - Why are you sick? 
 - What a fool. 

17
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,510
 - You're hurting me. 
 - What a fool. 

18
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,840
 Kang Hoon is upset. 

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,620
 You're a fool, So Jin. 

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,530
 What kind of trick is my fate playing? 

21
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:42,410
   

22
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,260
Let's try getting up. Slowly.

23
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,180
Gosh, seriously.

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,920
You have acute pancreatitis.

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,210
What did he feed you?

26
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,320
Yun Woo did nothing wrong.

27
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,660
I should've been careful.

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,880
How could you say that now?

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,720
Just drink this so you recover quickly.

30
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,420
When I had pancreatitis, barley tea helped more than plum juice.

31
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,060
I'm not the same as you. I'll drink it.

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,050
Are you okay?

33
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,860
Yun Woo, how did you find me here?

34
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,870
He called your phone. So, I told him.

35
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,980
Hyung, what did you feed her that she got pancreatitis?

36
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,140
I didn't know you were so severely lactose intolerant. I'm so sorry.

37
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,170
I said it's not his fault.

38
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,950
She can't digest fatty food or heavy cream well.

39
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,830
Heavy cream?

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,370
But why are you okay with the convenience store sauce?

41
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,710
I think I was nervous because I had never eaten at your place before.

42
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,540
- Ms. Han So Jin? 
 - Yes.

43
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,620
For pancreatitis, you can take antibiotics, get medicine, and leave.

44
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,460
But we found something strange.

45
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,880
Something is sticking out on the left bottom of your abdomen.

46
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,370
Pardon?

47
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,960
Lie down for a moment.

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,280
Okay.

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,040
Slowly.

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,550
Excuse me.

51
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,920
Let me press down.

52
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,770
Does it feel okay?

53
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,220
It doesn't hurt.

54
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,790
Could you wait outside for a moment?

55
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,080
Hyung, let's go.

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,990
May I check the ultrasound with you?

57
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,630
There were similar cases of fibroid or cervical cancer.

58
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,710
- Cancer? 
 - Right,

59
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,370
I have a BRCA gene.

60
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,090
It means it's not unusual for me to develop conditions like this.

61
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,410
It happened sooner than I expected, but—

62
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,340
Are you serious right now?

63
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,060
How could you say that without even flinching?

64
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,690
So Jin, you don't mind me checking the ultrasound, right?

65
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,660
That'd be okay, right?

66
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,810
No, you can't. You can never.

67
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,480
Both of you, please leave.

68
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,920
I'm sorry. This is important to me, too.

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,160
Let me check it myself.

70
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,620
   

71
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,160
Hyung, how's Noona?

72
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,730
I'd need to have a thorough checkup,

73
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,550
but I think it's a fibroid.

74
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,490
Doesn't she need surgery, then?

75
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,900
She'll need surgery once the location and size are confirmed.

76
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,930
How could she not have known?

77
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,330
It means she's been in pain at times, right?

78
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,570
I'll take care of it. Don't worry so much.

79
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,280
By the way, Kang Hoon,

80
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,570
what are you to So Jin?

81
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,660
 Kang Hoon, please come pick me up. 

82
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,240
 I think I'm dying right now. 

83
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,150
 It hurts so much. 

84
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,450
 Think about it. 

85
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,200
She wanted you when she was in danger and felt desperate.

86
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,710
There's someone you want to share pain and hardship with.

87
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,680
And there's someone you only want to share pretty and nice things.

88
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,190
That's it. Don't worry about it.

89
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,470
Are you okay with that? If she only wants you when she's sick?

90
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,450
I'm okay.

91
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,740
If she wants me at any moment, I'll run to her like I just did.

92
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,080
Thanks, Hyung.

93
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,950
 Don't follow me! Please! 

94
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,900
 Let me go... 

95
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,270
 right now. Please. 

96
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,100
 What's going on? 

97
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,160
 So Jin! 

98
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,060
 Sorry, I'll check the ultrasound myself. 

99
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,520
I tried to share the gut bacteria. What is all this now?

100
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,770
Here.

101
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,980
So Jin only eats my porridge when she's sick.

102
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,630
Feed it to her if she refuses to eat it.

103
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,360
Do you think she's a baby?

104
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,150
She'd like it. See you.

105
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,520
- I'll go now. 
 - Okay.

106
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,350
Geez.

107
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,090
It's better to starve before you stop having diarrhea.

108
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,080
This is like a torture.

109
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,210
I don't think my stomach is hurting anymore.

110
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,890
Can't I just eat?

111
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,750
Pancreatitis doesn't go away with just one antibiotic shot.

112
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,330
I'm really not in pain.

113
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,910
 When I had pancreatitis, barley tea helped more than plum juice. 

114
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,380
It really doesn't hurt.

115
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,810
Is it because of the barley tea?

116
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,210
It's Kang Hoon.

117
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,810
Dad made this for you.

118
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,920
Stop picking at it and eat more.

119
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,000
Here. Say ah!

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,180
That's your bite size.

121
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,340
Just eat it. Open your mouth wide.

122
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,650
Here. Say ah!

123
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,770
It's too bland. I need soy sauce.

124
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,340
Porridge is supposed to be bland.

125
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,480
It's way too bland, okay?

126
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,110
It's not bland at all.

127
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,340
Hold on!

128
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,570
Sharing a spoon is basically an indirect kiss.

129
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,350
Because you share the matching allogeneic bacteria in the saliva.

130
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,070
Indirect kiss?

131
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,320
Bacteria?

132
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,310
Ew...

133
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
We've shared a spoon countless times.

134
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,340
This isn't right.

135
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,060
Geez...

136
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,100
What are you doing?

137
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,530
Are you giving up on creating

138
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,810
matching bacteria by sharing the same food with the Sewer?

139
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,590
Yes.

140
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,420
I don't think that's happening anymore.

141
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,420
I'm leaving. Return the thermal bottle later.

142
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,580
Your dad is always doing me a favor. Thank him for me.

143
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,500
Just go to your appointment with Yun Woo. Don't be shy about it.

144
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,170
You need the best surgeon for your operation.

145
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,670
- At least Yun Woo is a trustworthy doctor. 
 - Geez.

146
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,940
I'll let someone else perform the surgery.

147
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,760
I can't let him do that, too.

148
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,450
I'll check later, okay?

149
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,190
I'm leaving.

150
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,950
Ah Ri, can we give Ahjussi two bunches of water celery?

151
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,000
Go ahead. I can get it easily because I have their contact.

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,140
Thank you. Put it down. You'll get pancreatitis.

153
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,420
Kang Hoon, wait just a moment!

154
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,360
Don't run!

155
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,530
You'll fall. Be careful.

156
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,800
Hey, are you okay? Is your back okay?

157
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,880
I told you not to run.

158
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,660
Get up if you're okay.

159
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,800
Yes, right.

160
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,540
T-This is still fine, though.

161
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,390
Give this to your dad.

162
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,810
It's probably organic because Ah Ri bought it.

163
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,350
Okay, thank you.

164
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,860
I-I'm leaving.

165
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,830
Okay, bye.

166
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,700
Bye? Okay.

167
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,620
- Father, 
 - Yeah?

168
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,340
So Jin asked me to give you this.

169
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,710
It's water celery.

170
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,540
- Kang Hoon, what's wrong? 
 - What?

171
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,540
Why is your face so red?

172
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,610
- Are you having a fever? 
 - No.

173
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,910
No, no, no!

174
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,360
Father, I'll...

175
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,130
I'll go get some fresh air.

176
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,670
Huh? Kang Hoon. Kang Hoon!

177
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,910
Our lips just happened to hit each other.

178
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,970
Yes.

179
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,810
It's not such a big deal.

180
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,680
Shit. Run.

181
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,650
Run for now. Run for now.

182
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,580
Run, run, run!

183
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,520
He's really out of it.

184
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,330
Why is he running in the middle of the night?

185
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,620
 You always cry here alone, huh? 

186
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,350
 I saw everything. 

187
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,880
 Go away! 

188
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,160
 Go away! 

189
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,810
 I'll go if you tell me why, kid. 

190
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,120
 I'm not a kid! 

191
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,670
 I have a name. It's Seo Kang Hoon! 

192
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,180
 Kang Hoon? So, why do you always cry? 

193
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:32,460
 My mom keeps asking me who I am. 

194
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,480
 She says she doesn't know my name. 

195
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,300
 Is your mom sick? 

196
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,550
 I don't know. 

197
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,210
 All she does is sleep. 

198
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:51,240
 From now on, I'll call your name a lot in your mom's place. Happy? 

199
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,310
 You're not my mom! 

200
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,420
 Kang Hoon. 

201
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,230
 Don't call me! 

202
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,680
 Kang Hoon. Seo Kang Hoon. 

203
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,460
 Seo Kang Hoon. 

204
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,610
Yes, she's Noona.

205
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,980
She's just Noona.

206
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,840
I...

207
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,460
like Noona?

208
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,370
 I sent a purse as a gift. 

209
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,690
 It matches with mine. 

210
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:15,710
Really? Wow, you're the best.

211
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,540
 Are you drinking alone on your birthday? 

212
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,290
Yes. I have no one to spend my birthday with.

213
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,400
 I'm coming over now. Wait for me. 

214
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,720
It's okay, Mom. I'm fine.

215
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,100
To be honest, there was one person I wanted to spend the day with.

216
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,910
 One person? 

217
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,210
It's Yun Woo.

218
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,900
Thinking about it, when we were dating,

219
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,900
we spent half of our time together traveling for fun.

220
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,150
But we didn't take photos of just the two of us.

221
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,920
 Really? 

222
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:00,480
A friend in Belgium sent this photo to me two years ago.

223
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,350
I've been keeping it tucked away,

224
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,160
and I'm looking at it now while drinking.

225
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,120
I feel...

226
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,100
kind of sad, Mom.

227
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,050
Because this is the only photo of us together.

228
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,550
 Mi Eun, do you love him? 

229
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,250
Yes. Of course, I love him.

230
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,500
There are many people I love...

231
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,880
and one of them is Yun Woo.

232
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,180
I just wanted to eat something tasty with him and talk about the old days.

233
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,920
 Well, I'm sorry. 

234
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,130
 I'm having dinner with So Jin at home tonight. 

235
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,900
 I'll just have a tea and leave, then. 

236
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,930
 I'm sorry. I'm cooking right now. 

237
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,810
 I want to just focus on that. 

238
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,820
 Okay, then. 

239
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,260
 Here, d-drink this. 

240
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,540
 Get home safely. I'm sorry. 

241
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,000
But I got rejected at his doorway.

242
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,670
To be honest, I feel so embarrassed and small right now,

243
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,350
but I'm talking about him again.

244
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,500
- Mom. 
  - Yes? 

245
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,830
I know I can't...

246
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,930
but I want...

247
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,090
that man.

248
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,770
 That's my girl. 

249
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:48,250
 You decide when to take or leave. 

250
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,110
W-What do you think? Doesn't this place look good?

251
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,690
Yes.

252
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,910
Well, yes.

253
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,040
Did you even ask the coach if I like blue crab?

254
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,330
Their blue crabs are as meaty as snow crabs.

255
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,170
But they aren't as big. So you need a bit of skill.

256
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,730
Let me remove the meat for you.

257
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,090
Gosh.

258
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,490
Are you okay? Let me do it.

259
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,210
No, no.

260
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,480
I'm known for my dexterity.

261
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,740
I'm not dexterous at all.

262
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,840
You have very pretty hands.

263
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,390
Thank you.

264
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,440
You can't hurt hands like yours.

265
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,680
It's okay. Just eat. I'll do it.

266
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,730
- Give it to me. 
 - Ouch!

267
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,770
What's wrong?

268
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,690
Did it poke you?

269
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,810
Dr. Yuh! Dr. Yuh?

270
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,920
Dr. Yuh! Dr. Yuh?

271
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,850
Wake up, Dr. Yuh!

272
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,810
Blood...

273
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,720
- Blood? Put your legs up! 
 - Phobia...

274
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,120
- Put your legs up! 
 - Hemophobia...

275
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,220
Pardon?

276
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,410
- Hemo... 
 - Hemo?

277
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,220
Doctor, are you afraid of blood?

278
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,790
- Yes. 
 - You have hemophobia, right? 
  (T/N: fear of blood) 

279
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,720
I'm used to handling fear.

280
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,350
Follow my lead. Breathe in when I say "one."

281
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,560
And breathe out when I say, "two."

282
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,100
One. Two. Breathe.

283
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,830
 Shim Hospital provides various custom care in 

284
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,010
 gynecology, rheumatology, internal medicine, and surgery. 

285
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,560
 We're a general hospital that provides care throughout your life. 

286
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,750
You can't move.

287
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,710
You have a fibroid. You need surgery.

288
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,800
Pardon? S-Surgery?

289
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,810
You need surgery. What will you do? Let it grow?

290
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,620
If it grows more, it could push other organs and cause complications—

291
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,300
Pardon? C-Complications?

292
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,470
Explain it to her.

293
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,650
Okay, I will.

294
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,640
I'll see the next patient.

295
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,300
I'll wipe that off for you.

296
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,420
I need a guardian after the surgery.

297
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,420
What should I do?

298
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,920
   

299
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,560
 What? Keep it short. 

300
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,350
Yes, Mom.

301
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,540
It's not a big deal...

302
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,110
I apparently need fibroid surgery.

303
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,060
I suppose it's kind of big.

304
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,670
So, it will be an open surgery.

305
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,830
 Fibroid? When is the surgery? 

306
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,710
I'm thinking April 3rd.

307
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,380
 Third? 

308
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,770
 You can't. I have a show in Busan. 

309
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,090
When do you not have a show, then?

310
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,340
Let's see.

311
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,270
Not this month or the next month.

312
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,660
I think June would work. The second week of June...

313
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,020
No, schedule it for the third week.

314
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,050
I'd be free then.

315
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,450
June?

316
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,350
Mom, I said I need surgery.

317
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,850
You want me to get sick two months later to work with your schedule?

318
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,640
 It's your surgery and your business. 

319
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,770
 Would you feel better if you made me the villain again? 

320
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,760
 I'm busy right now. Let's talk later. 

321
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,560
   

322
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,130
Dad,

323
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:11,550
I'll be having a fibroid surgery.

324
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,330
Thinking about being alone in the hospital room

325
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,900
scares me.

326
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,340
I'm scared to go to the operating room alone in a wheelchair,

327
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,450
and I'm also scared to be put under anesthesia.

328
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,220
Would I be able to handle it alone?

329
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,410
If you...

330
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,450
held my hand just once, Dad,

331
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,930
I don't think I'd feel scared.

332
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:00,090
Why did you have to leave in such a hurry?

333
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,600
I miss you.

334
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,920
She's a special patient. Please take extra care.

335
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,610
She must be feeling very anxious.

336
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,350
You've received complaints about being unfriendly, Dr. Choi.

337
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,190
Please take extra care this time.

338
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,140
Complaints?

339
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,600
What are we, hotel workers? We're doctors.

340
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,360
Doctors are in the service industry, too. Being friendly is necessary.

341
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,770
Consider the patient's personality and emotional state.

342
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,750
What else should I consider?

343
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,060
Her diet, looks,

344
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:22,570
and if she's flirting with you or not, too?

345
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,910
Did I do something wrong?

346
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,280
You're telling me to take extra care because you like her.

347
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,850
What?

348
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,680
I didn't know you like a whiny and childish type now.

349
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,620
She's an adult. Why is she so afraid to be examined at a hospital?

350
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,260
Give me her medical record.

351
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,090
- I'll take over. 
 - Pardon?

352
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:50,100
As you said, is it a problem to treat someone I like?

353
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,680
What are you doing? Leave.

354
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,920
Yes?

355
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Assistant Director, Ms. Han So Jin is here.

356
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,950
Okay.

357
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:37,050
Dr. Choi was supposed to be my surgeon.

358
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,890
This surgery is my specialty.

359
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,530
Allow me to do it, So Jin.

360
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,540
Are you telling me to show you inside my stomach?

361
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,240
You scanned all the DNA in my body.

362
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,550
That's more extreme.

363
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,740
But still,

364
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,660
this isn't the same.

365
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,750
You trust me, right?

366
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,880
If you look at this,

367
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,480
this thing is a bit big.

368
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,860
But let's do an MRI scan and get started immediately.

369
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,190
Surgery?

370
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,220
I'll have a surgical mark, then...

371
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,830
What's wrong with a surgical mark?

372
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,860
If my girlfriend had a surgical mark,

373
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,670
I'd be sad thinking how much it must've hurt.

374
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,860
But I'm glad I have you, Yun Woo.

375
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,030
You'll make sure I'll have minimal surgical marks, right?

376
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:04,140
Of course. Don't worry.

377
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,470
   
 One, two, three! 

378
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,310
It's past my birthday, okay?

379
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,350
 Happy birthday! 

380
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,990
It's overflowing.

381
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,660
This was just an excuse to drink, right?

382
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,390
You're too quick.

383
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,670
So, what did you do on your birthday yesterday?

384
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:31,520
Yes, it's a bit noisy in here.

385
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,560
Hurry up. Tell me.

386
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,630
   

387
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,830
Yes, thank you.

388
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,100
I'll get back to you. Okay.

389
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,160
Yes, Han So Jin. What's up?

390
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,890
 Han So Jin? 

391
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,120
The 3rd. Just for a day.

392
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,020
Can you make time?

393
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,750
 The 3rd? I have a photoshoot that day. 

394
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,710
 It's an important shoot. I can't cancel it. 

395
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,760
 Why? What's going on? 

396
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,810
I need to get surgery, but I need a guardian.

397
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:09,450
 It's a fibroid, but I need general anesthesia for open surgery. 

398
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,010
Come on.

399
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,020
It's not even cancer. Every other person gets that surgery.

400
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,970
You sound just like Mom.

401
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,200
You certainly have Yoo Myung Hui's genes.

402
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,570
 Do you know Ms. Yoo? 

403
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,140
 I'm her daughter. 

404
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,000
 I'm not her social daughter, but a biological one. 

405
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,250
 Han So Jin and Han So Ri were sisters? 

406
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:48,090
Is something bothering you?

407
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,290
I didn't mean to eavesdrop earlier.

408
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,860
It was my sister.

409
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,890
Why did she have to get sick?

410
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,230
She chose the day I can't come, too.

411
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,010
You must be very close since you're so upset.

412
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,840
We aren't close. We're basically strangers.

413
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,690
A stranger you feel sorry for.

414
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:10,410
Because she's deprived of affection, she's so nosy.

415
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,180
She gets involved in other people's personal lives.

416
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,990
Hey, hey! You know, my sister...

417
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,630
can't cut ties with anyone.

418
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:25,340
That idiot can't leave her friend who took her money.

419
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,290
She can't leave her boyfriend, who cheated.

420
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:36,850
And she can't leave our family, who only says

421
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,840
cruel things, either.

422
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,280
Isn't she such a loser? Seriously.

423
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,660
So? When is the surgery?

424
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,430
 - The 3rd.  
 - The 3rd?

425
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,620
Okay, I'll be there the day before. Don't worry.

426
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,170
 You're a firefighter. Save people instead of wasting time at the hospital. 

427
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,520
I know your family is busy.

428
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,280
I'm your guardian starting now, okay?

429
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,720
 No, thank you. I don't want a guardian who's younger than me. 

430
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,850
I'm bigger than you, okay?

431
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,300
I'll stop by your place later. Bye.

432
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,280
You look like a worried boyfriend.

433
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,900
She'll get better after the surgery. Don't worry.

434
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,540
She's not as healthy as you.

435
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,770
She can't even do ten squats.

436
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,510
When she got the gallstone removed,

437
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,980
she kept getting IV treatment because she couldn't eat.

438
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,570
Anyway, I'll leave early tonight.

439
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,000
There's a sparring session before the competition.

440
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,370
I'm worried because the sparring partner is strong,

441
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,230
but someone will come to cheer for me. It'll make me stronger.

442
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,220
Who?

443
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,110
You mean, Jung Tam?

444
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,320
   

445
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,720
Stretch all the way! Yes, all the way!

446
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,220
Open your eyes. How will you watch the match if you're so scared?

447
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,800
I can watch the match. I'm praying right now.

448
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,020
Okay, let's just say that.

449
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,620
Put your guard up! Guard up!

450
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,750
   

451
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,950
Seriously. I know it's Sung Mi, but she can't handle the UFC rookie.

452
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,500
She's getting beaten too much.

453
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,850
S-Sung Mi is getting beaten?

454
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,500
Yes.

455
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,750
S-Sung Mi!

456
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,440
Get up! Get up, Sung Mi!

457
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,080
Nam Sung Mi, fighting!

458
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,610
N-Nam Sung Mi, fighting!

459
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:41,680
Get up, Nam Sung Mi! Get up!

460
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,960
You can do it!

461
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,010
Yes, Sung Mi! Yes!

462
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,330
That's right! That's right!

463
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,780
Great, Sung Mi! Go, Sung Mi!

464
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,090
Go, Sung Mi!

465
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:55,840
You need to keep going! Keep going!

466
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,920
Let's stop now! Sung Mi, don't get up!

467
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,520
Let's stop now! Let's stop now!

468
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,890
Sung Mi, don't get up!

469
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,650
Sung Mi!

470
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,520
Dr. Yuh.

471
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,380
Dr. Yuh.

472
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,550
What happened to your pretty eyes?

473
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,960
Dr. Yuh. Dr. Yuh!

474
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,330
Are you okay?

475
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,910
Do you really have to do this?

476
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,520
Don't you work out to be healthy?

477
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,880
Why do you need to get hurt and bleed?

478
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,920
Don't you care that I worry?

479
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,490
Pardon?

480
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,750
Forget it.

481
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,490
I shouldn't bother because you don't care about my feelings.

482
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,980
In the ring, people fight over their beliefs.

483
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,120
I want people to understand my beliefs.

484
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,350
How could I understand the person I like volunteering to get hurt? How?

485
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,800
You...

486
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,020
Do you like me?

487
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:51,460
Yes, I like you, Sung Mi.

488
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,790
I've liked you since the very first...

489
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,870
moment I saw you.

490
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,040
I passed out whenever I saw blood in the anatomy lab during college.

491
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,450
Because I pass out whenever I see blood,

492
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,510
I can't even treat you.

493
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,680
If you bleed so much—

494
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,800
I'm sorry.

495
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,840
You're so cute.

496
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,430
I can't help myself.

497
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,030
Look who's talking.

498
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,300
I-I'm sorry. Does it hurt?

499
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,300
I'm okay.

500
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,520
Be careful.

501
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,170
Bring out the sushi.

502
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,270
Here's the sushi you ordered.

503
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,070
Sunbae, did you know...

504
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,900
that couples that kiss a lot share about 80 million germs per kiss?

505
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,880
And if they have a French kiss and touch tongues,

506
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,760
the number will go above a billion, and the matching allogeneic bacteria

507
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,380
will attract the two more.

508
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,380
So. Very. Powerfully.

509
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,330
Kang Hoon, why did you turn the TV off?

510
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,340
Your face got red.

511
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,450
No, It didn't.

512
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:57,900
By chance, is watching the kiss scene spiking your adrenaline, dopamine,

513
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,590
serotonin, the happiness hormone, and endorphins?

514
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,320
Not at all.

515
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,850
Kang Hoon, here's the sushi... Kang—

516
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,930
 She's Noona. She's Noona. 

517
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,670
You'll feel warm once the radiocontrast agent goes into your body.

518
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:28,620
Let me know if you feel nauseous or dizzy.

519
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,390
So Jin.

520
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,510
So Jin?

521
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,240
Yun Woo.

522
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,610
The test will be over while you listen to music.

523
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:50,980
And press this if something bothers you, okay?

524
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:56,110
I'll watch you with the screening doctor in the room. Don't worry.

525
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:03,100
♫  After an exhausting day  ♫

526
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:08,050
♫  Two people under the moon  ♫

527
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,440
 So heartwarming. 

528
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,250
 Is this what it's like to be healed by the healer gene? 

529
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:22,900
 Shim Hospital provides various custom care in 

530
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,160
 gynecology, rheumatology, internal medicine, and surgery. 

531
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,810
 We're a general hospital that provides care throughout your life. 

532
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,890
 Cherry blossom petals fall at the rate of five centimeters per second. 

533
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,680
 Don't they fall so slowly? 

534
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:10,180
 When you're in love, everything moves slowly, apparently. 

535
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,960
 Just like how cherry blossom petals fall. 

536
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,200
Hey, I'm hungry.

537
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,680
I guess I'm relaxed now. Let's go eat something.

538
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,420
Do you talk about eating as soon as you see me?

539
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,840
Did the examination go well?

540
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,500
Yes, I was healed.

541
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,330
You were examined, not healed.

542
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,940
You don't have to know.

543
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,480
So Jin, Kang Hoon.

544
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,450
Hello.

545
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,470
Hello, Mi Eun.

546
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,570
It's funny to see you two here.

547
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,280
Aren't we going? You said you were hungry.

548
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,710
Yes, let's go.

549
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,310
We'll get going now.

550
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,860
Okay. See you later.

551
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:51,380
Oh, right. So Jin, you said you were a DNA researcher, right?

552
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,430
I'd like to be tested sometime.

553
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,210
I've been told I had Ménière's disease. 
  (T/N: disease of the inner ear) 

554
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,670
I heard that's hereditary, too.

555
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,010
Ménière's disease?

556
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,830
Stop by sometime.

557
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,000
Better to get tested before it's too late. 
    

558
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,550
I'll be in touch.

559
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,010
Let's go.

560
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,800
Yun Woo.

561
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,400
You aren't allowed to eat instant food for now.

562
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,700
- No more convenience stores. 
 - Okay.

563
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,250
Make sure to eat something healthy for dinner.

564
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,630
Okay.

565
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,920
We'll get going, then.

566
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,240
- Should we get coffee? 
 - Let's. Got it?

567
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,200
- Noona, we should go, too. 
 - Yes, let's go.

568
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,280
 Make sure to eat something healthy for dinner. 

569
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,050
What are you doing? Are we going in or not?

570
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,710
No, I'm fine. I'm not allowed to eat instant food for now.

571
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,860
He told me I can't come here.

572
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,460
Slippers. 
    

573
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,670
Pack extra clothes.

574
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:27,810
   

575
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,380
Are you working late tonight, too?

576
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,140
 No, I'm out. 

577
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,660
Are you with Mi Eun, by chance?

578
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,600
 Come on. No way. 

579
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,480
 What were you up to, So Jin? 

580
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,540
I'm on my way home.

581
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,220
 Is the surgery preparation going well? 

582
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,810
It's going okay.

583
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,750
 So Jin, do you want to go somewhere with me right now? 

584
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,090
At this hour?

585
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,720
Where are you right now?

586
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,780
 I think I need to see you tonight. 

587
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,350
 I need to give you something, too. 

588
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,620
- Huh? 
  - Hello. 

589
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,130
Why did you want to come here all of a sudden?

590
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,090
You told me...

591
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,530
that everyone needs room to breathe.

592
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,280
So, I'm planning to come here often to heal.

593
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,940
This is a cost-effective healing spot, too, right?

594
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:35,990
Yes. But I thought you needed it right now.

595
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:42,510
Patients often get weak emotionally before surgery.

596
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,740
Things are unpredictable and unstable.

597
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,300
It makes you want to rely on something.

598
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,450
You aren't alone, So Jin.

599
00:42:55,350 --> 00:43:00,130
Before the operation, on the way to the OR,

600
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,570
and in the OR,

601
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,670
I'll be by your side.

602
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,270
- Take this. 
 - What's this?

603
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:20,810
This is cinnamon tea. I got it from a very famous place.

604
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,720
Cinnamon promotes blood circulation and warms your body.

605
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,930
And it's an effective anti-inflammatory food.

606
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:32,200
So, you need to drink every drop of it, okay?

607
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,680
- I will. 
 - And this.

608
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,440
Read it when you're bored in the ward.

609
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,080
And this. You need to keep your stomach warm after surgery.

610
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,830
- Apply them. 
 - Thank you.

611
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,100
And here's a power strip.

612
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,570
It has a long cord. We should talk on the phone all night.

613
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,920
And these. Organic slippers.

614
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,610
They're not just ordinary silicone.

615
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:55,690
Just look at the bear's smile. It's a knowing smile.

616
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,600
Slippers.

617
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,340
We must really have a telepathic connection.

618
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,150
How come everything I need is in here?

619
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,770
You're better than my family, Yun Woo.

620
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:15,220
My family doesn't care if I get surgery or not.

621
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,940
They might look uninterested,

622
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,120
but they must be worrying about you.

623
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,720
Probably not.

624
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:26,360
My family is very unusual.

625
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:33,690
I suppose your family might be different.

626
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:39,340
Now that I think about it, I've never heard you talk about your family.

627
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,900
It's still chilly at night, isn't it?

628
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,900
Shall we go?

629
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,560
Yes.

630
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,130
Don't worry about the surgery so much.

631
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,550
Let's overcome this together.

632
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,740
I'm sorry, but we're closing.

633
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,120
I just need a moment.

634
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,750
I'll have some sake.

635
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,450
Looks like you usually close alone.

636
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,870
Sometimes I close with my father, too.

637
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,800
I see.

638
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,990
You have a job, but you help your father's business, too.

639
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:03,090
You live very diligently, Kang Hoon.

640
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,970
I work as hard as everyone else.

641
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,510
Can I ask you something?

642
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,020
What's Ms. Han So Jin like?

643
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,190
Why do you ask?

644
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:25,300
I got curious.

645
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,340
She's a good person.

646
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,990
Is that all?

647
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,580
What answer do you want to hear?

648
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,080
Just about everything.

649
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,240
Everything about So Jin.

650
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,760
She can often be foolish.

651
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,990
Since she's too affectionate, she gets taken advantage of often,

652
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,030
but she's a kind and tender person.

653
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,540
That's why I want to protect her more.

654
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:11,350
I'm sorry I bothered you while closing.

655
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,530
How much is it?

656
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,680
It's okay. You can go.

657
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,910
Thank you.

658
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:28,590
"Relationships require arms and legs, not just heart.

659
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:32,550
Keeping it to yourself isn't beautiful."

660
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,820
What does that mean?

661
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,570
It means sitting and waiting is useless.

662
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:41,340
It's in Chapter 3 of my book.

663
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,020
Gosh. You said you didn't need my book.

664
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:49,730
Let me know anytime if you need it going forward.

665
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,040
Noona, here's white kimchi and perilla leaves.

666
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,340
Okay.

667
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,650
These are shine muscats and strawberries.

668
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,070
I'll put them in the fruit compartment.

669
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:11,170
Eat them after you release gas after the surgery.

670
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:13,120
Okay, I will.

671
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,020
Shouldn't you get going, though?

672
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,720
I said I'm off-duty.

673
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,020
I'll sleep here tonight.

674
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,750
You have surgery tomorrow. Don't you need an enema?

675
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,130
E-Enema? You don't have to worry about that.

676
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:29,500
When do you have to do it? Where's the medicine?

677
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,010
Why don't you step out for a minute?

678
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,550
Why would I?

679
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,790
- Is this enough? 
 - Right.

680
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,100
Could you do me a favor?

681
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,800
- What is it? 
 - Can you tie my hair?

682
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,070
- What? 
 - You know...

683
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,590
you need to wear it up so it doesn't get flat during surgery.

684
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,980
Your hands are fine. You do it yourself.

685
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,100
I wish I could, but it hurts to lift my arm up because of the IV.

686
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,990
Geez.

687
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:53,700
Go ahead. Tie my hair.

688
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,950
I've never done this before, okay?

689
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,490
- Make it look pretty. 
 - Whatever.

690
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,050
- Where? How? 
 - You know how I sometimes put up half?

691
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:05,110
- Like this? 
 - Yes, put it back. Like a half ponytail.

692
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:08,600
- This is my first time, okay? Like this? 
 - Yes.

693
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,190
Looks good, huh? Right?

694
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,470
So, Kang Hoon was the guardian?

695
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,300
Yun Woo.

696
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,650
Hyung, please make sure the surgery goes well.

697
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,440
Someone recommended me a good caretaker. So, I hired him.

698
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,480
No, it's okay. I can be the caretaker.

699
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,720
You have to go to work.

700
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,440
I told So Ri to cancel her schedule and be here.

701
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,430
We can alternate.

702
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:33,370
- So Ri's coming? 
 - Who's So Ri...

703
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,080
She's my sister.

704
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,240
Sister? She's an actual guardian.

705
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,610
How long will you stay here?

706
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,530
You need to stay until I go to the OR. You have to.

707
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,800
Of course, I will.

708
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,890
She needs to take a walk and take the enema medicine.

709
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:51,470
Hey, leave if you'll keep bringing that up.

710
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,670
I'm your guardian. Stop telling me to leave.

711
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,470
I'll get going, then.

712
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,690
Nice hairdo, Noona.

713
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,360
- Why would you keep bringing that up? 
 - What?

714
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,140
- You can't just say stuff like that. 
 - What...

715
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,750
So embarrassing...

716
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:15,760
The stripes were vivid, too.

717
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,680
Would you like to have a look here, too?

718
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,570
This is our special plant collection.

719
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,510
This one is good at purifying the air and...

720
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:30,890
this one is called a grass tree.

721
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:36,000
It's a special plant that flowers after a fire.

722
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,110
I like this one.

723
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:42,200
Okay. Would you like to take it with you?

724
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,520
I'll give you the home address.

725
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,060
Please deliver it there.

726
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,790
All right.

727
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:53,670
Please write down the address and the day you'd like to receive it...

728
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:58,470
- Thank you so much for today. 
 - Thank you.

729
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,270
We improved a lot today, right?

730
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,710
You really improved a lot.

731
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,350
- Right. 
 - Really?

732
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,990
How could we not improve?

733
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,950
It's thanks to our handsome priest.

734
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:39,260
 Don't do it! Stop! 

735
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,080
 Don't do it! Stop! 

736
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,510
 Stop! 

737
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,080
Stop. Stop!

738
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,500
Please!

739
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,710
Sister Anna. Sister Anna.

740
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,230
Sister Anna, why are you in here?

741
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,360
F-Father.

742
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,660
Why are you here...

743
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,490
I wanted to thank you for the water celery gimbap.

744
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,690
I was looking for you and ended up here.

745
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:02,740
Come out.

746
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,140
I can't.

747
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,140
I can't go out.

748
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:14,030
I'm not supposed to go out.

749
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:18,590
Don't come out, then.

750
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:21,710
I'll join you by your side.

751
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,100
Yes, Sunbae.

752
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,720
There's a fire in the fourth-floor office of the building near Yunghwa Market.

753
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,890
It's about to become a major fire because the buildings are so close together.

754
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,640
You have to come here now.

755
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,680
I'll be right there.

756
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,940
So Ri, you have to come.

757
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,450
You have to come before the surgery and see her, okay?

758
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,690
   

759
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,930
 I'm so sorry, Noona. 

760
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:16,550
 There was an emergency call-out. 

761
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:19,130
 I'll be there when you wake up. Don't worry. 

762
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:21,920
 Be yourself. Be cheerful. 

763
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,450
Ms. Han So Jin.

764
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,300
Yes.

765
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,990
Shall we go?

766
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,510
Do you not have a guardian?

767
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,310
No, I don't have one.

768
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:55,380
   

769
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,930
Ms. Han, please tell me your date of birth.

770
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:15,210
October 5th, 1992.

771
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:19,610
By the way, my surgeon is Dr. Shim Yun Woo.

772
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:23,540
Dr. Shim is helping a pregnant car accident victim deliver right now.

773
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,660
Let me check the situation there. Please wait a moment.

774
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,810
Please check the blood oxygen saturation.

775
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:39,410
She's bleeding a lot internally, and she has placenta previa.

776
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:42,160
It'll take a long time.

777
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,730
If you wait a bit...

778
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:46,000
I can't wait because of my next operation.

779
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,610
Let's call Dr. Shim's operating room and get started immediately.

780
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,370
Bring the consent form.

781
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:56,190
Another doctor can operate when the attending surgeon can't.

782
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:59,820
Ms. Han, you can sign right here.

783
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,340
Initiate anesthesia.

784
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,400
Initiating anesthesia.

785
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,640
 You aren't alone, So Jin. 

786
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:28,390
 Before the operation, on the way to the operating room, 

787
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:31,640
 and in the operating room, 

788
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,820
 I'll be by your side. 

789
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:39,050
 I'm confident. You are, too, right? 

790
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,640
 I'm hearing things now. 

791
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,490
Let's get started.

792
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,500
I took too long, didn't I? I'm sorry.

793
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,870
Yun Woo.

794
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:00,720
We'll put you under. Don't worry.

795
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,490
Where do you want to visit the most?

796
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,790
Where I want to visit?

797
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:14,360
Remember your happiest moment.

798
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:18,840
I don't have such a thing.

799
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:25,390
If so, imagine a precious moment.

800
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,350
I don't have one.

801
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,010
So Jin.

802
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:31,050
Your DNA is like a fate you can't avoid.

803
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:34,680
Everything was predetermined.

804
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,680
 Dad was wrong. 

805
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,150
 Dad wasn't supposed to die. 

806
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:55,670
 Because the happy days were predetermined, too. 

807
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:04,180
You said the surgery went well. Why can't she wake up?

808
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:08,840
Ms. Han, you need to wake up, spit phlegm, and move around.

809
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,890
Your lungs need to expand.

810
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:13,650
I'll make rounds and come back.

811
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,960
Take good care of her. Keep trying to wake her up.

812
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,900
You need to make her sit up if you can.

813
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,390
Well, then.

814
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:27,650
Han So Jin, wake up.

815
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:30,650
Hey!

816
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:38,590
Kang Hoon, I need to go to a photoshoot now.

817
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:43,160
Unni seemed like she was waking up in the recovery room,

818
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,860
but she can't wake up now.

819
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,450
- Okay. 
  - I'll get her a caretaker before I go. 

820
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:50,450
No, I'll be right there.

821
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,290
Why won't her fever go down?

822
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:02,660
Her fever is too high.

823
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:34,660
 My mom refused to put her hand on my forehead when I was sick. 

824
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:37,550
 She said it was because of inframince. 

825
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:40,820
 She said even if she put her hand on me, 

826
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:44,150
 my fever wouldn't go down because of the 

827
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,950
 thin layer between the cold and hot air. 

828
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,600
 But... 

829
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,110
Are you okay?

830
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:14,680
 His cold temperature reached my hot temperature. 

831
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:29,000
 Shim Hospital provides various custom care in 

832
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,130
 gynecology, rheumatology, internal medicine, and surgery. 

833
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:35,720
 We're a general hospital that provides... 

834
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,300
Okay.

835
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:44,250
I feel like it's about to come out...

836
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:05,180
Looks like you're in good condition.

837
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:09,360
I think you could eat. Should we start with porridge?

838
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,230
Your fever went down...

839
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,880
and you released gas, too. It's nice.

840
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,980
What kind of doctor is always with his patient?

841
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:28,980
That's my job. And you're my special patient.

842
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,620
I'm ruined.

843
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:34,490
Why am I always like this in front of the man I like?

844
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:36,090
Come on, I think it's cute.

845
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:40,740
And it means you're recovering quickly. It's a good thing.

846
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,180
Whatever.

847
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:47,790
Do you think I'm that kind of man?

848
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:52,690
A man who stops liking a woman because of that?

849
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:55,980
No, it's not like that, but...

850
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:58,770
But still, this is... I don't know.

851
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,010
You don't know this, do you?

852
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:06,480
I was so nervous because I thought I'd miss your surgery.

853
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:12,130
I ran to you so desperately.

854
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,890
That's why I'm just happy to see you awake like this.

855
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:22,120
So, don't worry about that—

856
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:30,660
 Was I possessed by something then? 

857
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,170
 Or was I not fully awake after the anesthesia? 

858
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,690
 I don't know why, 

859
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:41,220
 but I wanted to do that at that moment. 

860
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,300
 I wanted to follow my heart. 

861
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:47,540
♫  Someday, when I circle around you  ♫

862
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:50,570
♫  Someday, when I circle around you  ♫

863
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:54,850
♫  You hold my hand without a word  ♫

864
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:58,180
♫  You hold my hand without a word  ♫

865
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,840
♫  Leaning on myself is overwhelming  ♫

866
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,560
♫  Leaning on myself is overwhelming  ♫

867
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,940
♫  I find myself falling into your arms  ♫

868
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:14,060
♫  I find myself falling into your arms  ♫

869
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:17,980
♫  My mind  ♫

870
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,810
♫  And my heart  ♫

871
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:25,080
♫  Is completely filled with you  ♫

872
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:31,820
♫  Someday, when I circle around you  ♫

873
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,890
♫  Someday, when I circle around you  ♫

874
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:39,180
♫  You hold my hand without a word  ♫

875
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,280
♫  You hold my hand without a word  ♫

876
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:46,190
♫  Leaning on myself is overwhelming  ♫

877
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:49,790
♫  Leaning on myself is overwhelming  ♫

878
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:54,240
♫  I find myself falling into your arms  ♫

879
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,580
♫  I find myself falling into your arms  ♫

880
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,490
   

881
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:06,730
 When you start liking someone, the timing becomes cruel. 

882
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,920
 - A discharge gift. 
 - Did Yun Woo gift them to you? 

883
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,860
 Yun Woo likes that brand. 

884
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:15,040
 I wonder how it feels to like only one person. 

885
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,450
 Who said I only like one person? 

886
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:19,940
 - Who's she? 
 - I don't know her. 

887
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:24,590
 It can be improved if not reformed. 

888
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:28,360
 Did it go in your eye? Yun Woo is swimming like a child. 

889
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,180
 I'm here to deliver abalone to Yun Woo. 

890
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:33,360
 See you next time. 

891
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,340
 - I'm off, Mi Eun. 
 - Yun Woo. 

892
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:40,060
 If I start liking you now, would it be the worst timing?
