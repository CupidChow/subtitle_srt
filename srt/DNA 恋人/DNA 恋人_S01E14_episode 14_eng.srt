1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,480
   

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,420
   

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,990
   

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,590
   

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,250
   

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,010
   

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,660
   

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,990
   

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:48,810


10
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,690
- Let me do it. 
 - No, Noona.

11
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,600
Where are the shopping bags?

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,880
- They're in the drawer. Hold on. 
 - Let me get it.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,550
Just get me some bags.

14
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,450
Okay.

15
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,110
I thought you could use newspapers, too.

16
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,540
Yes, thank you.

17
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,240
I'm sorry. You gifted me that.

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,750
- What? 
 - This planter.

19
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,160
Didn't you send it?

20
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,890
   

21
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,850
Yes, I did send it,

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,200
but it's not what I ordered. It's something different.

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,510
They must've sent it by mistake.

24
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,530
- Really? 
 - I'll check with them tomorrow.

25
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,260
It's okay.

26
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,600
Just be careful.

27
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,950
- I'll go now. 
 - Okay.

28
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,190
Kang Hoon.

29
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,370
Could you give me a bit more time?

30
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,530
Yes.

31
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,650
Answer me when I'm the only one in your heart,

32
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,930
not Yun Woo.

33
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,110
Okay, I will.

34
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,590
Thank you.

35
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,730
- I'll go now. 
 - Okay, see you.

36
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,690
♫  I fell for you like someone who is bewitched  ♫

37
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,890
♫  Hesitant steps, though I wish for more  ♫

38
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,330
♫  I was so afraid of falling deeper  ♫

39
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,890
♫  Now, even the smallest space without you  ♫ 
 ♫  Feels overwhelming in my everyday life  ♫

40
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:02,520
♫  I abandoned myself, only looking at you  ♫

41
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,200
♫  Baby, will you calm me down?  ♫

42
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,370
   

43
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,140
 I wanted to prove my love with my DNA lover theory. 

44
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,160
 I'm afraid I had my last chance 

45
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,650
 and it makes me worry that I might've missed it. 

46
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,410
♫  I hope things last forever like this  ♫

47
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,760
 I think I made the wrong decision. 

48
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,550
 Could you please give me... 

49
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,880
 one more chance? 

50
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,850
♫  I got lost in your gaze   ♫

51
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,460
♫  that filled my heart  ♫

52
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,720
 Some people prove their love by protecting someone. 

53
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,510
♫  Though I try to come closer, I’m afraid we’ll drift apart  ♫

54
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:07,100
♫  I can’t let go of your hand  ♫

55
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,180
 When the one you love looks at someone else, 

56
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,520
 people often give up. 

57
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,470
 But can giving up be love? 

58
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,980
 I'll wait for you one more time. 

59
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,170
 Go to So Jin and tell her how you really feel now. 

60
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,450
 But if it doesn't work out again, come to me. 

61
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:36,610
 I'll prove my love by not giving up. 

62
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,500
♫  No matter how hard it gets  ♫

63
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,790
♫  Even if it hurts again, it’s only you  ♫

64
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,240
 Love. I've never believed in it my whole life. 

65
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,570
 That's why I didn't even know what it was, but... 

66
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,530
 If love means my five senses waking up, 

67
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,180
 I never loved Kang Hoon as a man. 

68
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,750
 But I finally realized that I was wrong about 

69
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,190
 everything I believed love to be. 

70
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,040
 I have to prove it now. 

71
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:16,170
   

72
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,400
   

73
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,520
   

74
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,000
Why the f*ck do people keep interfering?

75
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,150
You were so lucky today, too. Weren't you?

76
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,450
Mom,

77
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,870
I'll make sure they suffer more.

78
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,610
So, watch closely from where you are.

79
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,060
 I'll make you smile soon. 

80
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,050
   

81
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,660
So, natrium and oil were in the pot?

82
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,370
Yes.

83
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,850
If alkali metal touches water, it explodes.

84
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,910
Sunbae, step back.

85
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,810
Be careful.

86
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,330
The plant explodes and catches fire if

87
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,540
the recipient waters it.

88
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,600
And if this oil...

89
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,710
seeps into that fire...

90
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,870
So, who sent this plant?

91
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,520
I should look for him starting now.

92
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,480
   

93
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,620
   

94
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,780
   

95
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,050
   

96
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,070
Teo's Flower Garden?

97
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,630
   

98
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,950
- Welcome. 
 - Hello.

99
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,710
Are you looking for anything specific?

100
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,360
Well, yes.

101
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,620
Did someone order this plant yesterday?

102
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,160
Do you know grass trees?

103
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,150
Just one moment.

104
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,510
Here.

105
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,880
This is a grass tree.

106
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,400
But no one has bought this plant for the last two weeks.

107
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,920
How many shops sell this plant around here?

108
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,040
I'm not so sure about that.

109
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,090
But I’m sure not many people have them since they're so rare.

110
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,700
It doesn't grow naturally because it's a rare plant native to Australia.

111
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,080
Could you tell me where you source this from?

112
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,170
Well, sure.

113
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,830
It was difficult for us to find this farm.

114
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,300
I see.

115
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,340
- Thank you. 
 - Of course.

116
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,690
   

117
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,020
   

118
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,710
 ­  

119
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,890
What's this?

120
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,760
Open it.

121
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,410
They're fire extinguishers.

122
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,150
I'll teach you how to use them. Carry one with you.

123
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,940
The first minute after a fire starts is crucial.

124
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,730
If you don't extinguish it within that minute, it can turn into a major fire. Remember that.

125
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,800
Hold it, remove the pin, and spray it at the fire.

126
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,860
Easy, right? Here.

127
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,900
But why all of a sudden—

128
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,780
Is it weird to carry a fire extinguisher for self-defense?

129
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,320
No. Your face looks like a weather map right now,

130
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,850
like there's a typhoon and lightning.

131
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,690
What's going on? Go ahead, tell me.

132
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,290
Listen carefully, Han So Jin.

133
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,730
There have been many fire reports at the fire station.

134
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,650
I'm just worried.

135
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,920
You never know. It'd be good to be prepared.

136
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,290
And I can't protect you 24/7.

137
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,980
You're overreacting again.

138
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,120
And here's something important, Noona.

139
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,830
Here.

140
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,360
What's this now?

141
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,750
Let me explain. This is an electric shotgun.

142
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,480
Turn it on and...

143
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,870
That's it. Easy, right? Try it.

144
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,190
Do you want me to try it?

145
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,510
Go ahead and try it.

146
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,700
That's right. Hold it longer. That's right.

147
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,900
I'll explain this to you, too.

148
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,410
This is an expandable baton. You've seen it, right?

149
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,690
You just whip it out like this.

150
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,640
To collapse it...

151
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,210
You do this. Easy, right?

152
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,770
Hey, why are you scaring me like this?

153
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,950
It doesn't hurt to be careful.

154
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,250
Any questions? Should I show you how to use that again? Watch.

155
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,040
No, no, no.

156
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,850
Have you called about the wrong plant being sent to me?

157
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,580
Yes. They just sent it by mistake.

158
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,800
Really? What were you trying to send me originally?

159
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,900
I'll send you that tomorrow. Tomorrow.

160
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,870
 There are tons of invasive plants along the stream, too. 
   

161
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,810
 But don't be shocked. 

162
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,700
 We're not in the jungle. 

163
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,390
Didn't our volunteer work video turn out so well?

164
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,980
Let me see.

165
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,100
 It's a mess. 

166
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,270
Shim Yun Woo wore floral baggy pants?

167
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,820
Looking great.

168
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,120
It was cute.

169
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,210
Why do you keep drinking alone?

170
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,450
It tastes great.

171
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,920
I thought you and Team Leader Han were getting along well in Muari.

172
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,210
Are you having a problem again?

173
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,070
Geez, I have no choice but to get involved.

174
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,610
I think you two make such a great couple—

175
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,670
Eat this.

176
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,490
Assistant Director, I'll take care of you tonight.

177
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,140
You can relax and drink.

178
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,820
Have some snacks, too.

179
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,880
Yes. But I like kiwi.

180
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,540
- Kiwi. 
 - Thank you for your hard work today.

181
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,060
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers!

182
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,200
You usually pace yourself when you drink.

183
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,870
But you're drinking a lot today.

184
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,040
I know.

185
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,620
I'll get going now.

186
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,090
Let me come with you.

187
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,410
- Help him. Help him. 
 - It's okay. It's okay.

188
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,540
He hates people seeing him drunk more than anything.

189
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,550
We've arrived, sir.

190
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,960
Where are we?

191
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,520
We're at the address you gave me earlier.

192
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,010
I asked you to take me here?

193
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,720
Yes.

194
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,880
Let's go to Cheongdam-dong instead.

195
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,700
Excuse me?

196
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,800
Just one moment.

197
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,020
♫  We made promises ♫

198
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,070
We can go now.

199
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:23,200
♫  And the memories we drew together, I still remember them  ♫

200
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,770
♫  Never fade away  ♫

201
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,780
♫  Never fade away  ♫

202
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,860
 Who do you think I am? 

203
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,430
 I'm not like that. Seriously. 

204
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,600
 I said it hurts. 

205
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,850
 Seriously... 

206
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,340
♫  We can be eternal once again  ♫

207
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,340
♫  We can be eternal once again  ♫

208
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,930
♫  You and I  ♫

209
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,630
♫  Like flowers that bloom and wither (Yeah, yeah)  ♫

210
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:03,040
♫  Like the burning sunset that someday fades away  ♫

211
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,580
You're due soon now. Keep taking good care of yourself.

212
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,620
See you next week.

213
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,190
- Thank you. 
 - Take care.

214
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,790
- Thank you. 
 - Come this way.

215
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,490
♫  It's not the end  ♫

216
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:25,890
♫  When our eyes meet we see beyond our memories  ♫

217
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,420
♫  Our pain, our lonely times when we were exhausted and down  ♫

218
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,730
♫  When we were exhausted and down  ♫

219
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,790
♫  We, who were able to overcome it  ♫ 
 ♫  I know that  ♫

220
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,060
 Let's keep holding hands. 

221
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,560
 I just want to. 

222
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,460
 We have no telepathic connection. 

223
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,820
 How did you find me? 

224
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,880
♫  We can be eternal once again  ♫

225
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,870
 Are you okay? 

226
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,940
 But I finally realized that I was wrong about 

227
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,510
 everything I believed love to be. 

228
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:17,820
 That's why I think this might actually be love. 

229
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,350
 So Jin, I— 

230
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,400
 If you really love Noona, letting her go is love, too. 

231
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,630
♫  I want to love you  ♫

232
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,880
   

233
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,080
Jung Tam!

234
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,660
What brings you here without notice?

235
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,460
Should we go get macarons, Sung Mi?

236
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,940
Sounds good.

237
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,020
- Have some. 
 - Okay.

238
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,530
This macaron shop is...

239
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,750
where our telepathic connection first worked.

240
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,230
 Because you didn't come to the gym, 

241
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,480
 I sent a telepathic message as if I were praying. 

242
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,840
 - Doctor! 
 - Sung Mi! 

243
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,670
 And I happened to see you again here. 

244
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,880
Really?

245
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,290
Someone told me if you have a telepathic connection, you're DNA lovers.

246
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,090
- DNA lovers? 
 - Yes.

247
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,830
DNA lovers are meant to be together from birth.

248
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,920
I'm not sure if it's meant to be,

249
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,880
but I don't think I'd ever meet a man

250
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,810
who cares for me as much as you do.

251
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,730
Well, S-Sung Mi.

252
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,960
Yes?

253
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,710
I cannot have children.

254
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,200
Pardon?

255
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,190
Well... I'm sterile.

256
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,220
Ste—

257
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,240
Sterile?

258
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,240
I'm not sure about anything else,

259
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:02,150
but like you said, I can only love you for the rest of my life.

260
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:06,860
So, wouldn't that be enough for us?

261
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,790
There are a lot of DINK couples these days,

262
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:22,730
and many people raise pets as if they were their children—

263
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,970
I think I'd need some time to think, Jung Tam.

264
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,580
W-Well, you'll...

265
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,750
You'll call me when you're done thinking, right?

266
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,320
 That's such a selfish thing to say. 

267
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,920
You broke up, but you keep saying you love her?

268
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,820
That's basically like stalking.

269
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,110
Breakups need to be safe.

270
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,340
You once loved her. Don't give her a hard time.

271
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,000
You should've been better to her when you were together.

272
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,180
Having lingering feelings

273
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:53,130
not only hurts you but also the other person. It's like a form of emotional violence.

274
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:57,020
I hope you invest that time in yourself instead.

275
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,270
I agree. There's no need to beg for love

276
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,650
from someone who no longer feels the same.

277
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,250
 They say, "Leave amid applause." 

278
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,040
 I think this is the moment to face the end. 

279
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,450
 Accepting the end takes courage, too. 

280
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,210
It'd be so easy if I could stop when I want to stop.

281
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,290
 My daughter, did you have a nice trip to Sokcho? 

282
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:35,610
Yes, Mom. Should we have a meal together?

283
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,150
I eat dumpling soup often these days.

284
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,030
I didn't know you liked dumpling soup, too.

285
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:49,200
I don't, but my husband and daughter were crazy about it.

286
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,420
I only drank water next to them.

287
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,400
You mean, Ms. Han So Jin?

288
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,410
Do you know So Jin?

289
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,620
I got to know her because of Yun Woo.

290
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:04,690
I once complained about him to you.

291
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,770
I said there was someone else he was distracted by.

292
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,620
 Do you love him? 

293
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,810
 I know I can't... 

294
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,600
 but I want that man. 

295
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,630
 That's my girl. 

296
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,180
 You decide when to take or leave. 

297
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,900
That woman was So Jin?

298
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,370
So, are they dating?

299
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,650
They broke up now.

300
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,410
Really?

301
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,070
Why did they break up?

302
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,590
They seemed very different.

303
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,500
Yun Woo is very independent.

304
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,970
If any relationship problems arise, he tends to avoid the other person.

305
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,910
But So Jin is dependent on her relationships.

306
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,810
She seems deprived of affection,

307
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,940
making her feel anxious and impatient.

308
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:11,190
He must've been attracted to her because she's unique.

309
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,350
Maybe he thought it meant she was special.

310
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:21,460
Mom, it's probably hard to move on when the other person seems unique, right?

311
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,480
That can't be why he can't move on.

312
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,460
It's because he really likes her.

313
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,180
Is that so?

314
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,790
   

315
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,760
 Yes, Aunt. 

316
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,670
I booked the ticket this morning.

317
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,090
Yes.

318
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,500
There will be another doctor and...

319
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,640
a nurse traveling with me. Don't worry.

320
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,580
Yes.

321
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,320
Okay.

322
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,270
The US?

323
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,170
Yes, well...

324
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,660
it worked out that way.

325
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,960
I thought that'd be good for my mother, too.

326
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,750
Then, you can go there for a year.

327
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:27,400
There's no need to completely leave the hospital, Yun Woo.

328
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:33,520
I'd like you to be in charge of the hospital, Dr. Park.

329
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,560
You've been here since it was first established.

330
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,460
I beg you.

331
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,360
Yun Woo, I just heard from Dr. Park.

332
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,920
What do you mean you're quitting?

333
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,820
Everyone is here. You're making this easier.

334
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:10,660
Dr. Park of the pediatrics department will be the director from now on.

335
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,250
Gosh, Dr. Shim.

336
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,690
Thank you for everything you've done.

337
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,450
So many patients want you to deliver their babies because of Ms. Yoo.

338
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,990
Dr. Park will hire someone better than me.

339
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,520
Do you know which hospital to transfer to?

340
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,250
You said you know someone who has a successful hospital in the US.

341
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,010
Are you joining their hospital?

342
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,900
When are you coming back to Korea?

343
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,460
I'm very excited to submit the resignation letter right now.

344
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,540
I won't be thinking about returning for a while.

345
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,190
Anyway, let's talk more later.

346
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,910
Let's prepare for the afternoon appointments.

347
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,470
Okay, let's go.

348
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,740
Hey,

349
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,830
you could've at least discussed it with me.

350
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,040
You're lovesick right now. I didn't want to bother you.

351
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,840
Who am I supposed to get relationship advice from now?

352
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,340
I know the perfect person.

353
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,250
Her name is Jang Mi Eun. She's a relationship columnist.

354
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,220
I'll introduce her to you before I leave.

355
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,570
Take me with you.

356
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,450
It's so hard to date in Korea when you're a DINK believer like me.

357
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,910
You'd cry every day because you miss Sung Mi.

358
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,700
I'm tearing up again.

359
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,620
What's with you? Don't be like that.

360
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,750
I'm not crying, you cold-hearted bastard.

361
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,970
Did you tell Kang Hoon?

362
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,540
No, not yet. I should now.

363
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,350
   

364
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,500
Hey, Hyung.

365
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,260
 I'm in front of the fire station right now. Can we meet? 

366
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,250
In front of the fire station?

367
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,100
 Mi Eun, do you want to have dinner together tonight if you're free? 

368
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,210
 How about the N Seoul Tower restaurant? 

369
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,140
 That's where we first met. Remember? 

370
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,720
Hyung.

371
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,460
Kang Hoon,

372
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,640
I'm going to the US.

373
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,220
What? The US?

374
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,060
For how long?

375
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,310
I have no plan to return yet.

376
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:53,020
Come to our restaurant later. Let's have a drink.

377
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,580
Thanks for the thought, but I'm a bit busy.

378
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,150
I need to transfer my work duties since I'm leaving suddenly.

379
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,730
Hyung.

380
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,860
Say goodbye to your father for me.

381
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,100
Take care of yourself, too. And...

382
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,860
please...

383
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,790
take good care of So Jin.

384
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,010
Hyung, by chance...

385
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,400
you haven't received a plant, right?

386
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,600
A plant?

387
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,170
There might be a real culprit behind your mother's accident.

388
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,960
- What? 
 - I'll call you when things are confirmed.

389
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,970
 It's always like this. 

390
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,690
Whenever I like someone, they always leave me.

391
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,170
I know.

392
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:45,850
Looks like you have bad luck in relationships.

393
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,940
They say people like that are destined to be single forever.

394
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,560
Take it back. Take it back right now.

395
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,980
I'm just worried.

396
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,140
How's Dr. Yuh Jung Tam? Huh? Huh?

397
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,500
You should give it a try.

398
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,890
What do you mean, Yuh Jung Tam?

399
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,480
You go ahead if you're so interested.

400
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,280
I don't like Dr. Yuh, either.

401
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,450
The US isn't that far.

402
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,660
Just visit him if you want to see him.

403
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,130
You can take a weekend trip there if you sleep a little less.

404
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,460
The times have changed.

405
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,660
R-Right?

406
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,730
Is that right?

407
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,970
Yun Woo.

408
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,110
The traffic was bad, wasn't it?

409
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,040
A little.

410
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,850
Did you wait long?

411
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,710
A little.

412
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,150
It reminds me of that time.

413
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,030
That time?

414
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,580
   

415
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,940
- How many people? 
 - Just one.

416
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,240
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

417
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,970
May I join you?

418
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,770
Go ahead.

419
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,850
I've seen you at the aquarium.

420
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,980
Nice to meet you. I'm Jang Mi Eun.

421
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,180
I'm Shim Yun Woo.

422
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,580
Being here really reminds me of the old days.

423
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,340
By the way, why did you suddenly want to meet me here?

424
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,670
You're acting like something's up.

425
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,200
I'm quitting the hospital...

426
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,460
and leaving Korea.

427
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,780
- What? 
 - I'll stay in the US.

428
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,410
A-All of a sudden? Why?

429
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:33,640
I thought I could use a break.

430
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,350
I've thought a lot about...

431
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,430
what you said last time.

432
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:50,080
I suggested to So Jin that we start over, too.

433
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:54,110
But I got rejected.

434
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,510
She was so determined.

435
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,080
If it wasn't Kang Hoon by her side,

436
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,860
I would've kept trying.

437
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,850
So...

438
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,500
why?

439
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:18,800
I concluded that by giving up, I'm proving my love.

440
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,850
Giving up?

441
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:26,500
If my leaving makes her happy,

442
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,410
then I'll do that for her.

443
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,040
How about you?

444
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,020
Will you be okay?

445
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,110
Let's go together.

446
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,630
- What? 
 - I want to go with you.

447
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,590
- Mi Eun. 
 - I love you.

448
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,450
I'm proving my love by not giving up.

449
00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:00,880
I'll be by your side until you scream and say you're sick of me.

450
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,420
That's what would take for me to give up on you.

451
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,810
You changed my views on relationships

452
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,310
and even my whole life.

453
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,720
You won't give me a chance?

454
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,920
- No. 
 - Why not?

455
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,620
I never want to see someone hurting because of me again.

456
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,580
I...

457
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,970
I'm hurting now, too.

458
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:37,140
I'd like to keep you in my life, Mi Eun.

459
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,870
You're the only person who

460
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,200
truly understands me and is a good friend.

461
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,410
I find that very hurtful.

462
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,750
I finally told him.

463
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,380
Mi Eun!

464
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,290
Take this with you.

465
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,350
Kang Hoon.

466
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,350
Why do you always show up out of nowhere? Why?

467
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,500
Did you know you and I share the same route back home?

468
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,140
- Is something wrong? 
 - I'm fine.

469
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,830
Just go on your way.

470
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,980
Let me walk you home.

471
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,320
Do as you'd like.

472
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,130
You're alcohol-dependent.

473
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,060
You'll get addicted at this rate.

474
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,940
Do you know how many times I've seen you drunk?

475
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:30,100
If I told you how much alcohol has influenced the advancement of art and science,

476
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,120
you'd be totally shocked, Kang Hoon.

477
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,600
It stopped raining.

478
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,020
What? It did.

479
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,160
Would you like another drink?

480
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,460
Huh? Totally.

481
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,270
See? You're just an alcoholic.

482
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,570
Art and science, my foot.

483
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,500
What? Are you making fun of me?

484
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,420
Gosh, I can't tell if you're drunk or faking it.

485
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,200
Noona.

486
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,920
Noona, it's me, Kang Hoon.

487
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,750
Are you okay?

488
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,970
You dummy.

489
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,150
You aren't just supposed to hold the baton like this.

490
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,820
Watch this.

491
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,460
You're walking down the street.

492
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,360
And suddenly, you feel someone reaching out.

493
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,960
Then, you expand the baton like this.

494
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,660
Let's say someone's actually here.

495
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,250
Then, say, "You bastard." No.

496
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,000
This is you.

497
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,330
"You bastard. This can break your bone.

498
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,020
Get lost unless you want to die!"

499
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,790
Tell him that, okay?

500
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,380
If he still won't go away,

501
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,990
just go ahead and...

502
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,990
Okay?

503
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,850
Okay.

504
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,410
You really scared me.

505
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,650
I'm sorry. Here.

506
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,820
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

507
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,720
What did I tell you to do?

508
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,770
That's right. And?

509
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,580
That's right. You can poke, too.

510
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,360
 Poke! 

511
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,160
 That's right. 

512
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,420
Not me. Over here.

513
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,350
Interesting.

514
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,630
   

515
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,100
   

516
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,840
 Kang Hoon, 

517
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,350
 I'm going to the US. 

518
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,260
Kang Hoon.

519
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,990
Seo Kang Hoon.

520
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,100
What?

521
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,700
Do you know how many times I called you?

522
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,600
What are you thinking so intently about?

523
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,110
Are you worried about something?

524
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,000
No.

525
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,370
Let me get you more side dishes.

526
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,060
How strange.

527
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,580
   

528
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,180
Dr. Shim.

529
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,540
This is your last time making rounds.

530
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,850
It's not like it's the end of the world.

531
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:09,260
I'll go make my last rounds.

532
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,150
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

533
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,690
Was that from 2012?

534
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,010
 It's Psalm 78. 

535
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,360
"They would not be like their ancestors—

536
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,920
a stubborn and rebellious generation,

537
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,170
whose hearts were not loyal to God,

538
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:35,940
 whose spirits were not faithful to him." 

539
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,360
Is that the priest?

540
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,210
Is that Father Andrea?

541
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,940
He came by a few days ago to check Lucky's adoption progress.

542
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,010
How could he be so kind?

543
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,130
He's handsome, too.

544
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,060
"The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows,

545
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,820
turned back on the day of battle."

546
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,720
   

547
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,170
BK, do you need to tell me something?

548
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,290
I know Yun Woo well.

549
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:46,040
He won't come back to Korea for about 20 years.

550
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,620
Pardon?

551
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,030
What are you talking about out of the blue?

552
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,750
Shouldn't you still...

553
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,650
say goodbye properly?

554
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,670
Say goodbye?

555
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,710
 Yun Woo is going to the US. 

556
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,910
 I guess he's planning to stay there for a while. 

557
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,680
   

558
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,680
Yes.

559
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,990
Hyung.

560
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:47,060
Hey, what brings you here at this hour?

561
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,950
I stopped by while I was in the area.

562
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,440
Would you like something to drink?

563
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,990
I'm okay.

564
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,870
- Looks like you were packing. 
 - Yes.

565
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,080
It's finally kicking in.

566
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,980
Have a seat.

567
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:14,620
I don't think you just stopped by.

568
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,840
Do you need to say something?

569
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,800
What is it?

570
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:30,090
I wasn't sure if I should tell you this when you're about to leave.

571
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,050
But I thought I should tell you.

572
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,130
By chance,

573
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,420
does it have to do with So Jin?

574
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,370
She's involved, too.

575
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:46,010
To be honest, a plant was delivered to her place recently.

576
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:49,320
It had an inflammable substance in it.

577
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,230
What?

578
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,100
Fortunately, I caught it early,

579
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,190
but something terrible could have happened to her.

580
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,570
Who sent her that plant?

581
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,300
I'm looking into it, too. But I haven't found out.

582
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,710
They even sent it to her under my name.

583
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,910
What's worse is that this isn't the first time this happened.

584
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,160
Maybe...

585
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,320
your parents and Noona are involved in the same situation.

586
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,090
What do you mean by that?

587
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,660
If I'm right,

588
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,330
it's someone very methodical and thorough.

589
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:26,330
I don't know why he would do this unless he holds some kind of resentment.

590
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:29,880
Do you have some kind of hunch?

591
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,960
Yes.

592
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,850
Dr. Shim, someone sent you a plant.

593
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,690
Excuse me.

594
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,550
Who sent this plant?

595
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,430
A delivery person dropped it off and left already.

596
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,120
Yes.

597
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,020
I can say goodbye for the last time.

598
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,510
Yes, Director. Are you at the orphanage right now?

599
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,440
Would it be okay if I visited you in an hour?

600
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,630
Okay, got it. Bye.

601
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,150
No, Han So Jin.

602
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,310
We broke up a long time ago.

603
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,210
I'm being too nosy.

604
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,240
I'd better stop.

605
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,830
- Oh, Jung Tam. 
 - Hi.

606
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,730
It's been a while.

607
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,700
Are you here to see Yun Woo?

608
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,080
I think he just left.

609
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,300
Really?

610
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,620
Okay, then.

611
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,300
Excuse me, So Jin.

612
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,860
It might not be my place to say this,

613
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:11,380
but I've known Yun Woo for quite a long time.

614
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,350
I've seen him in countless relationships.

615
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:18,110
But he's never done this before.

616
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,370
What do you mean?

617
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,500
Suddenly leaving like this, for example.

618
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:31,580
You must've been that much special to him.

619
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,570
He tries so hard to appear cool,

620
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,850
but it must've been difficult for him...

621
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,940
since he's doing something he's never done before.

622
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:50,100
I should get going. See you.

623
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,050
Oh, right, So Jin,

624
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:58,630
you can't tell Yun Woo that I told you this.

625
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,540
 So dirty and gross! 

626
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,060
 - How dare you talk to me like that? 
 - I'll go see him right now. 

627
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,570
 I'll tell him to get out of our lives! 

628
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,270
 What? No, Yi Myung. 

629
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,570
 - Let go! 
 - Stop! 

630
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,720
 Let go! 

631
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,130
 Could you tell me where you source this from? 
   

632
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,180
 It was difficult for us to find this farm. 
   

633
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:43,210
   

634
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,860
Grass tree.

635
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,920
   

636
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,210
He is...

637
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,140
Andrea.

638
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,750
   

639
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,020
   

640
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,660
Han So Jin.

641
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,960
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

642
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,200
Why won't she answer?

643
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,360
I didn't expect you to visit out of the blue.

644
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,080
I'm sorry for showing up so suddenly.

645
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,380
I don't have much time.

646
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:26,150
Could you tell me when Father Andrea started frequenting Shim Hospital?

647
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,810
He seems to visit often lately.

648
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,890
Andrea does?

649
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:32,340
I'm not sure.

650
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:37,270
I haven't seen him doing anything other than leading funeral masses.

651
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:43,350
Here's Andrea's admission record you requested.

652
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,330
Thank you.

653
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,410
These two are...

654
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,830
That boy...

655
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,590
He's Andrea's twin brother.

656
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,320
 We met 20 years ago. 

657
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,850
 Do you remember, by chance? 

658
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,080
 I'm a priest. 

659
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:22,360
 I completely moved on from my past the day I became a priest. 

660
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:25,700
 Is that the priest? 

661
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:29,120
 He came by a few days ago to check Lucky's adoption progress. 

662
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,700
 Lucky got adopted by a nice couple. 

663
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,290
 Lucky? 

664
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:38,120
 He's Andrea's twin brother. 

665
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,610
 I thought he'd be fine since he got adopted as soon as he came to the orphanage. 

666
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:45,700
But he started a fire when they canceled the adoption.

667
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:50,030
He committed a series of arson since then, too.

668
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,790
Arson?

669
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,600
Where's he right now?

670
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,030
Andrea's younger brother.

671
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,050
- Father! 
 - You came.

672
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,080
What? What's wrong?

673
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:44,480
Father,

674
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,890
what's this plant?

675
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:49,070
A customer gave it to me as a gift.

676
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,330
When?

677
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,140
Just now.

678
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,930
Excuse me!

679
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,530
 Haeoreum Church. 

680
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:58,000
 "...just as the Father knows me 

681
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,380
and I know the Father—

682
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:06,730
and I lay down my life for the sheep.

683
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:12,690
I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen.

684
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:17,050
I must bring them also.

685
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:22,320
They too will listen to my voice,

686
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,580
and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.

687
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:28,290
 Father Andrea. Seven o'clock mass? 

688
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:37,380
 I ran into him past seven in front of the restaurant. 

689
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,670
No one takes it from me...

690
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:41,170
 He started the mass at seven? 

691
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:44,510
but I lay it down of my own accord.

692
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:47,140
- Excuse me. 
 - Many of them said...

693
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:51,000
I came here late. Did the mass start on time tonight?

694
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,690
No, it started a few minutes ago because Father had a personal reason.

695
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,830
I see. Thank you.

696
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:03,630
No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.

697
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:09,330
I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again.

698
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:15,740
This command I received from my Father."

699
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,080
Who are you, exactly?

700
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,260
What's this about?

701
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,280
Kang Hoon, what brings you here?

702
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,980
Stop acting and answer my question.

703
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,260
I asked you who you are.

704
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,670
What are you plotting, exactly?

705
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:52,540
What are you talking about?

706
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:58,920
Why did you come to my restaurant and leave a grass tree?

707
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,720
Why? To hurt my father?

708
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,020
- Or me? 
 - Kang Hoon!

709
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,800
What's the problem?

710
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:15,120
In the greenhouse, where the grass trees from the fire scenes were found,

711
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,800
they discovered this man's Bible.

712
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,990
Inside, there were photos of the people he had killed,

713
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:25,560
along with photos of those he plans to kill.

714
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,620
I'm not sure what's happening,

715
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,560
but please calm down, Kang Hoon.

716
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,730
I think you're mistaken about something.

717
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:38,840
Father stayed with me all day today,

718
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,980
and he had to start the mass late because he wasn't feeling well.

719
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,760
But regardless of all that,

720
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,880
why would he have done that?

721
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,700
He should be answering that question, not me.

722
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,400
What are you trying to do?

723
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,190
Why are you lurking around us and killing people?

724
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:08,530
Why are the lights off?

725
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,930
What?

726
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,890
Someone broke them.

727
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,770
 Mom, 

728
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,790
 I'll make sure they suffer more. 

729
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:45,300
 So, watch closely from where you are. 

730
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,800
 I'll make you smile soon. 

731
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:51,130
Father, are you okay? What's wrong?

732
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:52,690
We need to stop him.

733
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,890
If we don't stop him quickly,

734
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:59,250
there will be a fire, and someone will die again.

735
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,080
   

736
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:23,320
 I'm not a thief. 

737
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,920
 But you are. 

738
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,810
 You stole my happiness. 

739
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:31,090
 I'll take every single thing from you, too. 

740
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,060
 Han So Jin. 

741
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:39,820


742
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:46,100
♫  Oh, baby, tell me now, say that nothing will change  ♫

743
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:52,790
♫  I can't escape, hold me tight  ♫

744
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:59,200
♫  I was wandering alone, but you came to me like a dream  ♫

745
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:05,730
♫  I just want to rest in your embrace  ♫

746
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:08,970
♫  I fell for you like someone who is bewitched  ♫

747
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:12,180
♫  Hesitant steps, though I wish for more  ♫

748
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:17,640
♫  I was so afraid of falling deeper  ♫

749
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:21,950
   

750
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,550
 Come alone if you want to save this woman. 

751
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:28,960
 Come to the place where you and I first met. 

752
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,220
 Where we first met. 

753
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,700
 He has a twin? 

754
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,650
 Who's the one I saw, then? 

755
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:38,370
 Report them to the police first. 

756
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:42,980
 So Jin... She's in danger. 

757
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:45,130
 There's no time. 

758
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:47,760
 The fire will start soon. 

759
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,980
 So Jin! 

760
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:54,530
 I'll bring you back to where you belong. 

761
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:56,910
 First, let's make it out alive. 

762
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:01,060
♫  Oh, baby, tell me now  ♫
