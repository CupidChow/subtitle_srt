1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,530
   

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,050
   

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,910
   

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,990
   

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,180
   

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:35,000
   

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,530
   

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,970
   

9
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,610
 Was it because of her last facial expression? 

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,070
 The noise on the familiar road felt unfamiliar. 

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,950
 The atmosphere of that day. 

12
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,910
 The air of that day. 

13
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,640
 And that opportunity. 

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,310


15
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,300
 Why did I go that way that day? 

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,350
Han So Jin!

17
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,980
- No! Please spare me! 
 - So Jin, it's me.

18
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,070
This is Shim Yun Woo.

19
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,160
So Jin, are you okay?

20
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,520
 Was it because it's been pouring rain? 

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,850
 The familiar accidents and dispatches felt unfamiliar that day. 

22
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,250
 A car flipped on the Seonan Intersection. 

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,740
What?

24
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,350
Something bothers me.

25
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,130
You bastard.

26
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,930
 I shouldn't have left that spot. 

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,010
 Because a dangerous event was starting right there. 

28
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,310
 Huh? 

29
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,190
 This is... 

30
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,540
Gosh, my nose!

31
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,090
Yun Woo! Are you okay? Are you bleeding?

32
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,870
You aren't. You aren't.

33
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,850
What if your nose is broken?

34
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,310
I've cracked a walnut shell with my forehead once.

35
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,320
Walnut shell?

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,150
Walnut shell?

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,970
By the way, what kind of test were you going to do on me just now?

38
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,630
You said you were curious. This is how you get to know each other.

39
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,480
Is this how you get to know someone else, Yun Woo?

40
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,040
So? What did you find out about me?

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,540
Your head is too hard.

42
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,230
I'm sorry. Oh, no...

43
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,800
Are you okay? Let me see.

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,130
It's so red.

45
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,190
Thank you.

46
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,910
Don't worry. He won't be able to harass you again.

47
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,960
- Let's go. I'll drop you off. 
 - I'll drop her off.

48
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,110
No, wait at our restaurant. Let's have a drink.

49
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,070
Okay.

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,420
- Well, then... 
 - See you tomorrow.

51
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,850
Let's go.

52
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,180
Oh Sang Min, that bastard...

53
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,230
Can't believe he did this because I caught him cheating.

54
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,780
By the way, why do you look so upset?

55
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,310
I told you to choose the right man.

56
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,460
Don't fall for anyone just because they treat you nicely.

57
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,110
What's with you?

58
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,860
- By chance— 
 - Don't be out late for a while.

59
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,100
And don't take that path. Another pervert might show up.

60
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,390
Okay.

61
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,970
- Go inside now. 
 - I'm going. I'm going.

62
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,010
 This is how you experiment. 

63
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,700
It turns out he's a total player.

64
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,210
The promiscuous Octo-gene is dominating the healer gene.

65
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,840
You're acting more serious than usual tonight.

66
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,970
Oh, right. How did you get to know So Jin?

67
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,380
She's someone I want to protect.

68
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,910
Protect? Who?

69
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,610
You mean, So Jin?

70
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,490
She's a woman who threw herself to save my patient.

71
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,870
She's not a woman. She's a person.

72
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,030
Anyway...

73
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,740
I'm curious about Han So Jin.

74
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,290
So? Will you make her cry like other women?

75
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,250
- Hyung. 
 - Yes?

76
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,770
Is it okay to kiss someone if you're interested?

77
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,690
Well...

78
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,150
Do you think So Jin is strong because she saves others?

79
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,620
Someone who wipes others' tears isn't strong.

80
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,150
She's doing that, so she forgets about her own tears.

81
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,750
So?

82
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,190
The first time I saw her, she was crying.

83
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,060
She's not allowed to get hurt ever.

84
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,000
I see babies cry for the first time in the delivery room, too.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
- I'm serious right now. 
 - Okay.

86
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,040
   

87
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,160
Stop being interested in So Jin.

88
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,200
- Why? 
 - Why are you interested?

89
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,500
I don't know. I'm curious what kind of person she is.

90
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,300
You've had many women like that so far.

91
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,670
Hold on.

92
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,590
You like So Jin, don't you?

93
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,680
What are you saying?

94
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
You've never thought of her as a woman?

95
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,480
So Jin is like my family.

96
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,940
It's none of your business, then.

97
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,300
The family can't get involved in a relationship.

98
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,100
Was it the wrong question?

99
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,520
I should've asked him if he doesn't like her.

100
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,940
   

101
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:17,340
   

102
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,670
One, two! Weave! Weave! Nice one.

103
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,290
One, two! Weave!

104
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,020
Are you okay?

105
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,150
Why were you distracted instead of focusing?

106
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,450
You hit me on purpose, didn't you?

107
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,040
I had a reason. If you get distracted, you'll get punched.

108
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,110
- Okay. 
 - Well, by the way,

109
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,690
looks like Sung Mi won't be here today.

110
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,560
Maybe she had a night duty?

111
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,750
If it was a night duty, she must be tired. She needs to rest.

112
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,180
Gosh, you're disappointed because Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist isn't here.

113
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,580
No, no.

114
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,860
One, two! Weave!

115
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,270
Look at my baby skin.

116
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,010
I put a lot of care into it.

117
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,490
I didn't even get to see her.

118
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,960
Gosh, my blood sugar level is too low.

119
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,810
Macarons are the way to go.

120
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,860
- Doctor! 
 - Sung Mi!

121
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,050
Are you coming from the gym?

122
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,850
Well, yes.

123
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,020
Looks like you came for macarons.

124
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,500
Do you like macarons?

125
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,120
They're my favorite.

126
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,420
No, I don't usually eat them.

127
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,950
But I was on night duty.

128
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,200
I was craving sweets, so I stopped by on the way home.

129
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,560
That's what I'm doing, too.

130
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,220
I see. I'll see you at the gym, then.

131
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,640
- S-See you. 
 - Bye.

132
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,280
I got to see her after all.

133
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,100
She's cool.

134
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,920
 This is how you experiment. 

135
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,790
 This is how you experiment. 

136
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,450
Ah Ri!

137
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,470
What did you say?

138
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,460
Did you kiss before you started dating?

139
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,980
We didn't kiss. We almost did.

140
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,600
You're saying you almost...

141
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,810
kissed?

142
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,260
Wow! It might not just be your preference, but fate.

143
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,910
If it's repeated in life, it has to be fate.

144
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,950
I suppose I'll find out eventually.

145
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,450
Ah Ri.

146
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,920
Has anyone come running when you were in danger?

147
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,700
As if they received the SOS signal.

148
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,470
SOS signal?

149
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,590
No. Not even once.

150
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,740
Hoping for something like that would be fantastical.

151
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,680
Something similar has happened.

152
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,890
According to Carl Jung, there's synchronicity that overcomes time and space.

153
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,900
He said you feel and see the same thing, even if

154
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,410
you’re in a different space and time or something like that.

155
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,750
Carl Jung must've started with a hypothesis, too.

156
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,090
Just like my hypothesis about telepathic genes.

157
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,920
I'll prove my hypothesis, too.

158
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,320
Prove what? Telepathy?

159
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,450
Go ahead, then.

160
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,650
I took a half day off today. Well, then...

161
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,320
Where are you going?

162
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,610
I have a personal life, too.

163
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,990
Personal life?

164
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,630
Ah Ri does?

165
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,050
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

166
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,310
- Have some macarons. 
 - Oh.

167
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,710
- What are they? 
 - Macarons.

168
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,470
Hello.

169
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,570
- Would you like some macarons? 
 - Yes.

170
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,240
What's this now? Why are you so amped up?

171
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,610
Me?

172
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,220
While I was leaving the gym today,

173
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,620
I happened to crave macarons.

174
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:44,290
I noticed this one bakery and went there as if I was possessed.

175
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,750
And I ran into her there.

176
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,110
As if it was fate.

177
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,180
Fate?

178
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,140
Fate, my foot.

179
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,570
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

180
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,890
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

181
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,280
There.

182
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,100
Shouldn't you go home exhausted after a night duty?

183
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,230
- But... 
  - I don't usually eat them. 

184
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,860
 But I was on night duty. 

185
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,790
 I was craving sweets, so I stopped by on the way home. 

186
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,890
She apparently craved macarons today, even though she doesn't usually eat them.

187
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,610
I've been running into the same woman in front of the café near the hospital for three years.

188
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,340
Is it my fate to be with her, too?

189
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,600
- Really? 
 - You can't avoid them if your routine and routes overlap.

190
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,320
So don't add unnecessary meanings.

191
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,640
You'll lose her at that rate.

192
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,110
Please. I'll go now.

193
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,360
- Yes, Doc. 
 - Please.

194
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,150
What do you mean by fate?

195
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,700
Cheeky bastard...

196
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,930
Hey, hey!

197
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,810
 Are you looking for a perfect match for you? 

198
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,490
 Or are you just looking for someone who'd adjust themselves for you? 

199
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,000
 I recommend this to someone who wants to be true to themselves and date freely. 

200
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,430
 It tells you how to be yourself in love. 

201
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,530
 I hope you look forward to it. 

202
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:58,270
 And it's light because it's pocket-sized. 

203
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,800
 I'll see you in the next live stream. 

204
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,450
 Bye! 

205
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,360
   

206
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,000
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

207
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,350
This is what it means for an author to be absorbed into the book.

208
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,660
We're hoping for a million-seller, Ms. Jang.

209
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,530
There aren't as many relationship-obsessed people as you think.

210
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,730
I'll see you at the book signing.

211
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,120
You're so cool, Ms. Jang.

212
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,440
Have you read the book, Deputy?

213
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,520
To be honest, isn't she bragging about having many lovers?

214
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,550
What a nice world we live in.

215
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,410
Polyamory, my foot. She's just cheating.

216
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,650
You're right. Loving many people at once?

217
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,130
That makes no sense.

218
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,620
I think she's experimenting to see how many she can date.

219
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:00,780
I'm sorry, but I don't experiment with my life.

220
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,200
Welcome. 
    

221
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,960
Teacher, help him.

222
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,820
Enjoy.

223
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,730
Enjoy.

224
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,420
You're a good cook, Anna.

225
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,850
Yes.

226
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,790
Well, I like to eat.

227
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,380
Isn't it too bland, by chance?

228
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,250
That's what I liked about it.

229
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,000
The sauce was sweet and mild.

230
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,960
Whenever I was having meat as a kid, I starved the day before.

231
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,500
But I couldn't eat much because it was too salty.

232
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,470
Your mother must've liked salty food.

233
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,310
I grew up in an orphanage.

234
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,180
My father passed away early on.

235
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,500
And my mother died in a fire.

236
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,500
This pork galbi was the special dish at my orphanage.

237
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,960
The kids ate too much and got upset stomachs on special meal days.

238
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,750
That's why they overseasoned it.

239
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,530
Your mother passed away in a fire?

240
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,750
When?

241
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,180
When I was 14.

242
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,000
She loved growing flowers.

243
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,520
But there was a fire in the greenhouse.

244
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,380
All done, right?

245
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,510
Yes, yes.

246
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,070
Let's put it in here.

247
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,910
Thank you.

248
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,700
She wanted to experiment with me. Why isn't she contacting me?

249
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,810
I need to stop by Irowoon to do tests on a patient with pregnancy diabetes.

250
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,980
I'd be late for my botox checkup today.

251
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,060
Is the diabetic patient Ms. Go Sung Hui?

252
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,070
I scheduled her appointment.

253
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,800
I'll go to Irowoon instead.

254
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,380
Why are you pretending to be nice?

255
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,970
It's okay. She's my patient.

256
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,390
No, Hyung. Go to your Botox appointment.

257
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,940
You have melasma on the left cheek. You need to treat it now.

258
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,630
I'll be right back.

259
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,700
Fighting!

260
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,760
Why does he keep trying to go to Irowoon?

261
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,000
She was looking for you, Team Leader.

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,540
Isn't she so pretty? This is Yuk Jin Hui, a weatherwoman.

263
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,810
Are you Ms. Han So Jin?

264
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,800
Yes, I'm Han So Jin.

265
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,220
Do you think I have sexual dysfunction?

266
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,850
My ovary will die before I turn 40? What does that mean?

267
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,940
And what did you say?

268
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,010
I have a low chance of pregnancy?

269
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,750
Ask everyone who watches my weather forecast.

270
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,010
I was born superior.

271
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,320
Why would the genetics test say nonsense like this?

272
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,710
Having a low chance of pregnancy...

273
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,480
has to do with one's ovary conditions.

274
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,590
That's not the problem right now.

275
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,950
You know Pharaoh Group, right?

276
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,480
I'm about to become the chairman's daughter-in-law.

277
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,820
Would he still let me marry his son after this?

278
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,740
Ms. Yuk, please calm down and talk to me instead.

279
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,750
- Forget it. 
 - Okay, then.

280
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,520
Hey, bring me a test result that makes logical sense.

281
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,460
I'll run another test if you suspect an error.

282
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,420
But the test result can't be changed to your liking.

283
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,880
Hey! Do you know how much effort I put into this marriage?

284
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,660
How will you compensate me for my marriage and life?

285
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,220
Answer me right now!

286
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,350
Gosh.

287
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,060
- Hyung, do you still have hemophobia? 
 - What?

288
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,430
- Do you still have it? 
 - Yes.

289
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,540
- I apologize in advance. Sorry. 
 - About what?

290
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,530
It hurt! Blood...

291
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,330
Hyung, are you okay?

292
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,110
Please help! He's bleeding!

293
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,570
Hurry! Hurry, he's bleeding!

294
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,060
Excuse me.

295
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,390
I'd like to talk to you for a second.

296
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,330
Team Leader Han, go.

297
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,380
How's your cheek?

298
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,250
Why did he have to show up now?

299
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,230
Get in. You look tired.

300
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,980
No, I'm okay.

301
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,350
She's cute. Attractive, too.

302
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,880
What did you say? What did you say just now?

303
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,950
I didn't say anything.

304
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,590
I know a place to remove bruises in two hours. Do you want to go?

305
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,010
Welcome!

306
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,490
Welcome.

307
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,880
- It's two people. 
 - Two people?

308
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,730
Dong, take them to a room.

309
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,600
Two people. Come this way.

310
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,910
Get them a good one.

311
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,340
Please come this way.

312
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,120
Relieve stress and get rid of the bruise on your heart.

313
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,920
I don't want to be with you even for a second in this state.

314
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,260
I won't look. Just sing.

315
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,030
You go first.

316
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,690
I'm tone-deaf.

317
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,920
You won't regret this?

318
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,740
No. I like to listen.

319
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,590
Okay.

320
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:31,180

What are you thinking, exactly?

360
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,800
What do you mean?

361
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,870
You're suddenly acting like someone else.

362
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,640
You're kind to me.

363
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,320
You're making my heart flutter.

364
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,460
Was I kind? Did I make your heart flutter?

365
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,200
Well, it's just that...

366
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,370
Let's keep going.

367
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,860
Let's try doing that experiment.

368
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,270
Really?

369
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,240
Can we really do it?

370
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,050
 This is how you experiment. 

371
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,720
By the way, why all of a sudden?

372
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,200
I just suddenly became interested.

373
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,800
Why? You don't want to? Should we not?

374
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,570
- Let's not do it, then. 
 - No, no, no.

375
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,930
I'll really do it, then.

376
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,170
Okay.

377
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,200
Sunbae!

378
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,110
Huh? Ah Ri!

379
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,790
The sewer Octo-gene?

380
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,440
 Did you kiss before you started dating? 

381
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,000
 We almost did. 

382
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,660
Who's that...

383
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,530
What do I do?

384
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,280
What? What happened?

385
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Well, this is...

386
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,690
By chance,

387
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,340
the sewer Octo-gene...

388
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,070
- No, no, no. 
 - No, no, no.

389
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,360
It's not like that. Ah Ri! Where have you been today?

390
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,410
Oh... I was volunteering for the church.

391
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,430
I'm hungry. Should we get sushi before we go home?

392
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,670
Yun Woo, do you want to join us?

393
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,090
Let's go.

394
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,890
Enjoy.

395
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,730
Yes.

396
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,730
Enjoy your meal, Yun Woo.

397
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,470
You too.

398
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,950
So? You didn't take your medicine? Really?

399
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:54,810
I'm saying I only took three tablets out of seven, Sunbae.

400
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,290
And that's because of the priest?

401
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:05,460
For some reason, I feel relaxed whenever I'm with him.

402
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,440
Isn't this a miracle?

403
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,700
You used to live under the desk and in the lab.

404
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,370
But now you volunteer?

405
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:18,630
So? What's the priest like?

406
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,750
His father passed away when he was a child

407
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,750
and his mother passed away in a fire.

408
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,660
That's why he grew up in an orphanage.

409
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:41,410
The priest's mother liked to grow flowers in the greenhouse.

410
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,410
He must resemble his mother.

411
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,830
I smell flowers when I'm close to him.

412
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,480
 Yun Woo, I believe you'll understand me. 

413
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,230
 I want to live with the woman I love. 

414
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,150
 It's a grass tree. 

415
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,430
 It doesn't have flowers yet. 

416
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,730
 It only flowers after a fire. 

417
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,480
 Isn't it fascinating? 

418
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,740
   

419
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,890
 M-Mom! 

420
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:13,820
- Welcome. 
 - Hello.

421
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,070
I'll have an Americano.

422
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,640
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

423
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,600
Do you really run into someone if the routines and routes overlap?

424
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,060
No! Sung Mi and I are meant to be.

425
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,040
I'll have one more Americano.

426
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,500
Okay.

427
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,770
Sung Mi...

428
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,900
Geez!

429
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,720
How dare he check me out like that? Geez.

430
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,320
 Take care, then. 

431
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,510
- Thank you. 
 - Of course.

432
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,800
What should we have for lunch? There's a new eel restaurant nearby.

433
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,330
I'm sorry. I made plans today.

434
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,070
Who is it? Let me join if it's someone I know.

435
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:05,330
But you love eating alone so much.

436
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,120
Hold on.

437
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,380
You disappeared at the DNA center yesterday, too.

438
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,580
Don't try to fool me.

439
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,400
- You two met, right? 
 - We did meet.

440
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,390
What did you do together, then?

441
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,000
We went singing.

442
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,170
- What? 
 - We sang.

443
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,060
You sang? You?

444
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,770
Yes, I'm pretty good.

445
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,930
I can rap and dance, too.

446
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:36,390
♪  I met you out of many people as countless as stars  ♪

447
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,100
Thank you.

448
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,250
Should I get you flowers to add to the bunch?

449
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,180
No. These flowers will dominate other flowers.

450
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,310
What kind of woman did you pick this time?

451
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,470
I didn't pick her.

452
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,160
She picked me.

453
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,060
Geez, you scared me.

454
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,760
I'm sorry.

455
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,380
Isn't your immune system getting weak because you aren't dating?

456
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,670
I have a pollen allergy.

457
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:31,060
You're having an allergic reaction here?

458
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,040
Geez.

459
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,470
What's wrong with me?

460
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,370
You must've been upset because of Ms. Yuk yesterday.

461
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,090
I can't sleep for three days whenever stuff like that happens.

462
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,440
I would've been sick in bed for a month usually,

463
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,150
but I feel fine because someone showed up yesterday.

464
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,660
Who?

465
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:00,790
He's like a healer who doesn't let me have sad thoughts, maybe?

466
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,440
Healer?

467
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,460
It's a man.

468
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,350
I'll go home early today.

469
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,890
I have a lecture at my alma mater today.

470
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,790
- Okay, get ready. 
 - Okay.

471
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,980
How about lunch?

472
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,960
I want to eat something near the school.

473
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,320
I'll eat after the lecture.

474
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,380
Oh, my. Shim Yun Woo, what are you doing here?

475
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,700
I'll meet you inside.

476
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,520
I don't have afternoon appointments today, BK.

477
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,660
The meanings of sunflowers are...

478
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,330
waiting, worship, and longing.

479
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,820
- They're for me, right? 
 - No.

480
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,850
You scared me!

481
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,720
What? Are you remembering how you used to cry there?

482
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,980
You always played hooky. How did you become a teacher?

483
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,850
How about you? You played hooky in the clubroom all the time.

484
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,380
How did you become a researcher?

485
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,350
By the way, do the students you'll give a lecture to know?

486
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:44,370
- Know what? 
 - That you got dumped by a senior you loved

487
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,240
and you cried for the entire three years.

488
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,390
Hey, that was forever ago.

489
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,910
By the way, is the clubroom still the same?

490
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,580
Why? Are you still thinking of the senior?

491
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,300
- Seriously. 
 - Do you want to relive your memories?

492
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,250
I don't, okay?

493
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,080
Hello!

494
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,200
Nice to meet you, juniors.

495
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,840
I'm Han So Jin, from the 52nd class.

496
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,800
Why did you become a genetics researcher?

497
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,020
DNA is a navigation that lets you find your precious someone.

498
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:42,010
 My father was a genetics researcher for the National Forensic Service. 

499
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,750
 He analyzed the DNA of the unidentified victims 

500
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,420
 and helped many families. 

501
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:54,020
 They couldn't have joined their family if it wasn't for DNA. 

502
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,680
 That's why I wanted to do it, too. 

503
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,780
 Finding people's loved ones. 

504
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,890
And finding one for myself.

505
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,350
Our bodies have

506
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:22,820
DNA that's long enough to travel to the sun and back a thousand times.

507
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,670
King Jeongjong was kind even as a child.

508
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,700
Politics and power were...

509
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,600
 It used to be called "junk DNA." 

510
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:36,010
But there is a lot of research on intron, junk DNA.

511
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:42,720
If so, will twins with the same DNA live the same life?

512
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,100
We're telepathic with each other.

513
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,240
My leg hurt a lot once.

514
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,780
It turns out she injured her leg in a car accident at the same time.

515
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:57,570
That sometimes happens to twins, who share the same DNA.

516
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,350
Although they're in different places,

517
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:03,760
they feel the same thing at the same time.

518
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,350
I'm researching whether that's possible with people who are not twins.

519
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:14,750
I call the person you can communicate with a "DNA partner."

520
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,600
Are there people who can communicate with each other as if they're twins?

521
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,320
Yes. If the brainwave or frequency intensifies

522
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:31,280
and two people's signals interrupt each other,

523
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,540
your senses, emotions, and thoughts will be mixed together.

524
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,360
It's like sending telepathic messages.

525
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,210
Ms. Han, will we like the same man, too?

526
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,970
What are you saying? No, no.

527
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,810
I wonder.

528
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:51,610
Ask DNA, the prophet from the future.

529
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:57,830
Then, your perfect other half will enter through that door.

530
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,660
I went to the DNA center and heard from BK.

531
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,890
Here. I don't think you have flowers in the lab.

532
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,590
My goodness.

533
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,320
I have a pollen allergy.

534
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,450
I'm sorry. Let me wipe your face.

535
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,690
My gosh.

536
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,610
It's okay. Gosh.

537
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,630
This reminds me of when we first met.

538
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,630
It's exciting and fun.

539
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,890
You reacted as soon as you saw the flowers.

540
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,910
Your allergy must be severe.

541
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,790
I've been reacting since earlier.

542
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,270
But there weren't flowers around.

543
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:50,480
I was at the flower shop, but you reacted for me.

544
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,580
Telepathy?

545
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,100
Telepathy?

546
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,940
You haven't had lunch yet, right? Let's eat.

547
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,600
Wait...

548
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,640
Can I stop by my secret spot for a moment?

549
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,030
This is for you.

550
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,520
This is it.

551
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,450
This used to be our clubroom.

552
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:29,450
Wow, I spent so much time here during study hall.

553
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,060
- Study hall? 
 - It's still the same!

554
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,500
Shit!

555
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,820
It's a model skeleton.

556
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,470
Long time no see.

557
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,070
Why is that there?

558
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,590
Come here.

559
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,070
Ta-da!

560
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,850
This is the best spot for stargazing in our school.

561
00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:00,650
I saw my favorite star over there sometimes.

562
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,760
I learned it was called "Io" later.

563
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,790
Io is Jupiter's satellite.

564
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:12,390
It was called the Star of Hell because it's the closest star to Jupiter.

565
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,100
Star of Hell?

566
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,850
Jupiter is a star of storms.

567
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,760
Io became full of magma because of the tidal force.

568
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,730
There are volcanoes on one side,

569
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,060
and on the other side, where there are no volcanoes, it’s 148 °C below zero.

570
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,810
One is a ball of fire, and the other is a ball of ice.

571
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:32,480
They created hell because they're next to each other?

572
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,070
That's correct.

573
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:43,170
But if I were Io, I'd never want to be apart from Jupiter.

574
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:47,820
Otherwise, Io will be all alone in an endless space.

575
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,930
I would've done the same, too.

576
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,230
Jupiter must've wanted it to.

577
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,690
Daebak! That's where it was!

578
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,440
Daebak!

579
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,180
Hold on. Let me help you.

580
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,680
This is my time capsule.

581
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,800
I used to date a senior of mine.

582
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,560
I bought these movie tickets for us.

583
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,720
But he was two-timing.

584
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,900
He had already seen the movie with the other girl.

585
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,250
How many times did you get dumped, anyway?

586
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,180
At least, they always approached me first.

587
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,120
That MP3 player.

588
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,850
What songs are on here?

589
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:07,600
I put just one song in it to listen to it with my chosen one.

590
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,290
This is my theme song.

591
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,930
Theme song?

592
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,750
Sounds interesting.

593
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,970
So, have you listened to it with a man?

594
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,330
I haven't yet.

595
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,730
Really?

596
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,040
Should we listen to it together, then?

597
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,010
It ran out of battery.

598
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:34,850
If it still works, should we charge it and listen to it together?

599
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,600
Well...

600
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,000
- Sure. 
 - I'm hungry. Let's go get food.

601
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,020
Well, what should we eat?

602
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,610
I do have something in mind.

603
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,520
I'm craving something, too.

604
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,950
Should we say it at the same time?

605
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,510
Shall we?

606
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,870
One, two...

607
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,500
 Dumpling soup. 

608
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,790
Daebak!

609
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,330
Telepathy.

610
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,700
Let's go. I know an amazing place.

611
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,950
I wanted eel, but it's two servings minimum.

612
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,190
This is Shim Yun Woo's fault.

613
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,060
He abandoned me for a woman again.

614
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,070
Arrogant bastard.

615
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,260
Hyung!

616
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,750
Jung Tam.

617
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,390
Looks like you came for lunch.

618
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:32,210
Yes, we attended the fire department award ceremony

619
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,350
and stopped by on the way back.

620
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,780
Where's Yun Woo? Why are you eating alone?

621
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,680
You know how he is.

622
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,890
He went to see a woma—

623
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,530
He went to see Team Leader Han.

624
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,440
- So Jin? 
 - Yes.

625
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,730
Sexy...

626
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,250
Pardon?

627
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:14,660
Well, I... I meant to say tasty.

628
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,130
It came out wrong.

629
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,740
I see. The snapper and scallop rice is tasty here.

630
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,100
I see.

631
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,380
Enjoy your meal, then.

632
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,470
Yes, enjoy.

633
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,620
- Enjoy your meal, Hyung. 
 - Yes, enjoy.

634
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,330
- Good job. 
 - You, too.

635
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,570
I ordered this and this.

636
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,410
Good job. Let's get this and this, too.

637
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,490
   

638
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,420
Okay, bon appétit.

639
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,200
Hold on!

640
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,580
I'm done. It's been so long.

641
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,300
- I can eat, right? 
 - Enjoy.

642
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,070
Their dumpling soup makes me so happy.

643
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:13,560
Wow, the dumplings are so plump and handsome.

644
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,860
Right?

645
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,070
It's good.

646
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,800
By the way, how did you end up there when I was being followed?

647
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,520
It was a secluded area.

648
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,050
Well, I went to Kang Hoon's restaurant for a drink

649
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:42,870
and ended up there because there was no parking space.

650
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:53,290
By chance, did you get a feeling that day?

651
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:56,510
Did you hear or see something?

652
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:59,280
I'm not sure.

653
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:03,680
Well, I heard a car honking...

654
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,390
but there was nothing unusual.

655
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,110
Did you feel anxious, or did your heart race for no reason?

656
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,210
I'm not sure.

657
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:21,380
I think I felt more uncomfortable than anxious.

658
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,340
The flowers, then. Where did you get them?

659
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,000
The flowers?

660
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,410
The sunflowers?

661
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:32,970
A friend of mine has a flower shop near the DNA center.

662
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,720
So I picked fresh ones from there.

663
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:40,200
Were you there around 12, by chance? At the flower shop?

664
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,710
I'm not sure. Probably. Why?

665
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,640
 Was Yun Woo at the flower shop then? 

666
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,150
It might not have been a coincidence that you saved me.

667
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,020
And I started getting allergic reactions when you were at the flower shop.

668
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,150
It was as if I was at the flower shop.

669
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,630
There were no flowers near me then.

670
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,670
Come on.

671
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:06,540
It wasn't because of pollen.

672
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,160
It might've been another rare allergy.

673
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,760
And I didn't save you because of telepathy.

674
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,660
It was nothing... nothing but...

675
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:22,170
a pure coincidence that feels like fate. That's what I think.

676
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:27,350
You never thought a coincidence might actually be predetermined, right?

677
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,250
Okay, then.

678
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:40,040
Shall we start studying coincidences, then?

679
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,860
Okay.

680
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,710
Let's eat.

681
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,590
Thank you. 
    

682
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,340
Hello.

683
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,480
Thank you.

684
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:12,070
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

685
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,700
- Here are flowers. 
 - Thank you.

686
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,590
I really enjoyed your writing. 
    

687
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:20,770
You're such a great writer!

688
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:24,040
You look so smart, too.

689
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,610
I hear that often.

690
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,850
- Next? 
 - I'm also...

691
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:34,540
thinking of going poly or whatever.

692
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,610
What do you say? A fan like me...

693
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,960
can be a good partner, no?

694
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,260
Next person.

695
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,370
You need to answer.

696
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:49,050
It sounds like you didn't read carefully.

697
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:53,830
I don't date anyone because I date multiple people.

698
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,300
Anyone?

699
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,800
I'm not just anyone.

700
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,770
Are you sure you won't regret it?

701
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,160
Regret, my foot.

702
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,650
I don't date a horny loser who only has one thing on his mind.

703
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,370
W-What? A H-H-Horny loser?

704
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,710
Gosh, you're way out of line!

705
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,830
Who do you think you are? Horny?

706
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,510
Horny... Let go of me!

707
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:23,870
Horny loser?

708
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,510
I can't believe this!

709
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,110
- Let go of me! 
 - Next.

710
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,540
Thank you for waiting.

711
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,700
Are you okay?

712
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,940
I'm okay.

713
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,790
I'm a huge fan.

714
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,520
Thank you.

715
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:54,430
Do you think it was telepathy?

716
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,310
We met only recently,

717
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:03,590
but I've never felt connected to a man that way.

718
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,210
You say that after you build a good rapport

719
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,750
and learn what kind of person he and his parents are.

720
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,430
You say that after experiencing the other person enough.

721
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,220
You immature big sister.

722
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:18,200
You never know what a person is capable of hiding.

723
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,970
You aren't even 30. You wouldn't understand.

724
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:29,070
She's being stubborn. She must be smitten again.

725
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,660
You're talking about Yun Woo, right?

726
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:35,880
Listen carefully!

727
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,850
I know both you and Yun Woo well.

728
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:41,830
He's the last person you should date in this world.

729
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:47,350
He could never give you what you want, okay?

730
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,580
What's wrong with him? They're close friends.

731
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,660
That must be how he feels when someone he rescued

732
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,020
tries to kill themselves again.

733
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,270
What are you talking about now?

734
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,330
Let's go if you're done eating.

735
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:20,560
Aigoo, aigoo! I'm sorry, So Jin.

736
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:26,210
Kang Hoon received these at the award ceremony today.

737
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:30,400
I forgot to drop them off at home. I'm sorry.

738
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,870
Today? Today?

739
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,780
Telepathy?

740
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,780
Telepathy, my foot. That makes no sense.

741
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,220
Why is it so itchy?

742
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,090
What are you doing here?

743
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,320
Well, just...

744
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,430
Here's a gift for you.

745
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,160
It should still be warm.

746
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,760
It just got published today.

747
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,430
Did you write this yourself?

748
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:20,150
Of course. Take your time reading it.

749
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:23,530
By the way, did you get a call from the police?

750
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:26,230
Someone has been loitering around your home, apparently.

751
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:31,410
A few people have messed with the door lock and ran away before.

752
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:32,660
That doesn't bother you?

753
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,030
I don't go to the writing room every day. It's okay.

754
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,120
How about today? Did anything happen today?

755
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,620
Today...

756
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:42,910
 Who do you think you are? 

757
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,780
 Horny... Let go of me! 

758
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,120
- Today... 
 - Give me your phone number.

759
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,560
He might return if he was after you.

760
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,720
What a strange way to get someone's number.

761
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,000
Here you go.

762
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,400
How about Yun Woo? Isn't he worried?

763
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,510
We don't have that kind of relationship.

764
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,520
What kind of relationship is it, then?

765
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,890
Yun Woo is...

766
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,570
a man of Fridays?

767
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,150
Pardon? A man of Fridays?

768
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:23,590
I see different men each day.

769
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,400
Each day?

770
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:36,370
I'm sorry. I don't want to read your book on relationships.

771
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:43,270
Do you think only monogamous relationships are normal?

772
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:49,270
I don't understand people like you or Yun Woo, who date so casually.

773
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:51,210
You two should date each other.

774
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:54,130
Instead of hurting innocent people.

775
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,710
Everyone is so rude today.

776
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,190
   

777
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:27,570
 Listen carefully! I know both you and Yun Woo well. 

778
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:30,530
 He's the last person you should date in this world. 

779
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:36,480
 He could never give you what you want, okay? 

780
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,100
Seo Kang Hoon thinks a hundred times before he talks.

781
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,740
 I didn't save you because of telepathy. 

782
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,510
 It was nothing... nothing but... 

783
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:53,910
 a pure coincidence that feels like fate. That's what I think. 

784
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,590
- Coincidence? 
  - One, two... 

785
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,210
 Dumpling soup. 

786
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,040
 Daebak! 

787
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,570
Or telepathy?

788
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,170
   

789
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,450
Hi.

790
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,400
What are you doing sitting in front of food?

791
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,120
You can't do that.

792
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,190
- Sunbae. 
 - Yes?

793
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,630
- This is about my friend. 
 - Yeah.

794
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:32,630
I think my friend's friend fell for a dangerous man.

795
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,440
What is my friend supposed to do?

796
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,080
Dangerous man? Is he a criminal?

797
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,780
It's not that.

798
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,670
But he hurts women often.

799
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,500
He makes them fall for him completely

800
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,040
and he dumps them once he changes his mind.

801
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,260
She's a fool to fall for him.

802
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,670
But apparently, she can't help it.

803
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:54,170
He's handsome. He's a doctor. He's polite.

804
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,030
And he's funny, too.

805
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,780
Looking at my friends, once they fall for someone,

806
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,250
they can't break up even if they know the person is a jerk.

807
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:06,170
And some women always fall for bad men like him.

808
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:08,450
What am I supposed to do, then?

809
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,900
I mean, my friend.

810
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:19,450
You came.

811
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,030
- Come on in. 
 - Hello.

812
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,100
Thank you.

813
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,650
It's Ms. Go Sung Hui's genetics test result you requested.

814
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,530
Thankfully, the fetus is genetically normal.

815
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:38,370
Although, you should keep an eye on its hypoglycemia and polycythemia.

816
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:40,040
What a relief.

817
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:44,600
I was watching her closely because she had diabetes from birth.

818
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,150
I'll have to watch her hormonal balance after childbirth, too.

819
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,370
Would you like some tea?

820
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:51,640
I'd appreciate it.

821
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,040
- Just one moment, please. 
 - Okay.

822
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,300
   

823
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,380
   

824
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,560
Telepathy?

825
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:05,560
Team Leader Han, is telepathy a real thing?

826
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:11,180
I believe some coincidences were predetermined.

827
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:16,680
I'm studying if there are genes that affect the predetermination.

828
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,890
Coincidences...

829
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:23,570
Like how you run into someone when you go somewhere randomly?

830
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,750
That's just a coincidence.

831
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,570
Not stuff like that.

832
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:31,260
"I want to see him. I really want to see him."

833
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,120
You send a signal like that.

834
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,330
Either consciously or unconsciously.

835
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:39,420
But I'm still researching.

836
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,610
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

837
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,790
Right.

838
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:59,300
I heard you and Yun Woo went to a karaoke bar together.

839
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:03,650
He says you sang together, too. That's a lie, right?

840
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:07,210
Since he was humiliated after singing on a school trip,

841
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:09,720
he never sings in front of anyone.

842
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,710
Pardon? That can't be.

843
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:15,070
He won't let go of the mic.

844
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:17,930
So I didn't get to sing that many songs.

845
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:21,200
Did he perform to comfort you or something?

846
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,200
Comfort me?

847
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,940
 Let's go! 

848
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:39,410
His dancing did comfort me.

849
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,440
- He danced? 
 - Yes.

850
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,900
You mean his strange movement where his head moves separately from his body?

851
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,140
- Yes, yes. That's it. 
 - He's crazy.

852
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:54,010
By the way, looks like you're basically dating.

853
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,740
D-Dating?

854
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,960
No, we aren't dating.

855
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,580
What's your relationship, then?

856
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:09,360
Well... Maybe we're...

857
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,740
experiment partners?

858
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,530
Yes, Mother?

859
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:19,430
 Yun Woo. Your aunt from the US is visiting me today. 

860
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,330
 We're having dinner together. Do you want to come to Seongbuk-dong? 

861
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:25,090
Aunt came to Seoul?

862
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,020
Has it been 10 years?

863
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,080
Yes, sounds good. I'll be there soon.

864
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,700
Yoon Ho!

865
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,080
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm sorry.

866
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,580
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 - You need to be careful.

867
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,940
- It's okay. 
 - I'm sorry.

868
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:56,270
I sneezed again.

869
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:58,030
Just like then.

870
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,720
 - They're for me, right? 
 - No. 

871
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:10,990
We can experiment to see if it's telepathy or coincidence.

872
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,750
   

873
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,890
Yes, So Jin.

874
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:21,050
Let's have dinner together.

875
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,990
I'm sorry, I have a plan—

876
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:25,160
I need to tell you something.

877
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:30,640
Should we meet by coincidence and eat together?

878
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,320
By coincidence?

879
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,190
Han River or Namsan.

880
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:39,670
We'll each choose one and go there now.

881
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:44,990
Just send a telepathic message about where you're going.

882
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:48,270
And we'll meet coincidentally there.

883
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,890
Why do we have to do that?

884
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:52,560
 I want to confirm something. 

885
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,890
Confirm what?

886
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:57,340
To see if we're telepathic with each other.

887
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:04,240
To see if DNA partners can communicate through telepathy.

888
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,700
 This woman talks about DNA in crucial moments. 

889
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,500
 She's an unpredictable nerd. 

890
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,240
Sounds good. Let's experiment.

891
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,430
I'm the one who agreed to do it.

892
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,270
What should I do?

893
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:21,340
 Let's choose specific spots. 

894
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:24,000
At 8 o'clock, let's meet at Namsam Observatory or

895
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,690
at the bench in the Banpo Area

896
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:28,820
of the Han River, where the submersible bridge is. How's that?

897
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,810
Sounds good.

898
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:39,190
♫  As I was wondering alone  ♫

899
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:44,300
♫  My warm dream came and illuminated me  ♫

900
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,660
♫  Someday, this moment we’re sharing  ♫

901
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,840
I wonder where she went.

902
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,310
- Han River? 
 - It's coming.

903
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,750
- Namsan? 
 - It's coming.

904
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,850
Han River?

905
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:58,150
Namsan?

906
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:00,620
- My head hurts. So confusing. 
 - He's coming.

907
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:06,070
The telepathy will work, and he'll come where I am.

908
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,800
Han River or Namsan?

909
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,890
♫  You came to me like fate  ♫

910
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:20,980
♫  After waiting through all those slow hours  ♫

911
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,140
♫  I’ll come closer to you  ♫

912
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:28,860
♫  With my heart full, I will find comfort in your embrace  ♫

913
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,590
I have...

914
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:35,610
a bad feeling for some reason.

915
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:48,010


916
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,100
What?

917
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,290
Gosh, I'm sorry.

918
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,340
Yun Woo!

919
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,860
Han Seo Jin!

920
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:30,170
♫  I know you right  ♫

921
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,690
♫  I know, you think I'm odd enough  ♫

922
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:38,600
♫  Just take my hand  ♫

923
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:40,750
♫  Oh baby, hold on tight  ♫

924
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:46,610
♫  I’m heading deep into your mind, don't care 'bout your hurt  ♫

925
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:48,800
 I'm researching whether... 

926
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,980
 - Who are you? 
 - that kind of communication is possible. 

927
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:56,650
 I wanted to attend Ms. Han's lecture, too. 

928
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:00,570
 Are you So Jin's boyfriend or something? 

929
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,550
 Boyfriend? I'm not her boyfriend. 

930
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:07,350
 I'm a person who helps her research. 

931
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,860
 If you help her research, you should be in the lab. 

932
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:13,010
 Why did you come here with flowers? 

933
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:16,470
 But I approve of you as her friend based on your first impression. 

934
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,970
 Thanks. 

935
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:21,520
 Have you been her friend since high school, then? 

936
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,930
 Yes. 

937
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:34,330
 If so, do you remember what her favorite food was back then? 

938
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:35,500
 One, two... 

939
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,090
 Dumpling soup. 

940
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,290
 Daebak! 

941
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:41,890
 Telepathy. 

942
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:45,260
 Let's go. I know an amazing place. 

943
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:48,420
♫  Every day, would you give me all your heart tonight?  ♫

944
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,590
♫  Yeah, I’ll never give up on your love  ♫

945
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:54,790
♫  In my heart, you’re always with me  ♫

946
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:58,210
♫  Forever, you and I  ♫

947
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:02,220
♫  Just like this fluttering feeling  ♫

948
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:05,980
♫  You’re filling up my heart  ♫

949
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:10,820
♫  Your image  ♫

950
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,970
♫  Like a small dizziness  ♫

951
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:16,840
♫  You shake me up  ♫

952
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:22,960
♫  How can I even control my heart?  ♫

953
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,770
♫  Let it be  ♫

954
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,860
♫  I’ll follow where my heart leads  ♫

955
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:31,160
   

956
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,710
 The signal was interrupted because it was connected to someone by coincidence. 

957
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:36,900
 Kang Hoon? 

958
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,490
 - Noona! 
 - Kang Hoon. 

959
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:42,070
 I just stopped by. To see the stars. 

960
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:45,580
 Why are you taking things so far? 

961
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,620
 So Jin will meet a nice man. 

962
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:50,140
 You? I'll never let her date you. 

963
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,230
 How did I run into you here? 

964
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:54,680
 This happened to us many times. 

965
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,290
 I don't play with a person's sincere heart. 

966
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:59,790
 Let's experiment properly for one last time. 

967
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:03,960
♫  I’ll get you, your heart  ♫
