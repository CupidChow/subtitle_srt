1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,660
   

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,430
   

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,770
   

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,930
   

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,300
   

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:35,120
   

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,720
   

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,040
   

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,230
 A bastard like you doesn't deserve to be loved! 

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:53,760


11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,910
 Welcome! 

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,590
 Welcome to Han So Jin's world of experiments! 

13
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,630
 My puzzle... 

14
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,770
 Welcome! 

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,740
- BK. 
 - Gosh, you shouldn't have.

16
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,010
Say hello, Team Leader Han. It's Dr. Shim Yun Woo.

17
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,750
Is he that Shim Yun Woo?

18
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,200
Ah Ri, talk quietly.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,990
This is Team Leader Han So Jin of the DNA Research Team.

20
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,340
 So Jin. 
   

21
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,100
She majored in molecular biology.

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,790
Although she got into pseudoscience and she's still writing a thesis—

23
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,600
Nice to meet you. We've met before, right?

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,220
Well, I don't think we have.

25
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,890
Looks like you're bad at remembering people's faces.

26
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,830
 What? Did he recognize me? 

27
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,950
How could you not remember a face like this?

28
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,250
That's what I'm saying, BK.

29
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,500
You shouldn't have brought this.

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,470
Sunbae, did you spray the Super Teol on his sideburn?

31
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,740
What's with your sideburn?

32
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,560
Semi-retro is trendy these days.

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,540
Super Teol was custom-made for Oh Sang Min. That can't be.

34
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,520
There's no way.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,740
But it's growing right now.

36
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,830
As expected of Shim Yun Woo.

37
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,230
By the way, your name and face are very familiar, Ms. Han.

38
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,970
Oh, yes? Well, my name?

39
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,950
Where have I seen you and heard about you?

40
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,850
Actually, my name is very common.

41
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,250
My face is also very ordinary.

42
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,370
 This is how you're going to be, huh? 

43
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,770
- Anyway, Yun Woo. 
 - Yes.

44
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,890
I think my meeting will take a long time.

45
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,060
- Team Leader Han. 
 - Yes?

46
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,760
You have the prenatal test results for the Shim Hospital patients, right?

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,450
O-Of course.

48
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,730
Could you come this way?

49
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,420
Sure.

50
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,940
You scared me. Well, come this way.

51
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,260
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

52
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,960
 No, he can't think I'm the crazy woman with wild hair. 

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,010
 I'll wait until you come clean. 

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,220
Well, I have a question.

55
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,590
Yes, I was waiting for it.

56
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,720
You seem to have a lot of facial hair.

57
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,600
Does it run in your family?

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,570
It didn't start growing all of a sudden, right?

59
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,890
I get very curious whenever I see abnormal hair growth.

60
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm curious about what you just said.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,570
"Abnormal"?

62
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,150
- Pardon? 
 - Our DNA center...

63
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,420
is a multi-purpose space that represents medicine, culture, and life.

64
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,730
Through DNA tests, minor conditions can be treated...

65
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,730
- Excuse me. I'm sorry. 
 - and conditions that are hard to cure

66
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,540
are being treated with custom care.

67
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,810
Custom genetic anti-aging program and...

68
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,000
What was that?

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,430
There's a hair loss treatment presentation today.

70
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,500
We're currently developing a DNA custom hair growth solution.

71
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,660
It's called Super Teol.

72
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,630
Super Teol? Super... Teo...

73
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,470
 Super Te-ol? 

74
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,050
 Get hairy! 

75
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,070
 We're currently developing a DNA custom hair growth solution. 

76
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,960
 It's called Super Teol. 

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,320
 Super Teol? 

78
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,150
Super Teol?

79
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,280
Han So Jin. Han So Jin. Han So Jin.

80
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,000
I think I happened to see that being sold.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,920
There's no way. Super Teol is still under clinical trials.

82
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,650
Still under clinical trials?

83
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,770
What was the test result?

84
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,960
We tested it on animals. It was amazing.

85
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,800
A rat with severe hair loss became as hairy as a rabbit in just seven hours.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,760
A rat became a rabbit?

87
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,550
Isn't it amazing? And it absorbs really quickly, too.

88
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,480
The moment it was applied to the skin, it was absorbed into the dermal layer immediately.

89
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,640
Very deep inside.

90
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,530
I'm very curious how it'd work on humans.

91
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,890
It'd depend on the DNA and hormone levels.

92
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,110
But if the solution fits their genes,

93
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,870
it won't just be the beard, eyebrows, nose, belly, or armpit hair.

94
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,270
Their whole body could get covered with hair.

95
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,470
The secrets of genes are bigger than you imagine.

96
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,610
Well, yes. I suppose...

97
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,290
laser, waxing, and permanent hair removal

98
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,500
are widely available right now.

99
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,690
Hair removal?

100
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,360
Why? Your sideburns look great.

101
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,380
They look great?

102
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,930
No, no, I mean your hair growth doesn't look bad. I don't think you need to worry.

103
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,040
It doesn't look bad?

104
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,520
As long as it doesn't spread.

105
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,340
It might spread?

106
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,710
H-Here we are. This is the lab. Follow me.

107
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,380
 Should I tell him the truth now or not? 

108
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,020
 What do I do? 

109
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,340
 Should I tell her about Super Teol now? 

110
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,790
 What if she plays ignorant? 

111
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,360
 Let's wait until I find clear evidence. 

112
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,630
 Yes, let's talk about work for now. 

113
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,300
- Come on in. 
 - Yes, I will.

114
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,030
It's the list of high-risk patients according to the prenatal exam. 
    

115
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,010
According to the amniotic fluid test, Yoo Yeong Ah has a mutation in chromosome 18.

116
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,870
She needs to have two, but she has a third chromosome too.

117
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,180
   

118
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,760
What will Ms. Yoo choose to do?

119
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,770
The decision would be up to her, but I should recommend surgery.

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,930
- Pardon? 
 - Her fetus will likely die before birth,

121
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,270
and there is only a 5% chance that it will live longer than a year.

122
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,480
Even if it survives, not only it will be visibly deformed

123
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,020
but its heart, lungs, digestive system, and kidneys will be defective.

124
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,150
Need I say more?

125
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,180
There was a case like this before, too.

126
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,650
The baby was born without a part of its brain, so it died after a day.

127
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:32,460
But the baby was baptized and had a birthday party in her mother's arms.

128
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,670
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

129
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,740
 Happy birthday. 

130
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,270
 - Let's make a wish.  
 - The parents later said this.

131
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,530
The baby might have died, but

132
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,550
she didn't regret giving birth.

133
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,250
The problem isn't the fetus' condition. It's Ms. Yoo's

134
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,740
pulmonary arterial hypertension.

135
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,050
Which means the baby and the mother will say goodbye one way or another.

136
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,760
I'm a gynecologist.

137
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,180
It's my responsibility to prioritize the mother's health.

138
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,210
The baby and the mother...

139
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:23,470
start communicating from the moment she learns she’s pregnant.

140
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,290
For some people,

141
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:39,280
the moment they meet might be more precious than anything.

142
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,680
If the farewell can be delayed even for a day,

143
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,150
some relationships can endure any sacrifice.

144
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,480
Have you thought about how desperate she might feel?

145
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,360
That's when you're supposed to say goodbye.

146
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,100
When you feel bad and sad.

147
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,730
Not when you grow tired and angry.

148
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,880
And about your shoe...

149
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,960
You need to let go of your attachment to meet someone new.

150
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,600
Throw away the other shoe, too.

151
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,300
The sole is totally worn out.

152
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,500
T-The shoe?

153
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,950
 Hold on. Hold on! 

154
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,890
 We can't just let this slide... 

155
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,790
Ms. Han So Jin.

156
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,020
W-What's this for?

157
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,120
You're the researcher in charge of my hospital's prenatal exams.

158
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,320
Of course, I should have your contact info.

159
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,290
Do you think that's necessary?

160
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,460
Through BK—

161
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,630
Okay.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,550
Good.

163
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,580
What's that...

164
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,810
A rabbit?

165
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,970
 It'd depend on the DNA and hormone levels. 

166
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,150
 But if the solution fits their genes, 

167
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,770
 it won't just be the beard, eyebrows, nose, belly, or armpit hair. 

168
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,890
 Their whole body could get covered with hair. 

169
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,770
Geez...

170
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,920
It can't be.

171
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,480
No way.

172
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,790
He can't remember my face, right?

173
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,990
 It's such an honor to enter Ms. Han So Jin's... 

174
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,140
 world of experiments... world of experiments... world of experiments... 

175
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,980
 Welcome! Welcome to Han So Jin's world of experiments! 

176
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,390
It's over.

177
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,480
He knows about everything.

178
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,040
Why did he pretend like he didn't?

179
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,600
Han So Jin, why did you do that? Why?

180
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,150
No.

181
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,690
I punished a bastard who broke a woman's heart.

182
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,980
Because of the wound, someone might never be able to date again.

183
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,380
But he can't be punished by law.

184
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,430
Right. I'm innocent if you think about it.

185
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,320
I'm just nosy and indignant.

186
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,850
That's right. This is a punishment from the heavens.

187
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,020
Shy, I made a perfume using my favorite scents.

188
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,920
You must bark if you smell it on a man. Woof, woof.

189
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,570
You have to bark, okay? Let's go.

190
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,800
 By instinct, humans use their sense of smell 

191
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,540
 to find a partner who can supplement their immune system for their offspring. 

192
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,070
 Immune DNA is connected to smell. 

193
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,970
Shy, did you finally find him?

194
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,750
 If you're strongly attracted to someone's smell, 

195
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,490
 it means they are... 

196
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,420
 your DNA partner. 

197
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,020
Noona.

198
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,780
Hi, Shy. Aigoo...

199
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,920
Mayo... That's Mayo. What are you doing here?

200
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,970
The salon was busy, so I volunteered to walk him so I could take a stroll myself.

201
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,720
Shy, you minx.

202
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,190
You were never affectionate, but you fell for a male dog.

203
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:43,790
He seduces all the dogs in the neighborhood because he's handsome.

204
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,610
Watch out!

205
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,990
It's not because he's handsome.

206
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,910
Females detect males' smell really well.

207
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,490
Mayo, tell me. Are you Shy's other half?

208
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,020
So what if he were?

209
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,010
He can never commit to one female dog.

210
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,100
Right, Mayo? No, right?

211
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,000
Wait and see. He'll change once he finds the right one.

212
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,280
   

213
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,600
Shy, come.

214
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,370
Gosh, Shy. Do you like me more than Noona?

215
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,560
So cute.

216
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,090
What are you doing?

217
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,130
How strange. You never have any smell.

218
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,260
What do you think? Do I smell nice? Smell me.

219
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,380
Come here.

220
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,180
You smell burnt, okay? Because you play with fire too much.

221
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,200
I wasn't playing with fire. I was experimenting.

222
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,560
You're supposed to do experiments in labs only.

223
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,820
By the way, since I still smell like that,

224
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,200
it means we aren't a DNA match.

225
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,960
Gosh, enough with DNAs.

226
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,700
- I'm leaving. 
 - Hold on.

227
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,850
- Open it. 
 - Gosh, what's this?

228
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,340
- It's a safety bell. 
 - We just installed it recently.

229
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,430
It works at your apartment, this area, and all the way to my restaurant.

230
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,390
I designated you a special table No. 0 at our restaurant.

231
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,240
Safety bell?

232
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,320
Ta-da. I get alerted through this, not just the device at the restaurant.

233
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,600
Do you want to see if I get the alert from table No. 0? Press it.

234
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,970
One, two, three.

235
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,600
Ta-da. Table No. 21...

236
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,570
What do you use your phone for?

237
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,610
It's because I can't answer calls at the restaurant.

238
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,650
You'd better not call me anytime, okay?

239
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,160
You know what the safety bell is, right, Noona?

240
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,460
I'm your Noona. Seriously.

241
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,820
- I'll go. 
 - Okay.

242
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,560
Bye, Shy.

243
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,330
Hey, you'd better come when I call you.

244
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,850
Are you okay?

245
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,640
 Seo Kang Hoon. 

246
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,400
 We aren't related, but he's like family. 

247
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,610
 He's willing to sacrifice himself for me. 

248
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,610
Are you okay?

249
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:32,260
 But not just for me. 

250
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,070
Shy, shall we go now? Let's go, Shy.

251
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,010
Does she really like him?

252
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,980
Shy, let's go.

253
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,150
   

254
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,630
You scared me!

255
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,100
Were you looking for the man with your favorite scents with Shy again?

256
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,410
Why do you always have to show up like this?

257
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,060
Did you run away from home again?

258
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,900
This is the only place I can log out of the world.

259
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,280
As I left the center, I couldn't decide if I should take the subway or bus,

260
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,450
or eat before going home, or eat at home.

261
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:31,350
I came here because I couldn't decide on anything.

262
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,810
Didn't you take your medicine?

263
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,010
I quit whenever I become dependent on it.

264
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,630
Ah Ri, I'm hungry. Should we make something to eat?

265
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,030
I'll refuse.

266
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:55,280
No matter what I eat, I'd wish I ate something else.

267
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,260
Okay.

268
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,820
The man who frees you from that will be your DNA lover.

269
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,890
I'll find your other half, too.

270
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:34,490
♫  A dream within a dream within a dream within a dream  ♫

271
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,640
♫  Passing through a long oblivion, it’s my dream  ♫

272
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:52,460
♫  Time has crumbled on the horizon  ♫

273
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,280
♫  Look at me walking through the long desert  ♫

274
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,020
- Here's your order. 
 - Thank you.

275
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,880
- Dad, the couple's set. 
 - Okay.

276
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,650
♫  You shatter  ♫

277
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,820
♫  and appear everywhere  ♫

278
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,970
♫  In the eyes of a girl, in the entrails of a beast  ♫

279
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,810
♫  With the branches swaying in the harsh northern wind  ♫

280
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,800
♫  Scatter, disperse  ♫

281
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,260
   

282
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:41,170
   

283
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,890
 By instinct, humans use their sense of smell 

284
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:01,380
 to find a partner who can supplement their immune system for their offspring. 

285
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,430
 Immune DNA is connected to smell. 

286
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,160
 If you're strongly attracted to someone's smell, 

287
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,030
 it means they are your DNA partner. 

288
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,400
   

289
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,650
Jab, arm. Jab, arm.

290
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,360
Two. One, two, three, four.

291
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,710
One, two, three, four.

292
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,910
I hate scary places like this.

293
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,990
Are you here to work out?

294
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,120
Well, I...

295
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,450
Do you work here, by chance?

296
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,650
No, I'm a member here.

297
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,580
I see.

298
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,010
Take this if you're interested.

299
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,500
I grabbed a few since my fellow officers are interested in martial arts.

300
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,070
Have a look.

301
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,690
Officers?

302
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,920
Are you a soldier, by chance?

303
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,770
People often think that. I'm a firefighter.

304
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,280
- I see. 
 - Well, then...

305
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,800
What am I doing? Am I crazy?

306
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,380
How cruel.

307
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:41,340
I felt the baby's movement for the first time today.

308
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:49,060
I didn't know it was already ill inside my belly.

309
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,790
According to a detailed exam,

310
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,740
there are some issues with you, too.

311
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,140
You have pulmonary arterial hypertension, Ms. Yoo.

312
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,250
W-What's that?

313
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,220
It's a rare condition that's difficult to cure.

314
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:15,010
But you can improve your chances of survival if you treat it with medication consistently.

315
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,080
It's difficult to catch this in the early stages.

316
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,710
I think you were lucky.

317
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,390
Do you think...

318
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,820
I was really lucky?

319
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,710
By chance, Is Purumi sick because of me?

320
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,280
No, it has nothing to do with Purumi's genetic disorder.

321
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,780
But if you stay pregnant,

322
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,210
not only will the pulmonary arterial hypertension worsen,

323
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,230
but delaying treatment could also put you in critical condition.

324
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:00,020
If so, both you and the fetus will be in danger.

325
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,720
And if a mother with pulmonary arterial hypertension gives birth,

326
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,200
six out of ten...

327
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,340
end up dying.

328
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,820
So...

329
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,240
if I stay pregnant, I might die

330
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,400
and even if Purumi is born,

331
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,260
it won't live long, right?

332
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Then...

333
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,580
what should I do now?

334
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,830
Only you can make this decision, Ms. Yoo.

335
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,700
It's your life, and no one else, including me, can live it for you.

336
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,920
But I don't recommend a decision

337
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,400
that will endanger...

338
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,470
both you and the baby.

339
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,810
Well...

340
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,960
by the way...

341
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,460
You can't be attracted to a woman's biceps, right?

342
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,780
A woman caught my eye, and I followed her today.

343
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,770
She's apparently a firefighter.

344
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,260
I did some research at this place, and that firefighter is

345
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,220
entering an amateur martial arts competition.

346
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,930
Her nickname is Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist.

347
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:30,000
So, are you saying you'll start going there?

348
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,310
I've never been attracted to this type my whole life.

349
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,940
She really isn't my type,

350
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,510
but why did I find her sexy, all drenched in sweat?

351
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,440
Did I become a pervert as I got older?

352
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,140
Think of it as cheating and try dating her.

353
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,640
You'll go back to your usual type once you do.

354
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,240
What's your type, then?

355
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,010
My type?

356
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,780
Why don't you answer?

357
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,270
- I have a type. 
 - Why don't you answer, then?

358
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,100
Dr. Shim, help me find my type again!

359
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,640
Everyone, 
    

360
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,680
what word comes to mind when you look at this photo?

361
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,450
An affair? It's so dirty and low.

362
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,030
It's not true love.

363
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,320
No, they're polyamorists.

364
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,120
Let me explain this word to you.

365
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,690
"Poly" means multiple, and "amor" means love.

366
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,770
It's a compound word that's a combination of these two words.

367
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,620
How was polyamory born, then?

368
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:41,790
 I think it's because individuals' happiness has become important these days. 

369
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:46,880
 You can say the pressure of relationships was lessened a bit. 

370
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,420
But polyamory isn't about having multiple partners.

371
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,610
It's about being unrestricted.

372
00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:00,420
Because love shines most when you're your true self.

373
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,690
As a polyamorist, I'm in love more sincerely than anyone.

374
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,500
Just like all of you.

375
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,440
   
   

376
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,980
Mom!

377
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,090
You're the coolest person in the world.

378
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,490
You know I cut the trip short and came back, right?

379
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,300
Really?

380
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,980
I smell sweaty, don't I? I'm so busy right now.

381
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,800
You still can't trust others.

382
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,980
It's my work. Of course, I can't.

383
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,680
Come here.

384
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,530
- What do you think? 
 - Wow.

385
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,360
It's so cool.

386
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,720
Are her tears like diamonds?

387
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,460
You're so brilliant.

388
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,570
You can't put a price on this. It's my identity.

389
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,140
My true self I had lost getting married and raising a child.

390
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,790
You know what?

391
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:20,650
In that self-portrait, my face is paralyzed from post-natal care.

392
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:25,140
How can I possibly depict my tears from then?

393
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,790
Does the red thread wrapping your neck represent a bloodline?

394
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,410
Oh my gosh, Mi Eun.

395
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:37,900
You can quit being a relationship columnist and become an art columnist.

396
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,770
I'm not that good, Mom.

397
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,200
Both people and art should be like that, Mi Eun.

398
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,060
You need distance to enjoy them like this.

399
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,470
So, you won't invite anyone again, including your daughter?

400
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,970
Why bother on such a happy day?

401
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,720
It's suffocating and dizzying.

402
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,220
I didn’t realize either

403
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,130
that sharing blood could bring such discomfort.

404
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,230
 We're mother and daughter only socially. 

405
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,200
 We're free, but we stay a little lonely. 

406
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,850
 So we don't get overcome by freedom. 

407
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,880
Be free or be lonely.

408
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,660
Mother and daughter socially? How did she give birth to her, then?

409
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,970
Since when was Jang Fox friends with my mom?

410
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,370
I think it's been a while.

411
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,430
Ms. Jang came to the salon with her, too.

412
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,530
Why is she everywhere all the time?

413
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,110
She dates men, and she goes out drinking.

414
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,650
She has a lot of time on her hands.

415
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,960
She can't stay home with her looks and tendencies.

416
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,820
- I'm a homebody. 
 - Women find you pretty

417
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,310
and men find Ms. Jang attractive.

418
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,870
I attract men without seducing, okay?

419
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,930
Gosh, that's why you're left with nothing.

420
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,050
Was any of those men worth your time?

421
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,030
What? Should I have a competition with Jang Fox?

422
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,630
Let's see who scores a better man.

423
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,540
I bet on Jang Mi Eun, then.

424
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,110
Hey, Hwang Geum Soon.

425
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,120
Free?

426
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,260
You mean, huri?

427
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,430
When did you learn that?

428
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:18,800
A Korean word that means making someone dizzy by seducing them with one's charm.

429
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,920
Yes, Jake. I "huri-ed" you.

430
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,260
I seduced you, I said.

431
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,530
So, you'd better not come to Korea to see me.

432
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,280
Excuse me.

433
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,310
Looks like you just broke up with your boyfriend.

434
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,270
Do you have a boyfriend, by chance?

435
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,090
It's okay. I got a new boyfriend just now.

436
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,200
- Just now? 
 - You've been looking at me all this time.

437
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,830
Did you get caught showing interest in me?

438
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,800
I do admit it, but I'm...

439
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,400
not young enough to date every woman I like.

440
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,080
Then...

441
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,610
should we only meet on Thursdays?

442
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,960
I don't have a man to meet on Thursdays.

443
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,770
You're so cool.

444
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,580
If you're here to see a doctor, we're closed.

445
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,680
Hey, Shin Yun Woo. Are you really rejecting me?

446
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,840
Yes, I'm busy.

447
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,130
I see. Are you taking revenge because I didn't talk to you for six months?

448
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,170
Didn't you miss me? You were so patient.

449
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,340
Gynecologists have to be patient by rule.

450
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,620
Do you have a girlfriend? Are you single?

451
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,990
I want to be careful this time, but I only accept one person at a time.

452
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,760
- I never said I'd be one. 
 - I didn't ask you, either.

453
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,620
You got prettier.

454
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,420
I need a hug.

455
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,270
- Mi Eun. 
 - Yes?

456
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,570
You're stepping on my foot.

457
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,480
Sorry.

458
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,250
Friday. That's the only day I'm free. Call me.

459
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,020
Yun Woo... Was he always like that?

460
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,720
   

461
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,320
   

462
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,980
 Answer the phone. Answer it. 

463
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,040
 Answer it. 

464
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,850
 - Answer it.  
 - Avoiding won't do anything.

465
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,680
 Answer it. Answer it. 

466
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,440
 Answer it. 

467
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,030
Ms. Han, I'm so, so, so sorry for calling late.

468
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,950
I needed to tell you something.

469
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,710
Yes, go ahead.

470
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,930
Your Super Teol is mutating my genes.

471
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,550
Pardon?

472
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,460
What do you mean...

473
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,300
Tomorrow, at the center... There are too many people there.

474
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,200
Meet me at my office tomorrow.

475
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,800
Find out for yourself why I'm growing hair, okay?

476
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,860
I'll be there tomorrow.

477
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:28,320
My gosh, Shy. What do I do?

478
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,180
Mutation?

479
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,690
Since it was made specifically for Oh Sang Min’s genes,

480
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,120
it causes abnormal hair growth in other men.

481
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,900
 Shim Gynecology puts the parents and children first. 

482
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,230
 I'll be there throughout pregnancy and childbirth. 

483
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,100
 I'll alleviate the pain and concern in the process... 

484
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,160
   

485
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,550
No... No...

486
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,090
 Our medical professionals... 

487
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,480
I'm going crazy.

488
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,400
 Shim Gynecology provides all kinds of post-natal care. 

489
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:11,270
This was sprayed on my face.

490
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,040
Well, why do you...

491
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,680
have this, Dr. Shim?

492
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,570
You must remember it.

493
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,500
   

494
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:33,230
 When you got drunk last year, you couldn't remember the night before at all. 

495
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,920
 I've always noticed this. I think you have REM sleep disorder. 

496
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,460
 With REM sleep disorder, you act out your dreams unconsciously. 

497
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:47,670
I've had REM sleep disorder since I was a kid.

498
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,810
I apparently act out my dreams unconsciously.

499
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,870
I don't know how you were exposed to Super Teol.

500
00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:00,360
By chance, did I do something terrible?

501
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,600
You're funny.

502
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,480
Have you been carrying this around like this?

503
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,070
Do you think that's important right now?

504
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,060
I can't see patients or anyone in this state.

505
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,680
I'm not interested in permanently removing my sideburn.

506
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,500
I'm sure there's a solution. You're the one who created it.

507
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,610
I expect you to have professional ethics, Ms. Han So Jin.

508
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,600
C-Could you remove the mask?

509
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,860
- Sure. 
 - My gosh!

510
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,870
Could you turn your head?

511
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,050
Can you figure it out by just looking?

512
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,220
Do you mind if I touch it?

513
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,300
If you could figure it out by touching-

514
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,340
Look the other way.

515
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,670
Aren't you examining it right now?

516
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,220
Well, I wanted to see the other sideburn.

517
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,500
I need to compare the existing hair with the new Super Teol hair.

518
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,280
That won't be necessary.

519
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,430
I got you a sample.

520
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
This is the normal hair, and the other is the Super Teol hair.

521
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,510
I included the hair follicle for the test, too.

522
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:44,520
I can't wait to escape from this nightmare, Ms. Han.

523
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,630
Polyphenol. Catechin. Quercitrin.

524
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,360
Biotin. Fish mint. False daisy.

525
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,790
42.3%. 27.6%. 0.3% and 0.2%.

526
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,570
What are you saying?

527
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,870
I'm sorry.

528
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,230
Not only did I barge into your house drunk,

529
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,000
but I also turned you into a hideous hairy man.

530
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,900
"Hideous hairy man"?

531
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,840
What are you, an Elvis impersonator?

532
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,000
"Elvis impersonator"?

533
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,810
Let's give it a try.

534
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,140
I'll be responsible for everything.

535
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,470
I'm so sorry.

536
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,660
I don't need an apology.

537
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:34,470
Unfortunately, your Super Teol happened to work well with my genes.

538
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,590
 Here. Say "ah." 

539
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,250
- What are you doing? 
 - I'm examining you.

540
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,930
- Please relax. 
 - Me?

541
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:58,060
I think you're the nervous one.

542
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,900
Fine.

543
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,190
I'll let you examine me.

544
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,890
- Say "ah." 
 - Ah.

545
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,850
- A little wider. 
 - Ah.

546
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,860
Ah!

547
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,350
Perfect.

548
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,540
Good. There...

549
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,610
Done.

550
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,440
It's your first time, but you're good at it.

551
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,560
- Okay, then— 
 - Hey!

552
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,060
I think that was enough.

553
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,080
Are you warm, by chance?

554
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,980
I can feel warm when a woman gets this close unexpectedly.

555
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,310
I'll just dry this, then.

556
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,010
Why won't it open?

557
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,270
Ms. Han.

558
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,640
Yes?

559
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,090
Find an antidote...

560
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,400
for Super Teol. I'll give you 24 hours.

561
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,300
Let's meet back here at 8 p.m. tomorrow.

562
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,160
If you can't find the solution by then,

563
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,170
I'll make you take responsibility in another way.

564
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,210
Understand?

565
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,760
Another way?

566
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,400
Okay.

567
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,800
Do a genetic testing on Ms. Yoo Yeong Ah and check the rest of her medical history, too.

568
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,590
I need to prepare for her next childbirth.

569
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,640
How am I supposed to make it in a day?

570
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,850
That's like "Mission Impossible."

571
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,440
By chance, is this a revenge?

572
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,460
I don't have the right to say that.

573
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,800
 Polyamory. It's a non-exclusive relationship with multiple partners. 

574
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,370
 Have you considered if you could love multiple people? 

575
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,800
 How's that different from cheating? Is it possible? 

576
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,000
Why would it be impossible? 
    

577
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,590
Are you afraid of sharing your partner by chance?

578
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,790
No, not at all.

579
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,450
It's just one of many relationship styles.

580
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,550
 There's no need to alter yourself 

581
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,710
 and continue the relationship when the man doesn't love you. 

582
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,730
 Isn't adjusting yourself for other people also risky? 

583
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,460
 Yes, that's a dating method, too. 

584
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,260
 But polyamorists share with other people. 

585
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,010
 I'm a polyamorist... 

586
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,690
 Mom, I'm home. 

587
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:17,260
Did you fire all the maids again?

588
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,960
I don't want someone else to care for my home.

589
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,090
I need to clean it with my own hands.

590
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,380
Did you do gardening yourself, too?

591
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,420
No.

592
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,970
I hired a gardener.

593
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,680
Your dad likes flowers, you know.

594
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:43,660
How did you know I was coming and prepared all this?

595
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,600
Mom, should we eat somewhere nice for the first time in a while?

596
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,990
I won't go without your dad.

597
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,510
And...

598
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,150
we don't know when he'd come back. I can't go out.

599
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,280
Let's eat at home, then.

600
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,640
I prepared you a meal. Eat if you're hungry.

601
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,900
I have no appetite.

602
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,940
Okay.

603
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,640
   

604
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,110
 Yun Woo, listen carefully. 

605
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,690
 Dad won't come home starting today. 

606
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,860
 You and I, 

607
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:01,410
 the two of us will live here in this house 

608
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,420
 from now on... 

609
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,050
 You're attracted to some pheromone intensely in a moment, 

610
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,070
 but it might not be a good match for you. 

611
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:17,700
 Pheromones like that get people addicted to each other dangerously 

612
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,000
 and things can end up in tragedy. 

613
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,660
 But if you encounter a pheromone that summons happy memories, 

614
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,240
 sometimes, it stays in your memory forever. 

615
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,330
 Everyone has different fond memories, 

616
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:36,300
 but smell is always a powerful path to memory. 

617
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,150
 Pheromones like that make strong impressions. 

618
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,260
 If you felt a pheromone like that and met that person, 

619
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,900
 it means they're your DNA lover even death can't take away. 

620
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,370
Is today the day?

621
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:58,020
It was yesterday. Mom and Dad's wedding anniversary.

622
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,780
Your parents' is today, right?

623
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,900
How do you remember that? I need to be like you.

624
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,990
It's the day after my parents'.

625
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,450
Did you have a good time with your mother?

626
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,620
You visit your mom twice a year.

627
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,480
On her wedding anniversary and birthday.

628
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,380
You know she lives alone. Why don't you visit her often?

629
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,670
You're her only son. She must feel hurt.

630
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,460
How does that feel?

631
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,080
- What do you mean? 
 - Only looking at one person.

632
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,170
The earth is round.

633
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,910
It's a fact that never changes, just like how the earth is round.

634
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,090
The fact that I love that person…

635
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:50,530
won’t change, even if they or I were to die.

636
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,610
That's kind of scary.

637
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,280
If one changes, the other should, too.

638
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,450
I think not changing is worse than changing.

639
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:03,130
Is that why you keep changing?

640
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,490
- Maybe. 
 - Hyung.

641
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,840
Why don't you just live alone without seeing anyone?

642
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,690
No. I like women.

643
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,210
Gosh, you're so selfish.

644
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,160
I just...

645
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,290
wonder what if she had never met him.

646
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,850
Mom is still waiting for...

647
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,960
my so-called father.

648
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,120
She must think it was fate.

649
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,870
Kang Hoon,

650
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,390
the moment you think it's fate,

651
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,970
everything becomes hellish.

652
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,810
That's what I learned.

653
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,660
Nice.

654
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,040
 If I stay pregnant, I might die 

655
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,910
 and even if Purumi is born, it won't live long, right? 

656
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:25,540
 I don't recommend a decision that will endanger... 

657
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,750
 both you and the baby. 

658
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,270
- Thank you. 
 - Take care.

659
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:42,500
Assistant Director, Ms. Yoo Yeong Ah scheduled the surgery.

660
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,890
Okay.

661
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,610
She looked very torn, by the way.

662
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,750
 By the way... 

663
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,300
 when I was a kid, 

664
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:14,560
 my mom committed suicide, leaving me behind. 

665
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,800
 I blamed her so much, 

666
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,750
 but strangely, 

667
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,330
 I've thought about wanting to die as a kid. 

668
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,960
 But... 

669
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,220
 But... 

670
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,870
 while pregnant with Purumi, 

671
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:39,530
 I've never thought I wanted to die. 

672
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,300
 I wasn't taking a tranquilizer, either. 

673
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,820
 If... 

674
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,410
 Purumi is gone... 

675
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,110
 I'll... 

676
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,570
 Ms. Yoo, in both childbirth and child-rearing, the mother needs to be happy. 

677
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:06,220
 If the mom isn't happy, the child will be unhappy, too. 

678
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:22,900
 If you feel down, 

679
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:28,000
 please call this number instead of writing a suicide note just once, okay? 

680
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,800
   

681
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,870
Are you okay, ma'am?

682
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,220
Approach slowly.

683
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,530
 The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep... 

684
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,220
She's not seriously injured.

685
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:10,100
Her nose is bleeding. Wake up! Are you okay?

686
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,220
   

687
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,110
 To extract DNA from blood, 

688
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:29,930
 spin it in a centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 30 minutes first 

689
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,850
 and separate the buffy coat, which has cytosol. 

690
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,810
 After separating the buffy coat, 

691
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:40,850
 add 500 microliters of lysis solution, vortex, 

692
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:47,500
 and repeat the process until the mixture turns clear at 10,000 rpm. 

693
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,270
 Lastly, add 20 to 50 microliters of the DNA rehydration solution 

694
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:07,970
 and incubate it on a heat block at 56 Celsius for an hour or two. 

695
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:12,160
 And you're finished extracting a person's unique DNA. 

696
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,820
 This is the only thing that can't lie in this world. 

697
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,970
 It shows a person's whole life, including 

698
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:25,760
 how they were born and how they've lived. 

699
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,550
   

700
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,500
   

701
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,290
   

702
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,230
No!

703
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:50,980
   

704
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,910
 The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep... 

705
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,120
   

706
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,340
Ms. Han?

707
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,770
You have one hour until we meet.

708
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:35,270
I'm looking forward to it very much.

709
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,470
H-Hold on.

710
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:41,040
I discovered something important regarding Ms. Yoo.

711
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,020
Ms. Yoo has a dying gene.

712
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,770
Did she display any signs of depression?

713
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:51,060
What do you mean she has a dying gene?

714
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,240
That's a term I came up with.

715
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,020
I... I know someone with that gene.

716
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,860
His grandfather, father, and uncle committed suicide

717
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,710
and he attempted suicide, too.

718
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,120
The dying gene is inherited.

719
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,800
So what if the dying gene is inherited?

720
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,970
Does it guarantee she'll die?

721
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,100
A person with this gene...

722
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,450
can consider suicide in any minor situation.

723
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,160
She can suddenly feel the urge to commit suicide.

724
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,210
 I asked you to check Ms. Yoo's medical records. 

725
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:27,070
Why say something as ridiculous as a dying gene—

726
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:32,980
Assistant Director, there's a patient on the rooftop.

727
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:07,680
Ma'am, just one second. Step away and talk to me.

728
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:13,440
Don't be like that and talk to us... Please...

729
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,070
Hey, hurry. Do something.

730
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,720
- I'll try approaching her. 
 - No.

731
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,290
I'll go.

732
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,870
Ms. Yoo.

733
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:29,540
Ms. Yoo.

734
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,030
I'm Shim Yun Woo.

735
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,070
Let me just say one thing.

736
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,120
Hold on! Hold on!

737
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,140
You're here.

738
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:04,270
North Station, this is the Jungin Rescue Team.

739
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:08,170
We just arrived at the scene, and the rescue subject is standing on the rooftop.

740
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,540
We're installing an air mat and sending rescue officers. Over.

741
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,700
We have to place the air mat according to the subject's position.

742
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,000
We need to empty this area. Call the vehicle owners. Move it!

743
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,680
Is the owner of 4266 there? 4266.

744
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,470
- Should I move the car? 
 - Yes, you need to.

745
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:25,400
I believe Ms. Yoo Yeong Ah doesn't have a guardian.

746
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,250
Ms. Yoo Yeong Ah?

747
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,320
 If you feel bad, please call this number instead of 

748
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,210
 writing a suicide note just once, okay? 

749
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,460
   

750
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,340
 Okay. 

751
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,020
 Thank you. 

752
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,410
   

753
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,300
That call...

754
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,990
I need to save her. I need to save her.

755
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:53,590
Ms. Yoo, do you want Purumi...

756
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,560
to see you like this?

757
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,350
I...

758
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,000
wanted to live for the first time.

759
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:13,170
Because I finally had a family.

760
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,500
I wanted to have the baby.

761
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,990
I wanted to have him!

762
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:26,320
 Only you can make this decision, Ms. Yoo. 

763
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,250
 It's your life, and no one else, including me, can live it for you. 

764
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:34,920
 But I don't recommend a decision 

765
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,340
 that will endanger... 

766
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,850
 both you and the baby. 

767
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,600
I thought you would...

768
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,050
say something different.

769
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,640
"You can have him. It's possible."

770
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:59,520
No matter how dangerous,

771
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,710
couldn't you tell me a miracle exists just once?

772
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,900
Just once...

773
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:14,170
couldn't you tell me that?

774
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:18,200
 In both childbirth and child-rearing, the mother needs to be happy. 

775
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,980
 If she isn't, the child will be unhappy, too. 

776
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:30,530
- I told you that because— 
 - Purumi,

777
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:33,540
I can't have you, apparently.

778
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,260
But I can't abandon you, either.

779
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,100
So, let us...

780
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:45,100
go to a world where we can be happy together.

781
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,500
Purumi!

782
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,510
Purumi.

783
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:57,630
I'll make sure he comes out into this world.

784
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,720
If you need him for you to be happy,

785
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,940
I'll do everything I can.

786
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,950
Give me a chance, please?

787
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,250
Why is the car still here? Did you contact the owner?

788
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:14,190
He's on the way, but it'd take another 10 minutes.

789
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,930
There's no time. Lift the car. Come, everyone!

790
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:19,160
- Let's lift it. Let's lift it. 
 - Let's go!

791
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,100
We'll lift it. One, two, three!

792
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,520
One, two, three!

793
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,390
One, two, three!

794
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:28,860
One, two, three!

795
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,990
Excuse me! Excuse me, I'm sorry!

796
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,510
I will be with...

797
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:42,840
Purumi forever.

798
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,610
I'm not like my mom, who abandoned me.

799
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,050
Are you sure you won't regret this?

800
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,980
Ms. Yoo,

801
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,160
the moment you found out you were pregnant,

802
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:09,420
you fell in love with Purumi.

803
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:16,070
The moment you meet each other can be more precious than your whole life.

804
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,230
 For some people, 

805
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:26,310
 the moment they get to meet might be more precious than anything. 

806
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,970
If the farewell can be delayed even for a day,

807
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:30,990
 If the farewell can be delayed even for a day... 

808
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:33,310
some relationships can endure any sacrifice.

809
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:37,640
 some relationships can endure any sacrifice. 

810
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,350
There's a lot of time you can spend with Purumi.

811
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:44,690
You can hold Purumi, make eye contact,

812
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,560
and hear him crying, too.

813
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:50,360
Are you sure you won't...

814
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,740
regret this decision?

815
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,190
If...

816
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,980
I hold him in my arms and say goodbye...

817
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:09,650
I'd be even sadder.

818
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:16,600
Do you think Purumi thinks that, too?

819
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:25,860
Purumi probably wants to hold your hand, even if it's just one time.

820
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:32,550
You want to give birth despite the danger.

821
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:37,000
If that makes you happy...

822
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,080
Dr. Shim is a capable doctor.

823
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,140
He said he'll do everything he can.

824
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:47,700
Will you give up just like this?

825
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,600
Even if Purumi is born...

826
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,620
If this poor baby...

827
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,930
dies after living just a few days...

828
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:03,980
I understand how you feel.

829
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:06,850
Ms. Yoo, I...

830
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:09,880
I lost a family member.

831
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,930
I know what it's like to lose someone we love.

832
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:24,080
If he can breathe just for a minute, I want to do everything for him,

833
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:29,280
tell him I love him, and I can give up my life for him.

834
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,250
 I know how that feels. 

835
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,670
Purumi is still alive.

836
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:42,950
Let's allow a miracle for Purumi.

837
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,490
So...

838
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:58,470
live.

839
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,020
Both you and Purumi.

840
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,620
Please...

841
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,210
live.

842
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,830
Don't die.

843
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,690
 That moment... 

844
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:29,760
 I noticed that he smelled nice. 

845
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:37,130
 I'm in trouble. 

846
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:41,590
 A nerd got into my lane. 

847
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:55,730
♫  Everyday, would you give me all your heart tonight?  ♫

848
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:58,920
♫  Yeah, I’ll never give up on your love  ♫

849
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,180
♫  In my heart, you’re always with me  ♫

850
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:05,370
♫  Forever, you and I  ♫

851
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:09,520
♫  Just like this fluttering feeling  ♫

852
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:18,150
♫  You’re filling up my heart, your image  ♫

853
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:25,410
♫  Like a small dizziness, you shake me up  ♫

854
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:29,210
   

855
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:33,630
 I've never smelled this from any other DNA lover candidates. 

856
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,980
 It's a sweet and subtle scent. 

857
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:42,960
 I'll steal his scent. 

858
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,960
 No. 7. Where's No. 7? 

859
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,260
 What? 

860
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,500
 Calm down, Han So Jin. 

861
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,450
 This only means I passed the first round. 

862
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:52,410
 What's the next round, then? 

863
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:56,110
 An octopus gene that causes cheating isn't allowed. 

864
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:58,230
 The DNA with the beautiful scent. 

865
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:01,580
 I hope it's not there.
