1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,840
   

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,460
   

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,810
   

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,860
   

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,010
   

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,950
   

7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,540
   

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,540
   

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,540
 It's too late to regret. 

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,140
 I couldn't stop him from leaving without a promise to return. 

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,130
 I couldn't even say goodbye for the last time, and this moment... 

12
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,320
 makes me feel impossibly powerless. 

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,930
 My decision that I believed to be the right answer for a long time 

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,640
 actually was the wrong answer. 

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,990
 I finally realized that after he left. 

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,000
 Thinking now, it might've been fate rather than a simple coincidence. 

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,200
   

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,050
 If there is a designer of our lives like our DNA, 

19
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,190
 some people aren't supposed to meet. 

20
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,500
 Meeting each other would mean curse and death. 

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,210
 That's why I'm leaving. 

22
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,000
 Because I started believing in fate. 

23
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:45,180
   

24
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,100


25
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,820
Noona.

26
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,280
Noona, what's wrong? Are you okay?

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,850
Noona!

28
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,630
Are you awake?

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,310
What happened?

30
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,650
Thankfully, your fever went down a bit.

31
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,270
You were over 38&nbsp;°C earlier.

32
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,580
I think I'm finally feeling the impact of the incident.

33
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,870
I got you medicine. Make sure to take it.

34
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,090
I'll go since you're awake now.

35
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,950
You're leaving?

36
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,590
Thank you, Kang Hoon.

37
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,160
Noona...

38
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,670
I hope you don't hurt so much.

39
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,440
I'll go.

40
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,140
♫  Every empty spot  ♫

41
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,910
♫  Of my heart  ♫

42
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,550
♫  Is colored by you  ♫

43
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,170
♫  Who came to me without words  ♫

44
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,720
♫  The story we will paint together  ♫

45
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,620
 What am I supposed to do? 

46
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,950
♫  Feels so vivid to me  ♫

47
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,650
♫  I wish that this moment, looking at you  ♫

48
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,540
♫  Could last forever  ♫

49
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,040
He should let me know if he arrived safely.

50
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,710
He's so consistent even when he leaves.

51
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,470
He probably arrived safely, right?

52
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,770
I hope so.

53
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,630
Doesn't the hospital feel empty and gloomy without him?

54
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,070
I'm here. Why would it feel gloomy?

55
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,690
Oh, okay.

56
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,440
It was fun to watch him and Dr. Yuh bickering. Too bad.

57
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,570
Come on...

58
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,680
It's kind of boring without him.

59
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,160
But I'm sure he's doing well there.

60
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,040
I'll have a soondae to go, ma'am.

61
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,250
What are you thinking about so intently?

62
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,580
When did you get here?

63
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,370
Are things going well with So Jin?

64
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,330
Yes.

65
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,320
That's good to hear.

66
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,110
Here you go.

67
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,030
I gave you a lot of liver and lungs.

68
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,900
Thank you.

69
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,710
See you later, then.

70
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,020
It's not going well.

71
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,980
Pardon?

72
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,210
I said it's not going well.

73
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,500
Should we grab a drink?

74
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,720
Eating like this isn't bad.

75
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,840
It's kind of romantic, too.

76
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,020
Did you say you come here often?

77
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,260
Yes, it's a place with fond memories.

78
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,450
It's where So Jin and I first met as kids.

79
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,750
Is it okay for me to be here, too?

80
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,240
Yun Woo is gone now.

81
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,750
You just need to make things work with So Jin now.

82
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,640
But you don't look so happy about it.

83
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,860
I know.

84
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,150
Feelings are so strange.

85
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,680
I thought everything would be resolved without Hyung.

86
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,950
But now that it happened,

87
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,870
I no longer feel confident.

88
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,920
I've asked myself for a long time if I could really

89
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,890
make her happy and satisfied.

90
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,590
I've known the answer for a long time,

91
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,000
but I think I've tried to deny it.

92
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,260
How could you be exactly like me?

93
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,470
I was like that, too.

94
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,800
The other person didn't want it but just to feel better,

95
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,880
I forced my feelings on him.

96
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,680
Thinking back, I was so selfish and bad.

97
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,240
That's why I let him go.

98
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,630
I don't know about anything else,

99
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,760
but I think you're wrong about one thing.

100
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,340
- Pardon? 
 - You aren't...

101
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,600
a selfish and bad person, Mi Eun.

102
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,780
I can assure you that.

103
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,870
I didn't know you knew how to say stuff like that.

104
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,540
They say people die if they suddenly change.

105
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,620
Are you sure you aren't sick?

106
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,090
- I'm not. 
 - You must be.

107
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,080
How strange.

108
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,470
What happened to my lungs and liver?

109
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,070
So weird.

110
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,900
I only ate a piece of liver and lungs. Where did it all go?

111
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,650
It wasn't me. I swear it wasn't me.

112
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,080
Are you lying right now?

113
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,430
I-I only ate one. Hold on.

114
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,720
Seriously.

115
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,510
- Where did it go? 
 - Are you kidding me?

116
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,110
It wasn't me. Did I eat it by mistake?

117
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,810
I ate organs. I must've thought it was soondae.

118
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,850
How strange. Why do you keep denying it?

119
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,760
Where did it go?

120
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,280
- Seriously. 
 - I see a piece, Mi Eun.

121
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,240
Father.

122
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,380
This is Anna.

123
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,950
Where did he go?

124
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,450
He has no mass, either.

125
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,150
Father.

126
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,150
Sister Anna, what brings you here?

127
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,420
I was worried you didn't come to the mass.

128
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,340
Have you been here the entire time?

129
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,680
Sister Anna.

130
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,450
Yes, Father.

131
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,040
I said I love God,

132
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,480
but I'm not able to love a person.

133
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,580
God wants me to love people.

134
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,680
I'm not qualified to be a priest.

135
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,160
What do you mean by that?

136
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,520
I knew Yi Myung was unhappy,

137
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,640
but I never extended my hand once.

138
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,200
Yi Myung...

139
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,780
killed his former adoptive family, who abused him,

140
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,860
and while he was in jail for it,

141
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,120
he wrote me dozens of letters.

142
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,200
But...

143
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,330
I never responded once.

144
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,610
I just asked God to...

145
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,730
be responsible for Yi Myung instead.

146
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,000
I turned my back on him.

147
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,890
 Yi Myung. Yi Myung! 

148
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,720
 Yi Myung! 

149
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,080
 Yi Myung! 

150
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,540
 He stole my priest uniform and Bible and kept them, 

151
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,520
 perhaps because he missed me. 

152
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,130
 But I never gave him attention once. 

153
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,370
 If I saw him... 

154
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,030
I thought I'd be consumed by his darkness.

155
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,570
- I was afraid of that— 
 - No.

156
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,240
You love people, Father.

157
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,940
 You came inside the abandoned armoire to save me because 

158
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,250
you cared about me as a person, didn't you?

159
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,920
I was...

160
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,490
comforted by you then, Sister Anna.

161
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,290
As long as I'm a priest,

162
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,430
I won't be able to love anyone.

163
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,050
All done. Let's go.

164
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,710
You can't be obsessed with a winter scarf in summer.

165
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:44,990
You don't believe what I said about the yarn of fate, do you?

166
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,570
I just want to gift it to her.

167
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,680
- You know how she gets cold easily. 
 - Who?

168
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,090
So Jin.

169
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,520
- Kang Hoon, do you— 
 - It's not like that.

170
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,690
I want her to wear this scarf and meet someone nice.

171
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:12,470
She needs to find someone she can never forget, like you did.

172
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,800
How about you?

173
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,960
- Hello. 
 - Ms. Oh, Ms. Oh, you won't believe this.

174
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,540
Do you know what I saw?

175
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,360
Watch this.

176
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,650
 - Hello.  
 - Ta-da!

177
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,620
- Gosh. 
 - Doesn't he look amazing on TV?

178
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,340
He's a celebrity. I'll ask for his autograph later.

179
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,880
Don't be too excited.

180
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,170
- He's introducing himself. 
 - Here we go.

181
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,700
 I'm Gwang Su from 23rd Street of Singlesville. 

182
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,770
 I'm 36 years old. I was born in '88. 

183
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,810
 I live in Gangnam-gu, Seoul. 

184
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:05,130
 I'm an endourologist at Shim Hospital in Cheongdam-dong. 

185
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,720
 I have a job, a car, 

186
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,380
 and I have many friends, too. 

187
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,500
 But there's one thing I don't have. 

188
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,470
 That's... 

189
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,260
 To be honest... 

190
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,720
 I'm sterile. 

191
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,980
 But instead of devoting my money and time to children, 

192
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,100
 I'll fully focus on my wife and myself. 

193
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,440
I'd love to meet a woman who wants to be a DINK couple with me.

194
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,160
Thank you.

195
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,170
What's your ideal type?

196
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:56,670
I like someone who's petite, delicate, and feminine.

197
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,560
I used to, but...

198
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,670
I recently had a relationship that changed my entire life.

199
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,100
It changed me a lot.

200
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,200
 I don't have an ideal type currently. 

201
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,320
Any of you here can become my ideal type.

202
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,640
 What's your hobby? 

203
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,130
 Do you like to exercise? 

204
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,690
 I never did before, 

205
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,790
 but I really enjoy it now. 

206
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:30,400
 I tend to care for myself strictly. 

207
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,720
I want to go to a foot bath spa when I get a girlfriend and...

208
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,250
 I'm embarrassed of my feet. 

209
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,760
 Why? 

210
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,660
 They're the prettiest feet in the world. 

211
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,120
I want to watch a movie at a drive-in theater once a week, too.

212
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,480
 Call me Jung Tam. 

213
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,830
 Don't call me Dr. Yuh. 

214
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,140
 Or call me, "My dear cutie." 

215
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,270
 Even after getting married, 

216
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,680
I'd like to think of each day as a lovey-dovey date.

217
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,840
 I'm actually planning to become a DINK, too. 

218
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,790
 I see. 

219
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,190
It hasn't been that long since we broke up!

220
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,350
Celebrity. Celebrity. Celebrity.

221
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,240
Stand back. Stand back.

222
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,470
Hello.

223
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,300
Dr. Yuh, why do you look so good on TV?

224
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,320
Will you become popular now?

225
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,390
An autograph, please.

226
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,450
I'm not popular.

227
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,950
Why do you look so sad?

228
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,660
Because I'm lonely.

229
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,850
Didn't you find a match?

230
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,830
What is it? I want a spoiler.

231
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,110
Aren't you going to Thailand?

232
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,270
I don't know.

233
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,450
He shouldn't have mentioned he was sterile.

234
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,350
I know. He drives me crazy.

235
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,150
Here's your order.

236
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,250
Thank you.

237
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,620
   

238
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,700
   

239
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,730
Is the project preparation going well?

240
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,690
I'm sorry. I know you're having a hard time already.

241
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,910
It's okay. I need to keep work and life separate.

242
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,880
But I'm worried about the theme.

243
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,440
How about you try to make it work?

244
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,020
A romantic project.

245
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,890
You might as well do it officially.

246
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,610
I'm not so sure.

247
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,370
Excuse me.

248
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,140
   

249
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,420
Hello?

250
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,350
Hey, what's going on?

251
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,590
What?

252
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,140
Okay.

253
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,060
I'll head over right now. Okay.

254
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,980
Team Leader Han, is something wrong?

255
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,500
- What's wrong? 
 - Oh, I— I—

256
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,900
BK... I'll go home early today.

257
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,350
I'll tell you the details tomorrow.

258
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,790
I'm sorry. I'll go.

259
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,440
Okay.

260
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,850
Mom.

261
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,100
Hey.

262
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,400
Why didn't you tell me?

263
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,410
What's the big deal?

264
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,490
You don't have to worry.

265
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,790
It is a big deal.

266
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,000
You should've told me, at least.

267
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,600
- Who else would you talk to but me? 
 - Mi Eun,

268
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,430
death isn't tragic. It's natural.

269
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:11,540
I'm still so happy I'm an artist who's inspired by death.

270
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,110
At least, you need to understand me, okay?

271
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,320
Mom.

272
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,500
What do you mean, understand?

273
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,070
Do I have to hear about you dying from the news?

274
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,850
Mi Eun, I think you should leave now.

275
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,590
Okay, Mom. I'll come back.

276
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,270
And what's with this show?

277
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,180
You barely have time for surgery and go through chemo.

278
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,180
What's this stupid show for, anyway?

279
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,480
You want me to cut out my lungs,

280
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,810
take anticancer drugs, throw up, and pass out.

281
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,570
See how much it spread in my organs,

282
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,390
including bones, eyes, and brain, to what extent,

283
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,930
and die while trembling in fear?

284
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,250
Why do you think about dying first?

285
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,310
Many get surgery, become cancer-free, and live healthy.

286
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,420
I'll get surgery once the show ends.

287
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,790
What if the cancer spreads in the meantime?

288
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,240
It's my disease!

289
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,620
It has nothing to do with you.

290
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,100
What?

291
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,600
If you feel that bad,

292
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,780
have a show in memory of me after I die.

293
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,110
Mom, you really are...

294
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,680
selfish until the end.

295
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,220
Don't you care about So Ri and me?

296
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,910
I can't burden you now after doing nothing for you.

297
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,280
I've been living fighting my fate and nothing else.

298
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,470
My fate ended up bringing me here,

299
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,050
but you don't have to get sucked into it.

300
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:59,850
I won't apologize to you or anyone else.

301
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:07,150
So, don't demand to have a mom all of a sudden

302
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,410
and live well individually.

303
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,870
As you always have.

304
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,990
 Catch me. Catch me. 

305
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,130
 Catch me! 

306
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,130
 Be careful. Catch me! Catch me! 

307
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,800
 - Be careful. Be careful. 
 - I'm going to get you. 

308
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,810
 I'll catch you! 

309
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,900
 I'll catch you! 

310
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,420
 I'm getting close! 

311
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,330
Things went the way you wanted.

312
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,480
So Ri and I aren't weak.

313
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,280
Even if you disappeared from this world,

314
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,950
we'll never crumble.

315
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,560
So,

316
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,790
you should live, too.

317
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,400
Keep fighting the way you have, or do whatever you want.

318
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:58,200
Don't let us see you succumb to your fate.

319
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,030
Mom...

320
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,890
What is this, a tragic drama?

321
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,790
This is so annoying...

322
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,840
When you introduced yourself, you mentioned meeting true love.

323
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,520
- Yes. 
 - Why did you end up breaking up?

324
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,860
Well...

325
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,310
I was confident I could only love her for the rest of my life,

326
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,980
but I guess that wasn't quite enough for her.

327
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,750
To be honest,

328
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,040
just looking at this makes me miss her a lot.

329
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,060
I miss her so much that— I'm going crazy.

330
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,390
   
   

331
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,570
   
   

332
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,590
Look at him crying. Isn't he so funny?

333
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,600
Why does he cry so pitifully?

334
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,740
- Seriously. 
 - My gosh.

335
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,880
Do you find that funny?

336
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,790
Do you find that funny?

337
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,000
Geez, what's her deal?

338
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,700
Why did I come all the way here?

339
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,420
Why did he have to cry on TV?

340
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Oh, no...

341
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,370
Take care.

342
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,580
Hold on. Let's talk—

343
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,350
- Let go. 
 - Let's talk.

344
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,390
Do we have more to talk about?

345
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,000
You must have good news to tell after meeting a fellow DINK.

346
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,130
Did you watch "I'm Single"?

347
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:44,060
No, I don't watch stuff like that because I'm busy.

348
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,690
Take care.

349
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,110
Hold on, hold on!

350
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,130
I didn't go on the show because I wanted to.

351
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,640
A friend of mine is the show's producer.

352
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,130
One of the contestants suddenly canceled on them.

353
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,570
So, he begged me to fill in. I did it against my will.

354
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,370
You don't have to explain to me.

355
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,060
It's because I don't want you to misunderstand me.

356
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,300
I thought about you the entire time I was there.

357
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,560
I wasn't interested in any of the women there.

358
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,180
Did you really not miss me at all?

359
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,850
I missed you a lot, Sung Mi.

360
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,170
I didn't miss you.

361
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,090
Can't you look me in the eyes and say it?

362
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,060
I didn't miss you.

363
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,740
Sung Mi,

364
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,030
I love you.

365
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,550
Why are you doing this?

366
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,640
What do you mean?

367
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,580
Let go of me.

368
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,350
Stay still.

369
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,910
Okay.

370
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,990
   

371
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,410
I don't think I gave up on my faith.

372
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:14,100
I finally destroyed my greenhouse and got free.

373
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,550
I know, Father.

374
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:23,270
This is also your path to God, right?

375
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,350
   

376
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,320
Kang Hoon.

377
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,920
Noona.

378
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:53,680
The night air is nice. Do you want to go somewhere with me?

379
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,420
You know, right?

380
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,460
Whenever my relationships failed,

381
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:06,680
I came here to curse and hate the jerks who hurt me.

382
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,860
But this time,

383
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:14,880
I keep hating myself instead.

384
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,500
I thought Yun Woo...

385
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,740
abandoned me and ran away.

386
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,300
But...

387
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,650
I was the one who ran away.

388
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,030
Because our DNA wasn't compatible,

389
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,850
I ignored my feelings toward him.

390
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:46,260
In case I'd get hurt if we weren't meant to be,

391
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:53,360
I refused to believe Yun Woo's true feelings.

392
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,270
That's why I want to...

393
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,830
finally become brave.

394
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,950
Instead of relying on DNA or fate,

395
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,950
I'll try following...

396
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,180
my heart.

397
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,790
What if Yun Woo never comes back? I mean...

398
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,230
what if he came back but didn't love you anymore?

399
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,750
I'll cry.

400
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,370
I'll cry, struggle,

401
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,640
and overcome it.

402
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,170
Can I...

403
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,360
hug you just once?

404
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:42,180
♫  Every empty spot  ♫

405
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,870
♫  Of my heart  ♫

406
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,540
♫  Is colored by you  ♫

407
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,750
♫  Who came to me without words  ♫

408
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:57,220
I'm free! I'm finally free from Han So Jin!

409
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,040
You go ahead.

410
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,740
Hurry up.

411
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,130
♫  As the days we spend together  ♫

412
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,330
- Bye. 
 - I'll leave, then.

413
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:21,530
♫  I find myself thinking of you endlessly  ♫

414
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,720
♫  The story we will paint together  ♫

415
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,090
♫  Feels so vivid to me ♫

416
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:34,060
♫  I wish that this moment, looking at you  ♫

417
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,130
♫  Could last forever ♫

418
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,910
I chose the perfect time to come.

419
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,220
What brings you here?

420
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,100
Well...

421
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,620
I couldn't sleep and...

422
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,930
I felt lonelier than usual today.

423
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,730
But for some reason, I thought of this place.

424
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:17,360
I thought I might as well check if you were here, too.

425
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,460
But you were actually here.

426
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,180
Looks like we actually have a lot in common.

427
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,700
Have you seen the movie, "Notebook"?

428
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,320
"My name will soon be forgotten,

429
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,600
but I've loved another with all my heart and soul,

430
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,120
and to me, this has always been enough."

431
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,230
You're just like that.

432
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,390
So Jin is so foolish.

433
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,530
How could she reject someone like you?

434
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,950
I suppose you're right.

435
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,370
A part of me is still sore,

436
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,040
but I feel better.

437
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,440
See? I was right, wasn't I?

438
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,740
I hope Noona becomes happy.

439
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,800
She will be.

440
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,310
She's stronger than you think.

441
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,340
Since we were both rejected,

442
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,720
should we drink together?

443
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,660
We can't drink here.

444
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,010
- I'm sorry. Are you okay? 
 - I'm sorry.

445
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,580
Here.

446
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,240
Thank you.

447
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,500
You seem way more thoughtful than I thought.

448
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,730
You carry stuff like this, too.

449
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:02,480
Since So Jin is so clumsy and messy,

450
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,650
I started carrying it around at some point.

451
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,170
But I won't need it anymore.

452
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,820
You never know.

453
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,200
A woman you want to care for might show up again.

454
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,980
Should we get going now?

455
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,240
Do you want to catch a midnight screening?

456
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,230
Let's try changing your mood completely.

457
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,070
At this hour?

458
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,880
You can refresh your mood anytime and anywhere.

459
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,500
Let's get going.

460
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,550
Don't mind me.

461
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,720
Seriously. I said you can't drink here.

462
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,180
   

463
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,280
   

464
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,630
   

465
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:18,240
 These days, I'm finding answers for the hardships I've faced. 

466
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,460
   

467
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,690
   

468
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,140
 There's one question I haven't found the answer to yet. 

469
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,370
   

470
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,760
 Ta-da! Yun Woo, 

471
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,810
 I made your favorite, gopchang tteokbokki. Have a look. 

472
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,610
 Here. What do you think? 

473
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,230
Mom, gopchang tteokbokki has to be spicy.

474
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,540
 What? Really? 

475
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,410
 That's why it wasn't good. 

476
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,190
 But you can't eat spicy food. 

477
00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:00,050
 I'll make you royal tteobkokki with beef and soy sauce when I visit Korea. 

478
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,390
Are you visiting Korea?

479
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,410
 Of course, I have to. 

480
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,930
 You said you were opening a hospital in the countryside. 

481
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,210
 You must be tired. I should take care of you. 

482
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,660
I'm not opening a hospital.

483
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,520
I got hired as a general practitioner.

484
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,850
 What? 

485
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,430
 You got hired? 

486
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,220
 Why? Is it because of your hand? 

487
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,730
No.

488
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,770
I need some time to get used to living here.

489
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,450
See you soon, Mom.

490
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,020
Is it curry today?

491
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,030
The kids would be happy.

492
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,550
Hello.

493
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,120
Thank you.

494
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,600
It's been only a month, but you look better.

495
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,220
Do I?

496
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,970
Being around children makes me happy and gives me so much energy!

497
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:03,790
I feel closer to God, whom I've been searching for, too.

498
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,170
I can definitely tell.

499
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:10,050
This suits you more than the priest's uniform.

500
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,130
I'm envious that you look happier, too.

501
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,320
You're right. I'm happy.

502
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,980
Thank you for doing volunteer work so often.

503
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,720
It's not work.

504
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,140
I come here once a month to be healed, too.

505
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,490
Everyone wants to be happy, after all.

506
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:32,480
Me, the children here,

507
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,860
you, and Yi Myung, too.

508
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,000
No, we need to go inside now.

509
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,410
Let's go.

510
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,720
Oh, come on.

511
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,900
So Jin!

512
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,310
Wha— What took you so long?

513
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,010
Guys, it's Aunt So Jin.

514
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,450
Say hello to her.

515
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,970
Let's go!

516
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,880
Long time no see. Have you been well?

517
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,070
Hold on, hold on. I can't drop this.

518
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,410
- Let me carry that. 
 - Thank you.

519
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,620
- Take your time. 
 - Okay.

520
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,620
Ah Ri.

521
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,670
She's changed. She's changed.

522
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,300
Should we start with Min Jae?

523
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,100
Min Jae, I told you to eat a lot of veggies last time.

524
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,770
- Did you do that for a month? 
 - No.

525
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,830
Why not? You promised me.

526
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:34,350
But there's so much tasty food besides veggies.

527
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,210
I like meat.

528
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:40,140
But still. You promised me. Try to do it this time, okay?

529
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,650
Promise.

530
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,650
Ms. Han, I kept my promise.

531
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,980
I jump roped 100 times every day.

532
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,030
I'll grow a lot taller, right?

533
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,320
Wow, Yoon Soo.

534
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,660
Let's high-five first.

535
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,810
Good job. But you have to keep at it.

536
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,110
- Okay. 
 - Promise.

537
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,600
- Okay, next. 
 - Let's break up.

538
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,970
What?

539
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,560
You said we were meant to be.

540
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,520
How could love change?

541
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,930
Why are you acting like a child?

542
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,240
We both like black beans...

543
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,490
and we both like teddy bears.

544
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:15,250
We like the same colors, and our sign is the same.

545
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,480
You said we were meant to be.

546
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,050
Stuff like that isn't important.

547
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:21,250
There's no such thing as fate, you fool.

548
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,760
What's important, then?

549
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,380
Sincere feelings for each other are important.

550
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,650
Do you still not know that?

551
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,600
And I no longer like black beans.

552
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,830
No way...

553
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,510
Okay. Shall we move on to Ye Ji?

554
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,270
   

555
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,200
   

556
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,200
 The project I've been working on for the past year is called... 
   

557
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,040
Kindness Project.

558
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,350
   

559
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:35,120
In 2023, the discovery of the GPR27 genome, linked to Parkinson's disease

560
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,640
in Korean people, was announced.

561
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,180
Over the past year, our team has been visiting elderly individuals in need,

562
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,670
even those outside the service area, to provide genetic testing

563
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,140
aimed at preventing the disease and offering customized treatment.

564
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,280
Since this project focuses on the elderly,

565
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,840
we'll ensure it can be managed independently.

566
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,870
We also plan to collaborate with welfare centers

567
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:02,900
in each region and provide a mobile service.

568
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,960
Han So Jin switched genres for her projects.

569
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,420
From romance to inspiration.

570
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,000
I like it. Kindness Project.

571
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,280
Our team has been traveling all over the eight provinces because of this.

572
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,690
When will I get my weekends back?

573
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,000
Ah Ri, fighting!

574
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,300
Instead, I'll also join you this time.

575
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,490
I like that, BK.

576
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:32,300
But it's not easy to run tests on the elderly. Be prepared.

577
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:40,390
Are we there yet?

578
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,560
We're almost there. Hang in there.

579
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,630
You can do it.

580
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,430
   

581
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,770
- Wait just a moment, sir. 
 - Okay.

582
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,680
Thank you.

583
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,490
Yes, you're all set.

584
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:05,710
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you so much.

585
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,400
Please have a seat here.

586
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,550
You can have a seat here.

587
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,670
Hello.

588
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,740
I'll give you a cup that looks like a funnel.

589
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,190
Rub the inside of your cheeks with your tongue

590
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:23,840
five times switching sides like this.

591
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,910
Collect a lot of saliva and spit it in here.

592
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,600
Would you like to try it?

593
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,840
Let me give you one.

594
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,870
Here you go.

595
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:41,890
Like this. Make it look like a lollipop.

596
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,840
   

597
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,500
Let me help you in a different way, then.

598
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,730
Say "ah," ma'am.

599
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,040
Ah! Ah!

600
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,660
Oppa!

601
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:05,040
This unni is trying to do something funny to me.

602
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,120
O-Oppa?

603
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,710
I haven't been called that in a while.

604
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,990
Se Mi, if you say, "ah,"

605
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:22,780
this Oppa will give you something tasty.

606
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:26,100
- Get lost. 
 - G-Get lost?

607
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:30,080
I won't take it unless a handsome oppa gives it to me.

608
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,190
Ma'am, you might have a different taste,

609
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,940
but he has a symmetrical bone structure

610
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,830
and his features seem pretty harmonious.

611
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:45,290
Wouldn't you say he's handsome enough?

612
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,540
No.

613
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:53,860
The doctor oppa who gets me tasty food is more handsome.

614
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,410
Is there a doctor who's more handsome than me in this village?

615
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:02,650
You don't think our village doesn't have a hospital?

616
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:07,130
Our hospital has a doctor who's as capable as the ones you have.

617
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:09,890
Yes, of course.

618
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,440
Thank you.

619
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,360
Here's a pen for a gift. Please take it.

620
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,730
Thank you.

621
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,430
Thank you.

622
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,580
Let me try it just once.

623
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,580
Yes, come this way.

624
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,590
Hello.

625
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:52,800
   

626
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,800
Everyone went to the Village Assembly Hall.

627
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,440
That must be why no one's here today.

628
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,650
The DNA researchers from Seoul are here today, apparently.

629
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,150
DNA researchers?

630
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,700
Should we stop by, Doc?

631
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:09,210
More importantly, Mr. Kim Sang Eun hasn't visited for over two weeks.

632
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,890
- We should tell him to come today. 
 - I'm sure he won't come today.

633
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,320
It's his wife's birthday today.

634
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:20,300
Everyone in this neighborhood knows her birthday.

635
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,940
He's been preparing birthday meals for her for 10 years.

636
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:29,910
Then, I should be sneaky and invite myself to that birthday party.

637
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,330
Pardon?

638
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,000
I have no energy.

639
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,700
- Should we eat something when we get to Seoul? 
 - Let's do that.

640
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,120
Is that the handsome doctor?

641
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:50,830
   

642
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,110
 Mr. Kim. 

643
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,810
Mr. Kim.

644
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,780
- Who's this? 
 - It's me.

645
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,320
I came to wish your wife a happy birthday.

646
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,600
- Here's pork belly. 
 - Aigoo.

647
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,830
Thank you.

648
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:27,430
I needed someone to eat seaweed soup, anyway.

649
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,310
You look nice today.

650
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:31,770
Do I? Not bad, right?

651
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,730
Come on in.

652
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,710
It feels like she passed just yesterday.

653
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:42,310
I can't remember how old she's turning this year.

654
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,480
Did you take the medicine I prescribed you?

655
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,690
I didn't take it because it made me feel drowsy.

656
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,750
You still need to take it.

657
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:56,200
You might need to go to a major hospital in Seoul if you get worse.

658
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,280
I'm not going anywhere.

659
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,510
I'm not leaving this place.

660
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:02,530
My wife's name was Hyang Mi.

661
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:05,170
Our village name is Hyangmi-ri.

662
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:07,070
That's why she's Hyang Mi.

663
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:10,790
She lived in Hyangmi-ri with me her whole life.

664
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,920
How could I leave this place?

665
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,980
Let me look at your phone, sir.

666
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,440
Okay.

667
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,870
Take the medicine from now on when this alarm goes off.

668
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,130
Three times a day.

669
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,910
If you don't take it, you'll lose the memory of your wife.

670
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:35,260
That can't be.

671
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,340
I know when I'll be dying.

672
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,920
That'd be the day I forget about Hyang Mi.

673
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,620
Looks like you were a very loving couple.

674
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,730
I'm sensitive and inflexible.

675
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:56,780
But Hyang Mi was like a young adolescent girl.

676
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:02,770
We fought so much every day ever since we were newlyweds.

677
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:06,700
I thought we'd stop fighting as we aged,

678
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,490
but we kept fighting since we were always together.

679
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:13,590
She once stayed with our son in Suwon for years.

680
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,860
We've been talking about splitting all the time.

681
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,070
We've talked about getting divorced out of anger, too.

682
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:25,110
I don't know what's in here,

683
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:30,030
but we kept getting back together whenever we split.

684
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,530
I was almost sick of it.

685
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:38,980
But I finally realized it was because we were meant to be together.

686
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,350
- Mr. Kim. 
 - Yes?

687
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,120
By chance,

688
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,080
did you ever think...

689
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:57,780
things might've been better if you had split?

690
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,420
What?

691
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,900
Never mind. I probably said the wrong thing

692
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,300
being a bachelor and all. I apologize.

693
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,030
Being happy or unhappy isn't important.

694
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:13,390
I had someone to spend every moment together,

695
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:17,000
and that was Hyang Mi. That makes me happy.

696
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,610
- Here. 
 - Okay.

697
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,470
   

698
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,190
Thank you.

699
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:49,020
 I see my favorite star over there sometimes. 

700
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,560
 I learned it was called "Io" later. 

701
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,410
 Io is Jupiter's satellite. 

702
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:57,160
 It was called the Star of Hell because it's the closest star to Jupiter. 

703
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,080
 There are volcanos on one side, 

704
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,450
 and on the other side, where there are no volcanoes, it's 148 °C below zero. 

705
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,150
 One is a ball of fire, and the other is a ball of ice. 

706
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:09,920
 They created hell because they're next to each other? 

707
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:16,570
 But if I were Io, I'd never want to be apart from Jupiter. 

708
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:21,320
 Otherwise, Io will be all alone in an endless space. 

709
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,600
I like being alone.

710
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:30,360
I used to like being alone.

711
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,840
   

712
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,910
Hey, Hyung.

713
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,610
Thank you. Hello.

714
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,880
- Congratulations! 
 - You look so handsome.

715
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,470
Congratulations!

716
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,820
Hello.

717
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,370
- Congratulations! 
 - Thank you.

718
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,750
- Congrats! 
 - Thank you.

719
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,300
Congratulations!

720
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,830
Thank you.

721
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,420
I can't believe this.

722
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,360
- Congratulations! 
 - Thank you.

723
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,010
Thank you. Thank you.

724
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:47,040
Goodness, too bad you have to travel for work today.

725
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,940
The reception will take a while. Why don't you just go tomorrow?

726
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,040
According to the test results,

727
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,780
one of the elders could develop Parkinson's disease.

728
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,760
I thought explaining in person would be better than sending a letter.

729
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,930
I'll be right back.

730
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,650
I suppose you should.

731
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:08,100
It looks like everyone from Shim Hospital is here today.

732
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,060
Not sure.

733
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,220
I assume so.

734
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,030
Will the Assistant Director come?

735
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,790
Stop obsessing over him.

736
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,500
Hello.

737
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,280
I'm Seo Kang Hoon, and I'll be the MC for the wedding.

738
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,600
Before the ceremony starts,

739
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,220
the groom, Yuh Jung Tam, wants to say something to the guests.

740
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,790
I'll relay his message to you.

741
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:49,400
"Today, I'm marrying the DNA lover I was meant to be with.

742
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,910
Someone once told me this.

743
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:55,050
'There's fate in coincidence...

744
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:59,000
and there's DNA that controls fate.'"

745
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,090
 Team Leader Han, is telepathy a real thing? 

746
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,710
 I believe some coincidences were predetermined. 

747
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:14,620
 I'm studying if there are genes that affect the predetermination. 

748
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,350
 Like how you run into someone when you go somewhere randomly? 

749
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,760
 That's just a coincidence. 

750
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,470
 I want to see him. I really want to see him. 

751
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,550
 You send a signal like that. 

752
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:30,140
"The DNA lovers the heaven helps like Sung Mi and me

753
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,640
are bound to meet someday, apparently."

754
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:48,120
"Today, I'll let that come to fruition in front of you today."

Ma'am! Ma'am!

767
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:12,210
- You came, sir. 
 - Hello.

768
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,650
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

769
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:15,220
Have you been well?

770
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,270
Stop doing that.

771
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,020
- Ms. Baek Se Mi. 
 - Thank you.

772
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:26,030
Take a look and contact us with any questions.

773
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,410
Okay.

774
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,000
Shall we visit Mr. Kim Sang Eun now? 
    

775
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:33,520
That old man?

776
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,650
He went to the handsome oppa.

777
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:40,080
The handsome oppa is...

778
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:44,690
It sounds like Mr. Kim went to the hospital.

779
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:51,840
Could you tell me the name of the hospital?

780
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:56,670
I need to deliver this to him today.

781
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,680
Hello, sir.

782
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,710
- You remember me, right? 
 - Of course.

783
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:20,900
You came to do the DNA test last time.

784
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,230
We got the results.

785
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:27,470
According to the results, you might have a—

786
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:30,120
I know my condition.

787
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,480
I can manage it. You can leave.

788
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,510
You know you can't ignore it.

789
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:39,550
It's an incurable disease.

790
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:42,700
No, it will be curable someday.

791
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,460
- So, we're doing research, too— 
 - And if I'm cured?

792
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,820
- Pardon? 
 - What's the point of curing it?

793
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,830
If I'm cured and live a long time,

794
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:53,730
I'd have to wait longer to meet her.

795
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,650
To meet her?

796
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:06,190
Sir, sir.

797
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:10,010
I've waited long enough. It's time I finally meet her.

798
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:11,950
You should leave now.

799
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,250
 Han So Jin. 

800
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:42,920
Are you back from the US?

801
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,090
Yes.

802
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:47,640
When? When did you get back?

803
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,670
It hasn't been long.

804
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:14,280
Did you quit ob/gyn?

805
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,350
I'm still a doctor.

806
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,720
I thought I was very much of a city man,

807
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,710
but it's fun living here.

808
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:26,700
The villagers want to eat with me every day.

809
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,390
So, I never eat alone.

810
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,280
Something went wrong with your hand, didn't it?

811
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:52,810
Are you not able to be a gynecologist or do surgeries because of that?

812
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,320
Come on. I'm all healed.

813
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,740
I'm not completely back to normal,

814
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:05,270
but I'm getting used to new senses

815
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,760
and I even operated surgery recently, too.

816
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,800
It's my fault.

817
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,430
You need to stop doing that.

818
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:20,200
You think everything is your fault.

819
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,650
Did you already forget I put you in danger?

820
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:28,880
But more importantly,

821
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:31,940
I want you to congratulate me.

822
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,650
For what?

823
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:39,380
I really want to be a doctor now.

824
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:43,420
Are you saying you weren't a doctor before?

825
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:45,760
I've always wanted to quit.

826
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:52,540
For the first time in my life, I'm passionate about what I'm doing.

827
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,640
Don't worry about Mr. Kim so much.

828
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,140
I'll make sure to persuade him.

829
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:09,930
When are you going back to Seoul?

830
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:17,650
Ms. Baek had a question regarding the test results.

831
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:21,570
I'll see her son, stay overnight there, and go back.

832
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:30,520
You need to rest before going back to Seoul early tomorrow.

833
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,370
Well, yes.

834
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:35,610
- Well, then... 
 - Yes.

835
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:46,850
I had gone to the airport that day.

836
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,570
I just wanted to tell you that.

837
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:59,520
I'll leave, then.

838
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:04,950
 Thank you to Channel Manager Bepina. 

839
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:10,060

840
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:15,050

841
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:20,070

842
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,090

843
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,610
It's been more than a year.

844
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:38,810
Yun Woo moves on very quickly.

845
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:53,110
   

846
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:56,300
Do you need realistic relationship advice?

847
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,070
We give you relationship advice.

848
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:01,800
"Relationship Advice" starts now.

849
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,540
For the first anniversary of "Relationship Advice,"

850
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:10,240
we're having a live show at the studio.

851
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:15,570
Wow! Thankfully, so many of you joined us.

852
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,940
What is it?

853
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,740
Is someone here your type?

854
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:32,200
We prepared various kinds of segments.

855
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,530
We'll hear your questions first.

856
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:37,820
The man in the back.

857
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,720
I have a question for Ms. Jang.

858
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,350
You're in your 30s now.

859
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:48,360
Will you stay a polyamorist in your 50s and 60s, too?

860
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:57,170
There's a confession I want to make in front of you today.

861
01:07:57,170 --> 01:08:02,010
I'm no longer a polyamorist.

862
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,970
That doesn't mean I'd insist on exclusive relationships.

863
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:11,580
I'm looking for the third kind, which is just for me.

864
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,640
What's important is that...

865
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:18,900
I've realized that if someone can't love

866
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:24,600
one person properly, they can't love multiple people either.

867
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:29,600
I think this is also a part of my growing pain.

868
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:36,780
Yes, please applaud Ms. Jang's brave confession.

869
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,780
Hello.

870
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:49,640
Hello.

871
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,660
Is Dr. Shim Yun Woo here?

872
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:55,710
Dr. Shim? It's his day off today.

873
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:58,180
It's his day off?

874
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:01,970
He goes somewhere once a month.

875
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:04,790
I ask him where he goes, but he just smiles.

876
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:09,760
Would I be able to see him if I waited here?

877
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,070
He won't come back today.

878
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:14,280
He usually stays overnight there.

879
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,110
Is that so?

880
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:21,110
Okay, take care.

881
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,860
Okay, bye.

882
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:34,260
By the way...

883
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:38,140
what's the address of the hospital?

884
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:58,940
 I know there's nothing planned for us, but shall we... 

885
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,140
 start over again? 

886
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:30,520
 The ocean looks warmer than usual today, So Jin. 

887
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,270
   

888
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:39,930
 I wanted to send this postcard for some reason. 

889
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,430
 It will probably return to sender. 

890
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:18,110
So Jin, what brings you here...

891
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:20,040
I...

892
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,350
came to mail a postcard.

893
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,200
To whom?

894
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,800
To you after a year.

895
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,820
What did you write?

896
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:44,820
I said I lost my DNA lover because of you.

897
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:48,780
I'm not telling you to take responsibility.

898
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:50,970
I'm responsible for my decisions.

899
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:52,880
I just...

900
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,990
don't know what will happen in the future

901
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:01,540
and I don't know how we'd change,

902
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,990
but I want to restart...

903
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:08,780
this dangerous relationship.

904
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:13,710
Because it's not the DNA lover I love.

905
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:16,790
I love you, Yun Woo.

906
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:23,230
I love you very much, too, So Jin.

907
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,700
♫  In the beautiful times we had  ♫

908
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,460
♫  We made promises  ♫

909
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:44,110
♫  The dreams of reaching out for each other  ♫

910
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:46,540
♫  And the memories we drew together  ♫

911
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,990
♫  I still remember them  ♫

912
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:52,050
Should we walk to the lighthouse?

913
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:53,580
Shall we?

914
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:56,250
I'll just drop off this postcard.

915
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,750
Okay.

916
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:06,670
 This man might not be my DNA lover. 

917
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:09,500
 No, he probably isn't. 

918
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:12,730
 Because my research was not wrong. 

919
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:16,450
♫  We can be eternal once again  ♫

920

♫  You and I  ♫

921
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:25,840
♫  Like flowers that bloom and wither (Yeah, yeah)  ♫

922
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:31,750
♫  Like the burning sunset that someday fades away  ♫

923
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,750
♫  It will fade away eventually  ♫

924
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,240
♫  It's alright  ♫

925
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:41,980
 For that reason, we might get hurt, injured, and be uncomfortable. 

926
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:46,180
 But we decided to give it another shot. 

927
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:48,800
 Instead of DNA or fate, 

928
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,850
 we'll give love a chance. 

929
01:13:53,900 --> 01:14:00,800
 Therefore, I'm dismissing my DNA lover theory today. 

930
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,690
   

931
