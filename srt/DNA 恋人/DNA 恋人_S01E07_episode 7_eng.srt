00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,170
Looks like it.

 Eleven unrequited loves, nine love confessions,

 and seven devastating breakups. 

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,910
Look at this.

25
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,210
 And today... 

26
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,310
 I... 

27
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,610
 found my DNA lover. 

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,530
I'm sorry. They're full, and there's a long wait.

29
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,190
Their paella is good. I wanted you to try it with me.

30
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,160
Really? It's okay.

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,080
- Let's come back next time. 
 - Okay.

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,220
Do you want to try my go-to spot tonight?

33
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,640
They're so hip right now.

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,320
Wow, they're as hip as you said. Look at this line.

35
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,580
- Yun Woo. 
 - Yes?

36
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,500
Get us a table now.

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,070
- What? 
 - Hurry. Get a table.

38
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,830
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,680
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,140
Ta-da!

41
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,460
It's not restaurant quality, but give it a try.

42
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,300
- It's tasty. 
 - Right? It's not bad, right?

43
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,300
I told you.

44
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,350
You must come here often. I could tell you've done this many times.

45
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,880
Well, I come often. You know the days when you go,

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,820
"Am I the only one who struggles with life?"

47
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,830
That's when I come here.

48
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,780
I think it's too humble of a place for that.

49
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,550
This is a hip place for a different reason.

50
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,730
They get the best customers.

51
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,280
Last time, a bunch of kids came to feed a stray cat.

52
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,210
They were clamoring together,

53
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,560
and I found them so cute.

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,630
Seeing stuff like that makes me smile and...

55
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,410
it makes me stop worrying, too.

56
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,820
What do you think?

57
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,720
Isn't it a pretty cost-effective healing method?

58
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,610
You're right.

59
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,250
How about you?

60
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,100
Is there a healing spot you visit

61
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,620
whenever you feel stressed or sad?

62
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,600
Healing spot?

63
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,000
I think I need to think about it.

64
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,060
Shouldn't you have room to breathe, at least?

65
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,870
Let me know when you think of it later.

66
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,400
I introduced you to a new hip spot

67
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,520
and taught you how to heal, too. I gave you too much.

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,900
Treat me to tasty food next time, okay?

69
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,570
 Saffron. A gem of Persia. 

70
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,300
 You dry 500 flowers to get a gram of this spice. 

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,450
 A scent that fills the entire house with just a few strands. 

72
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,930
 It's also anti-inflammatory and antibiotic, and it regulates blood pressure. 

73
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,390
 It's perfect for calming the stomach after eating 

74
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,670
 instant food at the convenience store. 

75
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,590
 Looks like So Jin likes junk food. 

76
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,640
 I've never seen her eating healthy food. 

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,130
 I should teach her how important food is. 

78
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,250
 A man with pheromone from the heaven's garden. 

79
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,050
 He has a healer gene that will save me 

80
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,830
 from the dying gene. 

81
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,620
 He showed up in front of me regardless of 

82
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,330
 all the telepathic interference. 

83
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,290
My DNA lover.

84
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,420
I should pace myself because I'll love him for the rest of my life.

85
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,890
Take it so slowly...

86
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,670
   

87
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,720
What were you up to?

88
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,570
Me? Well...

89
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,860
It's a secret.

90
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,340
Should we meet tomorrow, too?

91
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,970
We've only been apart for an hour. Already?

92
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,700
 I need to slow down and savor it. 

93
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,490
How about we meet on the weekend instead?

94
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,790
I have an appointment this Saturday.

95
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,810
Let's go get something tasty after work tomorrow.

96
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,090
There's a very good Bulgarian restaurant run by a Bulgarian chef.

97
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,140
I'll make a reservation.

98
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,200
Bulgarian food? I've never tried it before.

99
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,770
 Send me the address. I'll meet you there. 

100
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,450
Good night, Yun Woo.

101
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,620
Are you two dating?

102
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,010
We can't date immediately. We need to flirt first.

103
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,840
What if the flirting goes nowhere?

104
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,480
They call living together and breaking up flirting these days.

105
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,220
Really?

106
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,150
Should I just tell him tomorrow is our first day as a couple, then?

107
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,000
Can't do.

108
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,240
   

109
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,340
- Hello, ma'am. 
 - Would you like soondae?

110
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,320
Yes. A lot of liver and intestines and fewer soondae, please.

111
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,280
Thank you.

112
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,920
Hello. I'll have tteokbokki and soondae to go.

113
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,400
I'll skip the liver and intestines.

114
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,200
Why doesn't he eat this tasty stuff?

115
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,590
Looks like you get all of your meals here.

116
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,460
Try it. Once you try it, you won't go back.

117
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,040
I hate liver.

118
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,770
I hate the liver-eating people, too.

119
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,070
Was that a joke just now?

120
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,710
How funny.

121
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,290
I'll treat you today because you paid last time.

122
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,980
Here you go.

123
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,760
If you don't like liver, do you not like foie gras, either?

124
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,510
I love that stuff.

125
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,430
I read an article about it. Isn't it animal abuse?

126
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,350
Eating liver fat spikes the cholesterol level. You should stop.

127
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,080
Thank you.

128
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,190
You can eat goose liver because they're free-range these days.

129
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,940
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

130
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,620
Kang Hoon, you're missing out on great pleasure if you don't eat foie gras!

131
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,270
What a shame!

132
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,280
He's cute.

133
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,760
Excuse me.

134
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,630
I don't think we've met. Who are you?

135
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,670
Just ignore it.

136
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,640
Today's a special day for me.

137
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,270
I haven't seen you like this in five years.

138
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,270
What's he like?

139
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,850
He's my other half.

140
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,900
Other half?

141
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,920
I'll get going now.

142
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,120
I have a bad feeling for some reason.

143
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,660
Are you okay?

144
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,840
Yes, I'm okay.

145
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,560
I'm not hurt.

146
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,980
Did you call me?

147
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,570
I pressed it by mistake.

148
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,710
I see.

149
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,710
Michael, have you been well?

150
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,240
I'm always the same, you know.

151
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,720
By the way, I don't think I've seen her before.

152
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,850
This is the chef from Bulgaria.

153
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,950
The way he cooks is very Korean.

154
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm looking forward to it.

155
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,990
Thank you.

156
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,830
Their signature dish is...

157
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,620
Long time no see, Michael.

158
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,330
Your usual company, Yun Woo, is over there.

159
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,400
Really?

160
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,850
He already took the window-side table I like.

161
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,410
Should we go somewhere else?

162
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,850
I know a place with a nice window-side spot.

163
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,950
No.

164
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,070
Let's take the table next to it.

165
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,670
Okay.

166
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,510
- Let's see... 
 - Yun Woo.

167
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,430
When did you get here?

168
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,660
Just now. Hello, So Jin.

169
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,740
Oh, this isâ€”

170
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,360
Nice to meet you. I'm Cha Yoo Ram.

171
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,030
Hello.

172
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,750
Nice to meet you, I'm Shim Yun Woo.

173
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,330
This is Han So Jin.

174
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,030
Looks like you haven't ordered yet.

175
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,700
Would you like to join us?

176
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,760
This is an important dinner. I'm sorry.

177
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,210
I think you should enjoy your time together.

178
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,730
Don't worry about us. We'll eat over there.

179
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,240
Okay.

180
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,360
Why don't we just...

181
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,090
How about we let them join us, Yun Woo?

182
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,340
I've wanted to talk with Mi Eun, too.

183
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,150
- With me? 
 - Yes.

184
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,950
I've seen you on Yoo Myung Hui's social media.

185
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,980
Do you know Ms. Yoo? How?

186
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,630
I'm her daughter.

187
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,420
I'm not her social daughter, but a biological one.

188
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,440
I've always wanted to meet you.

189
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,000
I didn't know you were her daughter.

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,650
What a funny coincidence this is.

191
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,300
I know.

192
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,400
Yun Woo, they can join us, right?

193
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,230
Okay, then. Have a seat.

194
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,580
Do you like the food, So Jin?

195
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,730
Yes, the chef is so talented, as Yun Woo said. It's delicious.

196
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,420
I'm glad to hear that.

197
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,890
I used to come here often with Yun Woo.

198
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,800
He's pickier with food than he seems.

199
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,670
I'm not at all.

200
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,360
Try this, too, So Jin.

201
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,980
Looks like you don't like it so much.

202
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,790
Pardon?

203
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,170
I like it.

204
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,430
 Why are they so similar? 

205
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,880
 What are they, soulmates or something? 

206
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,740
 Do they like the pork sirloin that much? 

207
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,150
 It's just salty and fatty. 

208
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,490
Are you two dating, by the way?

209
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,630
- Pardon? 
 - Well...

210
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,180
We're getting to know each other.

211
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,080
We interrupted you while you were getting to know each other.

212
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,320
You ordered this wine.

213
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,530
- Do you remember? 
 - You mean, Brussels?

214
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,060
So Jin, you should visit Belgium sometime.

215
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,710
So you've been to Belgium together, just the two of you?

216
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,000
No, with the travel club.

217
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,160
So that's you.

218
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,820
The club member with the same tastes and aesthetics

219
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,350
as if they're twins.

220
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,170
You agree on everything because you share similar values.

221
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,760
You broke up, but you still have romantic feelings for each other.

222
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,070
I read it in your book.

223
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,800
You broke up twice in three years,

224
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,420
but you got back together three times.

225
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,110
- Cha Yoo Ram. 
 - Let him be. He must like you a lot.

226
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,190
Stop pretending to be courteous.

227
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,630
Noona, I can't continue this abnormal relationship.

228
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,610
I'll leave now.

229
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,130
This isn't why we joined you.

230
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,260
I apologize for this, So Jin.

231
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,050
I'm sorry, Yun Woo.

232
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,860
I'll get going now.

233
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,660
Let's eat.

234
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,920
 Try this, too, So Jin. It's tasty. 

235
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,690
Does he force his taste on her?

236
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,890
Yun Woo does that?

237
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,190
He has the promiscuous Octo-gene.

238
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,600
How did he date Jang Mi Eun for three years?

239
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,390
Can't you read the air?

240
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,180
You're talking to yourself again.

241
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,400
Why don't you just go inside?

242
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,820
Hello.

243
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,380
Come on.

244
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,610
You don't drink this beer. Why are you copying me?

245
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,860
I got into it because of you.

246
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,480
Hey! Ham with tuna and mayo is my favorite one.

247
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,870
I grew up on ham with tuna and mayo, okay?

248
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,980
You'd better give up.

249
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,190
 So Jin, you should visit Belgium sometime. 

250
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,940
Seriously, it's bothering me so much.

251
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,260
What is?

252
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,540
You know, Yun Woo...

253
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,410
has an ex-girlfriend who's really similar to him.

254
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,750
Jang Mi Eun?

255
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,610
Yes. Huh?

256
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,620
What? How do you know Mi Eun?

257
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,510
I got to know her somehow.

258
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:02,260
What kind of relationship do you think they have?

259
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,720
Well, I'm not sure.

260
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,280
I'm not interested in other people's relationships.

261
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,690
Huh?

262
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,050
Why are you so interested in my relationships, then?

263
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,700
You aren't just anyone, okay?

264
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,390
So, what's wrong?

265
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,230
Why are you bothered by Mi Eun?

266
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,990
I thought she was just an ex-girlfriend.

267
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,070
We had a meal together today by chance.

268
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:32,560
With Yun Woo, Mi Eun, and Mi Eun's boyfâ€”

269
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,230
No.

270
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,940
Should I say her ex-boyfriend?

271
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,830
What a strange group. Were you able to eat at all?

272
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,190
Well, you could say they're just friends.

273
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,530
Maybe I don't have to worry.

274
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,690
Gosh, why are you acting so unusually cool?

275
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,240
Once you break up with someone, you burn everything related to him.

276
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,950
It's because I had bad breakups.

277
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,570
Whether it was a good or bad breakup,

278
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,930
men and women shouldn't see each other again once they break up.

279
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,590
It's not hard to get back together with your ex.

280
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,100
There are people like you...

281
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,360
and there are people like Yun Woo, too, I guess.

282
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,330
I think those two could never break up.

283
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,250
Why are you so sure about it?

284
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,950
Can't you tell how similar they are?

285
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,170
They're the same breed. Yun Woo and Jang Mi Eun.

286
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,080
 They notice and feel the same things. 

287
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,330
Encountering my fate and...

288
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:01,060
taking charge of fate are different things.

289
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,550
You mean, Yun Woo is your man of fate?

290
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,080
After many tests, the result says he's my DNA lover.

291
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,770
- Let's go now. 
 - You go ahead.

292
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,530
I'll go home with Ah Ri when she's back from the mass.

293
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:45,840
â™ª  Strengthen for service, Lord  â™ª

294
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:54,830
â™ª  The hands that holy things have taken  â™ª

295
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:03,370
â™ª  Let ears that now have heard thy songs  â™ª

296
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:16,800
â™ª  To clamor never waken  â™ª

297
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,170
Should we call it a night, brothers and sisters?

298
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,680
Father, I heard Anna brought us dinner tonight.

299
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,400
It's tasty.

300
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,820
You're such an amazing cook.

301
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,770
It's so tasty. What kind of veggie is this?

302
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,340
It's so tasty. I love the gimbap, too.

303
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,820
Thank you.

304
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,880
So tasty.

305
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,980
Thank you for the meal, Anna.

306
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,040
I love anything with water celery in it.

307
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,400
R-Really? Me, too.

308
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,390
You and I have similar tastes in food.

309
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,070
Sorry?

310
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,360
Well, on your tooth...

311
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,520
   

312
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,710
I was waiting for you at the park. When did you get home?

313
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,860
You usually come home through the park.

314
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,760
I took a different route tonight.

315
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,570
You could kill someone with this tteokbokki.

316
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,090
I have an appetite even when I want to die.

317
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,230
It gives me a reason to live.

318
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,490
Who puts water celery in tteokbokki?

319
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,620
Water celery is good with anything.

320
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,190
Father Andrea likes anything with water celery, just like I do.

321
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,210
They say the appetite makes a person.

322
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:28,820
For the first time, I thought maybe he had something in common with me.

323
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,040
You must be happy because you're similar to him.

324
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,940
Huh?

325
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,180
   

326
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,930
   

327
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,990
   

328
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,590
   

329
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,890
If the K in this book is Yeon Woo...

330
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,410
they spent three years together and...

331
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,240
they broke up twice during that time.

332
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,550
They date, break up, date again, and break up again.

333
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,850
Why did they break up?

334
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,820
I mean, why couldn't they break up? Why?

335
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,280
The hundreds of allogeneic bacteria in their guts

336
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,030
might be pulling each other like magnets.

337
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,410
They might have a similar diet.

338
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,000
You're right, Ah Ri. They like the same food.

339
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,930
It's a so-called matching allogeneic bacteria.

340
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,170
Matching?

341
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,460
It's my current research subject.

342
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,480
If you have similar tastes in food, you both develop allogeneic bacteria.

343
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,310
The allogeneic bacteria change the potency of sex pheromones

344
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:55,750
and the two can become sexually attracted to each other.

345
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,990
I know that theory. In the fruit fly mating test,

346
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:08,340
the male fruit fly was attracted to the female with similar bacteria.

347
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,690
Maybe it's not the humans who fall in love.

348
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,560
Maybe it's the allogeneic bacteria in our guts.

349
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,240
If you match, you're attracted to each other.

350
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,620
I suppose. If the microbes that connect the gut and brain are allogeneic,

351
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,470
it'd make you feel positive toward the other.

352
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,550
Three years.

353
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,460
They were attracted to each other because they ate similar food.

354
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,770
That's why they got back together after breaking up.

355
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,260
Then, they don't just have the same taste in food.

356
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,040
Did their moods, personalities, tastes, and thoughts become similar, too?

357
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,170
That much?

358
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,190
It's not fair.

359
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,440
They must've eaten the same food at least five meals a week for three years.

360
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,490
They could've been similar since they were babies.

361
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,500
This is no good.

362
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,260
I'll make him eat the same food from now on.

363
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,990
Three meals a day. No, even just one meal a day.

364
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,160
Would that be possible?

365
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,890
Where there is a will, there is a way.

366
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,030
Nothing is impossible to me, Han So Jin.

367
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:25,640
I'll make sure we have more matching allogeneic bacteria!

368
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,970
Ms. Nam!

369
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,040
- Whoa, s-sorry... 
 - D-Dr. Yuh.

370
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,660
I can't believe we ran into each other again.

371
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,250
- It's true, but- 
 - I heard running at dawn is good for you.

372
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,820
I thought I should give it a try, too.

373
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,530
It's six in the morning right now.

374
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:05,350
It's a coincidence we met on this path at this hour?

375
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,570
To be honest, Coach told me about your workout schedule.

376
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:16,240
I-I swear I'm not a stalker! Well...

377
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,230
I wanted to do the same thing as you...

378
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,240
every day?

379
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,440
I'll get going now!

380
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,820
Dr. Yuh.

381
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,480
You'll get sick if you overdo it on the first day.

382
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,550
It's not that. I'm late because I had to install the bicycle app.

383
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,020
Wait here for a moment.

384
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,180
I just sprinted for one kilometer here.

385
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,400
I'll be back in a moment.

386
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,950
Let's go together on the way back.

387
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,430
Let's.

388
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,010
Nam Sung Mi, fighting!

389
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,580
   

390
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,760
You always chug Coke whenever you have a worry.

391
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,740
What are you worried about?

392
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,640
The thing is...

393
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,900
I don't think it was an accident.

394
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,270
You mean, the apartment fire case?

395
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,620
The cause was unknown.

396
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,240
It wasn't a gas explosion or short circuit.

397
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,380
It's weird the leaves didn't burn, too.

398
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,930
Do you think the police are fools?

399
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,490
They called it an accident for a reason.

400
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,960
Oh, right.

401
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,100
There's a man I run into every day these days.

402
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,110
But it's strange.

403
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:27,700
When I saw him today, this part...

404
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,630
I mean, this part felt all itchy.

405
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,730
And all I'm doing is thinking about him, and my mouth is dry.

406
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,450
And my eyes feel warm for some reason.

407
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,950
Who's that man, anyway?

408
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,810
You won't know. He's...

409
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,000
very different from me.

410
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,800
I see.

411
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,760
What are you looking at?

412
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,000
  Â­ 

413
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,980
I heard she had a lot of family to support,

414
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,920
but the chief mourner is her hostess friend.

415
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,870
How did you know about this?

416
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,980
Of course, I should know.

417
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,660
This concerns my husband.

418
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,550
  Â­ 

419
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,790
Ga Hui and I went to the church only once.

420
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,530
Thank you for coming.

421
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,970
By the way, can she go to heaven?

422
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,920
Death ends the sin and allows resurrection.

423
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,000
 Tonight's dinner. 

424
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,940
 How does a ramen with the shiitake broth with miso sound? 

425
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,820
 I found a good restaurant for it. 

426
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,820
I'm telling you. Ms. Ha was Director Shim's mistress.

427
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,020
They apparently met at a hostess bar.

428
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,310
Didn't you see her last time?

429
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,360
She was wearing designer clothes from head to toe.

430
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,090
He got her a foreign car and an apartment in Gangnam.

431
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,580
I heard it was crazy.

432
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,760
But still, how could she burn to death?

433
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,800
She was punished by God.

434
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,070
And I heard she was pregnant with the Director's baby, too.

435
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:29,060
She seduced him to become the director's wife.

436
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,050
- What a bitch. 
 - Hey!

437
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,410
There are other patients here. Watch your mouth.

438
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,750
Okay.

439
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,870
You came.

440
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,560
Would you like some tea or something?

441
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,900
Let's talk for a moment.

442
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,710
Ga Hui and my child died.

443
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,450
Looks like you knew.

444
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,470
Did Mom tell you?

445
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:40,390
Your mom was at Ga Hui's funeral.

446
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,720
But she looked too happy. It's strange.

447
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,850
So?

448
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,770
I met with her psychiatrist, Dr. Kim.

449
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:03,310
She apparently went off her meds recently.

450
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,450
Ga Hui wasn't supposed to die like that. It's impossible.

451
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,170
I thought it was an accident.

452
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:18,820
Believing I'd never leave the mother of my child,

453
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,120
your mom has been waiting for me all this time.

454
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,320
If she finds out Ga Hui had my child,

455
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,410
she would've done anything.

456
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,130
Not only you caused her pain her whole life,

457
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,040
you're blaming her for murder now?

458
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,320
Your younger sibling died. Do you not care at all?

459
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,610
Even if it wasn't for that,

460
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,190
your patient and her fetus died!

461
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,000
Do you really deserve to be an obstetrician?

462
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,000
It's so funny...

463
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,550
to be told that...

464
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,270
by you, Director.

465
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,690
- What? 
 - Do you really deserve to be the director

466
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,930
and someone's husband?

467
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,480
Think carefully about that...

468
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,940
and tell me if I deserve to be something.

469
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,980
It's really disgusting and uncomfortable to hear.

470
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,040
Did you find out anything?

471
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,700
 The Madam was treated at the Irowoon DNA Center and went home just now. 

472
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,860
Keep watching her.

473
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,010
- Yes. 
 - Ms. Joo Min Ah has a risk of placenta accreta.

474
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,440
Her uterus might have to be removed if it bursts.

475
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,270
I'd like you to be there during the delivery.

476
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,860
Okay, I'll be right there.

477
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,850
 So Jin, an emergency surgery was just scheduled. 

478
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:30,600
 I'm sorry, let's eat the miso ramen some other time. 

479
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,990
Operation Matching Allogeneic Bacteria.

480
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,670
We're off to a bad start.

481
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,770
 It's finally the time. 

482
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,770
 We waited a year for this day. 

483
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:54,770
 Enjoy the in-season Cheonbuk oysters in eight different ways. 

484
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,980
 The weather is getting cold. It's the peak season right now. 

485
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,580
 The owner prepared Cheonbuk oysters for 30 years in Boryung. 

486
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,490
 I'm curious how they taste. 

487
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,920
You don't like oysters, So Jin.

488
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,140
I know. Why does it look so good?

489
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,230
I ordered stuff because of this show countless times.

490
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,390
I make impulsive purchases seeing them eating like that.

491
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,750
Yes.

492
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,230
That is what I should do.

493
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,200
What?

494
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,610
 Â­  

495
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,350
 Â­  

496
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,390
Ahjussi, just once, please.

497
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,820
- Please help me just once. 
 - It's not even sushi.

498
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,530
Why would you do that at my restaurant?

499
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:46,050
Because the hardwood fixtures and lighting at the bar are so elegant,

500
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,840
my appetite piques whenever I come here.

501
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,460
And the "Together Forever" sign.

502
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,330
It's so memorable.

503
00:40:54,330 --> 00:41:00,710
Like it's the kind of food you want to share with the one you want to be with.

504
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,900
Okay, fine.

505
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,260
Only for the three days I'll be gone fishing.

506
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,950
Clean up nicely after you're done.

507
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,120
Of course I will!

508
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,080
By the way, Ahjussi, while you're at it...

509
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,800
could you lend me that, too?

510
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,400
"That"? The chef's cap?

511
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,640
No, this is mine.

512
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,000
Just once. Just once.

513
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,210
You can use the new one, then.

514
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,460
You should use the new one.

515
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,900
There.

516
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,520
- How do I look? 
 - Looks good. You look like a chef.

517
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,540
Yay!

518
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,370
   

519
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:00,080
 Yun Woo, did the surgery go well? 

520
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,380
 You haven't had dinner yet, have you? 

521
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,140
 No. I'm sorry I couldn't make it today. 

522
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,670
 Let's have dinner together tomorrow instead... 

523
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:12,890
Welcome to Han So Jin's "Three Meals Per Day."

524
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:19,300
Whenever I crave Italian food after working overtime,

525
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,430
I eat spaghetti under a cozy cheese blanket.

526
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:29,290
The dish I'll be preparing today is Jackson Spaghetti.

527
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,880
 The secret recipe that was 

528
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,430
 No. 1 dish in the Convenience Store Michelin Guide. 
   

529
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:39,020
You can get all of these ingredients at a convenience store

530
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,030
that's three minutes from your home.

531
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,120
I'll get started now, then.

532
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,670
Pour water into the spaghetti.

533
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,180
Cover it like this.

534
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,380
Prepare the tteokbokki while the noodles are cooking, too.

535
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,990
I'll microwave the tteokbokki for three minutes.

536
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,090
Okay. What will we do while we wait for three minutes?

537
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:07,150
I'll prepare the ingredients.

538
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:11,090
You just need to mix these ingredients together.

539
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:21,040
I'm sure Dr. Shim would be salivating by now.

540
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,260
Only the ones who tried it understand.

541
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,810
Here comes the exciting world of flavors.

542
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,090
I'll put the cheese on top.

543
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:37,240
These colors and smell.

544
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:42,620
- Cheese? 
 - Did you see the cheese, Yun Woo?

545
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,810
 Let me try some. 

546
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,990
I'm here, Fatherâ€”

547
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,650
What's this?

548
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,530
It's so tasty.

549
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:04,640
Mr. Shim, I know you crave carbs after surgery.

550
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,390
Hyung, there's something else I'm craving right now.

551
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,150
What is it?

552
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:35,330
The mukbang continues tomorrow evening.

553
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,980
See you tomorrow, Dr. Shim. Bye.

554
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,270
Bye.

555
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,310
My goodness.

556
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,280
But this isn't Team Leader Han's spaghetti.

557
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,990
I might as well eat properly.

558
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,690
Isn't it good?

559
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,120
Why are you doing this?

560
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,480
You won't know.

561
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,400
It's a new strategy I'm pushing these days.

562
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:04,450
I wonder if Yun Woo followed my instructions.

563
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,720
Did you finish all that?

564
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,670
By the way, you and I have similar tastes in food.

565
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,210
We were like that as kids, too. We always fought over food.

566
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:28,570
I suppose we were both crazy about old kimchi and pollack stew. And salmon, too.

567
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,340
Right.

568
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,600
What is it now?

569
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,990
You and I must share a ton of matching allogeneic bacteria.

570
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:42,180
Matching... Allo... What?

571
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,240
Whenever you see me, your heart doesn't throb,

572
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,060
but your stomach does, doesn't it?

573
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,990
Doesn't your stomach throb? Throb, throb...

574
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:55,950
Cut the nonsense.

575
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,970
And what's this now?

576
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,020
Why are you wearing my father's hat? Huh?

577
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,190
No, you can't.

578
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,530
Don't do it. You're dead. Stop.

579
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,500
Put it back.

580
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,720
Why? This suits you more.

581
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,800
- Do it while I ask nicely. 
 - You look so pretty right now.

582
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,700
- One... 
 - I'm serious.

583
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,870
- Two! 
 - Okay.

584
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,530
- What are you looking at? 
 - Huh?

585
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,230
The thing is...

586
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:50,120
What? Do you think I look like a chef, too?

587
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,830
You look pretty.

588
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,000
Come on. You need to say stuff like that louder.

589
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,920
Say that I'm pretty again.

590
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,800
I knew you were eating too fast.

591
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,600
Drink. Go ahead and drink.

592
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,890
You're too old for this.

593
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,480
Gosh! Why did you eat so fast?

594
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,150
â™«  When love comes, worries follow  â™«

595
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:28,420
â™«  When separation comes, tears fall  â™«

596
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,750
 Whenever you see me, your heart doesn't throb, 

597
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,440
 but your stomach does, doesn't it? 

598
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,650
You're crazy. You're crazy.

599
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,530
Yes, let's run.

600
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:00,370
Run. Run, run.

601
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,350
Yun Woo, what did you eat last night?

602
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,360
Of course, I had the cheese spaghetti.

603
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,070
 How could I eat something else after a mukbang like that? 

604
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,780
By the way, it's hard to torture someone with food.

605
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,980
Where did you learn that?

606
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,910
Really? What a relief.

607
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:22,270
What's a relief?

608
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:25,900
Well, it's a relief you enjoyed it.

609
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,830
Anyway, never mind.

610
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:30,210
 For the dinner tonight... 

611
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,200
I'm so sorry, So Jin. I'll call you back in a moment.

612
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:40,680
I knew it.

613
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,880
How could you not eat the same thing

614
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,680
after watching my mukbang?

615
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,020
We must've developed thousands of allogeneic bacteria yesterday.

616
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,460
Just wait.

617
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:56,820
I'll fill your stomach with my allogeneic bacteria.

618
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:04,950
   

619
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:46,470
How does gomtang sound for dinner tonight?

620
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,750
   

621
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:52,890
Gomtang and dumplings, too.

622
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:58,040
Whenever I feel chilly, I eat gomtang

623
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,710
and feel warm immediately.

624
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,810
Should we try the satisfying bone broth?

625
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,240
You eat a lot. Why didn't you grow taller?

626
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,430
   

627
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,670
Today's dish is... Ta-da!

628
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:34,570
Super simple convenience store french fries with cheese.

629
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:37,170
Put them in the bowl like this.

630
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:38,660
Okay.

631
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,310
 Doesn't it look so tasty? 

632
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,500
Gosh, I'm hungry.

633
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,130
   

634
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:57,840
   

635
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,140
   

636
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,310
It's sticky.

637
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:14,150
Director Seo, you need to focus.

638
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,770
You're shaking the frame.

639
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:19,570
Sorry. It looked too tasty.

640
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,470
It's tasty.

641
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,740
Try some.

642
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,180
- Isn't it tasty? 
 - It is.

643
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,210
It's so tasty.

644
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:45,770
Shy, we ate the same food for three days.

645
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:50,140
We must share billions of allogeneic bacteria now, right?

646
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,060
The operation is going smoothly.

647
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,140
My goodness.

648
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,350
   

649
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,690
   

650
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,340
   

651
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:13,580
Yun Woo?

652
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,660
So Jin, are you preparing for a mukbang this weekend, too?

653
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,930
 Yes, what are you up to right now? 

654
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:22,490
The morning appointments ended just now.

655
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:25,200
 I prepared something amazing. 

656
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,030
 You can look forward to it. 

657
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,200
I'll be waiting.

658
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,070
 Okay, shall I check his gut condition? 

659
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:37,500
By the way, are you suddenly feeling constipated

660
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,340
 or has your stool color changed, by chance? 

661
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,170
The color?

662
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,540
Is it okay for us to discuss that?

663
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,560
Well...

664
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,860
the thing is...

665
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,900
I was curious if you followed the recipe.

666
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,130
Your stomach might've gotten upset

667
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,670
if you didn't follow the recipe and ruined the dish.

668
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,320
Recipe?

669
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,740
After watching your show,

670
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,970
 I got some at a restaurant that has good french fries. Don't worry. 

671
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,430
   

672
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:15,080
Did you get it at a restaurant, not the convenience store?

673
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:20,420
- Alone? 
  - No, with the travel club members. 

674
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:23,350
Travel club...

675
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:28,870
Mi Eun must've been there, too, then.

676
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,940
Yes, she's a member, too.

677
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,640
By chance,

678
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:40,620
did you have the cheese spaghetti with her, too?

679
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:45,740
 I had that with Jung Tam at a restaurant. 

680
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:49,110
And I had gomtang with him at a famous restaurant the day after, too.

681
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,390
   

682
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:52,590
 Is something wrong? 
   

683
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,080
No. 
    

684
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,270
Yun Woo, I'll hang up for now.

685
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,800
   

686
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,360
Did I do something wrong?

687
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,920
 Yun Woo and Mi Eun... 

688
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,770
ate the same food again.

689
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,640
What's wrong with that?

690
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,660
"What's wrong with that?"

691
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,860
They established matching allogeneic bacteria again. Those two!

692
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,840
Geez! Put the knife down.

693
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,430
Geez...

694
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,020
What's with the bacteria? Why are you freaking out about it?

695
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,290
According to some research,

696
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,840
a pig was fed with lactic acid bacteria humans take

697
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,490
and it became very friendly toward humans.

698
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:39,420
It bonded because it developed matching allogeneic bacteria.

699
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,730
Just like you and me.

700
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:44,110
But that happened to a pig.

701
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,000
What does that have to do with anything?

702
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:54,740
I want to bond with Yun Woo, like Mi Eun, too.

703
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:59,580
Those two share a bond, unlike Yun Woo and I.

704
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:05,260
But I think this failed, too.

705
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:31,110
I understand now.

706
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:33,770
A bond.

707
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,540
I feel bad.

708
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,150
What should I do?

709
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,980
What should I do to avoid making her worry?

710
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,070
   

711
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,890
 So Jin, do you want to come to my place tomorrow? 

712
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,440
 Let me invite you officially. 

713
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,350
 Let's have dinner together. 

714
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,180
At home?

715
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:15,730
His place...

716
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:21,420
 Let's eat the same meal at the same table instead of the mukbang. Okay? 

717
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,790
 So Jin Noona. 

718
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:37,080
 She makes that face whenever she falls for a man. 

719
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,810
 She smiles with one eye slightly closed. 

720
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,430
 Just like when she eats a sour tangerine. 

721
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,170
 Tomatoes, celery, lettuce, bell peppers, 

722
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,040
 abalone, gochujang, a baguette, milk, 

723
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,930
 ricotta, feta, whipping cream, and crÃ¨me fraÃ®che. 

724
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:58,870
I'll combine all these random ingredients and create a perfect dish.

725
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:02,880
Sympho... simple... symphony.

726
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,800
 Han So Jin has an appetite of a child. 

727
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,130
 She likes sweets and cheese. 

728
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:12,070
 She loves cream because she loves the rose sauce. 

729
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,730
To feed her the ginseng of the sea, I'll combine it with

730
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:37,890
instant ramen and plenty of butter.

731
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:39,790
   

732
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:48,610
   

733
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,990
Yun Woo,

734
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,480
I wanted to celebrate my birthday quietly with you,

735
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,000
not with the club members.

736
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,650
Ta-da! I got us wine, too.

737
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,820
Well, I'm sorry.

738
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:26,060
I'm having dinner with So Jin at home tonight.

739
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,280
I'll just have tea and leave, then.

740
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,400
I'm sorry. I'm cooking right now.

741
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,890
I want to just focus on that.

742
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:41,510
Let's celebrate your birthday with the club members next time. That's okay, right?

743
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,410
Okay, then.

744
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,020
Here, d-drink this.

745
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,600
I'll enjoy it. Thank you.

746
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,030
Get home safely. I'm sorry.

747
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,850
 Where are you, Noona? Would you like cold noodles today? 

748
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:51,010
 Jung Tam, Sung Mi, and I are eating it together. 

749
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,650
Hey, hey! Seo Kang Hoon!

750
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,360
 No, thanks. Eat plenty, including my share. 

751
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,820
 - I'll eat something tastier at Yun Woo's tonight.  
 - Hey, Seo Kang Hoon!

752
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,870
Kang Hoon.

753
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,100
Yes. Hey...

754
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,430
What did she say? Is Team Leader Han coming?

755
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:20,100
Noona said she couldn't come because she already had a plan.

756
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,390
Really? Let's go on our own, then.

757
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:26,150
Isn't she making an excuse because she doesn't want to come?

758
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,740
The thing is...

759
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,230
She's eating alone with Yun Woo at his place.

760
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:34,400
At Yun Woo's place?

761
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:39,760
I'm not sure. Will they really be just eating at home?

762
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,550
He does invite women over often.

763
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:45,880
He has a lot of disposable toiletries in his bathroom, like a hotel.

764
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,980
What a pervert.

765
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:51,940
Y-You can eat without me today. I can't join you.

766
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:57,290
Hey, come with us! I'd feel too awkward.

767
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,640
S-S-Shall we?

768
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,810
Okay.

769
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:15,390
Do you remember this and the puzzle, too?

770
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:17,780
It was so hard to put that back together.

771
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,290
Please try to forget that.

772
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:23,380
I can't. I'll remind myself whenever I feel depressed.

773
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,710
Put your coat on that hanger.

774
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:27,190
Okay.

775
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:32,300
â™«  In my heart, youâ€™re always with me  â™«

776
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,640
â™«  Forever, you and I  â™«

777
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,580
â™«  Just like this fluttering feeling  â™«

778
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,980
â™«  Youâ€™re filling up my heart  â™«

779
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,730
What do you think? Are you happy with the menu?

780
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:47,420
Yes, I love it!

781
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:56,230
By the way, why did you suddenly suggest eating at home today?

782
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:59,000
Do I need a reason for it?

783
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,510
I wanted to eat tasty food together,

784
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:05,580
go to nice places, enjoy nice things,

785
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:09,190
and create a bond with you, So Jin.

786
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,740
A bond?

787
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:13,780
All of a sudden?

788
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,140
It's not all of a sudden.

789
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,950
It's kind of strange.

790
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,990
Let's eat before the food I worked hard on gets cold.

791
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,520
Okay.

792
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,700
Try the cream pasta.

793
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,360
Yes.

794
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,460
And this cheese tteokbokki, too.

795
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,860
I'm so full.

796
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,780
How was it?

797
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,260
It was so delicious.

798
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:47,350
Yun Woo, I've never been so happy because of foodâ€”

799
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:54,780
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

800
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,260
To be honest, I have a slight lactose intolerance.

801
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:04,170
So, sometimes, this happens when I eat a lot of dairy.

802
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,010
But I'll feel okay in a bit. It's okay.

803
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,340
- Are you sure you're okay? 
 - Of course.

804
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,350
Should I make you a cup of coffee?

805
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,830
Yes.

806
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:20,640
Come on.

807
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,340
What's the deal?

808
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,900
The coffee smells nice.

809
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,680
Yes, I can smell it from here.

810
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,640
It smells nice.

811
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:38,160
The coffee smells amazing.

812
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:44,950
- Thank you. 
 - By the way, do you feel warm in here?

813
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:48,970
I turned up the temperature so you don't feel cold.

814
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:51,340
Did you? Thank you.

815
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:55,160
And I made the coffee stronger in case the food was rich.

816
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,050
That's okay, right?

817
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,500
 Strong coffee? 

818
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,170
I love strong coffee.

819
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:07,380
 If I drink this, I won't be able to stop it. 

820
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:09,150
Nice.

821
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:13,290
Should we go see a movie now, then?

822
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:15,060
Shall we?

823
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:20,830
 I can hold it. I can. 

824
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,890
Let's hang in there. A little longer.

825
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:25,700
 I can do it. 

826
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:29,540
 Han So Jin. Han So Jin. 

827
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:35,530
 No, I don't think I can. 

828
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:38,120
 What if I make a big mistake again? 

829
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:41,550
 I'll go to the sofa for now. 

830
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:42,780
So Jin, are you okay?

831
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:46,700
Yes, did you start it already?

832
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,670
 Don't act like you're in a hurry. 

833
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:54,120
 Be natural as if I'm looking around the house. 

834
01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:00,520
 Stop it with the heel of my foot. 

835
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,700
- Are you still warm? 
  - But... 

836
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,720
 how much longer can I endure like this? 

837
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:17,550
 What? Is my heart fluttering at this moment? 

838
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:22,070
I'm okay.

839
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:27,040
T-This is...

840
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,080
 A bastard like you doesn't deserve to be loved! 

841
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,320
You were wearing the chopsticks in your hair when you barged in.

842
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,910
It was so memorable.

843
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,970
That's why I got you this.

844
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,740
Come here.

845
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,860
It's pretty.

846
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:09,000
No!

847
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,890
I don't think I can.

848
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,240
Pardon?

849
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,220
I think... I should...

850
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,220
go home right now.

851
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:23,600
- What do you meanâ€” 
 - Don't follow me! Please!

852
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:26,010
Let me go...

853
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,920
right now. Please.

854
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,710
What's going on?

855
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:33,610
So Jin!

856
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,560
Your jacket...

857
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:42,110
Your jacket...

858
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:02,430
Gosh, I'm dying.

859
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:19,870
Kang Hoon, please come pick me up.

860
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:23,340
I think I'm dying right now. It hurts so much.

861
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:27,030
 Noona? What's wrong? Where are you right now? 

862
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:33,700
I'm... I'm in the bathroom in Yun Woo's building right now.

863
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:54,020
 Noona! Han So Jin! 

864
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,060
Noona!

865
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,640
Noona!

866
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:04,790
Noona, pull yourself together. Where does it hurt?

867
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:08,310
My stomach hurts so much. Kang Hoon...

868
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:10,270
My gosh...

869
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:41,230
- Yes, what happened, So Jinâ€” 
  - Hyung, I can't talk for long. 

870
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:44,040
I'm going to the Shim Hospital ER with Noona. Meet us there.

871
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,500
- Hang in there. 
 - It hurts...

872
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:55,070

 - Kang Hoon, what are you to So Jin? 
 - Are you okay? 

880
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:40,900
 There's someone you want to share pain and hardship with. 

881
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:45,090
 And there's someone you only want to share pretty and nice things. That's it. 

882
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:47,060
 - Kang Hoon! 
 - Be careful. 

883
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,300
 I like Noona? 

884
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,960
 No, no! 

885
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,520
 I know I shouldn't, but I want him. 

886
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,680
 You aren't alone, So Jin.

 Before the operation, on the way to the OR, 

888
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:04,820
 and in the OR, I'll be by your side.
