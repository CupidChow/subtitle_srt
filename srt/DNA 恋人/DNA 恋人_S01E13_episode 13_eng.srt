1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,390
   

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,500
   

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,910
   

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,510
   

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,290
   

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,020
   

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,580
   

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,070
   

9
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,310
 If I didn't make that decision, 

10
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,000
 would I not have regrets? 

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,380
   

12
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,200
I said you didn't have to drop me off.

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,890
I said just today.

14
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,000
It'd make me feel better.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,700
Seriously, you're so stubborn. Geez!

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,440
My gosh! Are you okay?

17
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,270
Did I hurt you?

18
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,650
My gosh...

19
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,980
Let's go.

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,900
- Let's hurry up. 
 - Geez...

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,650
You've always done these things for me.

22
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,680
Walking me home

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,530
and caring for every little thing.

24
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,380
And you've always been by my side whenever I struggled.

25
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,200
Thinking now, you've always done that for me.

26
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,430
Why are you suddenly bringing this up?

27
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,070
I know.

28
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,850
I think I've always taken it for granted.

29
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,270
Thank you, Kang Hoon.

30
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,640
You must've been very scared today, Noona.

31
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,380
Of course, I was.

32
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,710
I thought I'd never see you again.

33
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,900
I've never imagined being without you.

34
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,960
That would never happen.

35
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,340
So don't worry.

36
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,220
 Was it really because of the forgetful gene? 

37
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,360
 Kang Hoon's scent, which I had forgotten for a bit, 

38
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:27,550
 and his sincere promise to never leave me. 

39
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,000
 Am I finally able to feel this because 

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,750
 maybe... 

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,290
   

42
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,310
 I found my true DNA lover? 

43
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,140
Yes, it's me.

44
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,240
How's Patient Yoo Yung Ah doing?

45
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,330
 She regained consciousness two hours ago but is asleep now. 

46
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,640
 We're treating the fetus without any issues so far. 

47
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,840
That's a relief.

48
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,180
Call me anytime if there are any issues.

49
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,490
Okay.

50
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,140
   

51
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,030
 I like this one. 

52
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,150
 Okay. Would you like to take it with you? 

53
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,370
 I'll give you the home address. 

54
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,700
 Please deliver it there. 

55
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,710
   

56
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,700
 She stepped out for a moment. 

57
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,140
 I'll just leave this here, then. 

58
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,670
Ah Ri, this is the new dish my father developed.

59
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,340
He told me to bring it to her.

60
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,220
I brought enough for you, too. Eat it together.

61
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,130
Chef Hyung Chul did it?

62
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,020
My specialty is testing new dishes.

63
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,170
I'll give you my honest opinion as it is.

64
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,370
I'll get going now.

65
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,540
J-J-Just one moment.

66
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,800
You should have some tea since you're already here.

67
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,110
You brought this precious stuff, too.

68
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,300
So Jin said it's rude to just let people go.

69
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,370
You really don't have to.

70
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,680
I'll inconvenience you, then.

71
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,560
   

72
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,050
   

73
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,270
   

74
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,200
Do you like it?

75
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,100
N-No... Oh, thank you.

76
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,340
Have you confessed your love officially?

77
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,750
- Not yet. 
 - No? Why?

78
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,950
I'll tell her when she feels back to normal.

79
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,000
You need to use this chance to take her.

80
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,370
You'd regret it later. Love is all about timing.

81
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,820
No.

82
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,040
Her feelings are more important than mine right now.

83
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,460
I'll wait until she feels better.

84
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,480
I see.

85
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,240
How old were you when you first met her?

86
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,210
We first met when I was seven, and she was 11.

87
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,720
You probably don't get butterflies since you're too used to each other.

88
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,210
I do.

89
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,510
I still get butterflies and my heart races.

90
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,140
I hope So Jin feels the same.

91
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,930
For now, it's okay if she doesn't.

92
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,240
Kang Hoon, when I think back to her dating history,

93
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,620
I realize her heart never flutters unless it does so from the beginning.

94
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,900
That means her heart rate differs drastically

95
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,680
when she thinks of you as a man versus just as a person.

96
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,020
Whether you play hot and cold or try to hypnotize her,

97
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,430
you'll need a solution.

98
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,610
In order to remove the Sewer out of her heart

99
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,700
and proudly become a man in her heart.

100
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,890
Anyway, I cheer for you, Kang Hoon.

101
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,310
You came.

102
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,790
Hey.

103
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,240
How's your mother doing?

104
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,110
She improved a lot.

105
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,760
Her face brightened up, too.

106
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,540
What a relief.

107
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,330
Should we go get some fresh air if you're free today?

108
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,430
The weather is nice, too.

109
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,520
- Let's. 
 - I didn't bring my car.

110
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,540
I'll drive.

111
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:01,250
I'm driving quietly and making you feel comfortable.

112
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,620
- Why are you in a sad mood? 
 - Me?

113
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,360
I'm not.

114
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,500
The weather is nice today.

115
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,900
This is no good. I'll switch your mood more dynamically.

116
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,540
Pick one.

117
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,040
Should I have fun for once?

118
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,770
Sounds good.

119
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,410
The engine sounds different in the sports mode.

120
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm hungry. Let's go get some food.

121
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,760
You worked all night last night. I'm sorry to bring you out this morning.

122
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,280
It's okay.

123
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,690
It doesn't matter if it's night or day as long as I get to be with you.

124
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,300
- Is that so? Got it. 
 - Yes.

125
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,120
Ms. Lee Ye Ji.

126
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,620
Yes.

127
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,410
This way, Sang Ah.

128
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,120
- What should we eat? 
 - Sausage.

129
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,490
Do you only want sausage?

130
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,200
Isn't it so beautiful?

131
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,830
That's exactly the life I want.

132
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,370
What is?

133
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,180
When I get m-married later,

134
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,060
I'll have many children.

135
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,480
It can be either three or four.

136
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,790
Even five would be good.

137
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,270
Is that too many?

138
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,080
No, it's not that.

139
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,370
Mr. Yuh Jung Tam!

140
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,000
- Mr. Yuh Jung Tam. 
 - She's calling us.

141
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,910
Aren't you coming?

142
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,220
Yes, let's go.

143
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,280
   

144
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,330
 - Enjoy. 
 - I will. 

145
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,540
 Their dumpling soup makes me so happy. 

146
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,530
 Wow, the dumplings are so plump and handsome. 

147
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,120
 Right? 

148
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,310
Yun Woo, sorry for making you wait.

149
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,970
This must be a really old place. How did you find it?

150
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,990
Their dumplings are plump and handsome.

151
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,240
What? The dumplings are handsome?

152
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,120
That's why I like them.

153
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,570
Do you feel better after going for a drive?

154
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,320
It was nice. Thank you.

155
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:19,410
I went to my high school classmate's housewarming party recently.

156
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,770
She used to be against marriage, but she ended up getting married.

157
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,970
So, I got curious and asked...

158
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,090
why she got married.

159
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,960
What did she say?

160
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,690
Having someone greet her at home and be with her makes her so happy.

161
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,560
She said it gives her peace of mind or something.

162
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,210
- I can see that. 
 - I know.

163
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,030
I must be getting old, too.

164
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,920
When I enter the empty apartment alone,

165
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,020
I strangely feel lonely sometimes.

166
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,840
Haven't you ever felt that way?

167
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,080
Of course, I have.

168
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,790
I sometimes miss warmth when I'm sitting alone in the empty living room.

169
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,150
Really?

170
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,920
I'm not sure if I can give you peace of mind,

171
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,980
but I can keep you company in the empty living room.

172
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,630
What?

173
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,800
I mentioned living together once.

174
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,690
Have you thought about it?

175
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,510
If you keep repeating a joke, you're telling the truth, Mi Eun.

176
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,200
I'm serious.

177
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,880
I'm not joking right now.

178
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,380
Whenever you feel lonely or stressed,

179
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,290
I want to be by your side without demanding anything in return.

180
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,300
As close as possible at all times.

181
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,320
You don't have to give me the answer now.

182
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,150
So, I'd like you to consider it seriously.

183
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,240
Let's eat.

184
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,650
Kang Hoon, did you check the schedule for next week?

185
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,910
No, not yet. It's out?

186
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,620
Why did I see this now?

187
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,640
Geez, it expires today.

188
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,690
Gosh, I'm so forgetful.

189
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,500
- What is it? 
 - I recently entered a giveaway and won.

190
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,510
It's a full-course date ticket. What did they say?

191
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:53,700
Famous date spots that can make even couples in a rut fall back in love.

192
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,650
I won't be able to go.

193
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,000
- Sunbae. 
 - Yes?

194
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,590
- Can I have a look at it? 
 - Sure.

195
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,990
Gosh, what a shame.

196
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,710
   
   

197
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,880
 - Have you confessed your love officially? 
 - Not yet. 

198
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,500
 Kang Hoon, when I think back to her dating history, 

199
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,640
 I realize her heart never flutters unless it does so from the beginning. 

200
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,920
 That means her heart rate differs drastically 

201
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,880
 when she thinks of you as a man versus just as a person. 

202
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,310
   

203
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,530
Dear Sunbae, would you consider giving this to me?

204
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,050
What?

205
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,980
What would you do with it?

206
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,700
Seo Kang Hoon!

207
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,360
Hey, what's up?

208
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,850
 What are you doing after work today? 

209
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,590
Me? Nothing much.

210
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,010
 - Go on a date with me today.  
 - What?

211
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,370
You'd like it, too. I'll pick you up when you're done.

212
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,590
No, I'll just meet you there.

213
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,830
 Okay, I'll send you the address. 

214
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,880
 Meet me there after work. 

215
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,240
Okay, I will.

216
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,680
Kang Hoon!

217
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,350
Hey.

218
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,060
This place is beautiful.

219
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,510
It feels like another country.

220
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,180
Hold on, Noona.

221
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,590
What?

222
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,330
You're such a messy eater.

223
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,500
Why is my heart racing so much?

224
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,090
Wait for me.

225
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,390
Who's your first love? Is it me?

226
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,190
All of a sudden?

227
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,170
Hey, who's your first love?

228
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,440
First love?

229
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,010
Do I have one?

230
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,750
You don't have one?

231
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,650
I thought I didn't,

232
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,390
but there's someone I remember.

233
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,770
She was so pretty when she cried.

234
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:50,300
What? Did she look pretty crying, not smiling?

235
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,720
Yes.

236
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,730
She looked pretty to me.

237
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,710
If so, is that your ideal type?

238
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,480
Ideal type?

239
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,690
You like the church girl type.

240
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,570
Long straight hair, a good piano player.

241
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,910
Someone who's feminine and innocent?

242
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,020
No?

243
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,640
I'm not sure about that.

244
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,810
My ideal type is someone who cries often.

245
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,110
Stop joking. Be serious.

246
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,470
I'm not joking.

247
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,260
She cried for me once.

248
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,280
   

249
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,420
 Don't be sorry, Mom. 

250
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,630
 I'm okay. 

251
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,000
I wanted to cry, but I couldn't.

252
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,500
My mom felt bad that she didn't recognize me before she died.

253
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:20,300
I didn't want her to see me sad in her last moments.

254
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,480
 Crying again? 

255
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,610
 Today is your mom's memorial day. 

256
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,870
 Ahjussi was drinking all day when I visited him, 

257
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,550
 and he was running out of breath, crying. 

258
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,290
 What if something happens to him? 

259
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,890
 He tends to cry a lot. 

260
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,050
 Why don't you ever cry? 

261
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,730
 Even I feel so sad. 

262
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,230
You still remember what happened then?

263
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,650
How could I forget?

264
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,410
You cried for me when I wanted to but couldn't.

265
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,780
So...

266
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:19,140
are you thanking me for crying in your place?

267
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,610
Noona, are you still hurting because of Yun Woo?

268
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,040
I just...

269
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,110
keep thinking he can run away when I'm struggling the most.

270
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,110
I'm asking if you're hurting.

271
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,680
I'm not going to.

272
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,330
From now on.

273
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,070
Babe, the title of this installation is "The Temperature of Love."

274
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,100
If you touch the sensor, the lights will change color depending on your temperature.

275
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,090
Come on. This isn't real.

276
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,250
I don't want to do this.

277
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,000
Why can't you?

278
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,300
Hold my hand so I can see how much you love me.

279
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,140
Okay, okay. You go first.

280
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,520
Okay.

281
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,870
 Your temperature says you're in love. 

282
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,210
 Your temperature says you're in love. 

283
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,710
See? I said we didn't have to do this.

284
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,860
 - Do you not trust me? 
 - I want to. 

285
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,600
 So, prove yourself to me. 

286
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,110
 I want to hear it. 

287
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,180
 I want to hear you say you love me. 

288
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,850
Should we try it, too?

289
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,480
Next time.

290
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,920
Let's try it next time.

291
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,120
Yes?

292
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,330
 Tree Orphanage, the facility we sponsor, 

293
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,790
 contacted us regarding the Family Month event. 

294
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,300
- We sponsor them? 
  - Yes. 

295
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,480
 The Director had been sponsoring them for 20 years. Didn't you know? 

296
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,840
 He has always participated. What should we do? 

297
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,330
Okay. I'll participate.

298
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,310
Okay.

299
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,410
Sponsoring?

300
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,710
An orphanage?

301
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,600
   

302
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,600
Thank you for visiting us all the way here.

303
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,510
Thank you for continuing to sponsor us during such a difficult time.

304
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,380
Don't mention it.

305
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,010
I heard the Director had been sponsoring you for 20 years.

306
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,900
You must've found out recently.

307
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,180
The Director didn't want people to know.

308
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,940
Is it because he had a handsome son like you?

309
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,400
That's why he cared about that boy so much.

310
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,150
A boy?

311
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:45,010
Yes, he asked for us to take extra care of one boy.

312
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,430
He must've reminded him of you.

313
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,670
It's this boy right here.

314
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,740
The one on the far left.

315
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,340
 Mom. 

316
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,390
 Why are you doing this to us? 

317
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,060
 You thieves. 

318
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,330
 - What did you say? 
 - Your family is a bunch of dirty thieves. 

319
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,810
 - Thieves? 
 - Go! Go and ask about it. 

320
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:36,100
 Ask your mom what you stole from us. 

321
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,400
His mom passed away in a fire,

322
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,030
but he grew up well in our orphanage.

323
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,360
He's a priest now.

324
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,510
He led the Director's funeral mass, too.

325
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,620
He's called Father Andrea.

326
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,330
 Please lead him. 

327
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,810
 Please give heavenly comfort to the family... 

328
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,280
 I've heard a lot about you. 

329
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,150
 I'm Shim Yun Woo, Lucky's doctor. 

330
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,590
 I'm Andrea. 

331
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,620
Could you tell me which parish he's at?

332
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:20,100
He does volunteer work here once a month.

333
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,300
He'll actually be here today.

334
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,330
There he is. That's Father Andrea.

335
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,020
 Father! 

336
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,450
Father Andrea, why haven't you been here for so long?

337
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,190
 - We missed you.  
 - What should we do today?

338
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,260
 - Dodgeball. 
 - It has to be soccer. Soccer, no matter what. 

339
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,360
I heard you wanted to see me.

340
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,580
Yes, have a seat.

341
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,710
You provided me a lot of comfort at the funeral.

342
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,050
Don't mention it. I was only doing my duty.

343
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:23,690
Could you have a look at this photo?

344
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,530
It's a photo that was found at the scene.

345
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,310
You're the boy in the photo, correct?

346
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,650
I'm not sure how you found out.

347
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,980
Yes, it's me.

348
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:50,070
Have you been seeing my father, then?

349
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:54,380
No, I'm grateful for the Director.

350
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,170
He sponsored me through the orphanage,

351
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,370
which allowed me to attend divinity school as well.

352
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,260
But I didn't know he kept this photo, too.

353
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:12,010
We met 20 years ago. Do you remember, by chance?

354
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,700
You could say we have an ill-fated relationship.

355
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,540
I'm a priest.

356
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,620
I completely moved on from my past the day I became a priest.

357
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,600
I understand.

358
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,770
Well, then...

359
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,900
Lucky got adopted by a nice couple.

360
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,370
It's all thanks to you.

361
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,080
Lucky?

362
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,740
Don't you remember?

363
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I forget sometimes because there are so many babies like that.

364
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,030
- Got it. 
 - Okay.

365
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,900
   

366
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,430
Volunteer work?

367
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,470
What volunteer work?

368
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,620
   

369
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,070
 Do you like plants, Yun Woo? 

370
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,440
 Shim Hospital's bulletin board says 

371
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,640
 there's an invasive plant removal volunteer event. 

372
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,300
 Should we go together? 

373
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,400
- Assistant Director. 
 - My gosh!

374
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,800
I'm the team leader for the invasive plant removal event.

375
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,690
You're attending the event this week, right?

376
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,920
Right, the event.

377
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,560
I'm sorry.

378
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,850
I don't think I could because I have another plan.

379
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,630
The event photos will be on the hospital website.

380
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,650
I think you should come to promote the hospital.

381
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,740
There are many other great doctors besides me.

382
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,080
Are you worried because of Ms. Han, by chance?

383
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,300
She was on the participant list, too.

384
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,080
Don't worry so much about it.

385
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,720
She doesn't seem to have enough mental strength

386
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,450
to spend the night with a bunch of her ex's colleagues.

387
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,320
Well, that's not the only reason.

388
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,590
Should I secretly find out if she's actually coming or not?

389
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,150
I can make sure she doesn't come.

390
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,280
I'll be responsible for it.

391
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,900
Oh, wait— wait—

392
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,880
I'll go.

393
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,480
I'll go.

394
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,890
If so, I'll meet you at the hospital at 9 o'clock.

395
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,680
- Okay. 
 - Please come.

396
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,120
Okay.

397
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,590
What's wrong with Team Leader Han?

398
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,210
She has to go to Gangwon-do for volunteer work this weekend,

399
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,570
- but I guess the Sewer— 
 - What?

400
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,990
I guess Dr. Shim is going, too.

401
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,210
But she seems to be struggling to cancel it.

402
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:39,190
This happens when you make too many plans while dating.

403
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,040
Should you not make plans, then?

404
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,660
Start dating first.

405
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,540
Here she comes. Here she comes.

406
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,520
What are you all doing this weekend?

407
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,020
Maybe we should have a special gathering like we used to.

408
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,120
Hello? My dear grandmother.

409
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,740
Shy?

410
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,970
You're only available on the weekend?

411
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,400
That's perfect. Well...

412
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,990
I'll pick her up this weekend, then.

413
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,720
I love you, Grandmother.

414
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,680
- Ah Ri. 
 - I need to run a test now.

415
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,550
You should hear me out, at least.

416
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,570
I-I want to see my grandmother, too.

417
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,520
- I should visit her. 
 - BK.

418
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,850
I can't get out of the volunteer work, but I can add people.

419
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,120
How does that make sense?

420
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,240
How could I take an overnight trip with my ex?

421
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,480
I don't know a single person there.

422
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,510
You'll come with me, right?

423
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,700
Team Leader Han, weekends are very precious to me.

424
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,060
BK!

425
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,290
Please help me!

426
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,150
We've known each other for so long.

427
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,860
How could you do this to me?

428
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,340
Please, please don't abandon me!

429
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,000
Team Leader Han. Team Leader Han.

430
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,150
When did I abandon you?

431
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,720
Just pretend you're saving someone's life.

432
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,580
Please join me.

433
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,270
Hello.

434
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,990
Go inside. Go inside.

435
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,810
Is everyone here?

436
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,460
One, two, three, four.

437
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,660
- Hello. 
 - Yes, hello.

438
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,980
- You're coming, too? 
 - It worked out that way.

439
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,680
Aigoo...

440
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,310
Goodness...

441
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,660
Hello.

442
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,730
I'm sorry. My gosh.

443
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,160
So hot.

444
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,120
- Thanks for your hard work. 
 - It's nothing.

445
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,530
   

446
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,850
Get some vitamins.

447
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,530
I'm okay.

448
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,300
Team Leader Han.

449
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,840
Here.

450
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,790
 This is Jin Sun's father, Leader Oh. 

451
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:53,280
 The doctors from Shim Hospital in Gangnam, where my daughter works, 

452
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,500
 are coming today to do volunteer work for our village, Hacheon. 

453
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,810
Okay, okay.

454
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,790
We're here now. We need to get to work.

455
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,890
We need to go that way and change into work clothes.

456
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,150
Come out quickly.

457
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,800
- Father. 
 - Gosh, Jin Sun!

458
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,430
I brought the entire hospital with me.

459
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,380
Welcome. Welcome.

460
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,620
There are tons of invasive plants along the stream, too.

461
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,080
But don't be shocked.

462
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,930
We're not in the jungle.

463
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,510
Japanese hops, bur cucumber,

464
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,440
and giant ragweeds are everywhere at the moment.

465
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,070
It's a mess.

466
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,830
You're doing great.

467
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,700
Don't cut that off.

468
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,930
You don't get that much over there.

469
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:43,640
Dr. Choi, that's not a weed. Why are you cutting a perfectly fine plant?

470
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:49,990
Wow, Dr. Choi looks amazing in the work clothes.

471
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,040
What a fashionista. Good, good.

472
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,490
You should've gone somewhere crowded. Why are you here?

473
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,830
I like secluded spots.

474
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,630
- Carry on. 
 - Okay.

475
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,890
I should work here.

476
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,790
What do I do...

477
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,490
Walk slowly backward and listen to me carefully, okay?

478
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,030
We need to run away.

479
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,710
What? Won't the bees follow—

480
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,080
We'll turn into beehives unless we run away.

481
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,890
Put the sickle down slowly.

482
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,630
On a count to three, turn to the right slowly and run away, okay?

483
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,020
Okay.

484
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,700
One, two, three.

485
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,440
They're coming! They're coming! They're coming!

486
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,650
They're coming! They're coming! My gosh!

487
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,720
The volunteers are so full of love.

488
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,060
This is why I never believe it when people say they broke up.

489
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,300
♫  Every day, would you give me all your heart tonight?  ♫

490
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,490
♫  Yeah, I’ll never give up on your love  ♫

491
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,680
♫  In my heart, you’re always with me  ♫

492
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,900
♫  Forever, you and I  ♫

493
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,060
♫  Just like this fluttering feeling  ♫

494
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,830
♫  You're filling up my heart  ♫

495
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:48,600
♫  Your image  ♫

496
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,280
♫  Like a small dizziness  ♫

497
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,910
Oh, my god! Are they following us?

498
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,720
I think they're gone.

499
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,930
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

500
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,540
Are you okay?

501
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,240
I think I got stung just now.

502
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,300
Let me see.

503
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,600
I don't see a sting. They weren't bees. They were wasps.

504
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,190
- We should go to a hospital. 
 - What?

505
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,460
- Wasps? 
 - Hold on.

506
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,130
Is this the hospital? Someone got stung by a wasp.

507
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,080
She hasn't shown allergic reactions yet.

508
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,260
Where's the hospital located?

509
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,200
Really?

510
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,580
My gosh. Okay, got it.

511
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,530
It'd be faster to walk there than to wait for the ambulance.

512
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,830
Would you be able to move?

513
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,700
Yes, I'll walk.

514
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,440
I-It's okay.

515
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,780
Hop on my back.

516
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,570
No, I just need to rest for a moment.

517
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,740
The venom will spread more if you keep moving and circulate blood.

518
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,960
Hop on my back.

519
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,200
- I said I'm okay. 
 - Fine, then.

520
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,180
Wait here alone.

521
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,020
What? Well...

522
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,330
Y-Yun Woo...

523
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,410
H-Hold on, Yun Woo!

524
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,440
Yun Woo!

525
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,910
Yun Woo!

526
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,450
You can't even wait alone.

527
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,090
Hop on.

528
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,570
Let's go together.

529
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,800
- I think there were snakes. 
 - I think so.

530
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,840
Why do you get angry so easily?

531
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,170
Can we walk a little faster?

532
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:26,720
The venom could spread if you run.

533
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,710
Where's the hospital, exactly?

534
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,780
We're almost there.

535
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,590
What are you talking about? I don't see anything.

536
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,900
I said the venom could spread if you move.

537
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,700
- You don't listen. 
 - Because it hurts.

538
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,550
Why are you so heavy, So Jin?

539
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,470
What? You're so mean.

540
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,610
What did you eat?

541
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,070
Hold on. Don't choke me.

542
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,590
I think I'm going to fall.

543
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,880
It could've been dangerous if your boyfriend brought you in any later.

544
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,570
Take the antihistamine IV shot and go.

545
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,830
Thank you.

546
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,780
Your face is suffering a lot because of the owner.

547
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,710
- What did you say? 
 - You heard me.

548
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,100
Take your time and meet me outside.

549
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,090
Was it here?

550
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,120
   

551
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,030
Hey, Kang Hoon.

552
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,280
 - Where are you, Noona?  
 - Huh?

553
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,380
I'm at a clinic.

554
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,940
I got stung by a wasp.

555
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,710
 What? What's the address? I'll be right there. 

556
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,220
You're coming here?

557
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,530
No, why would you come all the way here?

558
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,210
I'll be okay, I just need to rest a bit.

559
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,800
Let's eat. Let's eat.

560
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,960
Thank you for all your work!

561
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,540
Wow! How could you eat when we don't know if the Assistant Director is alive?

562
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,820
The food is amazing.

563
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,790
Yes, the jokbal is great.

564
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,680
The jokbal is tasty.

565
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,520
Assistant Director.

566
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,890
Ms. Han.

567
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,760
Assistant Director!

568
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,780
You didn't fight, did you?

569
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,770
Come on. The Assistant Director isn't like that.

570
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,860
What? What's with this spicy gene?

571
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,510
I'm the sweetie of Muari.

572
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,110
- You're what? 
 - Sweetie.

573
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,200
Okay, whatever.

574
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,770
Anyway, what happened to your forehead?

575
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,100
I got stung by a wasp.

576
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:38,200
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I put ointment on it. It went down. It's fine.

577
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,340
Wow, what happened to you, Dr. Choi?

578
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,490
- Here you go. 
 - Looks tasty.

579
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,960
It looks good.

580
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,930
And the two of you.

581
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:53,430
You played hooky while we were working. You need to do the dishes.

582
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,340
That's kind of unfair.

583
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,530
We walked 10 ri because we couldn't get a taxi. 
  (T/N: ~ 4 km) 

584
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,600
Ten ri? I asked the village leader,

585
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,660
and he said the hospital is only two kilometers away.

586
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,100
I'll do the dishes.

587
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,350
It's okay. I'll do them.

588
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,200
Yes, could you?

589
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,080
Ms. Han can rest.

590
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,640
- Assistant Director and Dr. Ji can do them. 
 - Okay.

591
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,780
You're so cool, Doc. I'm impressed.

592
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,200
Eat potatoes. Why are you so mad?

593
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,400
- I heard you shouldn't be near water. 
 - Be quiet.

594
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,310
Go inside.

595
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,700
I'll help you rinse and go inside.

596
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,950
They think you played hooky because of me.

597
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:59,080
Don't work in the dark for too long.

598
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:03,130
You're taking the eye supplements, right?

599
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,330
You don't have to worry.

600
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,480
I'm telling you to take care of yourself.

601
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,260
What is it like to meet your DNA lover?

602
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,030
Didn't you reach your life goal?

603
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,780
I'm very...

604
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,540
happy.

605
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:35,190
I'm glad you're happy.

606
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,010
You can do the rest, right?

607
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,690
Yes.

608
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,470
 What is it like to meet your DNA lover? 

609
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,810
I barely managed to hold back.

610
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:29,510
Why does he show up and shake me up when I'm about to forget him?

611
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,350
 I'm very... 

612
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,260
 happy. 

613
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,840
Get some sleep. I'll wake you up.

614
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,560
Could you?

615
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,650
   

616
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,330
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

617
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,060
- Kang Hoon. 
 - Noona.

618
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,450
- Hey. 
 - Hello.

619
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,090
- I'll get going. 
 - Okay.

620
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,900
- See you. 
 - Bye.

621
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,780
Why did you come?

622
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,850
- Is this it? 
 - Yes.

623
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,500
- Are you okay? 
 - I am.

624
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,170
You should've been careful. You must've been scared.

625
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,370
I'll get you the medicine. Carry it with you from now on.

626
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,150
Okay. Let's go.

627
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,730
Long time no see, Hyung.

628
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:23,480
Yes, you look great.

629
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:27,990
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

630
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,640
 It's lung cancer. 

631
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,070
 Didn't you notice any symptoms? 

632
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:57,800
 It's probably stage 2, according to the size of the tumor. 

633
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,090
 You must've experienced breathing difficulties, bone aches, 

634
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,600
 and significant weight loss. 

635
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,210
I'd better quit now.

636
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,670
Yes, Mi Eun.

637
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,130
Are you free today?

638
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:24,070
Today?

639
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,800
I'm on my way to Sokcho because something came up at home.

640
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,560
Okay, then. See you next time.

641
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,000
 Didn't you come with your guardian? 

642
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,050
 Come together from now on. 

643
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,820
 We need to do a PET CT scan to see how much it has spread 

644
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,950
 and schedule the operation. 

645
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,730
 It'd be hard to do it alone. 

646
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:01,480
   

647
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,810
 You must've been so depressed. 

648
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,450
 The horrible thing was growing inside you every day. 

649
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,400
 Hey, why do you always expect things from her? 

650
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,190
 Don't you know there's no love in this family? 

651
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:22,030
 Yes, I was wrong. 

652
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,790
 We're the suicide victim's family and accomplices who drove him to it. 

653
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,780
 I thought we could... 

654
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,720
 pretend to be a normal family, at least today. 

655
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,980
We should've at least eaten together often.

656
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,330
Enjoy.

657
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,240
Excuse me, we'll have another sake.

658
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,750
Okay.

659
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,850
- Here's the sake. 
 - Thank you.

660
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,750
So Jin, do you know what Kang Hoon

661
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:04,420
started learning yesterday?

662
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,040
He's learning how to knit at the yarn shop nearby.

663
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,620
K-Knit?

664
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,900
Do you want to see it?

665
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:14,370
He's been doing this at the store all the time.

666
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:17,390
H-He knit this himself?

667
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,310
- Yes. 
 - Wow!

668
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,830
Seriously!

669
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,700
Father!

670
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,950
Seriously!

671
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,800
That's a scarf, apparently.

672
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,630
He says he'll give it to his girlfriend as a Christmas present.

673
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:35,110
He doesn't even have a girlfriend. What is he talking about?

674
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,940
By the way, why is it red?

675
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,650
Is it because it's for Christmas?

676
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:45,360
I told him the red yarn represents fate.

677
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,780
His mom knitted me a scarf with red yarn, too.

678
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,630
The unforgettable red yarn of fate binds us even in the underworld.

679
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,620
That's why he suddenly—

680
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,910
That's enough!

681
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:58,780
- Could you knit me one, too? 
 - Keep eating.

682
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,060
I think you're talented. Knit me one, too.

683
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:05,200
 He's like a huge puppy. 

684
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,220
 He's doing all the things I wanted to do with Yun Woo for me. 

685
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:15,760
 I hope Ahjussi, Kang Hoon, and I get to live together for a long time. 

686
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,910
 Try it. 

687
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:22,690
 The red lights will come on now. 

688
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,180
 Here. 

689
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,090
 Your temperature says you're friends. 

690
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:41,280
 No, no. 

691
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,550
 - Let me try again. 
 - Okay. 

692
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:53,570
 Your temperature says you're friends. 

693
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,000
 This isn't right. This isn't right. 

694
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,020
 Actually, he's your younger brother. 

695
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,950
 He's your younger brother. 

696
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,550
 He's your younger brother. 

697
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,440
No, no, no.

698
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,940
Gosh, no.

699
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,140
- Are you done eating? 
 - What? Y-Yes.

700
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,470
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

701
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,670
Okay, let's go.

702
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,520
- Please clean this up, Father. 
 - Okay.

703
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,790
- See you, Ahjussi. 
 - See you.

704
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,150
I said I'm okay.

705
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,760
It's dangerous at night.

706
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,130
You made it brighter with these.

707
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,750
- We're here. 
 - Yes.

708
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:51,480
- See you. 
 - Yes, see you. Thank you.

709
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,550
   

710
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,200
   

711
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,580
   

712
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,130
What is it now?

713
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,970
Did you break up with Sung Mi?

714
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:42,580
It sounds like you want that to happen.

715
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,880
I can just tell from your face.

716
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,100
You're breathing faster, too.

717
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:51,710
I think we'd be unhappy if we broke up,

718
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:55,700
but we wouldn't be happy even if we stayed together.

719
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,190
What should I do?

720
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,240
What's the issue?

721
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,250
You know I'm sterile, right?

722
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,990
I've never been unhappy because of it in my life.

723
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:11,500
I'd be happy living as a DINK couple, but...

724
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:17,440
ever since I met Sung Mi, I've blamed myself for being sterile.

725
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:24,390
She wants to get married and have many children.

726
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:28,440
It'd change your lifestyle, too. It's a difficult issue.

727
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,160
But...

728
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,350
is it necessary to worry about it?

729
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,270
Yes, I know.

730
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:41,280
We should break up. That's always been your conclusion,

731
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,470
but I've never liked anyone this much

732
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,830
in the past, and...

733
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,920
I don't think I will in the future either.

734
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,700
 What is it like to meet your DNA lover? 

735
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,600
 Didn't you reach your life goal? 

736
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,510
 I'm very... 

737
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,450
 happy. 

738
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,610
Go to Sung Mi.

739
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,710
And...

740
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:25,030
tell her that you're sterile.

741
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:28,050
Ask her if that'd still be okay.

742
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:30,150
If she says no,

743
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,370
try to cling to her.

744
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,690
Tell her you love her...

745
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,640
and tell her again.

746
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,730
Keep begging until the end.

747
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:43,690
What's with you? You're scaring me.

748
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:46,590
You said you'd regret it forever if you let her go.

749
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,440
You should try anything.

750
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:03,890
You haven't eaten, right?

751
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:05,340
No.

752
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,790
Ta-da! I got groceries.

753
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:11,530
Let's have soybean stew with rice.

754
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,710
Eat this before you go to bed.

755
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:31,050
You're an amazing cook, as you've always been.

756
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,650
Do I pass as a roommate?

757
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:37,960
For the co-living contract,

758
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,410
I came up with two conditions.

759
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,000
One.

760
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,920
We'll do grocery shopping and eat dinner together twice a week.

761
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,320
Two. Recommend each other a movie and watch it together.

762
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,330
And...

763
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:58,030
we'll change the rules as we go if we don't like them.

764
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:00,560
Anything you'd like to add?

765
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:08,000
Mi Eun,

766
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,920
I don't think I could do it.

767
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,790
Is it because of So Jin?

768
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:24,550
Even at this moment,

769
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:27,710
I think I'd be so happy...

770
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,970
if she were with me. I'm sorry.

771
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:33,440
It's okay. I knew you'd say that.

772
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:42,000
I understand you even in this cruel moment.

773
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,950
Because I was like that.

774
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:49,910
I kept seeing your face in other men's faces.

775
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,150
Yun Woo,

776
00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:00,720
if I had told you how I felt a little sooner,

777
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:05,690
would our relationship have changed?

778
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,190
I'll give you one more chance.

779
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:18,220
- Mi Eun. 
 - No.

780
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,490
I'll wait for you one more time.

781
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:27,110
Go to So Jin and tell her how you really feel now.

782
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,540
But if it doesn't work out again,

783
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,720
come to me.

784
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,300
   

785
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,420
   

786
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,400
Why suddenly a plant?

787
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,560
I should water it.

788
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:47,300
How much water does it need?

789
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,800
Yes?

790
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,260
What did you want to talk about?

791
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,010
I know it's too late to say this,

792
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:41,380
but I thought I should let you know.

793
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,680
I keep having the same dream every night.

794
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,530
 I keep going back to the day we broke up 

795
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,450
 and wishing I had made a different decision. 

796
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,260
But when I wake up,

797
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:59,410
the reality hasn't changed.

798
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:02,630
I'm afraid I had my last chance,

799
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:05,920
and it makes me worry that I might have missed it.

800
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:13,780
I think I made the wrong decision.

801
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,790
Could you please give me...

802
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:19,830
one more chance?

803
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,580
 Just like his selfish decision... 

804
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,990
 If I didn't make that decision then... 

805
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:32,460
 I just hope this decision won't turn into a regret. 

806
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,280
 would I not be regretting it now? 

807
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,860
I'm sorry.

808
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:41,010
We should finally go our separate ways.

809
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,610
Do you mean that?

810
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,030
My old self would've...

811
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:52,390
taken you back in a situation like this.

812
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:54,620
But not anymore.

813
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:04,420
Do you love Kang Hoon?

814
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:07,480
If love means my five senses waking up,

815
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,040
I never loved Kang Hoon as a man.

816
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,620
But I finally realized that I was wrong about

817
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,890
everything I believed love to be.

818
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:23,190
That's why I think this might actually be love.

819
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,100
- So Jin, I— 
 - Hyung.

820
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:34,800
If you really love Noona, letting her go is love, too.

821
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:59,200
Are you okay?

822
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,710
Yes.

823
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:11,690
I didn't think I'd say this in a situation like this,

824
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:18,380
but I feel it would be too late if I didn't say it tonight.

825
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,410
So, I want to tell you now.

826
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:23,330
Tell me what?

827
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:25,280
I like you, Noona.

828
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:28,670
No, I love you.

829
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:38,460
This is...

830
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:41,530
my no. 1 treasure.

831
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:46,270
It's a piece of the fire hose I grabbed on the scene for the first time.

832
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,190
Here.

833
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:54,740
♫  Who came to me without words  ♫

834
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:58,380
♫  The same place  ♫

835
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,190
♫  The same time  ♫

836
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,900
To me, you're...

837
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,390
just as precious and special.

838
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,420
I want to cherish you all my life.

839
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,690
I swear I can treat you so much better.

840
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:17,760
I'll never make you cry like the other bastards, either.

841
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,520
So,

842
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,410
come to me now.

843
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:28,420
♫  The story we will paint together  ♫

844
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:31,730
♫  Feel so vivid to me  ♫

845
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:35,640
♫  I wish that this moment, looking at you  ♫

846
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:40,630
♫  Could last forever  ♫

847
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:49,290
- You'll get hurt. Step aside. 
 - Okay.

848
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:52,000
I'll get the dustpan.

849
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:49,390
♫  Somewhere within the dreams we’ve been drawing  ♫

850
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:52,890
♫  I'll always look at you  ♫

851
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:56,630
♫  And smile  ♫

852
01:07:56,630 --> 01:08:01,200
♫  When you suddenly turn around  ♫

853
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,880
♫  I’ll be here to hold you and give you rest  ♫

854
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:13,280
♫  I'll always be by your side  ♫

855
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,300
   

856
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:31,600
 I wanted to prove my love with my DNA lover theory. 

857
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:37,070
 Some people prove their love by protecting someone. 

858
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:39,890
 When the one you love looks at someone else, 

859
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:41,980
 people often give up. 

860
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:46,070
 I'll prove my love by not giving up. 

861
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:47,850
 I'm thinking of going to the US. 

862
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:52,340
 I concluded that giving up is proving my love for her. 

863
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,640
 Father, what's with this planter? 

864
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,840
 A customer gave it to me as a gift. 

865
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,630
 Someone destroyed it. 

866
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:02,380
 You're so lucky today, too. Aren't you?
