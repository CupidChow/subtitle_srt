1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,510
   

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,460
   

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,920
   

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,970
   

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,230
   

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,050
   

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,050
   

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,060
   

9
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,430
 When you start liking someone, 

10
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,860
 the timing becomes cruel. 

11
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,930
 If I start liking you now, 

12
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,590
 would it be the worst timing? 

13
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,130
What would you like to do when you get discharged?

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,550
I'd be happy to do anything with my DNA lover.

15
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,670
Should we go on a drive somewhere nice, then?

16
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,180
That sounds good, but...

17
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,330
how about we try spending all day at home together?

18
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,510
   

19
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,010
What would we do at home all day?

20
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,860
   

21
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,180
There's so much to do.

22
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,950
We can eat together and drink beer together.

23
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,520
Would you like wine since you prefer that?

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,910
You aren't trying to do anything naughty, right?

25
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,590
Who do you think I am? I'm not like that.

26
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,540
Seriously.

27
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,900
You didn't get the wrong idea, right?

28
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,280
Your slapping hurts, So Jin.

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,300
Since you're a good cook,

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,390
how about we try baking at home? I've always wanted to try it.

31
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,340
Let's order something in.

32
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,750
- You're a good cook. 
 - You'll leave as soon as you eat again.

33
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,540
- Come on. Seriously. 
 - I'm sorry.

34
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,730
- I said it hurts. 
 - Seriously.

35
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,200
Kang Hoon, eat this octopus, too.

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,080
I caught the biggest one when we went fishing last time.

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,760
Let's cook an octopus for So Jin when she gets discharged.

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,710
Cut it with scissors and eat it.

39
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,740
Where did they go?

40
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,290
I'm here.

41
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,550
 Again? 

42
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,880
 I didn't dump him. 

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,210
 I just loved him the best I could. 

44
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,690
 Meet someone nice next time. 

45
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,430
 It'd be okay, then. 

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,460
 Does a man like that even exist? 

47
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,760
 He does. He'd love no one but you. 

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,760
 Who's that, exactly? 

49
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,320
Father, this thing has three hearts.

50
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,310
But why does it make love with legs, not heart?

51
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,200
What?

52
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,630
It does what with its legs?

53
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,710
It only has genitals on its legs. Why?

54
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,540
Why does it make love with legs?

55
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,870
Ask a personal question like that to the octopus itself.

56
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,680
Don't ask me. Seriously...

57
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,260
   

58
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,800
   

59
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,080
Yun Woo.

60
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,870
Did you sleep well?

61
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,570
Yes, thanks to you.

62
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,580
Here. It's a discharge gift.

63
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,140
You shouldn't have.

64
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,090
- Can I open it right now? 
 - Of course.

65
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,150
What is it?

66
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,530
They're probably the right size.

67
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,760
It's the same size as the shoe you left at my place last time.

68
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,810
Did you check the size, then?

69
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,090
No, I could just tell. It's 225.

70
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,900
Try them on.

71
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,130
They're so pretty!

72
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,210
My goodness.

73
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,470
By the way, they say lovers aren't supposed to gift shoes to each other.

74
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,980
But I'm not interested in leaving you. Don't worry.

75
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,810
Okay.

76
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,620
I have a gift I've wanted to give you, too.

77
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,540
Ta-da. What do you think?

78
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,980
 Matching bracelets? 

79
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,720
 Is that a DNA shape, by chance? 

80
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,220
 - I have to wear that shackle-like thing  
 - Pretty, right?

81
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,460
 right now, right? 

82
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,710
- Well... 
 - What is it? You don't like it, by chance?

83
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,820
 No, I hate it. 

84
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:13,450
I do. I didn't know the DNA helix was so cute.

85
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,210
Could you give me your hand? I want to put it on you.

86
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,990
Right now?

87
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,500
Okay.

88
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,650
Ta-da. It's the first couple's item I'm giving to my DNA lover.

89
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,320
Wear it every day. You can't take it off.

90
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,650
- I'll keep that in mind. 
 - Right, Yun Woo.

91
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,040
Did you leave the porridge for me after the surgery?

92
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,550
- Porridge? 
 - How did you know I like crab porridge?

93
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,530
Kang Hoon, you came.

94
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,730
I was very worried.

95
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,050
You two went through a lot. I heard the result is good.

96
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,150
How could you not even show up if you were very worried?

97
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,360
You didn't even answer my call yesterday.

98
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,200
I was...

99
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,170
a bit busy. I'm sorry, Noona.

100
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,450
No, So Ri got me a caretaker. I was comfortable.

101
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,090
- This is all of your stuff, right? 
 - Yes.

102
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,110
I'll wait downstairs. Take your time and meet me downstairs.

103
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,540
A surgery was suddenly scheduled for this afternoon. Please take care of her.

104
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,680
No need to ask.

105
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,130
It's what I always do.

106
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,290
Move back and punch forward.

107
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,140
Okay, go!

108
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,660
Ready, fight!

109
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,580
That's right.

110
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,090
You're doing great.

111
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,400
That's great.

112
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,900
Again.

113
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,110
One, two.

114
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,050
Dr. Yuh. Punch harder this time.

115
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,270
- Okay. 
 - One, two.

116
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,900
One...

117
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,890
A-Are you okay? I punched too hard, didn't I?

118
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,510
No, I'm okay.

119
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,740
Let's raise the tempo this time.

120
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,570
Okay, here we go! One, two! One, two!

121
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,300
- I'm punching really hard this time. 
 - Okay.

122
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,750
Okay!

123
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,800
I can't. I can't. I don't want to hurt you, Sung Mi.

124
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,060
I told you to punch hard.

125
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,660
Can't we just go on a date instead?

126
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,900
There are so many things I want to do with you.

127
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,790
We're training right now.

128
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,630
Focus! Focus! One, two! One, two! One, two!

129
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,180
How long will we do this?

130
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,740
One, two!

131
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,090
One.

132
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,320
- You can punch hard. 
 - I can't.

133
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,020
- It's okay. 
 - I'm sorry.

134
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,170
I told you to train, but you're on a date.

135
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,440
Hello, Coach.

136
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,900
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

137
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,970
Thank you.

138
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:28,840
How about you model for the member recruit poster, Sung Mi?

139
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,510
We'll do a couple's shot like a body profile shot.

140
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:37,370
There's no one to replace Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist in our gym.

141
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,850
I'll give it a try to promote our gym.

142
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,490
Fighting.

143
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,900
Dr. Yuh, would you like to do it with me?

144
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,810
Pardon?

145
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,520
No, I didn't mean you should do it with him.

146
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,410
There's someone with a great body who's been a member for two years.

147
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,920
He said he'd help if we needed him.

148
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,180
Oh, I see.

149
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,130
No, I'll do it.

150
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,970
Sung Mi can't do it if I'm not doing it.

151
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,480
Okay. Photoshop works great these days.

152
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,890
No, we don't need Photoshop.

153
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,520
I'll try designing your body, Dr. Yuh.

154
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,330
- Pardon? 
 - Fighting!

155
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,020
- Dr. Yuh. 
 - Yes.

156
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,310
I'll try touching you, then.

157
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,970
Okay.

158
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,490
S-Sung Mi.

159
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,200
Aren't we moving too fast?

160
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,280
You're nothing but fat.

161
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,500
You really have zero muscle.

162
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,930
Come this way.

163
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,590
We'll check the skeletal muscle percentage and start squatting.

164
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,120
Wow.

165
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,160
I can't believe I'm wearing a matching jewelry.

166
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,530
   

167
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,400
 So Jin, were you still awake? 

168
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,120
Yun Woo, what are you up to right now?

169
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,660
I was just thinking about you.

170
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,710
Come on, you're lying.

171
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,210
It's true. What were you up to, So Jin?

172
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,140
Well, the thing is...

173
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,600
I got you some supplements while I was getting mine.

174
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,430
I keep worrying about your RP gene.

175
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,100
I got supplements for your eyes. I'll give them to you next time.

176
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,540
Thank you.

177
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,990
You have to remember to take them.

178
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,920
Okay, I will.

179
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,020
By the way, you said you're going to work tomorrow, right?

180
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,480
I think you should rest because you had surgery recently.

181
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,200
Would you be okay?

182
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,250
I'm okay. I'm not very sensitive to pain.

183
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,100
I'm behind work, too. It'd be easier to start work as soon as possible.

184
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,590
You can't overwork, then, okay?

185
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,180
Okay, I won't.

186
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,360
So Jin, you must be tired. Go to sleep. I'll call you tomorrow.

187
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,850
Hold on. What was it? Well...

188
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,530
Right, right. Do you like plants, Yun Woo?

189
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,810
I do like plants.

190
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,000
So, I was wondering, Shim Hospital's bulletin board said

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,530
there's an invasive plant removal volunteer event.

192
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,280
Should we go together?

193
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,960
Should I sign us up?

194
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,040
Or you can do it, too.

195
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,830
I don't mind doing it, either.

196
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,050
- I don't care— 
 - So Jin.

197
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,080
- Yes? 
 - You're talking because

198
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,680
you don't want to hang up, right?

199
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,930
Could you tell?

200
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,480
I miss you and want to hear your voice every day. What do I do?

201
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,780
I don't know why I'm like this, either.

202
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,480
 Why do you think I like you, So Jin? 

203
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,110
Why do you like me?

204
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,250
The more I see you, the more I become unfamiliar with myself.

205
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,310
Is that a good thing?

206
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,190
I'm not sure. I'm not used to feeling unfamiliar,

207
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,710
but I don't hate it.

208
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,000
That sounds kind of complicated.

209
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,260
I'll learn more over time.

210
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,380
I'll learn more about you over time, too, right?

211
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,470
 By the way, what's your ideal type? 

212
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,540
I don't have an ideal type.

213
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,060
How about you?

214
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,020
Before I met you,

215
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,100
I wanted someone like my dad.

216
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,260
 I see. Someone like your dad? 

217
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,720
Whenever I think about my dad,

218
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,990
I regret so many things.

219
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:49,750
There were these hiking shoes he really wanted.

220
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,740
He said they prevent you from tripping.

221
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,870
But...

222
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,310
I never got to buy them for him.

223
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,680
Aren't I such a bad daughter?

224
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,450
I still regret that the most to this day.

225
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,500
Hello?

226
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,190
Yun Woo?

227
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,420
Are you listening?

228
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,750
So Jin...

229
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,410
I'm sleepy...

230
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,200
Good night, Yun Woo.

231
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:14,520
   

232
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,800
- Gosh, Yun Woo! 
 - You haven't had lunch yet, right?

233
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,020
My goodness.

234
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,170
Did you make all this yourself?

235
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,510
I fell asleep first. I have to make up for it.

236
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,140
Here.

237
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,450
You shouldn't have fallen asleep like that last night.

238
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,870
How much did you hear?

239
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,810
I don't remember well because I was half-asleep, but...

240
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,430
So Jin,

241
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,470
- open it. 
 - What is this?

242
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,280
It's a brand older people like.

243
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,010
I'm not sure if your father would like them.

244
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,550
Were you listening when I was talking about that last night?

245
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,290
I always catch important information.

246
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,470
Is buying people shoes your hobby?

247
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,900
Is it? Your shoes were worn out,

248
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,290
and your father doesn't have any hiking shoes.

249
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,040
It's good to gift what people need.

250
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,940
Thank you so much.

251
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,110
I never thought to do this.

252
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,780
My dad would be so happy.

253
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,670
That'd be a relief, then. First of all,

254
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,000
enjoy your meal.

255
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,810
There's something on you.

256
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,140
Those are the days.

257
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,360
Are you not happy now?

258
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,730
I'm very happy.

259
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,570
   

260
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,440
   

261
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,290
   

262
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,360
   

263
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,780
   

264
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,150
Did you get the text? You're coming, right?

265
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,350
I don't think I could go, Mi Eun.

266
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,190
I'll tell the guys directly.

267
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,020
What? Well—

268
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,850
It's hard to see Shim Yun Woo's face.

269
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,080
Crab, crab.

270
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,480
I'm in your care, crab.

271
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,060
So tasty.

272
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,780
 So Jin, what are you doing tomorrow? 

273
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,600
 Should we meet? 

274
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,990
Noona, are you free tomorrow?

275
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,290
Tomorrow? Why?

276
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,280
I was just curious.

277
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,600
I think I'll have dinner with Yun Woo tomorrow.

278
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,380
Just wait and see. It will be a happy ending this time.

279
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,430
Okay.

280
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,870
Thank you. I'll go now.

281
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,590
Huh? Okay.

282
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,730
Ahjussi, thank you. Here.

283
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,350
- Yes, see you. 
 - Bye.

284
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,280
 ­  

285
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,640
Hello.

286
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,150
Thank you.

287
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,520
What's wrong with you?

288
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,750
I met up with Sung Mi this morning

289
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,390
and did 100 squats and 50 push-ups.

290
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,940
Why are you doing this? Are you entering a competition?

291
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,860
You know what my dream is.

292
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,250
Getting nails painted with a girlfriend.

293
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,780
Taking a foot bath together.

294
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:58,060
Making pottery and couple's rings at a studio.

295
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,800
Watching a movie together at a drive-in theater and stuff like that.

296
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:08,030
But I think her dream is to turn my soft fat into muscles.

297
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,170
Then, tell her no.

298
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,320
Sung Mi likes it. How could I say such a thing to her?

299
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,020
Try to balance things out, then.

300
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,470
Do what she likes one day,

301
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,060
and do what you like the other day.

302
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,960
But what if she doesn't like it?

303
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,970
Making her like it would be up to you.

304
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,500
It's easy for you to say.

305
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,690
Your ability is to be always annoying.

306
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,060
Why do I hear stuff like that so well?

307
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,200
You always hear everything, I'm telling you.

308
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,560
If she says she doesn't like what you like,

309
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,110
that'd mean she doesn't like you enough.

310
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:49,560
If you love someone, no matter what they want,

311
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,770
you try to do it together. Don't you agree?

312
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,240
Hearing you say "love"

313
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,480
feels a bit strange.

314
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,990
Bye.

315
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,620
Awkward, right?

316
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,740
What's this, Yun Woo?

317
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,890
We were supposed to spend all day at my place after you got discharged.

318
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,360
It was your idea. Don't you remember?

319
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,900
Of course I do.

320
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,230
Do you want to go to my place today? You'll get fully rejuvenated.

321
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,860
I prepared crab porridge because you said you liked it.

322
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,580
I love it.

323
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,260
Just one second.

324
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,640
 The bouquet is finished. 

325
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,660
 You can pick it up by five. 

326
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,990
 Noona, are you free tomorrow? 

327
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,330
 As usual, thank you for the meal today. 

328
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,790
 I'll go now. 

329
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,810
 Okay, see you. 

330
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,080
Why? Don't you like porridge?

331
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,100
No. Well, the thing is...

332
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,060
I'm sorry, Yun Woo.

333
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,040
I had a very important plan. I must've forgotten.

334
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,630
I'll call you later.

335
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,120
- Pardon? 
 - I'm so sorry.

336
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,440
- I'm sorry. 
 - So Jin.

337
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,520
Hello? I'm on my way right now. I'm sorry.

338
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,650
   
 Are you really not coming? 

339
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,740
 If you don't come, I'm done with you. 

340
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,050
 It's a once-in-a-lifetime event. What kind of friend does this? 

341
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,840
The three of us always came together.

342
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,420
It's weird not having So Jin here.

343
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,100
She has a plan, apparently.

344
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,950
Really? We can't help it, then.

345
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,650
Oh, right.

346
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,790
Flowers for your mom.

347
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,150
I forgot because So Jin prepares it every year.

348
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,890
You're right.

349
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,170
I'll look up a flower shop right now.

350
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,190
It's okay. It's hard to get pink hydrangea.

351
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,540
Ahjussi!

352
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,410
What?

353
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,520
Do I miss So Jin that much?

354
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,570
I can hear her voice.

355
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,290
Ahjussi!

356
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,330
Kang Hoon!

357
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:19,020
How could you both forget her favorite flowers?

358
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,580
I thought you had a plan. What are you doing here?

359
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:26,430
I'm sorry, Ahjussi. I remembered it was Mother's memorial day a week ago.

360
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,960
It happens when you're busy.

361
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,290
Because you always brought these flowers,

362
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,180
I almost didn't give her flowers this time.

363
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,020
I'll prepare them from now on.

364
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,740
I've been waiting for this day since I'm not allergic to these flowers.

365
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,880
Please let me prepare them in the future as well.

366
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,200
Okay, I will. Let's go.

367
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,500
So pretty!

368
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,400
I'll take one here, too. One, two, three.

369
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,670
- How pretty. So pretty. 
 - Do we look okay?

370
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,230
That was great.

371
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,000
Yes, yes.

372
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,930
That's it. That's it.

373
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,400
So pretty.

374
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,100
You're so pretty.

375
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,700
What? Shim Yun Woo!

376
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,830
Seriously.

377
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,800
He was going to come, anyway. He's so flaky.

378
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,500
- Hurry up. 
 - Hurry up, Yun Woo!

379
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,030
We're taking a group photo.

380
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,830
One, two, three.

381
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,250
One more. One, two, three.

382
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,940
So pretty.

383
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,900
I thought you couldn't come. You somehow made it.

384
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,420
It just happened so.

385
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,360
The plan suddenly got canceled.

386
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,010
I'm so happy you're here.

387
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,260
So pretty. I love it. Look at the flowers. The flowers.

388
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,790
That's it.

389
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:58,830
I wonder what it's like to look at only one person your whole life.

390
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,670
It means you're legally involved.

391
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,430
And who says they'd only look at each other?

392
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,050
Is that so?

393
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,730
But those two...

394
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,210
Nice.

395
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,010
look so happy today.

396
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,890
Do you think so?

397
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,790
How nice.

398
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:29,850
His mom and I took photos holding lanterns here, too.

399
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:35,650
You guys, I'll have a date alone with her for a moment, okay?

400
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,810
Why don't we go together?

401
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,210
Come on. Today's a special day.

402
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,880
I need to have a date with her, too.

403
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,140
Go ahead, Ahjussi.

404
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,100
You brat. See you.

405
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,530
See you.

406
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,620
If you don't come back in an hour, I'll leave him here.

407
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,680
Okay. I'll be back.

408
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,200
Should we look around, too?

409
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,550
Many kings and queens who lived in this palace

410
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,840
were loving toward each other.

411
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,420
After Queen Soheon passed, King Sejong

412
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,590
didn't bring in a new queen until he passed away.

413
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,910
They had eight sons and two daughters during 22 years.

414
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,290
They were a loving couple.

415
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:30,950
You could say they were a lovey-dovey couple where the woman was older.

416
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,250
- Let's move on. 
 - He had so many court ladies and concubines.

417
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,170
How did he only love her his whole life?

418
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,340
What do you think you'd be like?

419
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,360
I think I'd be like that if I fell in love

420
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,440
with someone.

421
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,110
Why are those two there?

422
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,400
You go on ahead.

423
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,270
- We'll be down there. 
 - We'll be taking photos.

424
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,900
Okay. Check the area down there.

425
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,240
It's funny to run into you here.

426
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,100
You said you had an important plan. Was it to see Kang Hoon?

427
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,650
Pardon? No, the thing is...

428
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,100
We came together because it was my mother's memorial day.

429
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,490
- We come here every year. 
 - I see.

430
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,230
How about you? What brings you here?

431
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,660
A friend from the club is doing a wedding photoshoot today.

432
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,550
I came here because you said you couldn't have lunch together.

433
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,640
 By the way, why are they wearing matching hanbok? 

434
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,760
Where's your father? Why is it just you two?

435
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,160
I suppose he needs time alone.

436
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,280
He'll be here soon.

437
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,660
Should we all have dinner together? Let me treat everyone.

438
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,840
Thank you for the offer,

439
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,850
but we spend Mother's memorial day with the family.

440
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:03,680
Anyway, the four of us ran into each other again.

441
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,090
It's nice for many reasons.

442
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,910
"Many reasons"?

443
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,990
Hold on, Yun Woo.

444
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,860
 What is she doing? 

445
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,300
 Han So Jin, don't let this upset you. 

446
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,800
 You lose if you're bothered. 

447
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,820
- Shall we go now? 
 - Yes.

448
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,970
We'll get going now, then.

449
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,240
Call me when you get home, So Jin.

450
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,730
Okay, I'll call you later.

451
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,210
We should go, too. Father is waiting.

452
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,680
Okay.

453
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,190
   

454
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,910
   

455
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,580
If you're so upset, why did you act that way?

456
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,030
Can you tell?

457
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,790
It's so obvious.

458
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,530
I don't know.

459
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,150
To be honest, I'm more upset with Yun Woo than Mi Eun.

460
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:21,940
I feel so disappointed and angry,

461
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,440
but it feels different with him for some reason.

462
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,260
How is he different?

463
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,740
I just like him.

464
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,690
Even when he hurts me.

465
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,100
Will you get hurt again?

466
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,470
So, what I'm feeling is...

467
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,730
even if I get hurt like before,

468
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:48,190
I don't think I'd hate him the same way.

469
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,310
I don't know.

470
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:54,720
Is he special because he's my DNA lover?

471
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,590
 Why do I feel so uneasy? 

472
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,310
About what?

473
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,840
I'm not sure, either.

474
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,310
It might be because of Kang Hoon.

475
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,800
- Kang Hoon? 
 - Yes.

476
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,220
She joins him for his mom's memorial day every year.

477
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,210
You don't see that often in male-female relationships.

478
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,300
Is that right?

479
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:34,990
Of course. You'd have to guard So Jin's side well.

480
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,850
Of course, she'd have to guard your side well, too.

481
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,220
We don't have a regular relationship, either.

482
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,280
Hello, ma'am. I'll have tteokbokki and soondae to go.

483
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,970
Minus liver and intestines.

484
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,350
Give him a lot of liver and intestines.

485
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,090
You fail because you only love one thing.

486
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,540
Try to expand your taste.

487
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,420
Would you like liver and intestines?

488
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,050
No, it's okay.

489
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,930
Geez, you're so stubborn.

490
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,110
Thank you.

491
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,250
You haven't slept all night, right?

492
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,870
Your face looks so tired.

493
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,470
What are you trying to say?

494
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,650
"Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly."

495
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,610
You can never do that if you're too serious.

496
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,170
Try to think lightly.

497
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,470
About what, exactly?

498
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,410
I'm not sure.

499
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,320
What could that be?

500
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,900
What do you think that is?

501
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,870
What do you think? It's tastier than you thought, right?

502
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,680
Here you go, ma'am.

503
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,190
You should tell me what that is, at least.

504
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:21,840
What is the thing you can't do if you're serious?

505
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,940
Are you really curious?

506
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,450
Confessing your love.

507
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,220
You might not be able to do so if you miss the timing.

508
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,300
I told you too much.

509
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,330
Are you okay? Is it good?

510
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,490
It is.

511
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,980
Hello.

512
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,610
- Who's she? 
 - I don't know her.

513
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,440
This is a special treat from me.

514
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,050
I hope you like it.

515
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,130
- You must come here often. 
 - This is my first time.

516
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,300
 The women's passionate look toward Yun Woo. 

517
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,520
 They won't stop paying attention to him. 

518
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,160
 I forgot for a moment. 

519
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,450
 Seven promiscuous octopus legs. 

520
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:45,950
 - His promiscuous Octo-gene is still powerful.  
 - Want to see a movie?

521
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,020
Seriously?

522
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,890
So Jin.

523
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,380
So Jin?

524
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,140
- Yes. 
 - What do you think?

525
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,690
- About what? 
 - The drive-in theater.

526
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,110
You know the film "The Man from Nowhere," right?

527
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:01,330
It's back in theaters. I wanted to watch it with you.

528
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,220
But I can't stand watching blood.

529
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,130
"I'll chew your whole body except for your gold tooth.

530
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,230
I still have one shot left.

531
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,190
This is bulletproof glass, you son of a bitch..." Don't you know that?

532
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,150
Wow, you're exactly like Won Bin.

533
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,720
   

534
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,640
 My DNA lover has to be popular with women. 

535
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,560
 But... 

536
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,650
 it's not like he shows interest in them. 

537
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,460
 I need to adjust myself. 

538
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,120
 I need to stay cool. 

539
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,150
Team Leader Han.

540
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,220
- Yes. 
 - The consultation with the new customer.

541
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,510
I think you'll have to do it.

542
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,480
Me?

543
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,700
 The thing is, she specifically chose you as the consultant. 
   

544
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,260
Come in here.

545
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,010
Just one moment.

546
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,510
I didn't know you were coming.

547
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,820
Have a seat here.

548
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,300
You really came.

549
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,240
Yes, I've always wanted to come.

550
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,370
You came because of the Ménière's disease, right?

551
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,600
Well, yes.

552
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,200
Just one moment. I should have your chart.

553
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,200
Here it is.

554
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,070
I'm not sure which hospital told you that,

555
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:31,180
but I don't see a genetic mutant that could cause Ménière's disease.

556
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:37,490
But your melanocyte-stimulating hormone could become a genetic mutant.

557
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:42,420
A genetic mutant that develops melasma might appear, too.

558
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:48,170
That result sounds worse to me.

559
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,520
Don't worry so much.

560
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,360
Our center has a custom skincare line and

561
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,580
we're developing a highly effective brightening product, too.

562
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,460
I'll think about it.

563
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,210
Those are pretty shoes.

564
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,870
Did Yun Woo gift them to you?

565
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,060
Yes.

566
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,580
By the way, how did you know?

567
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,480
Yun Woo...

568
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,340
really likes that brand.

569
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,740
If you date someone for three years, you end up learning things you don't necessarily

570
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,990
want to know so intimately, I think.

571
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:35,090
That was the case for Yun Woo and me, at least.

572
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,930
So Jin,

573
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,970
did you decide to go out with him?

574
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,880
Yes, it started only recently,

575
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,560
but I'm trying to make things work with him.

576
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,290
What do you like about him, So Jin?

577
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:56,100
It's not like I can pick out one thing I like about him.

578
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,870
He's my destined partner.

579
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,290
Destined partner?

580
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,690
You could say we're destined because

581
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:09,530
we're attracted to each other genetically.

582
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,940
How do you know you're Yun Woo's destined partner?

583
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,080
I can't tell you everything,

584
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,260
but many tests proved it.

585
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,260
I don't understand because I don't believe in destiny,

586
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,130
but it's interesting.

587
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,360
Thank you for the consultation.

588
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,040
I'll think about the skincare line.

589
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,570
Okay. See you then.

590
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,940
Oh, right.

591
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,870
So Jin, would you like a tip?

592
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:48,440
If you want to be with someone, you should never try to possess them.

593
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,230
Especially...

594
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,080
Yun Woo.

595
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,770
He really hates that type.

596
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,320
Well, then...

597
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,930
 My lover has the promiscuous Octo-gene. 

598
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:28,150
 My DNA lover will always have women around him. 

599
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:33,720
 Destiny favors the emotionally detached one. 

600
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:47,200
 If you date someone for three years, you end up learning things you don't necessarily 

601
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,470
 want to know so intimately, I think. 

602
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:53,040
 That was the case for Yun Woo and me, at least. 

603
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,810
 Thank you. 

604
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,430
You started dating only recently, Sunbae.

605
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,240
What's bothering you this time?

606
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,710
Is he a public property or something?

607
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,100
Why would she touch my man?

608
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,020
Think of it as your cross to bear, since your other half has the Octo-gene.

609
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,640
You can't change one's genes.

610
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,330
Change...

611
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,590
one's genes?

612
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,660
- Don't do it. 
 - That's right.

613
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,640
- Don't do it! 
 - I might not be able to change them,

614
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,850
but I can at least improve them.

615
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,420
Because people are supposed to change.

616
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,950
   

617
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,250
 Out of three billion base pairs of genes humans have, 

618
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,470
 only 20,000 of them become manifested. 

619
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,880
 You can't change the base sequence you're born with, 

620
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,480
 but you can change their functions. 

621
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,080
 I'll turn off Yun Woo's cheating gene 

622
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,850
 and out of two billion 999 million 980 thousand genes that didn't manifest, 

623
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:23,820
 I'll find the devoted man gene that's hiding and turn it on. 

624
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,610
 Larry Young, an internationally renowned social neuroscientist, and his team 

625
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,080
 injected the Vasopressin receptor from a male montane vole with 

626
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:38,010
 the devoted man gene into a male prairie vole with the cheater gene. 

627
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:41,460
 And immediately, the cheating vole 

628
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,900
 transformed into a devoted husband. 

629
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,110
 If so... 

630
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:55,320
I brought this just in case it's cold at the theater.

631
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,170
Keep yourself warm.

632
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,300
Thank you.

633
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,290
 It's okay. 

634
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:20,920
 My classmates and teacher are like that, too. 

635
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,040
 My mom told me to say 

636
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,720
 I don't know my address or phone number if I get lost. 

637
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,890
 She wants us to die together whenever she drinks. 

638
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:37,640
 You're worse than the fat bastards 

639
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,290
 who call me poor, Ahjussi. 

640
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,740
Dr. Yuh,

641
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,020
if you cry so much,

642
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,710
you'd lose your muscles.

643
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,670
The muscles in our bodies consist of water.

644
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,580
Losing muscles isn't important right now.

645
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,760
Is your heart made out of stone?

646
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:11,210
That Dark Knight card is everything to that little girl.

647
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:14,430
But she gave it to Ahjussi.

648
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:20,130
She said she won't have anyone to like if she starts hating him, too.

649
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,550
Now I can't even cry if I want to.

650
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,630
You're my coach, not my girlfriend.

651
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,350
I'm sorry, Mr. Yuh.

652
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:34,130
I was joking. Joking.

653
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,460
Call me Jung Tam.

654
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,800
Don't call me Dr. Yuh.

655
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,100
Or call me, "My dear cutie."

656
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,390
Yes, that's right!

657
00:44:55,390 --> 00:45:00,250
That's it! Yes, chew them all up like that!

658
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,950
Nice, nice!

659
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:08,960
You said you can't watch bloody movies. But you totally adjusted.

660
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,770
Well, I keep getting sucked in because the sound is so full, and it feels real.

661
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,210
- Yun Woo. 
 - Yes.

662
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,550
I have something to say.

663
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,250
Okay.

664
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,720
Let's switch to a cheerful mood.

665
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,490
It's too bright. I have something important to say.

666
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:34,280
Important? What kind of mood do you want?

667
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,550
What would be good? Something romantic like this or...

668
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,540
I think that would be good.

669
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,030
This?

670
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,560
Tell me.

671
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,290
Here's a gift.

672
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,430
Another one?

673
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:56,890
The bracelet was enough. What is it?

674
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,510
What's this?

675
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,290
It doesn't look like a perfume.

676
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,500
Is it a hair growth solution again?

677
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,250
No, no. It's nothing like that.

678
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,030
It's called PGS.

679
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,580
It stands for Playboy Gene Suppressor.

680
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,030
Playboy Gene Suppressor?

681
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,120
It's a product I'm developing.

682
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,860
I thought you should try it.

683
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:29,620
You still believe I'm destined to be a cheater, right?

684
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,390
No, it's not like that at all.

685
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,580
It's purely academic—

686
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,910
Fine. I'll use this spray, then.

687
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,100
- Really? 
 - Instead, I have a favor to ask.

688
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,340
- What is it? Ask me anything. 
 - Let's travel abroad together.

689
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,100
Pardon? T-Travel abroad?

690
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,630
Is that a no? I won't use this, then—

691
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,940
No, no, no. Let's go. But how long will we be gone for?

692
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,670
- Six days minimum. 
 - Six days?

693
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,980
My dream is to stay at home for six days.

694
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,420
   

695
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,660
   

696
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:02,240
You'll be happy you traveled. I guarantee it.

697
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,170
   
   

698
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,140
Instead, you'll apply this spray three times a day.

699
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,050
Okay. I'll spray every time I see you. I promise.

700
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,610
- Did it get in your eye? 
 - No, it's okay.

701
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:24,850
Let me see. Hold on.

702
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,970
There's something in your eye.

703
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,260
What is it?

704
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,570
Yun Woo is swimming there like a child.

705
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,220
Splash, splash.

706
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:45,320
All of a sudden, Yun Woo?

707
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,490
Isn't it too soon?

708
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,220
And we're in a car, too.

709
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,240
But still, Yun Woo. This is...

710
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,020
So Jin.

711
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,800
So Jin?

712
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,880
The seat switch.

713
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,930
Press the other way.

714
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,860
You can press with your index finger.

715
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,390
 There you are. 

716
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,220
Like that.

717
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,950
 Who are you? 

718
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:19,450
 You came all the way here because of that girl? 

719
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:21,800
 I'm her next-door neighbor. 

720
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,430
 The lord shines the light in our hearts. 

721
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:48,370
Have faith in his grace and confess your sin.

722
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,400
Father,

723
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,210
do you know why I can't...

724
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,930
get out of the armoire?

725
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,890
Go ahead and tell me.

726
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,750
I once...

727
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:14,340
had a friend, too.

728
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,090
Her name was Yoon Hye.

729
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,170
But I...

730
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,330
ignored her death.

731
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,880
There were kids who bullied her.

732
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,220
That day was...

733
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,630
 the second night of our school trip. 

734
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:51,520
 They came to the room Yoon Hye and I were in, 

735
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,670
 beat her up like crazy and took her to the rooftop. 

736
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,270
 I kept thinking if I should get out of the armoire. 

737
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:08,730
 Should I get out or not? Should I get out or not? 

738
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,910
 But I couldn't get out. 

739
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,360
I should've gotten out.

740
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,470
I should've stopped them.

741
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,880
 But at that moment... 

742
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,690
 Because I didn't get out of the armoire, Yoon Hye died. 

743
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,620
But I still want to hide.

744
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,690
So, no one could find me.

745
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,670
So...

746
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,580
I don't have to make any decisions.

747
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,630
Sister Anna.

748
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,800
Yes, Father.

749
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,230
Some trees usually don't have flowers,

750
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,660
but they blossom after burning in fire.

751
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:45,130
You had a heartache in life.

752
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,180
But it's probably for you to blossom.

753
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:55,900
You'll soon be able to smile brightly like a flower.

754
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,540
And your loved one who passed...

755
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:10,410
will be resurrected as a flower inside your heart.

756
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,380
H-Honey.

757
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:00,040
It took a long time...

758
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,830
for me to pack my stuff and leave this house.

759
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:05,440
I'll send the divorce papers through Mr. Goo.

760
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,690
Sign it and send it back.

761
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,250
W-What are you doing, Honey?

762
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,100
I never cared you dated other women.

763
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,400
You never cared? You always watched me.

764
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,940
Wherever and whenever.

765
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,680
Even when I traveled abroad.

766
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,240
I'm sorry. I'll never do it again.

767
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,920
Please don't divorce me, at least.

768
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,790
Ha Ga Hui is gone, too now.

769
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:36,320
Even the woman who held you back by getting pregnant is gone—

770
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:43,350
You're the one who wanted her to die the most.

771
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,040
So...

772
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,130
what exactly did you do to her?

773
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,690
Are you...

774
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:58,000
accusing me right now?

775
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,980
How despicable.

776
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:07,520
You kept Yun Woo by your side his whole life with a heartbroken face like that.

777
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:16,600
I don't care what you tell me right now.

778
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,790
What's important is that our family can start over.

779
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,290
Only you need to come back.

780
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,040
No, that's not going to happen.

781
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,530
Do you still not get it?

782
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,840
Why does time pass so quickly whenever I'm with you?

783
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,400
Isn't that a good thing?

784
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,620
Not so much.

785
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,270
I want time to pass very slowly.

786
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:14,110
So it feels like we've been together for a long time.

787
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,830
Just one second.

788
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,230
Okay.

789
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,330
Yes, Mother.

790
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:25,030
 Yun Woo, I need to talk to you 

791
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:29,090
Let's talk later unless it's really important. I'm busy right now.

792
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,330
 It's important. 

793
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,580
 We're getting divorced. 

794
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,790
That's great.

795
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:48,080
You can enjoy your life now.

796
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,460
I'll hang up.

797
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:00,960
Is something going on with your mother?

798
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,800
It's nothing.

799
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,430
Go inside.

800
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,230
- I'll go, then. 
 - Okay.

801
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,170
 ­  

802
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,240
- You came, Yun Woo. 
 - Yes.

803
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,750
Hyung, you haven't come at this hour in a while.

804
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:47,480
I know. I felt like drinking after dropping So Jin off.

805
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,320
Is something going on?

806
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,850
You need to eat while drinking.

807
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,400
What's going on?

808
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,970
Kang Hoon,

809
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,550
I think my parents are finally getting divorced.

810
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,600
All of a sudden?

811
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,550
It was bound to happen, you know.

812
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,000
So, how about you?

813
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,400
I said it's a good thing.

814
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:41,180
I asked her to finally live her life. That's what I said.

815
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,950
I was asking how you're feeling.

816
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:46,810
I don't know.

817
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:55,120
It feels strange because what I've been hoping for is about to happen.

818
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,650
I didn't think it'd be...

819
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:00,730
surprising or different at all.

820
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:12,770
Come on. I'm fine. It's not a big deal.

821
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,650
Not a big deal, my foot.

822
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,420
Kang Hoon,

823
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,500
do you believe in destiny?

824
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,890
Destiny?

825
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:26,040
Seeing my parents my whole life,

826
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:30,440
I believed there's no such thing as destiny.

827
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,330
The moment you believe you're meant to be with someone,

828
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:38,360
you enter hell together. That's what I thought.

829
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,020
But strangely,

830
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:46,510
I found a woman I want to believe is meant to be with me.

831
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,670
It's giving me such a headache.

832
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,100
I'm doing things I've never done before.

833
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,940
You're talking about So Jin.

834
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:21,060
 Couples take photos to cherish their moments together. 

835
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:28,170
 The photos capture their time together alone and nothing else. 

836
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:32,270
 If we could show our feelings like photos, 

837
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,840
 would there be no longer heartaches? 

838
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:13,790
   

839
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,650
It's off again.

840
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:35,900
My stupid timing.

841
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,270
Mi Eun, what are you doing here so early?

842
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,280
My mom sent me abalone.

843
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,160
I wanted to share it with you.

844
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,170
I'd like to talk to you, too.

845
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,690
Can we have a coffee together?

846
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,000
Yes.

847
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,090
Come in for a moment.

848
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:08,480
One, two, three.

849
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,590
Ta-da.

850
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:12,250
Daebak.

851
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,940
Dad wanted to feed you and Ah Ri with something healthy.

852
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:19,310
Hyung Chul is the only one who cares about me.

853
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:24,060
Should we invite Yun Woo and share it with him?

854
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:28,470
Oh, okay. Let's eat it with him.

855
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,440
What did you want to talk about?

856
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,240
Yun Woo,

857
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,770
to be honest, I...

858
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:58,710
   

859
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,190
So Jin is calling you.

860
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,900
So Jin, what's with the video chats this morning?

861
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,790
 Hello, So Jin. 

862
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:24,510
 I stopped by to give Yun Woo abalone. 

863
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:26,780
 See you again sometime. 

864
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,900
 Is something going on? 

865
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,790
Well, I... I wanted to tell you something.

866
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:36,910
 - What is it?  
 - It's nothing.

867
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:38,810
I'll talk to you later.

868
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:42,280
Have fun with Mi Eun, then.

869
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:46,340
 So Jin, should we have lunch together today? 

870
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:52,550
No, I-I'm going to Han River to exercise right now.

871
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:54,870
I'll hang up, Yun Woo.

872
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:04,490
No woman visits her male friend who lives alone on a Sunday morning.

873
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:08,340
I'm sure she slept there last night.

874
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,760
I'll try calling him.

875
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,980
What are you doing? Is something going on?

876
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:16,870
Can Yun Woo not be with Mi Eun on a Sunday morning

877
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:20,540
looking straight out of the shower?

878
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:23,700
I'm sure there's an explanation.

879
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,790
You can't get away from trash if you refuse to doubt him.

880
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:29,040
He's not trash, okay?

881
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,470
Should we go to Han River for a run? Think about it while running.

882
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:33,360
I'll go alone.

883
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:36,040
Shit!

884
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:46,190
Mi Eun, lock the door behind you.

885
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:48,200
I'll go.

886
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:51,160
Yun Woo!

887
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:59,670
How powerful is his Octo-gene that even the PGS doesn't work?

888
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,940
What? What's this? Geez!

889
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,210
  ­ 

890
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,950
   

891
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,420
   

892
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,180
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

893
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:43,220
Why is it suddenly raining?

894
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:51,030
   

895
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:55,430
I said I wanted to be alone.

896
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:04,010
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

897
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,480
 The phone is powered off. 

898
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:17,150
This is crazy. This is crazy.

899
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:19,350
How did he find me here?

900
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:25,590
So Jin! Hold on!

901
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:34,690
What are you doing here, Yun Woo? Are you here for a run?

902
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:38,140
The weather was nice, but it suddenly started raining.

903
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:40,780
Stop acting cool. It's not like you.

904
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,420
Ask me. I'll explain everything.

905
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,530
It's a misunderstanding.

906
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:52,970
Get ugly.

907
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:56,110
I really want you to get ugly.

908
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,940
I wish my DNA lover were ugly.

909
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,410
I want him to be rude, have poor taste, not a doctor,

910
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:06,240
and I want him to be poor, too.

911
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,740
So he can only look at me.

912
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,400
So Jin,

913
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,600
can't you tell how much I like you?

914
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:54,210
 Now there's someone who finds Han So Jin before I do. 

915
01:06:56,070 --> 01:07:05,820


916
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:15,310
 Thinking about it, I always found her too late. 

917
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:20,090
 I was late to save Ahjussi, too.

 So Jin is like my family. 

923
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,300
 It's none of your business, then. 

924
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:49,960
 Would things have changed if I learned my feelings sooner? 

925
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,670
 Confessing your love.

 I said, I love you. Very much.

 What's easy for you can be difficult for someone, So Jin.

 A woman with anxious attachment
