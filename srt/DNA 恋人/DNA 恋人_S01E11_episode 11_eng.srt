1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,500
   

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,420
   

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,930
   

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,580
   

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,350
   

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:35,020
   

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,690
   

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,050
   

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,000
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm really okay.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,620
I can walk straight. Straight. Look.

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,390
No, I'm okay. Goodbye, sir.

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,350
- You drank a lot. 
 - Thank you for the meal.

13
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,040
- Send her home quickly. 
 - Get in. Get in.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,790
Here, here. I'm going in.

15
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,700
Let's go in.

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:08,990


17
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,340
   

18
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,300
The uniform was...

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,170
Kang Hoon's?

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,140
No way.

21
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,410
Yun Woo was proven by the tests.

22
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,620
No, no.

23
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,350
The pheromone.

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,220
There was the pheromone.

25
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,850
Yes, that was definitely heaven's scent.

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,110
 You must bark if you smell it on a man. Woof, woof. 

27
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,240
Maybe Shy stopped, not because of Mayo...

28
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,500
 - Noona!  
 - but because of Kang Hoon?

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,100
Yes, the promiscuous Octo-gene!

30
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,160
Yes, if the uniform was Kang Hoon's,

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,940
the Octo-gene couldn't have been detected. Yes, right.

32
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,520
Sunbae, what are you still doing here?

33
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,410
Ah Ri,

34
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,250
the uniform was Kang Hoon's, not Yun Woo's.

35
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,730
What?

36
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,900
If so, my DNA lover is...

37
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,810
Have you been mistaken about everything, then?

38
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,010
Then, the Sewer and promiscuous Octo-gene was Seo Kang Hoon?

39
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,080
Daebak.

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,190
No, no, no. There must be an error.

41
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,570
There's no way the Octo-gene was found in Kang Hoon.

42
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,990
You never know. The activation might've been suppressed.

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,210
   

44
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,540
He's my perfect DNA lover.

45
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,380
 - One, two, dumpling soup. 
 - Dumpling soup. 

46
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,690
 So Jin! 

47
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,460
 So Jin! 

48
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,040
Scientists shouldn't believe what they want to believe.

49
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,810
You need to prove it.

50
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,200
   

51
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:05,710
   

52
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,240
Excuse me, I'll have tteokbokki and a lot of fishcake broth.

53
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,020
Thank you.

54
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,150
Do you usually talk that much when you're drunk?

55
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,910
You scared me.

56
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:41,410
Do you come here when I'm here on purpose?

57
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,530
No, I don't.

58
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,120
But I did wait for you today.

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,820
Me? Why?

60
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,100
Is that your usual drunken habit?

61
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,950
Drunken habit?

62
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,180
What do you mean...

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,770
♪  Turn it all back  ♪

64
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,130
 Kang Hoon, 

65
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,460
 love always... 

66
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,360
 comes back. 

67
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,510
♪  Turn it all back  ♪

68
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,010
♪  Turn it all back  ♪

69
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,390
 Why are you doing this? 

70
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,160
 Kang Hoon, I'm really... 

71
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,820
 I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. 

72
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,050
 I'm really, really sorry. 

73
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,490
 I love you. 

74
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,520
 There's... 

75
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,130
 Han So Jin in here. 

76
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,630
What were you talking about last night, anyway?

77
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,680
- What did I say? 
 - You really don't remember?

78
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,820
You brought up the uniform and DNA.

79
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,380
Anyway, don't confuse Yun Woo and So Jin again.

80
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,280
I even brought that up.

81
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,320
Okay, Kang Hoon. Fine.

82
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,680
Let's become friends, then.

83
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,020
Since we're sharing secrets.

84
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,880
I know it's childish, but a secret is a secret.

85
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,910
Secret?

86
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,680
The secret that Yun Woo isn't So Jin's man of fate, and...

87
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,340
the fact that you're So Jin's DNA partner.

88
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,920
 Let's keep holding hands. 

89
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,300
 I just want to. 

90
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,080
Are you okay?

91
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,440
Gosh, this keeps happening because of my allergy.

92
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,350
 I'm sorry, So Jin. 

93
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,220
 Kang Hoon received these at the award ceremony today. 

94
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,610
 Right, the day I had the allergic reaction because of Yun Woo's flowers, 

95
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,530
 Kang Hoon received flowers, too. 

96
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,950
Ahjussi, when is Kang Hoon coming back?

97
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,300
He's already back.

98
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,710
He says he needs to sweat to wake up or something.

99
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,940
He went out to exercise.

100
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,230
 I'm getting off work now. Where are you? 
   

101
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,790
 I'm sorry, Yun Woo. 

102
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,540
 I have something important going on today. 

103
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,950
 Should I wait until you're done? 

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,800
 No. I'll call you later. 

105
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,810
What? She's making me curious.

106
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,110
Kang Hoon! Let's talk for a second!

107
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,390
- What is it? 
 - Geez!

108
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,790
Hey, this is important!

109
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,610
I'm listening.

110
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,530
Remember bringing flowers to your sushi place on the day of the award ceremony?

111
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,480
What time did you receive those flowers?

112
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,950
I don't know. I don't remember.

113
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,550
Try to remember it.

114
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,080
What time was the ceremony?

115
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,710
I said I don't know.

116
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,330
What time was it?

117
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,480
- Maybe around 11. 
 - 11?

118
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,950
What time did you receive the flowers, then?

119
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,720
Why are you asking?

120
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,120
I'll explain the details later.

121
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,250
Try to remember what time you received the flowers.

122
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,880
 Jung Tam. 

123
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,400
 Looks like you came for lunch. 

124
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,340
 Yes, we attended the fire department award ceremony 

125
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,640
 and stopped by on the way back. 

126
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,120
I think it was around 12.

127
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,930
What?

128
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,850
 - Jung Tam. 
 - Because of Seo Kang Hoon, 

129
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,860
 I might've had an allergic reaction. 

130
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,110
 If so... 

131
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,690
 It's weird. 

132
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,710
 It's dinnertime. And you don't come to the Han River alone. 

133
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,760
 I just felt like running today, okay? Are you happy? 

134
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,750
 If so, the telepathy... 

135
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,070
   

136
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,260
What's wrong with her?

137
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,190
She's so weird.

138
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,190
♫  Countless days  ♫

139
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,070
♫  Overwhelmed by the weight of my heart  ♫

140
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,310
♫  Overwhelmed by the weight of my heart  ♫

141
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,380
♫  Repeating over and over again  ♫

142
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,700
♫  I’m shaking  ♫

143
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,710
♫  Wanting to let go  ♫

144
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:34,200
♫  You are like a gift to me  ♫

145
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,430
♫  Consoling me gently  ♫

146
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,760
   

147
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,580
♫  I feel like I could give you  ♫

148
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,010
 You can write a promise, maybe. 

149
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,880
 One you want to keep a year later. 

150
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,940
 A relationship that can end anytime. 

151
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,330
 I suppose that's the relationship style you prefer. 

152
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,820
♫  When I circle around you  ♫

153
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,750
 Half of love is about waiting on the other side. 

154
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,960
 I'm approaching slowly. 

155
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,350
 Let's meet in front of the Slow Mailbox again. 

156
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,630
   

157
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,350
   

158
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,240
   

159
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,780
How long will you do this?

160
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,290
Would you accept your woman taking a body profile photo with another man?

161
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,300
Well, you know...

162
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,380
I even accepted them being lovey-dovey in front of me, wearing matching purple sweats.

163
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,150
That's not the issue.

164
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,860
She never said anything and never discussed it with me.

165
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,270
I'm more disappointed and upset about that.

166
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,720
Don't you think she didn't tell you to keep her relationship with you?

167
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,060
- No, I don't. 
 - Don't answer it, then.

168
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,130
Don't answer it even if she were injured.

169
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,720
W-Will you go that far?

170
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,460
- How about you? 
 - Me?

171
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,210
   

172
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,280
- H-Hello? Yun Woo. 
  - Yes, So Jin. 

173
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,930
Should we meet using telepathy like we did before?

174
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,900
 We'll meet at either Han River or Namsan. 

175
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,720
Sounds good. How about at seven?

176
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,320
 I have a meeting near Yeongdeungpo today. 

177
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,720
 I'll leave around six from there. 

178
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,020
I'll send a lot of telepathic messages until we meet. Okay?

179
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,480
What's this now, man?

180
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,020
Hyung, I think you owe me a lot.

181
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,140
When will you return the favor?

182
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,980
What do I owe you?

183
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,340
A-Anchorwoman No Min Jeong, the woman you dumped five years ago

184
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,220
I confessed my love to her while comforting her.

185
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,130
To be honest, I liked her before you did.

186
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,480
Good job.

187
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,140
But she married into the Global Group family. You don't need to bring that up.

188
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,450
Anything else you owe me?

189
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,030
I mentioned your name at your regular brunch café

190
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,080
and got their new dishes for free a few times.

191
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,640
- And? 
 - On your desk, I saw...

192
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,820
A choco— Do I have to mention all this?

193
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,580
You committed many sins, Hyung.

194
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,570
I'll give you a chance to make up for it now.

195
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,820
If you do me a favor, I'll give you the hotel coupon I never gave you last time.

196
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,890
Favor, my foot. You snake.

197
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,520
Don't you need the hotel coupon? Should we forget about it?

198
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,800
Sung Mi would love it because it's a suite on the rooftop.

199
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,130
Bye, then.

200
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,540
Do you need my body or brain?

201
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,770
Han So Jin is heading toward the Yeongdeungpo Station.

202
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,250
 Yeongdeungpo Station. 

203
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,310
Okay, let's go.

204
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,710
That's great!

205
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,200
- Really. 
 - Seriously!

206
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,320
 ­  

207
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,980
Line 2 goes to Jamsil. Is she going to the Han River?

208
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,420
The Han River isn't only in Jamsil, Hyung.

209
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,430
Don't get distracted, and keep following her.

210
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,280
 This stop is Jamsil, Songpa-gu Station. 

211
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,980
 The exit is to your right. 

212
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,320
 This stop is... 

213
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,780
Bingo, it's Jamsil.

214
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,010
It was the Han River. Over.

215
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,800
I was right, wasn't I—

216
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,700
Hel—

217
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,520
Cocky bastard. He hung up on me.

218
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,100
I'm letting it go because of the coupon.

219
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,530
Dr. Yuh Jung Tam?

220
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,270
It really wasn't a coincidence.

221
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,280
Yun Woo and I had a telepathic connection.

222
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,080
She must be around.

223
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,890
Yes, Hyung.

224
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,710
No, she's not here yet.

225
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,260
Yes.

226
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,810
Okay, I'll send you the coupon now.

227
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,280
Have fun with Sung Mi.

228
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,820
You're sure So Jin got off at the Jamsil Station, right?

229
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,520
If she did, she should be here by now.

230
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,350
Okay, then. Bye.

231
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,900
She should be here.

232
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,610
Yes, So Jin. Where are you?

233
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,310
 Well... 

234
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,290
 I'm almost at Namsan. 

235
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,800
 I see the Palgakjeong. 

236
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,490
 Where are you, Yun Woo? 

237
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,530
Namsan?

238
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,310
I see.

239
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,290
I'm on my way there, too.

240
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,560
Our telepathic connection worked today, too.

241
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,450
By the way, I'm sorry.

242
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,970
There was a crash right in front of me.

243
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,990
I'll be a bit late. Would that be okay?

244
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,990
 - Yes.  
 - I'm so sorry—

245
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,730
- Did you do this last time, too? 
 - So Jin.

246
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,890
Did you find out where I was going using Jung Tam?

247
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,990
I wanted to make you happy somehow.

248
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,340
But I'm sorry.

249
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,440
- I want to ask you something. 
 - Okay.

250
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,600
That uniform...

251
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,600
Was it really yours?

252
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,110
No.

253
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,120
Kang Hoon and I had the same number that day.

254
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,450
You took Kang Hoon's uniform.

255
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,220
Wait...

256
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,840
Why haven't you told me that all this time?

257
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,940
I wasn't trying to lie. No matter what the reason was,

258
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,710
we're dating because we like each other. I didn't think it was important.

259
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,520
You should've been honest with me regarding the uniform or the telepathy.

260
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,530
You're basically lying.

261
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,650
So, are you unhappy right now?

262
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,340
Are you unhappy?

263
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,440
No.

264
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,440
I'm not unhappy.

265
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,570
But we can become unhappy someday.

266
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,670
Just like with my ex-boyfriends who weren't my DNA lovers,

267
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,570
I can have a bad breakup with you, too.

268
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,760
Why are you so obsessed with the past?

269
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,540
Look at us now. We're happy.

270
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,410
But still, it feels like you used my belief.

271
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:45,170
I think we should take time to think things through.

272
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,880
- What? 
 - I'm sorry.

273
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,950
So Jin.

274
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,420
So Jin!

275
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,710
I used her?

276
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,510
Why would she say that? Seriously...

277
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:10,910
But still. How could she say stuff like that so easily?

278
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,690
What did I do wrong, exactly?

279
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,280
- Excuse me? 
 - Huh?

280
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,000
I can't believe this.

281
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,900
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

282
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,040
I can't believe this.

283
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,700
Why aren't you getting in?

284
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,600
Or don't press the button.

285
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,210
Okay, I'm sorry.

286
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,850
Could I have another glass of this?

287
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,330
I'll have the same, too.

288
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,610
It's Yun Woo.

289
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,310
You always show up when it's time to drink.

290
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,310
As if we have a telepathic connection.

291
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,970
You're talking about that, too?

292
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,270
What?

293
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,560
Does telepathy even exist?

294
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,710
What do you mean by that?

295
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,270
She wants time off.

296
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,540
I won't make excuses.

297
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,600
I accidentally said it when I was drinking at Kang Hoon's restaurant.

298
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,890
That you and So Jin aren't DNA partners.

299
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,520
I was drunk, but—

300
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,690
It's okay. That's not a big deal.

301
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,220
That's not an important factor in relationships.

302
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,950
Whether we're DNA partners or not...

303
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,950
doesn't matter.

304
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,350
This is actually for the better.

305
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,610
I felt guilty pretending to be So Jin's DNA lover.

306
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,470
What's important is that...

307
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,370
I don't want to break up yet.

308
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:35,250
Are you confident you won't hurt So Jin?

309
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,900
To be honest,

310
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,380
you'd eventually break up with her. Won't you?

311
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,990
She's looking for someone she'd never break up with.

312
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,920
She's looking for the one she'd marry and stay together forever.

313
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,610
Can you be that kind of a man for her?

314
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,180
If you aren't confident, you should stop now.

315
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,340
   

316
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,320
She gives up way too easily.

317
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,000
I would've answered if she called just once more.

318
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,190
 Dr. Yuh, Ms. Nam Sung Mi is here. 

319
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,370
Have a seat, Ms. Nam.

320
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,220
You were diagnosed with hypothalamic amenorrhea last time.

321
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,190
Your leptin level is back to normal.

322
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,990
Did you have any other symptoms?

323
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,990
Such as mood swings, headaches, or blushing.

324
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:22,620
I'm not here to be examined today.

325
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,400
Because you didn't answer my calls,

326
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,820
I came to see you.

327
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,790
I'm sorry I let you get the wrong idea.

328
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,560
I want to apologize properly.

329
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,530
Why do you look so tired?

330
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,450
You're making me feel bad.

331
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,500
Did you skip food and couldn't sleep because of me, by chance?

332
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,510
Yes.

333
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,590
Don't cry. Don't cry.

334
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,960
Do you accept my apology?

335
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,400
I'll forget about it. I'll forget about it.

336
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,850
I'll forget about the muscular man. Don't worry.

337
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,140
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

338
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,550
I want the stir-fried pork today.

339
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,330
No, no. How about malatang, Sunbae?

340
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,110
- And tanghulu, too? 
 - Let's do it.

341
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,610
- Tanghulu? 
 - Tanghulu?

342
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,640
 I wanted to make you happy somehow. 

343
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,980
 But I'm sorry. 

344
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,040
He knew how desperate I was!

345
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,610
Huh? What? Why? Me?

346
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,530
It's nothing.

347
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,030
What's wrong with her?

348
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,190
How could he tell a lie like that?

349
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,960
How could he lie that he was my DNA lover?

350
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,450
Did I do something wrong?

351
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:05,470
   

352
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,720
Hurry, hurry!

353
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,570
Hurry.

354
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,230
   

355
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,450
Thank you.

356
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,450
Hyung.

357
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,470
- Both the mother and baby are safe. 
 - What a relief.

358
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,190
Are you busy, Hyung? Can we talk for a second?

359
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,120
Sure.

360
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,320
Oh, my God. He's totally my type.

361
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,660
Seo Kang Hoon is so handsome.

362
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,970
Why is he so cool? He makes my heart flutter.

363
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,400
Aigoo, you said Dr. Shim was your favorite. You're switching?

364
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,590
You're so easy.

365
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,870
His broad shoulders and the golden ratio. So awesome.

366
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,480
What am I going to do?

367
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,380
What are you going to do?

368
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,440
Not everyone has the golden ratio.

369
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,970
Have you heard of the Shim ratio?

370
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,100
From the hairline to the eyebrows,

371
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,860
from the eyebrows to the nose tip, and from the nose tip to the chin.

372
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,850
It's 1:1:1, the perfect golden ratio.

373
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,300
And even his brain is sexy.

374
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,690
To show his ideal human side,

375
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,750
he got one question wrong on purpose on the entrance exam.

376
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,450
Every nurse in our hospital knows that.

377
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,030
Did you see Kang Hoon caring for Ms. Han So Jin?

378
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,530
He was so devoted.

379
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,600
Seriously. I'll put the IV drip on me and become a patient.

380
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,350
You're driving me crazy. Seriously...

381
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,680
Could you get me Ms. Kim Ji An's ultrasound result?

382
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,660
Firefighter Seo Kang Hoon versus Assistant Director Shim Yun Woo.

383
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,170
Which team would you choose?

384
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,220
- Doo-goo-doo-goo-doo-goo. 
 - Doo-goo-doo-goo-doo-goo.

385
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,290
The ultrasound.

386
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,800
How are things with So Jin these days?

387
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,840
Oh, right.

388
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,190
You don't keep secrets from each other.

389
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,900
Why do you ask? Did she say something?

390
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,650
She didn't tell me anything.

391
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,980
Hyung, I'm sure she's having a hard time.

392
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,040
Try talking to her.

393
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,660
I guess she needs some time.

394
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,110
You should understand her.

395
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,040
You know why she's looking for her DNA lover.

396
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,860
I do.

397
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,550
That's why it's hard.

398
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,980
I don't believe in having a DNA lover,

399
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:58,690
but I can see that she's happy when she's with you.

400
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,680
As you said, DNA isn't everything.

401
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,190
As long as you're happy together.

402
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,910
So, you should approach her first.

403
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,620
I stole too much of your time.

404
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,030
I'll go now.

405
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,810
Don't worry about me.

406
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,460
There are many ways to make her feel better.

407
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,060
I don't worry.

408
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,080
Thank you. Let's go.

409
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,140
Sunbae.

410
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,840
It's burning.

411
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,490
Sunbae?

412
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,590
What's going on?

413
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,430
Ma'am, we'll have another bottle.

414
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,200
Okay.

415
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,400
Well, we're closing now.

416
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,050
T-Thank you.

417
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,010
Sunbaenim, it's over now.

418
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,590
Okay.

419
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,790
It's not over!

420
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,760
I haven't done anything yet.

421
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,500
Pardon?

422
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,030
Is this how it ends?

423
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,960
Is it over with my DNA lover?

424
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,890
How could he steal my heart and fool me like this?

425
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,040
Shim Yun Woo, you bastard.

426
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,080
Screw the DNA!

427
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,680
DNA? What?

428
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,510
I'm sorry. She's sick. I'll take care of her.

429
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,450
I'll pay.

430
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,120
Why did you drink so much?

431
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,620
How could he do that?

432
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,110
We'll go ahead and pay now.

433
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,570
Yes, I need to be somewhere tomorrow.

434
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,870
I'll join you for the next gathering.

435
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,750
 I want to end everything as you wanted. 

436
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,530
 Come home at seven on Friday. 

437
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,150
Seriously, how much did I drink last night?

438
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,660
- I think I'm dying. 
 - You have no idea.

439
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,390
How can you chug soju like that?

440
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,790
I know.

441
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,350
I didn't know you were such a lush until yesterday.

442
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,910
You should've stopped me. I really feel...

443
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,650
- Gosh. 
 - Seriously.

444
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,180
It's not like you listened to us.

445
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,050
You were crying and screaming.

446
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,260
That was a good restaurant.

447
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,960
I won't be able to go back for a while because of you.

448
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,060
That's not the only good place. You can go somewhere else.

449
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,470
I'd miss that anchovy sauce.

450
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,800
- I'll find you another one. 
 - I could tell it was from Jeju.

451
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,140
Ma'am, you came.

452
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,970
I came to say goodbye because I won't be able to come in for a while.

453
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:14,530
I've been coming here because of you. I'm sad.

454
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,380
What's wrong, Ms. Yum?

455
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,950
Will you stop getting the anti-aging treatment?

456
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,270
I no longer need it.

457
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,380
My husband and I are getting divorced.

458
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:31,470
Thinking about it, I've been in unrequited love with him for over 30 years.

459
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,250
But I'm thinking of quitting now.

460
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,970
Well...

461
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,390
I'm not sure if this would comfort you,

462
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:56,970
but that's not unrequited love.

463
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,550
Maybe you weren't meant to be with him,

464
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:06,260
but you mistakenly chose to believe you were.

465
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,990
It's too late to go back at my age.

466
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,100
I have a son.

467
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:24,190
My whole life, I thought he was hurt because of my husband.

468
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:29,730
But I keep thinking I hurt him these days.

469
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,570
Do you know what hurts me the most?

470
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,750
When someone told me that my son can't love anyone

471
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:43,560
and he's always having unsatisfying relationships,

472
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,620
I thought it was because he took after his father.

473
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,040
But that wasn't it.

474
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,810
It was my fault.

475
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,240
All he saw was our marriage, and that was the world he knew.

476
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,010
He probably had no choice.

477
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,210
You shouldn't think that.

478
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:11,230
I couldn't see my son because loving my husband was so hard.

479
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,350
There isn't much time left,

480
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:19,270
but I want to tell my son that I'm sorry.

481
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:23,790
What do you mean, there isn't much time left?

482
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,270
I'd better get going now.

483
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,340
Thank you...

484
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,210
for everything.

485
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,870
Yes.

486
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:40,710
Come by for some tea like today from time to time.

487
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,590
I hope my son meets someone like you,

488
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,700
Ms. Han.

489
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,580
So Jin,

490
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,150
I know you don't want to talk to me right now,

491
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,400
but please listen for a moment.

492
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,380
DNA isn't important to me.

493
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,850
I just wanted to be someone you'd like.

494
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,200
But I ended up hurting you...

495
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,620
unintentionally. I'm truly sorry.

496
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:55,250
Could you please understand me?

497
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,760
I know...

498
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,500
you didn't do that with bad intentions.

499
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:18,250
But you said that getting hurt requires permission, too.

500
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,450
I hate to get hurt more than anything.

501
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,690
I let you hurt me because it was you, Yun Woo.

502
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,460
Because I believed we were destined partners.

503
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,870
But you weren't actually my destined partner.

504
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,670
It's still hard to accept that.

505
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,410
So, please give me some time.

506
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,550
♫  Someday, when I circle around you  ♫

507
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,550
♫  Someday, when I circle around you  ♫

508
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,970
♫  You hold my hand without a word  ♫

509
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,210
♫  You hold my hand without a word  ♫

510
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,850
♫  Leaning on myself is overwhelming  ♫

511
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,590
♫  Leaning on myself is overwhelming  ♫

512
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:21,990
♫  I find myself falling into your arms  ♫

513
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,150
♫  I find myself falling into your arms  ♫

514
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,880
Are you okay?

515
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,700
I'm not so sure.

516
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,910
I don't know how I feel or how Yun Woo feels.

517
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,710
- Why do you say that? 
 - He's been...

518
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,000
pretending to be my DNA lover for me.

519
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,890
How was that for me, exactly?

520
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,360
He could've thought that.

521
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,500
How is that possible?

522
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,190
I can't bring myself to understand.

523
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,950
You dummy!

524
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:36,150
Try to understand not with your head, but your heart.

525
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,630
He probably didn't do that on purpose.

526
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,150
It's because he likes you.

527
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,800
He doesn't even believe in destiny,

528
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,090
but he pretended to be your DNA lover. It couldn't have been easy.

529
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,040
You know his personality, too.

530
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,220
Do you still not understand?

531
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,970
I don't know.

532
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,440
You're all grown up now. You know how to say stuff like this.

533
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,900
Don't touch me. I'm sweaty.

534
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,530
You little.

535
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,950
 Come to the greenhouse. 

536
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,630
- Yes. 
  - Is this Mr. Shim Yun Woo? 

537
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:45,910
 There was a fire at a greenhouse in a residence in Seongbuk-dong this afternoon. 

538
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,980
 The fire was successfully put out, 

539
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,200
 but a man in his 50s, A, died from the accident... 

540
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:10,240
 and a woman in her 50s, B, is still unconscious. 

541
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,370
 According to the police, a journal written by B that appears to be 

542
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,460
 a suicide note was found at the scene. 

543
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,500
 The police are assuming she attempted suicide. 

544
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,430
 The fire department said the fire started from the inside. 

545
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:28,540
 They're currently investigating the exact cause and the extent of the damage. 

546
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,670
Mom!

547
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,130
Mom!

548
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,630
Mr. Shim Yun Woo?

549
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,310
This is her journal found in her residence.

550
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,760
Pardon?

551
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:53,830
It appears she planned suicide for a long time.

552
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,710
Are you okay?

553
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,670
I heard you knew them.

554
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,110
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

555
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,680
Hi.

556
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,390
Team Leader Han, you haven't heard, right?

557
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:33,270
Yun Woo's father died in a fire.

558
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,420
 We ask you to care for his soul. 

559
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:51,350
Please let him have a joyful funeral with hopes for heaven and resurrection.

560
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,570
Please give heavenly comfort to the family

561
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:58,200
who loved him, easing the pain of temporarily saying goodbye,

562
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,240
and let the Holy Spirit be with them so they will not grieve.

563
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,580
 Amen. 

564
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,660
Hang in there.

565
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:10,500
By the way, I heard the arsonist who killed him was his wife.

566
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,460
The murder motive is clear.

567
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,600
She was in pain her whole life because of the director's adultery.

568
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,010
You should be mourning. That's enough.

569
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:23,220
It must've been tough for the Assistant Director to grow up in that environment.

570
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:39,700
Yun Woo looks fine on the outside, but he must be hurting a lot.

571
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,530
I don't see even a single relative of his.

572
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:45,560
Right. You know, too, right?

573
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,980
Yun Woo's mother was your client.

574
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,880
Who?

575
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,770
Ms. Yum Jang Mi.

576
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:00,810
You didn't know she was Director Shim's wife?

577
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:08,340
She didn't fill out the family information on the membership form.

578
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,810
She begged us to keep it a secret.

579
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,630
 There isn't much time left, 

580
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,640
 but I want to... 

581
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,240
 tell my son that I'm sorry. 

582
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,850
 Should I tell Yun Woo? 

583
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:18,430
 You shouldn't have said you loved her if you'd change so easily. 

584
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,190
 I'll leave now. Pardon me. 

585
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,630
 Yun Woo... 

586
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,140
 Why did I do that? 

587
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,400
No matter how much I hated him...

588
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,640
   

589
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,080
   

590
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,100
 Why don't you answer my call? 

591
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:23,500
 I'm in front of your mother's hospital room right now. 

592
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:28,820
 There's something I need to tell you. 

593
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,470
I'm here.

594
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,850
It's Team Leader Han So Jin.

595
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:54,570
The day you visited me for the last time,

596
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:57,570
did you...

597
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:04,020
want me to stop you, by chance?

598
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,090
   

599
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:36,750
 I'm thinking of taking a trip somewhere warm for a bit. 

600
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,630
 I want to reset my memory, too. 

601
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:42,090
 I need a place to dream. 

602
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,420
You make a nice couple.

603
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,870
Here.

604
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,660
I'm sure he'd be in touch. Eat first.

605
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,090
Okay.

606
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,180
Don't feel like eating?

607
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,010
Yeah. Not really.

608
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,630
 I want to reset my memory, too. 

609
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:29,590
 It feels like my bad memories will get reset when I'm here. 

610
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,620
 This is the warmest ocean, apparently. 

611
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,430
I got it.

612
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,550
I think I know where Yun Woo is.

613
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,560
- Where? 
 - Yangripo.

614
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,630
He's probably there. I'll go meet him.

615
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,340
You'll leave at this hour?

616
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,010
Are you sure he's there?

617
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:48,220
I hope he's there.

618
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,350
Call me if anything happens. I'll be there.

619
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,960
Okay. I'll go, Ahjussi.

620
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,930
Okay, call us.

621
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,610
 Right, there's a red lighthouse on the seawall path there. 

622
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:05,440
 If lovers walk there and return, their love will come true. 

623
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,580
 Should we walk all the way to the lighthouse right now? 

624
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:11,550
 Let's just walk holding hands now... 

625
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,400
 and go later? 

626
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,190
Yun Woo.

627
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:40,530
How could you make me worry so much?

628
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:45,050
Did you really think I couldn't find you?

629
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:51,010
We have no telepathic connection.

630
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:53,100
How did you find me?

631
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,290
Are you okay?

632
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,620
Have you eaten at all?

633
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,060
Yes.

634
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,570
Let's sit.

635
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,650
Yun Woo,

636
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,420
your mother...

637
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,760
visited me right before the accident.

638
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:44,800
She apparently was my client.

639
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,910
I suppose she trusted me.

640
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:52,150
She was very open with me.

641
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:57,480
She told me something like this.

642
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,830
She said she has a son...

643
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:08,120
who must have a lot of wounds.

644
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,370
But she said...

645
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,730
you weren't hurt by your father,

646
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,000
but her.

647
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:31,130
She wanted to apologize to you because of that.

648
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:40,710
She also said she didn't have much time.

649
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,570
I'm sorry.

650
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:49,610
If I stopped her, then—

651
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,310
No.

652
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,710
You shouldn't feel bad about it.

653
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,520
It's our family's business, after all.

654
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:09,970
I...

655
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:15,520
came here without knowing you'd be here.

656
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:23,120
I was so worried that I didn't even care you weren't my DNA lover.

657
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,300
Do you know how much I prayed on the way here?

658
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:31,020
I prayed, "Please, please let me meet Yun Woo."

659
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,880
Yun Woo.

660
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,520
Yun Woo, you have a fever right now.

661
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,810
Thank you.

662
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,250
 We're in Yangripo. 

663
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,350
 I found Yun Woo. 

664
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,390
 We'll stay here tonight and go back tomorrow. 

665
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:45,450
Kang Hoon, is something wrong? Are you okay?

666
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:50,700
Father, let me borrow your car.

667
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,630
So Jin.

668
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:20,060
Yun Woo, are you okay?

669
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:25,170
How long have I been sleeping?

670
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,110
Just rest more.

671
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:32,640
I'll watch you by your side.

672
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:36,990
So Jin.

673
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:47,420
Can I tell you my childhood story?

674
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,780
Was it when I was 14?

675
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,510
 My father told me... 

676
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:04,300
 he found a woman he loves. 

677
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,020
 He said he wanted to live with her. 

678
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,700
Well, and my mother...

679
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,690
As you know, since then,

680
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:19,920
she became extremely obsessed with my father.

681
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:24,290
That's when I learned...

682
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,310
that the more you love,

683
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,100
the more you get hurt.

684
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,470
That's why I'm scared.

685
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:39,360
"I love you," those simple words.

686
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:43,320
I can't even say that to you.

687
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:52,440
But whenever I'm with you, I keep getting strange.

688
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,670
I want to say "I love you" to you, the words I'm afraid to say.

689
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,940
I've never made a promise to anyone,

690
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,130
but I want to do that with you.

691
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,800
Even though I can't keep the promise,

692
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:07,390
just like how you mustered up the courage to come here,

693
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:10,180
I'm mustering up the courage to ask you now.

694
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,820
Could you be by my side?

695
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:23,540
I want to keep listening to your story.

696
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,020
Could you tell me more?

697
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,460
My mother?

698
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,910
Mother...

699
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,590
My mother...

700
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:47,790
still doesn't know I can't handle spice.

701
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:49,070
What?

702
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,290
The worst thing to me was...

703
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:56,320
that she put habanero seasoning in every meal.

704
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,750
When I couldn't eat it.

705
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,360
You should've told her.

706
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:10,310
Her only joy was to cook for my father, who never came home.

707
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:13,830
How could I tell her that?

708
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:18,350
But it was bearable.

709
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:23,760
And my mother also changes flowers depending on her mood.

710
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:37,120
 Mom. 

711
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,700
 Dad won't come home starting today. 

712
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,510
 You and I. 

713
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:46,430
 The two of us will live in this house... 

714
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,250
 Yun Woo! 

715
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:26,050
   

716
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,330
 You've arrived in Yangripo. 

717
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:59,330
 The navigation will end now. 

718
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,040
Why...

719
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,110
Why did I come here?

720
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,400
He told me to press it in an emergency.

721
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,090
Where's Yun Woo?

722
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,900
He left.

723
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,700
He left?

724
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:18,750
♫  You and I somewhere within the dreams we’ve been drawing  ♫

725
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:22,550
♫  I'll always look at you   ♫

726
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:26,020
♫  And smile  ♫

727
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,270
♫  When you suddenly turn around  ♫

728
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:32,590
I'm hungry.

729
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,220
Let's go eat.

730
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:39,210
♫  I’ll always be by your side  ♫

731
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:41,080
Me, too.

732
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,980
I'm hungry, too.

733
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:22,260
   

734
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:26,430
   

735
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:32,930
   

736
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:36,230
   

737
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:43,320
♫  Oh, baby, tell me now, say that nothing will change  ♫

738
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:49,700
♫  I can’t escape, hold me tight  ♫

739
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:56,300
♫  I was wandering alone, but you came to me like a dream  ♫

740
01:08:56,300 --> 01:09:02,620
♫  I just want to rest in your embrace  ♫

741
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:20,230
   

742
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:25,600
 Mom, I don't know why I keep thinking about her even though we broke up. 

743
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:29,090
 Take good care of her by her side. 

744
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:31,200
 I hope you don't regret saying that. 

745
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:36,470
 Thinking now, Kang Hoon was the one who was always by my side. 

746
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:38,520
 Go on a date with me today. 

747
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,320
 Look around you. 

748
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,310
 Someone is always looking at you. Like the moon. 

749
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:46,750
 The one who always stood by me. 

750
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:51,560
 He was my DNA lover. 

751
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:57,070
♫  I was wandering alone  ♫
