1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,410
   

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,590
   

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,860
   

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,920
   

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,290
   

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,920
   

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,580
   

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,220
   

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:52,070
 Timing and Subtitles by the 
 DNA ðŸ§ª You and Me Team 

10
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,330
 I won't... 

11
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,560
 let go of you again. 

12
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,620
   

13
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,480
Go in now.

14
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,780
Make sure to sleep warm.

15
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,310
Okay.

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,680
Thank you.

17
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,050
   

18
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,390
 The phone is powered off. 

19
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,280
 You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep... 

20
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,880
 But whenever I'm with you, I keep getting strange. 

21
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,910
 I want to say "I love you" to you, the words I'm afraid to say. 

22
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,760
 Just like how you mustered up the courage to come here, 

23
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,850
 I'm mustering up the courage to ask you now. 

24
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,640
 Could you be by my side? 

25
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,530
It just doesn't make sense.

26
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,630
How could he do this after telling me all that?

27
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:33,060
Surely, he didn't have a reason he couldn't tell me, right?

28
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,640
   

29
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,550
Hey, Kang Hoon.

30
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,860
 Were you sleeping? 

31
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,910
No, not yet.

32
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,650
There should be a bag of medicine on your door.

33
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,910
Looked like you might have a cold.

34
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,010
Take it before bed, even if you don't want to.

35
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,420
Okay, thank you.

36
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,180
 Don't mention it. 

37
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,610
 Don't think about anything and sleep tight. 

38
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,680
 I'll call you tomorrow. 

39
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,570
All the pharmacies must've been closed at this hour.

40
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,650
   

41
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,720
Ah Ri,

42
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,330
Ms. Park Eun Jung is coming early today to check the test results.

43
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,300
Let's prepare the chart in advance.

44
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,070
What happened to your face? Are you sick?

45
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,630
You look uglier than usual today.

46
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,200
It's nothing. I think I'm coming down with a cold.

47
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,430
I don't think it's nothing.

48
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,950
 I'm in front of the center. Meet me for a moment. 
   

49
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,470
I thought it was important to you.

50
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,880
So, I wanted to give it back.

51
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,970
Give it to your real DNA lover if you meet him later.

52
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,750
That's what you're telling me the first thing we meet?

53
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,980
What happened yesterday, and why did you do that suddenly?

54
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,280
Shouldn't you at least explain that to me first?

55
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,010
How could you do that?

56
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,690
Say something!

57
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,000
Why are you doing this? And if you were going to do this,

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,420
why did you tell me that last night?

59
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,870
There's no reason.

60
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,000
I just sincerely want you to be happy.

61
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,000
You're doing this...

62
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,590
for my happiness right now?

63
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,170
I know it's hard now, but for the future,

64
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,870
this is the right thing to do. At least,

65
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,280
you won't be unhappy that way.

66
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,460
What do you mean by that?

67
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,060
You told me...

68
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,390
that without the DNA lover,

69
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:56,680
you'd become unhappy later, even if you aren't right now.

70
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,720
- Yun Woo, that'sâ€” 
 - Regardless,

71
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,870
you realized that your real DNA lover...

72
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,650
was Kang Hoon.

73
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,450
Could you still be with me knowing that?

74
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,240
The reason we're breaking up...

75
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,760
is clear, right?

76
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,080
Be well.

77
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,190
   

78
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:04,430
   

79
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,710
   

80
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,270
He ends the relationship with just two sentences?

81
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,010
How?

82
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,440
It was easy because he didn't invest any feelings.

83
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,680
The post-breakup depression kicked in again.

84
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,000
Overeating, insomnia, and mood swings.

85
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,500
I wonder how long it'd last this time.

86
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,290
Don't worry. I'll move on quickly this time.

87
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,390
Humans have CCR5, the forgetful gene. 
    

88
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,610
To prevent me from being unhappy, this gene will...

89
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,350
 You don't know this, do you? 

90
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,070
 I ran to you so desperately. 

91
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,960
 I took too long, didn't I? I'm sorry. 

92
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,160
It will alter my memory...

93
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,520
 Can't you tell how much I like you? 

94
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,970
and help me forget.

95
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,750
 Do you think I'm that kind of man? 

96
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,250
 A man who stops liking a woman because of that? 

97
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,610
You said he's not even your DNA lover!

98
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,050
Why can't you forget him?

99
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,910
 Remove the photo of the Sewer first! 

100
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,550
   

101
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,210
   

102
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,900
   

103
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,670
   

104
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,870
 I knew he'd turn out like this. 

105
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,300
 The way he looks and all... 

106
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,880
 He's so ugly. 

107
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,510
 Can't believe he'd do that. 

108
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,640
   

109
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,860
 Noona! Open the door, Noona! 

110
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,440
 Noona! 

111
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,490
 Open the door! 

112
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,150
- Kang Hoon. 
 - What are you doing right now?

113
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,870
Hey, why did you do that?

114
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,750
You're playing with fire for experiments again, huh?

115
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,210
I'm not, okay?

116
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,560
What is it, then?

117
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,280
I was just destroying what I was supposed to.

118
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,250
Seriously.

119
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,470
I get it. You're a firefighter.

120
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,010
Do you want me to start the fire again?

121
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,790
It's fine.

122
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,710
Kang Hoon,

123
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,150
today...

124
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,980
I met Yun Woo.

125
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,070
And...

126
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,660
we really decided to break up.

127
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,110
You did nothing wrong.

128
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,530
You loved him as best as you can.

129
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,980
   

130
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,880
   

131
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,640
   

132
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,130
What did you want to talk about?

133
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,710
Hyung,

134
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,230
will you really break up with Noona?

135
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,410
Yes, I sorted things out.

136
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,070
Sorted things out?

137
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,590
Is that so easy for you?

138
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,280
I thought you were sincere about her.

139
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,380
I was.

140
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,330
That's why I helped her.

141
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,640
I sincerely want her to be happy.

142
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,210
What are you talking about?

143
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,920
Why would that make her happy?

144
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,310
You two are saying the same thing.

145
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,960
It looked like she was very hurt.

146
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,490
You should take good care of her by her side.

147
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,770
I hope you don't regret saying that, Hyung.

148
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,910
 Kang Hoon, 

149
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,940
 she was the first person I wanted to protect. 

150
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,080
 My heart kept growing for her, 

151
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,820
 and I got scared. 

152
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,180
 If I'd end up hurting her, consumed by love, 

153
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,160
 I thought I should let her go before my feelings became more serious. 

154
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:46,010
 I can't watch her growing unhappy by my side. 

155
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,720
 Because no love lasts forever. 

156
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,850
â™«  I got lost in your gaze that filled my heart  â™«

157
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,230
â™«  Though I try to come closer  â™«

158
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,580
â™«  I'm afraid we'll drift apart  â™«

159
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:10,050
â™«  I can't let go of your hand  â™«

160
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,310
â™«  Oh, baby, I'll take it all the time  â™«

161
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,500
â™«  You embraced my heart that ached like a wound  â™«

162
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,490
â™«  Like a child, I lean on you again  â™«

163
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,320
 Where's Yun Woo? 

164
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,320
 He left. 

165
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,890
Hey, Kang Hoon.

166
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,630
 What are you doing this evening, Noona? 

167
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,610
I just want to rest at home.

168
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,260
 Why don't you meet me outside? Let's go somewhere. 

169
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,900
Okay.

170
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,090
What do you think? Doesn't it feel good?

171
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,550
You said it was nearby.

172
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,290
Anywhere in Seoul is close.

173
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,560
I can go anywhere when there's an accident.

174
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,140
Okay.

175
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,080
You need to use your body at times like this.

176
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,960
Try to keep up with me.

177
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,660
Okay.

178
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,520
It's hard, isn't it?

179
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,870
Timeout.

180
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,880
The moon is bright.

181
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,490
Isn't it fascinating?

182
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:24,010
You need to see the moon's shadow to tell how big it is.

183
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,900
Noona, do you know why you can't see the moon during the day?

184
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,330
You told me when I was in elementary school.

185
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,620
The moon revolves around the Earth,

186
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,950
but the Earth revolves around the sun.

187
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,850
That's why you don't see the moon when the sun is bright.

188
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:44,050
The moon is always by the Earth,

189
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,680
but the Earth doesn't notice it.

190
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,340
That makes the moon sad.

191
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,400
I told you that because you found science difficult.

192
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,350
Why is science always sad for you?

193
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:01,080
Hey, the ones that are alone are always sad.

194
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,990
Look around you.

195
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,450
Someone is always looking at you.

196
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,240
Like the moon.

197
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,960
 He definitely has a gene that heals me at times like this. 

198
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,670
 But... 

199
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,420
It's so strange.

200
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,320
How could you have no scent?

201
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,950
It's strange. How could a person not have a scent?

202
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,270
Maybe you can't smell it.

203
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,650
I have a sense of smell as good as a dog's.

204
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,270
Noona, I'll go get some water.

205
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,140
Wait just a moment.

206
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,790
I'll be right back.

207
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,020
Noona.

208
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,540
What took you so long?

209
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,360
I'm sorry. Here.

210
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,040
Do you want me to wear these?

211
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,530
They didn't have slippers at the convenience store.

212
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,000
I went to the underground mall nearby, but only one store was open.

213
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,600
Try them on. So, we can go home. Go on.

214
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,980
What?

215
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,910
Why are they flashing lights?

216
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,620
I'd recognize you 100 meters away.

217
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,520
You think this is funny, don't you?

218
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,530
What if I chased you in these?

219
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,170
- What are you doing? 
 - Come here.

220
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,350
- Hold on. Hold on. 
 - Come here. Come here!

221
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,350
Noona, stop!

222
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,410
Hey! Hold on!

223
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,840
Noona...

224
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,970
Gosh...

225
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,780
 Dr. Shim, I'm on a staycation using the coupon you gave me. 

226
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,320
 Guess who I'm with? 

227
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,780
Hold on.

228
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,620
Was the bed a super single or double?

229
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,340
Isn't super single a bit small?

230
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,490
It's a bit small.

231
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,470
Jung Tam.

232
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,550
What are you doing?

233
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,010
Aren't we going to check in?

234
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,670
We are. Let's go.

235
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,060
Should I help you check in?

236
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,040
What's the name on the reservation?

237
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,170
 Super single? Double beds? Super single? 

238
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,110
 I can't let my sleeping habits wake her up. 

239
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,600
 But aren't the double beds too big? 

240
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,350
 Yes, super single would be better. 

241
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,780
- Sir? 
  - Super single. Super single. 

242
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,960
Jung Tam.

243
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,350
- Yes? 
 - What's the name on the reservation?

244
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,180
Super single, please.

245
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,410
Pardon?

246
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,030
I-It's probably under Yuh Jung Tam.

247
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,480
- Mr. Yuh Jung Tam? 
 - Yes, yes, yes.

248
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,910
I'm okay.

249
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,100
I swear I don't mind.

250
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,400
- Just one moment. 
 - Well...

251
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,280
I'm embarrassed of my feet.

252
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,580
Why? They're the prettiest feet in the world.

253
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,630
Let me take this one off, too.

254
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,600
Okay.

255
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,190
- It tickles. 
 - You're splashing on me. Hold on.

256
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,820
You know how to do stuff like this?

257
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,930
Of course.

258
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,240
You're feeling comfortable, right?

259
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,940
Yes.

260
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,520
Don't look from now on.

261
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,230
Okay.

262
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,970
You aren't looking, right?

263
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,250
No, don't look.

264
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,090
I'll start now.

265
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,220
Ta-da! All done.

266
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,320
   

267
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,420
Wow!

268
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,170
It's so cute.

269
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,910
Do you like it?

270
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,590
- Yes. 
 - I'm glad.

271
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:11,720
Can I do what I want to do now, then?

272
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,150
Pardon? Like what?

273
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,300
Sung Mi...

274
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,770
Sung Mi...

275
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,490
Wait... Sung Mi...

276
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,720
Sung Mi...

277
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,100
Why are you...

278
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,470
Sung Mi.

279
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,140
Hold on...

280
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,340
   

281
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,790
I knew you wouldn't tell me where she was, even if I asked.

282
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,200
So, I asked So Jin.

283
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,560
Okay.

284
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,860
Here.

285
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,400
I hope she can hear this music box in her dream.

286
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,740
How are things with So Jin?

287
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,430
We broke up.

288
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,750
Because of me.

289
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,790
Do you regret...

290
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,280
breaking up?

291
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,240
Have I ever regretted my decisions?

292
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,260
Should we go on a drive, Yun Woo?

293
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,250
I'll drive. Let's step out for a moment.

294
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,910
You used to like to visit Chuncheon.

295
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,590
No.

296
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,950
I feel bad leaving my mother here alone.

297
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:51,450
Yun Woo, you think she wouldn't know you're sitting here looking so sad, right?

298
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,950
She knows.

299
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,140
When the patient is sick, the caretaker needs to cheer up and eat well.

300
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,750
Don't you agree?

301
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,920
Thank you.

302
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,090
It's called a grass tree. It blossoms after it burns.

303
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,340
It was found at a fire site a month ago, too.

304
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,840
Isn't it kind of strange? The same plant was found twice.

305
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,440
It must be just a coincidence.

306
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,410
 Also, this photo was found at the site. 

307
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,610
 Do you know them, by chance? 

308
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,540
 It's a grass tree. 

309
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,800
 It doesn't have flowers yet. 

310
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,000
 It only flowers after a fire. 

311
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,090
 Isn't it fascinating? 

312
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,020
 Mom. 

313
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,730
I'm here, Father.

314
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,670
Hey, you came.

315
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,780
- I'll take that. 
 - Yes, for Table 2.

316
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,930
Here's your order.

317
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,580
Enjoy.

318
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,400
   

319
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,570
- Hey, So Ri. 
  - Yes, Kang Hoon. 

320
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,580
 What's up at this hour? 

321
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,480
Can I ask you a favor?

322
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,670
So, you're going on a date today?

323
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,480
What's she like?

324
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,630
It's okay as long as she's not like Han So Jin.

325
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,710
Why? What's wrong with her?

326
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,200
What? Is it really Han So Jin?

327
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,280
No.

328
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,000
It's not quite right.

329
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,000
- By the way, So Ri. 
 - Yes?

330
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,040
Do you not detect any scents from me?

331
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,370
You don't wear cologne.

332
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:54,280
No, I'm asking if I have a natural scent.

333
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,070
What are you talking about?

334
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,420
- Are you starting to resemble Han So Jin? 
 - I mean,

335
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,080
someone said I don't have any scent.

336
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,910
Enough about scents.

337
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,380
This is no good. Just change. Let's go somewhere else.

338
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,330
Just pick anything that seems okay.

339
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,830
Just trust me on this.

340
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,780
Go inside.

341
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,100
What time are you meeting her?

342
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,750
- Do I look okay? 
 - You look great.

343
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,810
Here.

344
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,410
It's too ordinary.

345
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,990
Next.

346
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,320
It's not bad, but let's try the next one.

347
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,240
Hurry.

348
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,890
So Ri.

349
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,290
Wow!

350
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,860
This is it.

351
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,530
- Do I look okay? 
 - Yes.

352
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,070
Have a look.

353
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,200
You look great.

354
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,290
Here's the cologne.

355
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,000
Okay.

356
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,030
Welcome to the cell and gene therapy seminar.

357
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,840
You must've looked through the chart,

358
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,120
but I'm sure all researchers would know what it's about.

359
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,280
It's nothing complicated.

360
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,300
I think you should know these two things.

361
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,100
The first one is...

362
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,900
Do you know him?

363
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,710
He's like a breakthrough for Sunbae.

364
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,640
Breakthrough?

365
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,770
Here. They're hypoallergenic flowers. Don't worry.

366
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,840
What's with the flowers...

367
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,760
Wait, what's with you today? Are you going somewhere?

368
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,150
- You said you get off early today, right? 
 - Yes.

369
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,630
I'm leaving soon, but...

370
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,530
You should...

371
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,740
go on a date with me today.

372
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,910
What?

373
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,360
You said you wanted to go to an ice rink.

374
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,520
Go with me.

375
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,740
Wait. Did you eat something funny?

376
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,010
No, I'm serious.

377
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,380
I'll wait until you're done.

378
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,610
You can just leave now.

379
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,510
We're almost done preparing.

380
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,200
Ah Ri can take care of the rest.

381
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,100
Would that be okay? I'd appreciate that.

382
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,600
No, no. But stillâ€”

383
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,010
No, you should go home early for once.

384
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,580
You need a break once in a while.

385
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,000
As for the rest of the task...

386
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,660
we'll take care of it.

387
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,370
W-We?

388
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,660
Yes, you can go.

389
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,290
Don't worry about us.

390
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,040
Thank you.

391
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,540
Noona said she works with great people.

392
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,820
- She was right. 
 - Come on.

393
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,160
What are you doing?

394
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,030
Go ahead and leave.

395
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,950
Well, o-okay.

396
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,940
I'll go now, then.

397
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,840
Ah Ri, please take care of the rest.

398
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,950
I'll see you next time.

399
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,530
Are you wearing cologne today?

400
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,870
Yes.

401
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,540
Do I have a scent now?

402
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,620
It smells artificial.

403
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,180
It's nothing like the one Shy smelled.

404
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,140
 A date? 

405
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,960
What are you doing?

406
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,900
No, I'm coming.

407
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,640
- Hold, hold. 
 - I haven't done this for so long.

408
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,820
You see the kids skating, right?

409
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,190
You need to be as good as them.

410
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,470
Right foot, left foot.

411
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,540
That's right. That's right.

412
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,030
You kept making fun of me.

413
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,330
- Here. 
 - Gosh, how embarrassing!

414
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,160
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

415
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,200
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

416
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,720
What?

417
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,450
What?

418
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,670
It's nothing.

419
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,150
Shall we go?

420
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,780
Noona, I have to make a call.

421
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,400
Okay. I'll be waiting here.

422
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,290
- Wait a moment. 
 - Okay.

423
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,760
What's wrong with me?

424
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,510
Hey, move!

425
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,360
Han So Jin!

426
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,360
Are you okay?

427
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,220
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes.

428
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,600
- Can you get up? 
 - Yes.

429
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,650
I got you.

430
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,350
Thank you.

431
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,930
Be careful.

432
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,500
Go ahead.

433
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,670
Hold on.

434
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,020
Don't do anything that'd injure you next time.

435
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,690
There was no time to think before jumping in.

436
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,540
That's how you always get injured, too.

437
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,050
Don't copy stuff like that.

438
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:39,430
Why does it seem like accidents happen whenever I'm with you?

439
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,960
It's because you're a troublemaker.

440
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,140
I'm fine. Let's go now.

441
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,620
Okay.

442
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,030
You have to let me go first.

443
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,150
Oh, okay.

444
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,730
I said I'm fine.

445
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,630
Ahjussi is waiting. You should go.

446
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,960
I'll see you go in first.

447
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,680
What's this?

448
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,680
   

449
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,730
   

450
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,910
Did you do this?

451
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,280
The day I gave you the medicine...

452
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,380
 "I installed LED lights due to repair delay. 

453
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,530
 I'll remove them when it's repaired. 

454
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,890
 Seo Kang Hoon." 

455
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,440
 I just put it up while I was here. 

456
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,420
It's dangerous at night.

457
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,910
You should've told me.

458
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,360
I almost didn't know.

459
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,840
I didn't have to say all that.

460
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,080
   

461
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,630
   

462
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,220
 Thank you for agreeing to participate in the clinical trial. 

463
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,340
   
   

464
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,680
So Jin, you said he's just a friend.

465
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,070
You really have no feelings for each other, right?

466
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,770
- Yes. 
 - This is a case-control study.

467
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,340
The subjects can't be couples.

468
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,230
- We aren't. 
 - We aren't a couple.

469
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,470
That can't be true.

470
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,890
Here, look.

471
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:55,530
The red parts are the activated parts of your brains.

472
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:00,320
But they have red parts in the same spots.

473
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,740
Even the brightness levels are the same.

474
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,880
How could they be exactly the same?

475
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,150
The fact that the brain activities match

476
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,340
means your sixth sense reacts the same way

477
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,700
whenever you see or feel something.

478
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,810
 Sadness, hopefulness, sadness, and fears. 

479
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:25,550
 All of your general emotions match as if you were born that way. 

480
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:31,740
 Now that I think about it, Kang Hoon was the one who was always by my side. 

481
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,410
Go inside.

482
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,550
I had fun today, thanks to you.

483
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,670
- Aren't you leaving? 
 - Go in first.

484
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,710
Bye.

485
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,530
Father!

486
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,130
Is he upset about something?

487
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:01,670
 Do you regret breaking up? 

488
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,690
 Have I ever regretted my decisions? 

489
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,100
Is this my timing?

490
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,580
Thank you.

491
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,950
Mr. Shim, your face is the exact face

492
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:30,010
you make after a breakup.

493
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,370
Did you break up with Team Leader Han?

494
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,190
It feels a bit different this time.

495
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,780
- Is that so? 
 - Should I...

496
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,660
set you up on a blind date?

497
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,130
- It's fine. 
 - Don't be like that and try it.

498
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,360
I'll find someone who's exactly your type.

499
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,090
Let's see. Let's see.

500
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,320
Mr. Shim Yun Woo?

501
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,860
Hello. The traffic is bad, isn't it?

502
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,990
It's not that. Today was my riding day.

503
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,140
But Brian was a bit sick.

504
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,420
Brian is the name of my horse.

505
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,540
Sorry to hear that.

506
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,720
What do you like?

507
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,740
By the way, what's your hobby, Yun Woo?

508
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,650
I don't really have one.

509
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,570
I like to visit good restaurants.

510
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,990
I got sick of the five-star ones in Korea because I go too often.

511
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:54,590
I went to the fine dining restaurant at the Chevile hotel recently.

512
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,020
But the food tasted so cheap.

513
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,560
I thought they were selling instant food.

514
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,140
Should I introduce you to my regular spot today?

515
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,570
 Ta-da! 

516
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,880
 It's not restaurant quality, but give it a try. 

517
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,140
 - It's tasty. 
 - Right? It's not bad, right? 

518
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,210
 I told you. 

519
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,270
You know how to smile?

520
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,830
- Pardon? 
 - This is my first time seeing you smile.

521
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,640
Yes.

522
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,650
 That's it! Yes, chew them all up like that! 

523
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,450
 Look. Look what they're doing to So Mi. 

524
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,870
 Wipe them off! Kill them all! 

525
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,210
You must like action movies.

526
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,940
I suppose so.

527
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,190
How about you?

528
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:00,000
I can't stand anything that feels dangerous.

529
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,580
You're on a very dangerous date.

530
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,190
Hello.

531
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:15,600
I'm this man's ex-girlfriend.

532
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,220
He has 43 billion won in debt...

533
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,480
and he probably doesn't own the hospital, either.

534
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,490
Would that be okay?

535
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,300
Isn't 43 billion too much?

536
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,250
You seemed too stressed out.

537
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,220
So, I got rid of her.

538
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,830
What brings you here?

539
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:53,320
I came with the publication company editor.

540
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,020
And here you are.

541
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,140
Yun Woo, should we go somewhere nice?

542
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:03,630
The weather is so nice.

543
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,910
Isn't it so nice to walk here?

544
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,330
It is.

545
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,690
You should come here with your boyfriend.

546
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:13,360
Aren't you seeing anyone these days?

547
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,840
I moved on a long time ago.

548
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,160
- From what? 
 - The men.

549
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,670
Why?

550
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:25,130
I want to love just one person now.

551
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,140
I want to...

552
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,530
focus on...

553
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,350
only that person.

554
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,960
It's getting late. Shall we go?

555
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,160
Is there a place we can go to?

556
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,530
You don't want to go home?

557
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:58,590
It just feels...

558
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,490
kind of empty at home.

559
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,730
You must be lonely, Yun Woo.

560
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,440
If you're lonely,

561
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,510
should I move in with you?

562
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,620
Come on. Stop joking.

563
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,530
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

564
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,290
Stop. I don't want you to.

565
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,500
I'm serious.

566
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,180
   

567
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,060
   

568
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:45,670
Seo Kang Hoon has a gene that heals me.

569
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,590
He's my healer...

570
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,440
and I'm his healer.

571
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:57,090
That means he has the healing gene and Octo-gene.

572
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,380
If that's the case,

573
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,680
   

574
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,360
since we're each other's healer genes,

575
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,980
did Kang Hoon's Octo-gene

576
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,180
become dormant?

577
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,910
 How's your wrist? 

578
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,440
 Try not to use it too much. 

579
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,540
 Come to the restaurant tomorrow night. Let's have dinner together. 

580
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,680
Really?

581
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,210
Unfortunately, your heart rate is going up.

582
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:37,480
We can't delay the surgery anymore.

583
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,600
I see.

584
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,530
Don't worry.

585
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,760
Everything will be okay.

586
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,240
Okay.

587
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:52,770
When Purumi is born, your body fluid and blood will decrease suddenly.

588
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,880
Your heart will endure it well.

589
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,830
I'll be by your side to make sure that happens.

590
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,740
Doctor,

591
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:08,480
the day I tried to commit suicide,

592
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,260
 Yo Han saw me for the first time. 

593
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,500
He thought we were meant to be.

594
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,020
Actually, my brother is sick, too.

595
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:25,350
People think I can't get married because of him,

596
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,520
but while I've been depressed for a long time,

597
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,600
I've been comforted by my brother every single day.

598
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,290
I wouldn't have been alive today if it wasn't for him.

599
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:42,320
The more I listen to him,

600
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,650
I felt like...

601
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:50,040
he was meant to be with me.

602
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,650
I feel the same way, Yung Ah.

603
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,510
I didn't see this coming at all. Anyway...

604
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:06,230
Ms. Yoo needs to go in. So, enjoy your conversation.

605
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,820
- Dr. Shim. 
 - Yes.

606
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,210
Do you know that lady?

607
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,650
The one who persuaded me on the rooftop.

608
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:19,130
Purumi and I survived, thanks to her.

609
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:24,750
 Please live. 

610
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,910
 Don't die. 

611
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:31,870
Please make sure to thank her for me.

612
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,040
I will.

613
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,390
It's 16:57.

614
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,120
Ms. Yoo,

615
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,000
congratulations.

616
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,710
I'll suture the incision now.

617
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:03,190
Here.

618
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,360
Dr. Shim, Ms. Yoo is acting strange.

619
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,650
She's losing consciousness.

620
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,780
Y-Yung Ah. Open your eyes, Yung Ah.

621
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,030
Yung Ah, open your eyes!

622
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:28,080
She lost more than 2,000 cc of blood.

623
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,760
Start injecting oxytocic and get me a balloon catheter. Hurry.

624
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,220
- Okay. 
 - Hurry!

625
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,610
The oxygen saturation level is dropping.

626
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:35,120
She lost over 3,000 cc of blood.

627
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,450
The blood pressure is 65 over 34.

628
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,830
Ji Yo Han, get it together. Start injecting levarterenol.

629
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,660
- Okay. 
 - Ms. Yoo,

630
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,160
won't you meet Purumi?

631
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,790
You need to meet Purumi. Ms. Yoo. Ms. Yoo!

632
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,700
Hurry up.

633
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,360
 For some people, 

634
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:58,800
 the moment they get to meet might be more precious than anything. 

635
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,530
She won't stop bleeding. Her uterus is shaking.

636
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,290
 Live. 

637
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:11,280
 Both you and Purumi. 

638
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,140
 Please live. 

639
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,120
 Don't die. 

640
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,220
Her blood pressure went up, and her heart rate went down.

641
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,040
She's stabilized.

642
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:35,900
Ms. Yoo, thank you for hanging in there until the end.

643
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,060
You did great.

644
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,320
Thank you. Thank you.

645
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,020
Thank you.

646
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,440
Mom,

647
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,750
I met this nerdy woman.

648
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,600
Her name is Han So Jin.

649
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,110
You know her, too, right?

650
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:58,200
I heard you know each other.

651
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,050
What do you think?

652
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,740
I know you're close to her.

653
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,550
Ever since I broke up with her,

654
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,690
I think of her every day. I don't know why.

655
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,310
I've never felt this way before.

656
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,740
What kind of feeling is this?

657
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,370
You know, right?

658
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,060
I'll be right back.

659
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:54,610
 There were 193 accidents at the mudflat in the past three years. 
   

660
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:57,350
 Twenty-seven people have lost their lives. 

661
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:01,000
 And there were 33 accidents until last month... 
   

662
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,960
 Next news. 

663
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:11,790
 There was a fire at a residence in Yongdo-dong around 8:33 tonight. 

664
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:17,330
 The rescue workers of Jeongin 911 Rescue Center rescued the residents, 

665
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,290
 but Mr. Seo, a firefighter in the late 20s, was isolated 

666
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,400
 and sent to Yeonseong Hospital. 

667
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,920
 The fire that started on the second floor burnt the entire house 

668
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,030
 and took about an hour to put out. 

669
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,100
 Mr. Seo, who's currently in critical condition... 

670
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,100
- Ahjussi. 
 - No way.

671
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,340
- It can't be our Kang Hoon. 
  - was known to take risks. 

672
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,550
 He even passed the Emergency Technician License Exam, 

673
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,390
 that's known to be difficult to pass. 

674
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,910
 The news is upsetting many. 

675
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:47,350
 - The Fire Department is soon...  
 - Isn't he answering?

676
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:50,740
Kang Hoon isn't... He isn't answering.

677
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:56,200
 After hearing about Firefighter Seo's condition... 

678
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,260
The... The car is here.

679
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,580
Yes, Ahjussi. Let's go.

680
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,580
I'm okay. I'm okay. Okay...

681
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,450
Ahjussi, are you okay?

682
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:11,810
- I'm okay. 
 - Are you okay? Let me help...

683
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:14,050
Are you okay, Ahjussi?

684
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,330
- Try getting up. 
 - My legs got weak.

685
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,850
- Ahjussi. 
 - Ahjussi! What's going on?

686
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:20,540
- Yun Woo. 
 - Hey, Yun Woo.

687
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,330
My Kang Hoon...

688
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,990
Kang Hoon is in danger.

689
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:26,150
Could you drive us to Yeonseong Hospital?

690
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,730
We need to go to Kang Hoon now.

691
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,260
He's apparently at the hospital.

692
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,880
Let's go, Ahjussi.

693
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:42,320
Mr. Seo, Kang Hoon follows the safety protocol well. I'm sure he's fine.

694
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,750
- Don't worry. 
 - He's right.

695
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,750
He'd never die leaving us behind.

696
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,970
So, please hang in there.

697
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,550
Here.

698
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:59,430
Kang Hoon... Did something happen to Kang Hoon?

699
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:02,890
- The thing is, Iâ€” 
 - I'll check on him myself. I'll...

700
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,100
Please calm down.

701
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,490
My Kang Hoon... There's no way...

702
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:10,490
- Sir. 
 - My son...

703
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,260
It's not like that.

704
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,730
Noona.

705
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,700
 That's when I realized... 

706
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,540
 one thing I've been denying so hard. 

707
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,440
 I'm sorry. 

708
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:20,650
 I'll be good to you in my next life. 

709
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:24,860
 My time with you and our children 

710
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:29,750
 was very brief, but I was happy. 

711
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,350
 I can't even believe you were mine. 

712
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:37,300
 I want to see you, my family, one last time now. 

713
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,250
 I love you. 

714
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:45,920
 Dad. 

715
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,830
 No, no... 

716
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:52,790
 Dad, Dad... 

717
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:56,410
 Four years ago, on the worst day of my life, 

718
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:00,690
 the forgetful gene erased everything about that day. 

719
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,900
 Sadness and Kang Hoon, who stayed by my side, too. 

720
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,580
Hey.

721
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,650
If you die, I'llâ€”

722
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,450
I won't die.

723
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,500
How could I die?

724
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:25,810
I'll never hurt you and Father like that.

725
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,940
â™«  Every empty spot  â™«

726
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,140
â™«  Of my heart  â™«

727
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,200
 Is that why... 

728
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:58,950
 I forgot the precious person who's always been by my side? 

729
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:02,620
â™«  The same place  â™«

730
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,870
â™«  The same time  â™«

731
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:08,600
 The one who's always been protecting me. 

732
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,140
 The one who made me smile 

733
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:14,520
 when I was hurting the most. 

734
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:19,060
 My DNA lover was... 

735
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,540
 actually this person. 

736
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,100
You bastard!

737
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,400
I thought something happened to you!

738
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,240
I thought something happened to you!

739
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,320
I was going to follow you, punk!

740
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:38,860
Hey, I told you to be always careful.

741
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,730
I said you have a hero gene.

742
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:42,730
I said death is always by your side.

743
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:45,140
How could I die leaving you two behind?

744
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:49,930
But Seo Min Gyu is a bit...

745
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:55,120
Is he in a very bad condition?

746
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:19,640
How lucky.

747
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,840
â™«  Oh, baby, tell me now that you won't change  â™«

748
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,480
â™«  Say that nothing will change  â™«

749
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,260
â™«  I canâ€™t escape  â™«

750
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:10,060
â™«  Hold me tight  â™«

751
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:13,360
â™«  I was wandering alone  â™«

752
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,500
â™«  But you came to me like a dream  â™«

753
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,620
â™«  I just want to rest in your embrace  â™«

754
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:26,320
â™«  I fell for you like someone who is bewitched  â™«

755
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,490
â™«  Hesitant steps, though I wish for more  â™«

756
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:34,950
â™«  I was so afraid of falling deeper  â™«

757
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:38,330
   

758
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:40,640
 Did you confess your love officially? 

759
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,840
 Not yet. 

760
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,130
 You need to use this chance and take her. 

761
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,910
 Love is all about timing. 

762
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:47,680
 No. 

763
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,840
 Her feelings are more important than me right now. 

764
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,010
 - My gosh! 
 - The volunteers are so full of love. 

765
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:58,550
 This is why I never believe it when you say you broke up. 

766
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,340
 You're choking me... 

767
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:05,010
 Why does he show up and shake me up when I'm about to forget him? 

768
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:07,370
 I'll wait just one more time. 

769
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:10,550
 Go to So Jin and tell her how you really feel. 

770
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:14,830
 Instead, come to me if it doesn't work out this time. 

771
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:18,070
â™«  Oh, baby, tell me now  â™«
