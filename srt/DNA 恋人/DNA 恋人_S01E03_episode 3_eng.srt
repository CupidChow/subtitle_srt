1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,210
   

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,530
   

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,940
   

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,550
   

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,170
   

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,970
   

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,520
   

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,970
   

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,420
 Dad! Dad! 

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,660
 Dad, I'm here. Wake up! 

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:01:00,000


12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,950
Excuse me, Ms. Han.

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,960
Please open your eyes.

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,560
Are they open?

15
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,120
Are they?

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,620
Could you let go of this then?

17
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,590
You're so consistently reckless.

18
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,860
Why am I like this right now?

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,930
I think I could explain if you moved a little.

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,580
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,450
What? Han So Jin. Han So Jin!

22
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,320
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

23
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,230
You can't butt in all the time. Why did you go up there?

24
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,170
Some pass out or have a heart attack while falling.

25
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,540
Or if you're unlucky, you fall outside the mat and tear your main artery.

26
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,140
Ms. Han might be unlucky, but I tend to be lucky.

27
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,070
By the way, how do you two know each other?

28
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,320
You two should go to the hospital first.

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,040
- Come on. 
 - It's okay.

30
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,480
She didn't die.

31
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,590
We don't want to see someone dying in front of us again.

32
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,910
I won't let that happen again.

33
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,710
Excuse me.

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Assistant Director!

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,720
I thought you were going to die.

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,210
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I'm okay.

37
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,810
Are you feeling okay?

38
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,410
Let me check on the fetus.

39
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,140
The Yun Woo I know will definitely save Ms. Yoo.

40
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,850
I don't know about other things, but he cares about his patients a lot.

41
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,540
- What are you doing? 
 - What?

42
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,580
I asked what are you doing?

43
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,210
I fell with my nose in his armpit.

44
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,690
He smelled so sweaty.

45
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,080
You noticed that when you were about to die?

46
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,960
I know. I find that strange, too.

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,510
But...

48
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,480
it smelled nice.

49
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,490
Dad, have a drink.

50
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,800
I won't let you drink alone tonight.

51
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,580
Here.

52
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,640
A glass for me, too.

53
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,810
It's so strong.

54
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,150
And you drank this every day?

55
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,890
Geez.

56
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,700
I told you not to drink at a place like this, didn't I?

57
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,160
A female college student was kidnapped and asked to be rescued around here.

58
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,130
Did you put a tracker on me or something?

59
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,320
Your routes are so predictable.

60
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,620
Aigoo, aigoo...

61
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,260
I told you not to cry alone.

62
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,400
Get up. I'll make you noodles at the restaurant.

63
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,770
I already knew...

64
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,740
that my dad would die.

65
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,790
He freed all of his pet birds,

66
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,580
and he gifted the plants he cherished to neighbors too.

67
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,990
He couldn't handle hard liquor,

68
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,810
but he bought Kaoliang liquor at a grocery store every day.

69
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,670
I knew all about it.

70
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,950
However...

71
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,020
I pretended I didn't know.

72
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,380
Because he looked too miserable.

73
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,060
So Ri, Mom, and I...

74
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,870
hated Dad for being in unrequited love.

75
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,430
We were so annoyed with him for telling us he wanted to die.

76
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,490
So I'm the worst person here.

77
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,360
- Noona. 
 - He didn't call any of us before he died.

78
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,640
So Ri, Mom, and me...

79
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,230
None of us would've told him...

80
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,950
why he had to continue to live.

81
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,020
 Dad! Dad! 

82
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,910
 Dad! 

83
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,260
 You saw, right? He breathed just now. 

84
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,110
 I saw him exhale. 

85
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,560
 The air that was in his lungs came out. 

86
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,610
 Kang Hoon, please save Dad. 

87
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,430
 Just for ten minutes. 

88
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,800
 No, just one minute. 

89
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,780
 It's because I need to tell him something. 

90
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,820
 That I'm sorry... 

91
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,670
 and to ask for his forgiveness. 

92
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,600
 That I love him. 

93
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,310
 I've never got to tell him that. 

94
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,060
 Dad, wake up. 

95
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,300
 Dad, I'm here. Wake up! 

96
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,370
Han So Jin.

97
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,220
Find a man like your dad.

98
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,720
Someone who loves you almost too much.

99
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,300
Someone you'd get sick of and want to dump because he's always attached to you.

100
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,020
You need to be happy.

101
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,840
Everyone I saved needs to be.

102
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,500
But I didn't get to save your father.

103
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,340
Is that why you're still rescuing people?

104
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,200
Here.

105
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,950
It's an herbal heat pack.

106
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,210
Microwave for two minutes and put it on your shoulders and back.

107
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,280
I can't do stuff like this because it's too hot.

108
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,490
But he must be in more pain than me right now.

109
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,930
He? Who?

110
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,850
Dr. Shim Yun Woo.

111
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,810
 The moment you meet each other... 

112
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,660
 The moment they get to meet... 

113
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,320
 might be more precious than anything. 

114
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,170
 can be more precious than your whole life. 

115
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,780
Why did I suddenly say that?

116
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,950
That nosy woman...

117
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,490
ended up saving a life.

118
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,020
 The moment you meet each other can be more precious than your whole life. 

119
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,210
He remembered what I said.

120
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,670
 If he can breathe just for a minute, I want to do everything for him, 

121
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,800
 tell him I love him, and I can give up my life for him. 

122
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,180
 I know how that feels. 

123
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,380
 She didn't die. 

124
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,160
 We don't want to see someone dying in front of us again. 

125
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,960
I suppose...

126
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,550
it's not something I should worry about.

127
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,200
 Are you feeling okay? 

128
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,860
 Let me check on the fetus. 

129
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,540
   

130
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,820
Jab. Jab. One, two.

131
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,380
Jab. Jab. One, two.

132
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
- Jab. 
 - One, two. Okay.

133
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,810
- One, two! Turn. One, two. 
 - Jab. Jab. One, two.

134
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,260
- That's it. 
 - One, two. One, two.

135
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,100
This time it's one, two, and duck. Focus, focus.

136
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,910
- Okay. 
 - One, two, duck, and weave.

137
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,590
You need to do it well. Go!

138
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,580
One, two, duck, and weave.

139
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,400
You need to focus. Focus. Why look at the window?

140
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,300
Sung Mi, might as well destroy the sandbag.

141
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,990
Why don't you just tear all of them apart?

142
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,950
Do you want to spar with Do Hwan?

143
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,430
To teach him how it's done.

144
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,170
I'd love to.

145
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,610
Do Hwan, let's see what you got.

146
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,040
Don't hit like they're sandbags. Go easy.

147
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,950
Be honest and pure.

148
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
- Fight! 
  - Fighting! 

149
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,820
- Block it! 
 - Guard!

150
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,770
- Get in position. 
 - Fighting!

151
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,960
Get in position.

152
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,170
Get him! Get him! Fighting!

153
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,980
Guard!

154
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,310
Get him!

155
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,580
No, no! Get out! Get out!

156
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,510
Stop! Stop! Stop hitting her!

157
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,990
That's right!

158
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,950
Nice! Great job, Nam Sung Mi!

159
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,280
By the way, you must be Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist's huge fan.

160
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,760
No, I'm just–

161
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,560
You should treat your fan since you won.

162
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,370
What are you talking about?

163
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,240
Should I treat you instead then?

164
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,350
Here you go!

165
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,770
I'm sorry, Sir. Hand it back to me.

166
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,500
No, it's okay.

167
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,290
I'll put this in the towel collection box.

168
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,940
Well, but–

169
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,850
Geez!

170
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,550
   

171
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,370
Ah Ri,

172
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,830
listen carefully.

173
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:21,150
I smelled a scent in an impossible situation.

174
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,530
 What do you think that scent was? 

175
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,580
Are you talking about scents again?

176
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,880
You need to test it to find out if it's a dud or not.

177
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,250
Why don't you just soak him?

178
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,420
- Soak him? 
 - Yes.

179
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,430
Soak him in alcohol.

180
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,820
Ah Ri?

181
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,050
Sunbae, I read this in a book.

182
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,480
They soak the human body in alcohol.

183
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,840
And they extract the person's scent using alcohol.

184
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,570
Ah Ri, I'm not in the mood for a grotesque joke right now.

185
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,650
And why would you soak someone in alcohol?

186
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,400
That's what I should do.

187
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,930
- Pardon? 
 - Of course.

188
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,380
A brave person finds their destiny.

189
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,730
Right, that was a story about a serial killer. I'm sorry.

190
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:22,510
I'll steal his scent.

191
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,350
Here we go again.

192
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,810
What's wrong? What's going on?

193
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,850
I cheated a bit today.

194
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,160
A tank truck got into my lane.

195
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,270
What do you mean?

196
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,160
Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist's name was Nam Sung Mi*.
  (*Means "masculine charm") 

197
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,770
You told me to try cheating.

198
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,030
So I signed up at the gym immediately.

199
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,580
Is her name Nam Sung Mi?

200
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,170
So? How was it?

201
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,330
It was nice. Her smell was really nice.

202
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,790
What? What do you mean? What smell?

203
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,580
Anyway, be careful.

204
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,770
The truck might suddenly stop.

205
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,780
If you don't slow down, you'll tip over.

206
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,890
I can manage myself.

207
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,980
You know we have a basketball game with Hwalgichan Urology today, right?

208
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,580
Right, it was today.

209
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,950
By the way, Nurse Pyo has reserve force training today.

210
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,270
Gosh, that Nurse Pyo.

211
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,970
We're missing one person. What do we do?

212
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,810
There isn't anyone else in our department.

213
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,770
Hey, let's recruit someone.

214
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,910
I know someone.

215
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,060
I'm talking a boxer and a firefighter.

216
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,620
Firefighter?

217
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,990
I'll recruit someone instead.

218
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,720
No, their ace is two meters tall.

219
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,630
A normal person can't handle him.

220
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,380
Only Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist can handle him.

221
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,610
Do you know someone better?

222
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,750
He better be as good as Yeosam-dong Fire Fist.

223
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,490
Here's your order.

224
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,170
Thank you.

225
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,690
Enjoy.

226
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,030
A bottle of sake, please.

227
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,980
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

228
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,120
Thank you.

229
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,840
What's with you today?

230
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,190
You did something wrong again, didn't you?

231
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:18,210
No. I'm helping you because you looked busy.

232
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm not busy.

233
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,710
Yes.

234
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,470
Thank you.

235
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,700
By the way, why don't your friends come here?

236
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,390
It'd be nice if they helped the business.

237
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,810
My friends? A lot of them came.

238
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:43,970
Really? But that doctor from Shim Hospital? He never came, right?

239
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,170
You mean, Yun Woo?

240
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,080
Yes, Shim Yun Woo.

241
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,850
Does he come here often?

242
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,670
I guess he comes sometimes.

243
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,820
By the way, why are you asking me that?

244
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,890
Huh? Well, I just...

245
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,230
So you two seemed pretty close.

246
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,510
How do you know each other?

247
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,640
   

248
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,350
Speak of the devil.

249
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,750
Hyung.

250
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,750
Tonight? Why? Is something going on?

251
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,600
Basketball?

252
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,230
 Basketball? 

253
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,600
 Basketball is... 

254
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,850
 a sport that lets me collect sweat, which contains body scents. 

255
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,520
 This is it. 

256
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,470
I'm helping my father at the restaurant. I don't think I could.

257
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,320
 F-Father? 

258
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,640
 No! 

259
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,470
Okay, let's play some other time.

260
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,040
Okay.

261
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,200
What?

262
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,730
Kang Hoon, I find men most attractive when they sweat.

263
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,960
What are you talking about?

264
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,900
What do you mean? I want to see you play basketball.

265
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,110
- All of a sudden? 
 - Yes, all of a sudden.

266
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,100
I really want to see it. Can you, please?

267
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,550
Are your eyes hurting?

268
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,980
Just once. Play basketball.

269
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,310
You need to exercise. You need to exercise and sweat.

270
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,250
Let's go.

271
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,380
Ahjussi, just once. Please? Basketball.

272
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,730
Kang Hoon, leave now.

273
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,800
- What? 
 - Right now. Happy, So Jin?

274
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,900
- Go! 
 - Start!

275
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,370
Front. Stay.

276
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,650
Nice.

277
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,950
Good.

278
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,840
Seo Kang Hoon! Nice, Kang Hoon! So cool!

279
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,230
You'll need to play hard to make her happy.

280
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,550
Kang Hoon, go! Fighting!

281
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,160
Your fan is scarier than you.

282
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,460
Let's go! You look great!

283
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,960
She's too much today.

284
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,760
 Run a little more. A little more. 

285
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,590
Hey, pass! Pass! No. 7! No. 7!

286
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,140
No. 7! No. 7!

287
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,330
Okay, nice! Nice!

288
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,670
Okay!

289
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,040
Darn it. No. Good job!

290
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,040
That's right. Do that.

291
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,850
 That's right. Keep running. 

292
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,400
 Nice. A little more. Keep running. 

293
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,810
That's it.

294
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,210
That's the real deal.

295
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,500
 That's right. That's right. 

296
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,420
 That's right. 

297
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,320
 No! No! 

298
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,350
 I need to collect that. 

299
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,140
 Gosh, what a waste. 

300
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,990
 That's mine! 

301
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,620
That sweat was the real deal.

302
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,490
Gosh.

303
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,270
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

304
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,180
 Thank you. 

305
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,700
Thank you. Good game.

306
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,150
Are you sure you haven't played in a while? You were good.

307
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,760
- Really? 
 - Yes, you were.

308
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,630
Why aren't you No. 23 today?

309
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,190
I needed the lucky number seven today.

310
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,640
Winners, we're having dinner afterward.

311
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,580
- Should we take a shower and go? 
 - Hyung, I'm sorry.

312
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,280
I have a plan tonight. How about tomorrow?

313
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,420
You little bastard. You're meeting a woman again, aren't you?

314
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,350
You always have to leave halfway.

315
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,080
How about you? You're coming, right?

316
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,580
Hey, where did our goddess of victory go?

317
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,960
Hyung, I'm sorry.

318
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,070
I need to go back to the restaurant, too. Let's eat later.

319
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,420
You two should go instead.

320
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,600
Yes, take them with you. Hurry.

321
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,460
Just forget it.

322
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,700
I don't need you. Don't touch me. I don't need you.

323
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,730
Should we get a beverage instead?

324
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,170
Let go. I don't want you.

325
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,940
 You didn't forget the show tonight, right? See you at eight. 

326
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,880
 You think a beverage could comfort me? 

327
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,200
 I'll get you something tasty. I'll get you two. 

328
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,430
 Two, my foot. 

329
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,590
 There are many people here... 

330
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,600
This is my chance.

331
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,520
His number was...

332
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,830
Seven. It was seven.

333
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,780
Seven. Seven. Seven. Shit...

334
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,200
I'll have the elephant one.

335
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,830
Okay. Let's have five of those. The same one.

336
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,240
Where's seven? Seven!

337
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,920
What's she doing?

338
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,350
Here.

339
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,580
I'm almost there. Almost there. Here I go.

340
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,880
   

341
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,200
 Put the sweaty shirt in a vacuum flask 

342
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,730
 and extract the scent. 

343
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:32,160
 The extracted smell will become the person's unique scent. 

344
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,280
 How much you like the scent will tell you 

345
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,580
 how close he is to becoming your DNA lover. 

346
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:45,190
 It's because his sweat scent contains his immunity gene. 

347
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:53,790
 Women recognize their man's immunity gene for her offspring. 

348
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,010
DNA lover. DNA lover.

349
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,660
DNA lover! DNA lover!

350
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,220
 DNA lover! 

351
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,760
Shim Yun Woo.

352
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,610
He's the man I mentioned before.

353
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,610
Nice to meet you. I'm Shim Yun Woo. Congratulations on your show.

354
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,670
- Thank you. 
 - I really like your work.

355
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,140
What an honor.

356
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,820
By the way, which one did you like so much?

357
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,030
Are you attracted to the baby one because you're an obstetrician?

358
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,610
Is that so?

359
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,830
Most of these paintings were inspired by my pregnancy and childbirth.

360
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,240
Could you tell me what feelings you get from it?

361
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,400
Yes.

362
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,730
The mother's face looks scared but also very sad.

363
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,710
Does she have postpartum depression?

364
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,770
I depicted how I felt when I had my first child.

365
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:13,450
It felt like she would pierce my heart like a nail and stab me.

366
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,310
She grabbed me by my ankles and broke my wings.

367
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:22,210
It felt like she would eat me alive and create my grave.

368
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,300
Mi Eun must feel sad hearing that.

369
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,530
Yun Woo, Mom and I don't share a drop of blood.

370
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,190
- I'm sorry. 
 - We're social mother and daughter.

371
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,620
We all have someone we respect.

372
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,790
Someone you wish were your mom.

373
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:47,330
Someone I would've loved to have as my mom.

374
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,880
I wouldn't have created this painting if Mi Eun were my daughter.

375
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,440
My husband and my children were like a wall to me.

376
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,130
I need to go because the reporters are here.

377
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,800
- See you again. 
 - Take care.

378
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,680
 Did the painter get divorced? 

379
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,340
Her husband passed away.

380
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,560
I heard she has two daughters,

381
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,550
but I've never seen them at her shows.

382
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,980
I think they basically cut ties.

383
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,320
That might be easier for them.

384
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,360
It seems that I like her,

385
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,490
but I don't like her.

386
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,140
You have someone. What's she like?

387
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,640
She's just a person, not a woman to me.

388
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,240
- She's like a stalker. 
 - What?

389
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,240
She's a researcher. The nerd I mentioned before.

390
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,030
I see. She has an intriguing appeal.

391
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,810
You feel uncomfortable, but you're drawn to her.

392
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,180
I've never felt this way before.

393
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,990
I'm curious.

394
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,920
It's 10 weeks old. The ultrasound doesn't show anything unusual.

395
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,340
Congratulations. It's growing up in good health.

396
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,160
- Really, Doctor? 
 - Yes.

397
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,520
By the way, there's something I'm worried about.

398
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,970
My baby's late grandpa went blind.

399
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,290
Let's do a DNA test. Our hospital provides it.

400
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,290
How does it work?

401
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,670
It won't hurt the baby, right?

402
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,960
We won't test the fetus directly. Don't worry.

403
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,180
You and your husband need to do a DNA test first.

404
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,370
You can visit the hospital together.

405
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,450
But the baby's father is too busy.

406
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,700
Let's get your blood sample first, and we'll test with a kit for the father.

407
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,450
Nurse Oh Jin Sun will explain everything to you.

408
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:45,670
Yes. By the way, if you don't mind me asking,

409
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,430
could you tell me what your fetus name was?

410
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,160
I want to have a son like you.

411
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,130
We don't know if it's a boy or a girl yet.

412
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,320
But I...

413
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,650
It was "Shinhon*." 
 *(Means "newlywed")

414
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:12,040
My mother named me that because she wished they would be like newlyweds forever.

415
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,250
Shinhon?

416
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,050
That's pretty. I'll name my fetus that, too.

417
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,530
Okay. We need to do a test for the genetic disorder.

418
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,880
Get a blood sample and send it to Irowoon immediately.

419
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,560
   

420
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,820
What's the deal?

421
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,450
 Knock, knock. Ms. Han. 

422
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,890
   

423
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,850
   

424
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:38,740
   

425
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,550
   

426
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,550
 To extract the scent from the shirt that was processed all night, add distilled alcohol. 

427
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:05,500
 Add 1 ml of the special mixture I created by going through countless trials and errors. 

428
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,360
 If you seal the flask so it reacts fully, 

429
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,680
 you can extract the person's pheromone. 

430
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,640
♫  Just like this fluttering feeling  ♫

431
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,420
♫  You’re filling up my heart  ♫

432
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,180
♫  Your image  ♫

433
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,620
♫  Like a small dizziness  ♫

434
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
Well done.

435
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,120
Isn't that Team Leader Han?

436
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,630
What did she have for lunch today?

437
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,810
She had spicy pork.

438
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:09,140
♫  I’ll follow where my heart leads  ♫

439
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,360
 Shim Yun Woo. 35 years old. 

440
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,050
 Occupation, obstetrician. 

441
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:20,270
 His pheromone smelled heavenly. 

442
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,880
 I've never smelled this from any other DNA lover candidates. 

443
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,720
 It's a sweet and subtle scent. 

444
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:41,700
 It leaves me longing intensely. It's a powerful scent. 

445
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,190
Did you smell it?

446
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,940
Can someone be your DNA lover if the pheromone is to your liking?

447
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,210
It smells like the sewer.

448
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,030
Really? It smells like the sewer?

449
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,770
Yes, that's it.

450
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:16,730
God couldn't have made the 23 pairs and 46 chromosomes so simple.

451
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,850
Calm down, Han So Jin.

452
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,130
This only means he passed the first step.

453
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,090
Then what is the next step?

454
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,120
I need to confirm something before moving on to the next step.

455
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,860
The promiscuous Octo-gene, which makes you cheat, isn't allowed.

456
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:53,080
That's your favorite gene. You'll be reunited with it in the end.

457
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,370
That's why I want to check that first.

458
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:01,100
I'll check if he has the promiscuous Octo-gene that he can't go a day without a woman.

459
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,060
He smells like the sewer, but if he cheats, too...

460
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,420
That's the worst.

461
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,150
But I need his consent first.

462
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,540
How do I get that?

463
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,940
Is someone speaking ill of me today? My left ear is so itchy.

464
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,360
There must be countless women who speak ill of you.

465
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,330
Well, that means they're interested in me in a way.

466
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,160
Should we have the team dinner at Munggi tonight?

467
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,830
I'll call Kang Hoon.

468
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,340
Invite the goddess of victory, too.

469
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,520
Who?

470
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,880
Bring Noona So Jin, too?

471
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,420
Hey, Seo Kang Hoon!

472
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,900
Hey...

473
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,390
We're just having dinner. You didn't have to change.

474
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,350
I felt gross after being in the lab all night.

475
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,020
There he is.

476
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,000
Let's wait inside.

477
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,380
Okay.

478
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,820
 The powerful pheromone. 

479
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,780
 He can't have the promiscuous Octo-gene, right? 

480
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,580
 He definitely looks like the popular type. 

481
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,720
 A bastard like you doesn't deserve to be loved! 

482
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:42,150
I'd get rejected even before I get to try.

483
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,510
Right. That's right.

484
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,330
Not too bad.

485
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,340
Yes, the past is supposed to be forgotten.

486
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,000
Shouldn't you come every week?

487
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,060
But this place is...

488
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,900
You have to be a good dancer.

489
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,850
- Don't be so rash. 
 - All right.

490
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,380
- It's not easy, okay? 
 - Okay.

491
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,810
Try dancing now.

492
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,790
So Jin is here. Let's raise our glasses.

493
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:21,360
Hand me your glass.

494
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,990
Thank you for cheering for our team.

495
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,900
Don't mention it.

496
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,330
Let's put our glasses together.

497
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,900
We came.

498
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,140
We went. We fought. We won.

499
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,130
 We won! 

500
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,260
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

501
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,820
Let me do it for you, Ms. Han.

502
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,280
Okay.

503
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,520
Have some, Ms. Han.

504
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,670
- Thank you. 
 - Eat this, too.

505
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,290
Since when did you like octopus? We seem to have something in common.

506
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,520
I don't like octopus.

507
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,930
They have sex with their legs because their genitalia is located there.

508
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,300
- Pardon? 
 - What?

509
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:26,080
The male octopus approaches the female while in disguise.

510
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,860
Only to the young and not fully developed octopuses.

511
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,780
I have a different opinion.

512
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,910
Octopuses can relate to each other and have strong maternal instincts.

513
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,850
They're strong-hearted because they have three of them.

514
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,090
They have three hearts.

515
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:47,520
But I don't get why they make love with their legs instead.

516
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,010
That's what I'm saying.

517
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:53,380
The gene I'm studying these days is named after the octopus.

518
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,850
It's a combination of "promiscuous" and "octopus."

519
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,350
It's the promiscuous Octo-gene.

520
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:05,730
There's a gene that makes humans genetically cheaters.

521
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:09,680
 She must've been betrayed by a cheater before. 

522
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,750
Do you really believe there's a cheating gene?

523
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,000
It's not just a belief. It exists.

524
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,390
The dopamine receptor in chromosome 11 is the promiscuous Octo-gene.

525
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,690
Most people have two,

526
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:28,190
but some have four, and some even have seven of them.

527
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,110
You should get a DNA test, too.

528
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,550
You always have more of everything.

529
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,340
He has many hobbies, girlfriends-

530
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,930
I know. Ms. Han must know best if I have the promiscuous Octo-gene or not.

531
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,420
Pardon?

532
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,890
Me?

533
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,150
How?

534
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,700
I asked you to do a DNA test last time.

535
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,920
Oh, that?

536
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:59,050
We destroy all personal information after the goal of the test has been met.

537
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:04,800
I don't do DNA tests for personal reasons.

538
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,440
A researcher I know stole a man's uniform.

539
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,260
What could've been the purpose?

540
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,910
She was like this.

541
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:24,590
I'm not sure. I suppose some people do that.

542
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,410
Gosh.

543
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,080
Are you okay?

544
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,240
Give me water.

545
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,670
Keep coughing. Are you okay?

546
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,840
Cough out the octopus.

547
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,680
What's with you?

548
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,710
This is no good.

549
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,620
Let me help you.

550
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,540
What are you doing right now?

551
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,090
I'll push you five times. Keep trying to cough.

552
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,520
You don't have to do this...

553
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,750
I'll start.

554
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,350
- One, two... 
 - Hold on. Hold on.

555
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,630
three, four...

556
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,120
five.

557
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,970
Good job.

558
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,000
It must've been hard. Good job.

559
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,530
Pour me a glass.

560
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,740
Do you need my help again?

561
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,410
I think you have something to return.

562
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,680
Pardon? What do you mean...

563
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,070
I see why you could misunderstand, but it's not like that.

564
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,510
I'll clean it well and give it back to you.

565
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,760
Wh-What is it?

566
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,470
By chance, is that your kink...

567
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:38,410
Pardon? K-Kink? No, it's not like that.

568
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,510
I'll tell you. To be honest–

569
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,300
I'm listening.

570
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:55,380
The immunity gene is mixed in the sweat, and you develop a unique scent.

571
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,710
And depending on the MHC genes in the immunological product,

572
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,290
the smell of that person attracts some people.

573
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,000
- It leads to attraction? 
 - Yes, attraction. That's it.

574
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,710
Do you need to smell someone to know that?

575
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,630
No, it's not that. Biologically-

576
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,810
How was my smell then?

577
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,930
Well... The thing is...

578
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,410
I liked your...

579
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,520
smell, Dr. Shim.

580
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,650
When we fell from the hospital rooftop, your smell...

581
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,940
 felt so vivid that I could almost see it. 

582
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,570
I've never felt that.

583
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,100
And I wanted to find out why.

584
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,860
That's why I stole your uniform.

585
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,590
I'm so sorry.

586
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:03,130
I wanted to experiment to see if I was mistaken or not.

587
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:11,260
Ms. Han,

588
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,340
are you confessing your love for me right now?

589
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,560
Pardon? Love? No.

590
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,900
It's just that I–

591
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,350
Noona, let's get going.

592
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,660
Get up. Let's go.

593
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,210
Okay, let's go.

594
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,510
I should get going, too.

595
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,640
Ms. Han,

596
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,010
I'll drive you home if it's on the way.

597
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,540
No, she lives near me. She can go with me.

598
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,670
I'll make sure to return your shirt.

599
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,940
It looks like you need it for your experiment. Just keep it.

600
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,270
I think you need it more than I do.

601
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,280
What are you talking about?

602
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,820
It's nothing. Let's go.

603
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,690
I'll go.

604
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,010
Why did it have to be an octopus?

605
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,690
Then why did you get stuck inside my throat?

606
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,490
Octopus, octopus, octopus!

607
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:22,290
What do you have against me?

608
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,010
   

609
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:29,980
   

610
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:46,270
The Heimlich maneuver. Was it really necessary?

611
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,680
He touches people so naturally.

612
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,570
He's totally an octopus, isn't he?

613
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:57,860
He knew I had stolen the uniform, but he was testing me.

614
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,380
Yes, I need to know for sure.

615
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,760
I need to do the promiscuous Octo-gene test.

616
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,700
I'll run the test with the uniform for now.

617
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,710
Should I just do it? No.

618
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,560
I can't do it without his consent.

619
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,490
I could get into trouble for this.

620
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,450
But what if he doesn't agree to it? What do I do then?

621
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:20,010
That'd be bad!

622
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,990
Let me sleep.

623
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,090
Let me sleep!

624
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,500
Why did you call me on my day off?

625
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,110
You practically live in the gym if I don't invite you out.

626
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,200
What's wrong with that?

627
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,360
We'll have another serving of soondae.

628
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,240
What's that?

629
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,160
It's a fire.

630
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,130
Let me borrow this water, Sir.

631
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:54,300
- Let's go. 
 - I'll evacuate the victim.

632
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,800
- Notify the station for me! 
 - Okay!

633
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,990
No, I want it to be casual, like a handbook.

634
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,850
Evacuate this way! This way!

635
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:15,190
Stay calm! Stay calm!

636
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,800
It's okay.

637
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,390
Anyone inside?

638
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,890
Yell if you're inside!

639
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,020
I know.

640
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,960
 Is anyone inside? 

641
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,590
 Is anyone inside? 

642
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,480
Is anyone inside?

643
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,010
Who are you—

644
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,240
Didn't you hear the fire warning?

645
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,280
No, I didn't.

646
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,130
Is the emergency speaker just a decoration?

647
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,430
You can't just disconnect that.

648
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,170
It was disconnected when I moved in.

649
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,410
Let's head out. It's dangerous to inhale smoke.

650
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,560
Cover your nose and mouth. Lower your body and follow me.

651
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,810
Lower your body!

652
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:08,210
Be careful. Just one moment.

653
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,970
Yes, Sunbae. I found a tenant on the eighth floor.

654
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,550
We're in the emergency stairway.

655
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,740
We need to go down, but I can't see anything.

656
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,270
 The stairs are still safe. 

657
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,570
 Team Leader came and stopped the fire. 

658
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,020
Okay, I'll be right there.

659
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,900
Don't get scared and hold my arm tightly.

660
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,220
I need to guess where we're going.

661
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,470
We'd both be in danger if you lose me.

662
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,530
Let's go.

663
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,510
Stay calm.

664
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,640
Stay calm.

665
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,490
Hurry!

666
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,810
Are you okay? We're almost there. Hang in there.

667
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,020
That way.

668
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,490
Watch your head.

669
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,580
Are you okay?

670
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,640
 Hold my arm tightly. 

671
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,660
You inhaled a lot of smoke.

672
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,800
Make sure to see a doctor, just in case.

673
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,950
Are you okay?

674
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,370
Yes, I'm okay.

675
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,260
She was on the site for a long time.

676
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,370
Please treat her accordingly.

677
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,300
- H-Hold on– 
 - Your airway might be damaged.

678
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,680
Could you try talking?

679
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,320
What's your name?

680
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,440
J-Jang Mi Eun.

681
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:40,150
 Shim Gynecology puts the parents and children first. 

682
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,870
 I'll be there throughout pregnancy and childbirth... 

683
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,980
I'll get him to consent, no matter what.

684
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,640
 We'll try our best so you can trust us... 

685
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,420
Yes.

686
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,290
 Ms. Han So Jin of Irowoon DNA Center is here. 

687
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,800
Okay.

688
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,480
I have a sample of a hair growth restrictor.

689
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,000
I'm sorry for making you wait.

690
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,060
It took you a long time. I thought you gave up.

691
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,130
These are the samples custom-made to your DNA.

692
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,560
Oh, is that so?

693
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,260
Let me test it.

694
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,620
Well, that's not how you apply it.

695
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,480
- How do you do it, then? 
 - Just one moment.

696
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:51,130
You're smelling my pheromone again, aren't you?

697
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,530
I'm not.

698
00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:00,080
Each strand of hair needs to absorb the restrictor.

699
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:05,800
There. You're done.

700
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:22,920
Dr. Shim, have you...

701
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:28,080
been strongly attracted to a woman's scent before?

702
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:36,170
You're asking what kind of scent I like on women, right?

703
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:40,810
If you don't mind, could you tell me what you think of my scent?

704
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,150
I can't smell from here.

705
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,210
Do you want to come closer?

706
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:15,060
Whoa, I... Dr. Shim, I have a favor to ask.

707
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,990
- What is it? 
 - Well...

708
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:23,690
I would like to do a DNA test on you.

709
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,290
- Could you sign the consent— 
 - But you already did it.

710
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:28,660
This isn't about hair growth.

711
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:33,550
I want to find out about you in detail.

712
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:42,820
To be honest, all of my exes had the promiscuous Octo-gene,

713
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:46,300
and they all cheated on me because it became active.

714
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:56,290
That's why I want to find out if you have that gene.

715
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,600
Promiscuous Octo-gene?

716
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,020
That's what you mentioned last time.

717
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,350
Ms. Han,

718
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:11,580
you talked about attraction through scents last time.

719
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,950
I guess this is how you express your feelings for someone.

720
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:18,060
F-Feelings?

721
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,210
I'm sorry, but I can't agree to do this.

722
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:26,430
Because that's not how men and women get to know each other.

723
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,170
 You're coming to the restaurant with Mother and So Ri today, right? 

724
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:01,020
   

725
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:26,780
   

726
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:28,830
Yes, Director.

727
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,590
Hey, I just arrived.

728
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,300
I get sick every time I leave the country these days.

729
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,350
 Are you at the hotel? 

730
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,660
I'm on my way there now.

731
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,350
Is your mom doing well?

732
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:46,890
The hormone medication doesn't seem to work. I'm thinking of switching it.

733
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,170
 Make sure she keeps seeing the psychiatrist, too. 

734
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:53,560
That's on hold for now since she took all the tranquilizers at once.

735
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,470
 Okay. Everything's fine at the hospital, right? 

736
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:59,030
- Yes, of course. 
  - We'll go straight to the hotel, right? 

737
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:04,250
Yes, I'll see you when you're at the hospital.

738
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,620
Okay.

739
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:14,190
Which table is this for? No. 4?

740
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,120
Here's your order.

741
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,800
- Father. 
 - Hey.

742
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,530
Hey, Hyung.

743
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:25,360
I came for a drink, but you're busy. I'll come back next time.

744
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,550
No, it's okay. Everyone will leave soon. Sit here.

745
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:30,140
- Would that be okay? 
 - Yes, it's fine.

746
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,390
Business is good.

747
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,910
Have you eaten?

748
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,440
I'll get you your usual.

749
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,450
Why don't I help Father instead?

750
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,540
- You know how good I am. 
 - It's okay. It's okay.

751
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,520
Just sit and wait.

752
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:56,110
Here's the warm sake you always get.

753
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,730
Wait just a moment.

754
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:28,440
Yoon Sub,

755
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,120
Kang Hoon is taking good care of So Jin. Don't worry about her.

756
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:40,390
I'll take good care of your family on your behalf, too.

757
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:43,490
Enjoy it and have a relaxing time.

758
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,210
Thank you, Ahjussi.

759
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,810
What's this?

760
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,430
Did you already forget?

761
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,520
They're the utensils for Dad.

762
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,870
Here's the sashimi.

763
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:51,810
Mother, our aged kimchi is delicious.

764
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:55,020
Try it with the salmon sushi.

765
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,800
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

766
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:02,320
Hey, So Ri, turn that off now.

767
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,250
It's because they whimper in front of the door when I'm not there.

768
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,730
You listen to Kang Hoon, at least.

769
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,180
Kang Hoon has the scent our family doesn't have.

770
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,070
The scent of a human.

771
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:22,290
I'll get you plums when you're done.

772
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,320
Enjoy the meal.

773
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,790
His wish was merely to have a meal with his family.

774
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:34,160
That's why your dad's life ended that way.

775
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,530
Keep this in mind.

776
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:39,020
A family member who can't support himself is the worst.

777
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,980
That's worse than a stranger.

778
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:53,400
You say these things even to a stranger.

779
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,250
He was the head of our family his whole life.

780
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:58,760
"Well done. You did great. It's okay."

781
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,610
Have you ever said that to us even once, Mom?

782
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:08,040
What do I owe you, exactly?

783
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,830
Why do you ask so much from me?

784
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:12,550
Being your mother is my sin.

785
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,500
Be quiet, both of you!

786
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,870
Can't you just stop?

787
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:19,480
Everyone has a right to be forgotten.

788
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,330
You barely remember him. Did you already forget?

789
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:24,910
Is that why you always criticized him so harshly?

790
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:27,670
You're the one who blocked his number.

791
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:30,120
Think carefully, Han Seo Jin.

792
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,440
Dad died because of you.

793
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,280
- What? 
 - You two.

794
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,230
Do you know what you inherited from your father?

795
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:41,200
Depressive tendencies.

796
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,200
So Jin, do you know what you've always said as a teenager?

797
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,100
You always said, "I'm hurt. I'm in pain. I want to die."

798
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,140
"I didn't want to have you, but I was forced to."

799
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:58,770
I think I inherited depressive tendencies from you since I grew up hearing that.

800
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:01,410
You must've been so depressed.

801
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:05,030
The horrible thing was growing inside you every day.

802
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:10,020
 I depicted how I felt when I had my first child. 

803
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:15,690
 It felt like she would pierce my heart like a nail and stab me. 

804
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:24,660
Hey, why do you always expect things from her?

805
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,450
Don't you know there's no love in this family?

806
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:31,280
Yes, I was wrong.

807
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:35,000
We're the suicide victim's family and accomplices who drove him to it.

808
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,980
I thought we could...

809
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,630
pretend to be a normal family, at least today.

810
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:46,650
For just an hour while we eat with Dad...

811
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,760
I thought we could...

812
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:52,630
be a family for just an hour.

813
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,700
You must feel good after stabbing someone.

814
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:03,770
What were you thinking?

815
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:08,410
Did you really not know he'd die like that?

816
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:17,750
- Kang Hoon. 
  - Excuse me. 

817
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,780
- Leave her alone. 
  - Excuse me. 

818
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:23,520
I'm still waiting for the sushi I ordered earlier.

819
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:23,370
   

820
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,810
You must be cold.

821
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,670
Ta-da.

822
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:30,950
Were you at the restaurant the whole time?

823
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:35,780
- By chance, did you– 
 - You must've loved your father a lot.

824
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,240
I did.

825
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:46,270
But, of course, he loved my mom more.

826
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:51,080
But loving someone doesn't mean it's fate.

827
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:56,010
If you love someone alone,

828
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,520
 you suffer as much as you love them. 

829
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:09,370
You must think my experiments are silly,

830
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:12,310
but I believe there's a DNA lover.

831
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:18,180
I believe you need to find your perfect match to save and

832
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,600
redeem each other.

833
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,840
If I meet my other half,

834
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,890
I'll be so good to him.

835
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:36,810
Because he must've been very sad before we met.

836
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:44,500
 Each woman looks pretty in different moments. 

837
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:47,890
 With this woman, 

838
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:50,560
 it's right now. 

839
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:53,460
 It's strange. 

840
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,040
Are you still interested in my genes?

841
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,090
- Pardon? 
 - I don't think the problem would be solved your way,

842
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:13,020
but try testing on me. You have my consent.

843
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:19,310
- Really? 
 - By the way, do you have to do this like last time?

844
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:22,750
No, I just need your uniform.

845
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,360
Uniform?

846
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:27,810
You agreed, okay?

847
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,000
Thank you!

848
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,060
My gosh! My gosh! My gosh!

849
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,890
Thank you!

850
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,230
You can't change your mind later.

851
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,130
You can't change your mind later!

852
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,830
Please. The DNA with the beautiful scent.

853
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:19,320
I hope it's not there.

854
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:54,220
He has superior genes, as I expected.

855
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,070
He has everything that's good.

856
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:59,450
He has quick reflexes.

857
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:03,720
He has amazing long-term memory and space-recognition skills.

858
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:17,350
 The... The... 

859
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,870
 promiscuous Octo-gene. 

860
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:26,040
   

861
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,820
 He has seven of them. 

862
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:30,950
 He is the biggest womanizer. 

863
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:35,750
His DRD4 tandem repeats seven times at least.

864
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,510
He has the strongest promiscuous Octo-gene.

865
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:39,460
He's not just a two-timer.

866
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:42,790
He can be a seven-timer! No.

867
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:45,270
He must have countless women.

868
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:51,650
No way! How could this be!

869
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:54,690
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

870
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,580
I'll wash the uniforms and give them back to you.

871
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,470
It's okay. I'll wash them.

872
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:01,440
By the way, there's one missing.

873
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,990
What pervert would steal a uniform soaked in sweat?

874
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,910
By the way, whose uniform was this?

875
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:07,620
Look carefully.

876
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:10,380
Didn't both you and Yun Woo wear No. 7?

877
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:20,780
   

878
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:25,580
♫  You think I'm odd enough  ♫

879
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,490
♫  So many things to qualify  ♫

880
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,570
♫  Oh baby, hold on tight  ♫

881
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:35,850
♫  I’m heading deep into your mind, don't care 'bout your hurt  ♫

882
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:39,950
♫  I mean it so, oh baby, hold ya breath  ♫

883
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:42,950
♫  You'll see how I conquer your heart  ♫

884
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:48,290
♫  I’ll tune all my parts to own you  ♫

885
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,740
♫  You said it, right? Hey  ♫

886
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:54,630
♫  Hope we can chill and take some time  ♫

887
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,870
   

888
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,850
 That womanizer is my DNA lover? 

889
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:03,280
 - Hurry, hurry! 
 - What's with her? 

890
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,970
 Dr. Shim, you have the promiscuous Octo-gene. 

891
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:08,900
 Who's this? 

892
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:12,100
 The fate can't be found through experiments. 

893
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,210
 Can't believe I'm meeting the man who saved my life here. 

894
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:17,650
 Someone like him gets aggressive once he crosses the line. 

895
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:19,510
 It's hot. 

896
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:23,360
 By the way, who's bothering you this much, Yun Woo? 

897
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,580
 I know. She bothers me for some reason. 

898
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,190
 Kang Hoon, someone's following me! 

899
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:30,790
 - Han So Jin! 
 - Ms. Han!
