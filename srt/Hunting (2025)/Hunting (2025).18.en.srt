I didn't commit any crime!

196
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,990
You didn't commit any crime?

197
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,670
What did you do last night?

198
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,990
You violently resisted law enforcement!

199
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,660
Calm down, Zixian.

200
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,720
Mou Yikuo.

201
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,710
From what I know,

202
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,430
in Fengmao Village,

203
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,980
most people have the surname Mou,

204
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,200
right?

205
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,730
You're all related.

206
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,720
So what's your relationship

207
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,960
with Mou Haidong?

208
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,260
We're just neighbors,

209
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,950
nothing more than that.

210
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,550
Right.

211
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,670
All of you in the whole village

212
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,270
are neighbors and relatives.

213
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,960
So are you and him

214
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,840
close,

215
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,270
or do you just know his name?

216
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,230
Just...

217
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,210
I just know his name.

218
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,340
We're not close.

219
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,270
We're not close.

220
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,650
Good.

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,060
Show him the photo.

222
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,330
You just know his name, right?

223
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,810
Take a closer look.

224
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,840
The person in the photo

225
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,150
looks a bit like me.

226
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,900
Coincidence.

227
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,280
Alright,

228
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,030
no problem.

229
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,550
I understand.

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,630
Usually,

231
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,330
suspects like you

232
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,810
refuse to admit what they've done.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,550
But

234
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,030
I need to tell you something.

235
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,820
According to

236
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,090
the "Criminal Procedure Law

237
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,320
of the People's Republic of China",

238
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,960
when handling cases,

239
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,120
we do need confession from suspects.

240
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,960
But we value more factual evidence,

241
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,830
which means physical evidence.

242
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,110
No, officer,

243
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,830
I really don't know him well.

244
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,480
I don't know about his drug business.

245
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,720
I'm not his drug cook.

246
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,550
Didn't the LSD stamps sell well?

247
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,080
Why not sell those anymore?

248
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,480
Making LSD stamps is easy.

249
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,130
Making meth requires skills.

250
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,800
I don't have the skills.

251
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,030
Right.

252
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,930
So you were making the LSD stamps before,

253
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,200
because it doesn't require many skills.

254
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,700
You're quite deeply involved, aren't you?

255
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,500
Let me ask you.

256
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,150
Who is Mou Haidong's drug cook?

257
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,240
I don't know.

258
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,750
I think you're well aware

259
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,750
that Mou Haidong has been executed.

260
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,720
So what are you hesitating about?

261
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,980
What are you afraid of?

262
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,720
Is someone threatening you?

263
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,550
No.

264
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,290
Then speak up if you're not afraid.

265
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm just a...

266
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,200
Think carefully before answering me,

267
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,870
OK?

268
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,530
Don't make things up anymore.

269
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,030
Fine.

270
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,780
What do you want to know?

271
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,600
I'll tell you everything,

272
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,200
but

273
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,270
can I get a reduced sentence?

274
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,200
Mou Yikuo,

275
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,630
this isn't your first time doing this,

276
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,240
right?

277
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,900
According to the "Anti-Drug Law

278
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,550
of the People's Republic of China",

279
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,150
you're now suspected of

280
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,840
drug manufacturing,

281
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,630
drug trafficking,

282
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,090
and drug transportation.

283
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,360
Multiple offenses combined for punishment.

284
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,120
I don't need to tell you

285
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,650
what your fate will be, do I?

286
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,140
Mou Haidong has an illegitimate son.

287
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,910
He's actually the most skilled drug cook

288
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,700
in the business.

289
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,560
Do you know this illegitimate son?

290
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,450
I've met him a few times.

291
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,560
His age

292
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,220
is about the same as mine.

293
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,600
He

294
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,110
isn't very tall.

295
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,560
His appearance is average.

296
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,720
People in the village

297
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,730
used to call him

298
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,720
Pigpen Boy.

299
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,960
I can say one more thing.

300
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,200
His mother was also in this business.

301
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,010
Mou Haidong cultivated him.

302
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,290
That Pigpen Boy,

303
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,560
what's his real name?

304
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,630
I remember

305
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,270
they called him

306
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,390
Mou...

307
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,360
Mou...

308
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,750
Mou Sen.

309
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,440
Yes.

310
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,270
Mou Sen.

311
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,400
Which "Sen"?

312
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,520
I really don't know that.

313
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,410
Take a look.

314
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,490
Looks like him.

315
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,720
Mou Sen.

316
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
It's him. Mou Sen.

317
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,080
[Public Security Notice Board]

318
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Mou Sen.

319
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,360
[Mou Sen, Male]

320
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,960
We're getting closer to him.

321
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,560
[Reward Notice]

322
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,530
How did you find this place?

323
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,730
How is Four-Eyes Hao doing?

324
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,620
He's OK.

325
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,830
Really?

326
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,060
I'll help him quit.

327
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,130
How will you help him quit?

328
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,260
How can you help him?

329
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,960
Mou Sen is the source of drugs.

330
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,940
You help him?

331
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,640
Mou...

332
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,350
Yes.

333
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,240
Mou Sen.

334
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,290
He's Mr. Luo.

335
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,650
He's also the drug cook.

336
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,240
His surname is Mou.

337
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,300
His name is Mou Sen.

338
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,440
It seems Mou Sen

339
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,270
hasn't even told you

340
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,840
his real name.

341
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,060
Let me tell you now.

342
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,870
Mou Sen

343
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,550
is Mou Haidong's illegitimate son.

344
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,590
He trained him to make drugs

345
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,640
since he was a kid.

346
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,880
Duozai,

347
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,570
just think about it.

348
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,000
He grew up

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,680
in a drug den.

350
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,240
You want him to quit drugs with you.

351
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,030
You're really naive.

352
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,660
Mou Sen is using you.

353
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,340
Remember that sales clerk

354
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,550
from Baiye Music Store I mentioned before?

355
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,680
Her name is Zhan Cui.

356
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,060
After relapsing, she had a breakdown

357
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,570
and killed her boss.

358
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,280
That was also caused by him.

359
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,540
What do you want?

360
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,440
I want to take him down

361
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,270
with you.

362
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,970
Why do you hate him so much?

363
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,480
Three years ago,

364
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,790
Mou Sen

365
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,940
killed my boss.

366
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,280
He was like family to me.

367
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,230
I've been looking for him for three years.

368
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,000
You want to kill him?

369
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I won't kill him.

370
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,050
Killing him would send me to prison.

371
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,070
I want to catch him

372
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,800
and hand him over to the police.

373
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:54,900
Duozai,

374
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,080
I don't know why you're still hesitating.

375
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,420
Someone like Mou Sen

376
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,290
will discard people after using them.

377
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,010
You can stay by his side,

378
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,740
but the next person

379
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,520
to be abandoned will be you.

380
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,030
Where is he?

381
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,270
I don't know where he is.

382
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,550
I'm asking you where Mou Sen is.

383
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,280
I really don't know where he is.

384
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,000
Hao knows.

385
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,310
Duozai.

576
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,340
Where is Yang Yipeng now?

577
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,370
Are you looking for Duozai?

578
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,720
I'm looking for you.

579
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,360
Mou Sen.

580
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,060
We know each other？

581
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,840
More than that.

582
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,570
I've been looking for you for 3 years.

583
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,420
Three years?

584
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,770
The fishing raft.

585
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,970
I'd forgotten until you mentioned it.

586
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,120
Surprised?

587
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,600
It is quite surprising.

588
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,480
But I'm more surprised

589
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,620
that the explosion didn't kill you.

590
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,010
You didn't die,

591
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,760
so I had to survive.

592
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,840
I never expected

593
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,560
that Mr. Zhen was actually a cop.

594
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,110
What?

595
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,870
You came to find me

596
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,390
for revenge

597
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,800
or to arrest me?

598
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,030
What do you think?

599
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,230
You came here alone.

600
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,760
You probably didn't come to arrest me.

601
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:02,940
Here you are.

602
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,440
Don't run!

603
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,240
Don't catch me! Don't catch me!

604
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,210
I'll give you money!

605
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,340
I'll give you money!

606
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:30,900
I don't want money.

607
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,160
I want your life today.

608
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,970
You're a policeman.

609
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,610
You can't harm

610
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,160
someone who surrenders voluntarily.

611
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,190
You know a lot about police,

612
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,740
don't you?

613
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:56,910
But let me tell you,

614
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,380
you don't know me.

615
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,220
This knife is yours.

616
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,960
I was acting in self-defense.

617
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,480
You're a police officer.

618
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,320
You can't kill people.

619
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,720
You're not a human being.

620
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,880
You're a bastard.

621
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,230
[End]

622
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,440
What's wrong?

623
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,790
I never expected

624
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,590
that Mr. Zhen was actually a cop.

625
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,710
Get up.

626
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,710
You're not dead yet! Hurry up and go!

627
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,360
Go!

628
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,210
Kill him.

629
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:37,880
Fine.

630
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,180
Come here.

631
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,730
Go to hell!

632
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,250
What are you doing?

633
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,920
There's no time.

634
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Stop right there.

635
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,430
Don't run.

636
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,600
Get in the car.
