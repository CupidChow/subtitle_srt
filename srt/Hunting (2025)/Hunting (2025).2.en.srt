You want fifty more kilograms.

764
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,179
Are you kidding me?

765
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,880
You've been stalling for three years.

766
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,050
Even if you borrow money from a bank

767
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,230
for three years,

768
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,480
you have to pay interest.

You know why we had to delay.

771
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,580
I do know the reason.

772
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,340

Du won't let you off the hook.

775
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,630
If he doesn't spare you,

776
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,000
he won't spare me either.

777
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,260
If he doesn't spare me,

778
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,130
I won't spare your brother.

779
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,880
We're in the same boat now.

780
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,260
Fifty kilograms.

781
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,410
That's not too much

782
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,050
for three years's interest, right?

784
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,240
Fifty kilograms is not a small amount.

785
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,360
You're a cook, aren't you?

786
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,020
You can handle 200 kilograms,

787
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,620
so fifty is nothing.

788
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,200
So who is asking

789
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,780

Don't falsely accuse me.

I've been doing business with your father

793
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,710
for years,

794
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,360
we've always valued honesty.

That's all for today's class.

Thank you.

If you hadn't helped me three years ago,

I couldn't have escaped from Nanzhou.

816
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,670
Then why didn't you take me with you?

I was on the run.

818
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,250
You couldn't have endured that hardship.

819
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,800
Don't push all the blame onto me.

820
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,840
Isn't it because your affairs

821
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
were always more important than me?

822
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,880
Just tell me,

00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,760
how do you want me to help you this time?

824
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,520
I need a place

825

00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,680
I'm a pharmacist.

831
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,810
How long have you been stalking me?

00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,160
You came back just to use me, didn't you?

833
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,190
In Nanzhou,

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,340
I have no one I can trust

I know you're with someone else now,

837
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,180

I'll give you the drug store.

But you need to understand that

842
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,440
this isn't about love.

843
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,860
It's business.

Mou, let me ask you.

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,540
Are you and that drug maker

850
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,070
related by blood?

851
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,920
He must be hiding among these people

852
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,700
who donated blood to you.

853
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,540
I don't know.

854
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,340
Who are you talking about?

855
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:35,950
I don't know.

856
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,000
I don't care what message

857
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,410
you're trying to send by hurting yourself.

858
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,920
Let me be clear with you.

859
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,760
It's useless.

860
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,590
You don't know?

861
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,150
Fine.

862
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,700
But you should know that

863
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,650
if the goods aren't delivered,

864
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,870
the buyers won't let it go.

865
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,200
You and your family are in danger.

866
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,350
You'd better cooperate with us.

867
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,550
I demand protection for my family.

868
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,450
Then I'll tell you.

869
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,380
I'll tell you everything.

870
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,970
Is that all you want?

00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,600
That can be arranged.

872
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,920
Just cooperate with us.

873
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,520
Tell us everything you know,

874
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,650
and the police will protect them well.

875
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,890
So you hurt yourself

876
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,510
for such a simple reason.

877
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,000
My family is innocent.
