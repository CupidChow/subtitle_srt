[Episode 11]

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,450
Liu Bingqiang,

4
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,650
where were you last Wednesday night?

5
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,500
I don't recall.

6
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,650
Here's a little reminder for you.

7
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,229
The wild beach in Zhangjiang.

8
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,070
Officer, what are you talking about?

9
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,479
That beach thing
doesn't ring a bell with me.

10
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,039
Fine.

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,450
Then take a look at this.

12
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Has it jogged your memory?

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,070
Officer,

14
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,090
is it illegal to stroll by the sea?

15
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,490
No, that's not illegal.

16
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,630
But the refrigerated truck drivers

17
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,360
and the porters all confessed

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,140
that it was you who hired them that day

19
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,079
to transport goods to the beach.

20
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,380
I'm giving you a chance now.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,360
I can't control what they say, can I?

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,180
I'm telling you,
I'm feeling terrible right now

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,740
in this condition.

24
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,400
Tell me

25
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,150
who exactly texted you and told you

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,090
to withdraw.

27
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,090
I'm in pain.

28
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,310
Liu Bingqiang,

29
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,590
stop pretending, will you?

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,000
Listen,

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
you'd better come clean.

32
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,430
Why the yelling?

33
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,290
What kind of attitude is this?

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,750
Criminal suspects are humans too.

35
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,880
What has he done now?

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,870
He is being all slippery and evasive.

37
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,329
He just wouldn't confess.

38
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,280
Alright. Apologize.

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
I'm sorry for his rudeness.

40
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,940
Apologize.

41
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,590
Apologize!

42

I'm sorry.

43
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,280
Get out.

44
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,420
You're recovering well.

45
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,710
Knowing you had woken up,
I thought you'd be hungry,

46
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,570
so I brought you
noodles cooked with pork trotters.

47
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,360
I forgot you couldn't eat this
in such a condition.

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,220
This might be bad for your health.

49
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,020
I know

50
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,040
you definitely won't disclose anything.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,060
Even Yang Min has confessed.

52
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,680
This is a very serious case.

53
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,079
You can't take the heat.

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
To be honest,

55
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,210
I find your behavior quite baffling.

56
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,710
You finally turned a new leaf
after spending many years in prison.

57
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,040
Don't you think you're being foolish now?

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,030
Of course,

59
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,089
I know someone must have forced you.

60
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,870
But can you honestly say
you never thought about

61
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,160
committing crimes one last time

62
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,290

63
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,960

64
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,350
Well, you meant to do
what's best for your son.

65
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,100
But why did you drag him into this mess?

67
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,670
threatening me with my son, aren't you?

68
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,430
Nonsense.

69
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,180
I'm a police officer.

70
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,830
How could I threaten you?

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,220
I'm simply sticking to the facts.

72
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,970
Our acts are based on evidence.

73
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,380
Alright.

74
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,110
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

75
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,440
Have a good rest.

76
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,300

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,780
Oh, right.

If you're dissatisfied

79

with that young officer from earlier,

80
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,830
just file a complaint.

81
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,360
Okay?

83
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,560
Fine.

00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,050
My son doesn't know anything.

87
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,950
I lied to him.

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,500
He doesn't know anything?

89
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,870
Then you must know everything.

90
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,130
He really has nothing to do with this.

91
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,830
What do you want?

92
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,350
I think you're well aware

93
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,060
that claiming he's innocent won't help.

94
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,090
This is drug trafficking.

95
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,280
Offenders can be executed for trafficking
a certain amount. Do you know that number?

96

You can keep silent.

97

99

Did you guys plant a spy in our squad?

how is Duozai doing?

I'd hate to see anything happen to Duozai.

121
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
That's because Duozai is top talent

in the future.

On the night in question,

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,120
due to our operation,

131
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,380
those drug dealers failed to make drugs.

132

133

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,700
Gu Zhifeng was the one
who tipped them off.

137

I believe they'll get in contact again.

138
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,510
Based on
Captain Luo's investigation results,

139
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,410
it was indeed Gu Zhifeng

140
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,960
who gave the drug dealers

141
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,090
a heads up on the night in question.

142
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,549
Since Gu was transferred here
from the Narcotics Control Brigade

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,000

It won't be long before he retires.

But who would've thought?

148
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,030
I assure you, Chief Fang,

149

in my bureau is crooked,

and collect goods from him.

at the beach failed.

that Mou Haidong still has goods in stock?

00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,810
Since we can't meet in person,

563
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,390
we have to proceed with
this standard procedure.

564
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,850
What is your date of birth?

565
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,830
November 29,

566
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,350
1976.

567
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,560
What is your mother's name?

568
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,830
Luo Fenghua.

569
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,440
I think you've already received
a copy of the will.

570
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,000
I was authorized by Mr. Mou Haidong

571
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,480
to read his will after his passing.

572
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,940
The content is as follows.

573
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,540
I, Mou Haidong,

574
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,790
hereby leave
my international online trading account

575
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,070
to Mou Sen.

576
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,200
It is accessed

577
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,700
by Mou Lang's iris.

578
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,510
Mou Lang's iris?

579
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,520
Yes.

580
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,770
Mr. Mou decided

581
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,760
to give you the account long ago.

582
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,250
But without Mou Lang,
you won't get anything.

583
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,790
Continue to carry out your promise.

584
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,110
Good luck.

585
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,510
Hey, Yipeng.

586
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,240
The household registration office

587
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,970
has faxed over some documents.

588
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,690
The person you've mentioned
was probably called Luo Fenghua.

589
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,200
However, in 2002, she already died

590
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,240
from drowning.

591
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,680
Her family reported the incident
and said it was possibly a murder.

592
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,110
But there was no proof of it.

593
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,030
The records show
that she didn't have children.

594
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,480
Mou Haidong never acknowledged
this son of his.

595
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,340
He even confined them in a pigpen.

596
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,770
You're suspecting...

597
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,720
Luo's son is the drug cook?

598
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,200
Yes.

599
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,280
This man must be Luo Yuansu.

600
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,340
Okay.

601
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,000
Keep following this lead.

602
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,720
Be careful.

I don't know who you're talking about.

614

about 5'11''.

from the Xinji police.

Is he the Xinji buyer
that Liu Libo is dealing with?

Why is he coming to Nanzhou in person?

00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,670
Stop following me around.

749
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,440
It's annoying.

750
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,630
Then tell me the reason!

751
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,190
I have another important task...

752
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,880
I have another important task

753
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,590
for you, alright?

754
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,620
What is it?

755
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Don't go away!

756
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,360
What's the task? Say it!

757
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,510
I need you to partner with Yang Yipeng.

758
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,550
Aren't you playing the role
of his daughter?

759
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,350
Yes. And then?

760
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,150
Go talk to him!

761
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,550
Would you let me use the bathroom?

762
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,120
Then I'll wait for you
outside the bathroom.

763
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,230
Can't you just go find him?

764
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,230
I really need to use the bathroom now.

765
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,230
But you must talk this over with me
before I go find him!

766
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,600
Welcome back.

767
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm frying hairtail fish for you.

768
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,530
It smells so good.

769
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,310
Let's eat.

770
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,260
What do you think is on Luo's mind?

771
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,360
Is he trying to keep me out
of Tang Du's case?

772
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,960
He's worried about your safety.

773
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,590
Especially
since you were held hostage once,

774
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,050
he's become more worried.

775
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,230
So I won't get in danger if I'm with you?

776
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,710
You'll be in even bigger danger.

777
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,710
That makes sense.

778
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,000
Tell me.

779
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,630
Why did you ask me to come?

780
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,360
You know
what Lion Dance troupes do, right?

781
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,920
Yes.

782
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,280
They perform in the temple fair,

783
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,230
which is Nanzhou's biggest folk activity.

784
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,400
Only the locals

785
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,730
who are considered blessed can attend it.

786
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,670

[Nanzhou Temple Fair]

788
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,280
You seem like a blessed girl.

789
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,080
You can be an eligible attendee, right?

790
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,640
Captain Luo
has really thought this through.

791
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,600
But what are we attending
the temple fair for?

792
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,130
This is Luo Yuansu,

793
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,030
the drug cook we're looking for.

794
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,030
[Wanted Notice]

795
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,610
He might show up that day.

796
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,560
But...

797
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,630
there are no signs of Tang Du

798
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,830
and Liu Libo attending the temple fair.

799
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,200
Here's what I think.

800
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,510
Tang Du and Liu Libo might both be decoys.

801
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,260
That can be a possibility.

802
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,320
Maybe they're going for
a diversion tactic this time.

803
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,250
Even if the chance of success is 1%,

804
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,570
we must put 100% of hard work in it.

805
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,250
I'm on your side.

806
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,160
Did you hear me?

807
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,960
Let's go.

808
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,760
Time to eat!

809
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,440
Now, the problem is,

810
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,970
we need to deliver the remaining goods

811
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,850
in exchange for the hostages.

812
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,830
But you don't have enough goods.

813
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,960
I've made some more.

814
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,090
Now, I need someone

815
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,520
to transport the goods.

816
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,440
Which of you would like to do it?

817

818

Don't you know why?

819
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,360
We're talking about rescuing Duozai.

820
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,180
He's your son.

821
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,760
Don't you know how serious this is?

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,150
Plus, when the work is done,

823
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,410
you'll make a fortune.

824
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,830
Think it over.

825
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,450
Let me do it.

826
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,110
I feel like
I've got Duozai into hot water.

in the past two days.

huh?

830
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,510
Why can't I do it?

Stay out of this!

835
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,800
You're so weak

836
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,930
and inexperienced.

00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,150
It's okay.

839

will both come back safely.

Eighty percent.

to cope with emergencies.
