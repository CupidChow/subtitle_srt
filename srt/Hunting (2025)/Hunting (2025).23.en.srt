566
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,500
So, listen now!

567
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,290
This used to be
a mountain mining facility.

568
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,820
Plus, it's close to the border.

569
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,720
So it's been neglected for quite a while.

570
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,000
Here, we've got enough resources
to keep us comfortable,

571
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,930
even if we have to go into lockdown.

572
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,480
Of course,
we've got big plans for the future.

573
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,710
Whatever you can dream on,

574
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,110
the Platinum Road will eventually have it.

575
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,130
I don't think this is the place.

576
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,660
But Duozai's location was here just now.

577
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,200
Though there aren't signals now,

578
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,930
there should be some traces left.

579
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:12,440
There are indeed signs
of a car coming by here.

580
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,000
But

581
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,170
the trail ends here.

582
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,720
Could it be that they found the tag

583
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,530
and dumped it somewhere nearby?

584
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,540
In that case...

585
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,710
The informant is in grave danger now.

586
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,510
Captain Yang.

587
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,510
I've detected
an extremely weak signal source.

588
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,640
What signal source?

589
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,020
It can't be determined.

590
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,610
It's intermittent.

[Location Management platform]

592
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,030
Besides expanding the size of the base,

593
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,550
we're also improving
our defensive measures.

594
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,150
Open it up!

595
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,050
Yes!

596
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,350
We plan to build the walls
with thick cement

597
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,590
to increase their strength and durability.

598
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,520
In Dianchuan,

599
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,440
there are some abandoned mining sites

600
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,600
remotely located in complicated areas

601
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,130
with few inhabitants.

602
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,260
Could it be possible

603
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,150
that the Platinum Road we're looking for

604
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,800
is actually hidden in there?

605
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,890
That would explain

606
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,580
why a car suddenly disappeared
when it got here.

607
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
The Platinum Road

608
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,450
should be somewhere around here.

609
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,260
Let's check out the foot of the mountain.

610
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,880
Our current supplies

611
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,140
are sufficient for long-term survival.

612
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,780
Even if we end up
getting cut off from the outside world,

613
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,220
we don't need to worry about safety here.

614
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,230
Unbelievable.

615
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,670
I thought

616
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,890
the Platinum Road was just a network.

617
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,020
I didn't expect it to be here.

618
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,650
We will continue to grow.

619
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,450
As long as we have a platform,
raw materials, capital,

620
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,400
and sales, of course,

621
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,280
we'll build some new facilities

622
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,070
to produce our own drugs.

623
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,920
I want the Platinum Road
to develop its own brand!

624
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,920
For that,

625
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,940
I need you to join us.

626
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,600
Together,

627
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,280
we can become leaders
in global market of drugs.

628
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,710
Coming here

629
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,600
is the best decision I ever made.

630
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,230
The returns on your involvement
in the Platinum Road

631
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,630
will not disappoint you.

632
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,190
Everyone here is a shareholder.

633
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,230
And this...

634
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,110
This is our common kingdom.

635
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,590
We've detected some

636
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,100
weak signal interference sources nearby.

637
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,700
Very good.

638
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,800
Keep monitoring.

639
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,480
It seems

640
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,230
their equipment

641
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,960
is affecting our monitoring.

642
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,000
This is the location.

643
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,800
If what Boji said is true,

644
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,190
and we can truly find
signal interference sources here,

645
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,070
then there must be

646
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,360
operation facilities
regarding the dark web.

647
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,310
Duozai has really led us
to the Platinum Road.
