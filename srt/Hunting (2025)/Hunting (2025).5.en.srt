Why do you think it's him?

194
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,700
He knew where the car was,

195
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,000
and he hates drugs.

196
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,270
He also has a grudge
against Gold-Tooth Wan.

197
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,870
So he's the most suspicious.

198
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,720
What about evidence?

199
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
You're asking me?

200
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,480
I think you've got our roles reversed.

201
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,270
You're the cop.

202
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,390
You're the one who needs to find it out,

203
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,190
but you want me to do everything.

204
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,790
Beg me,

205
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,790
and I'll help you.

206
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,270
Yang Yipeng, your attitude is terrible.

207
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,650
Why should I beg you?

208
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,120
You used to be a police officer.

209
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,670
Do you realize
you're acting like a thug now?

210
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,730
Your behavior is nothing like that
of a police officer!

211
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,670
I look like a thug?

212
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,440
That's exactly right.

213
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,320
I am a thug.

214
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,010
Yang Yipeng, let me tell you something.

215
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,470
You were in the police force
three years ago.

216
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,109
Don't think I don't know
what you've been doing

217
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,310
these past few years.

218
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,720
What have I been doing these years?

219
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,000
If I didn't pretend to be like this,

220
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,540
how could I get close to those people?

221
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,579
How could I make them trust me?

222
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,000
You think I want to be like this?

223
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,150
You have no right to question me!

224
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,030
[Letter of Resignation]

225
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,480
I won't approve

226
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,350
your resignation application.

227
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,480
You won't catch the killer this way.

228
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,880
This is my own choice.

229
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,400
A stupid choice!

230
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,440
Are you so wise?

231
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,270
You've been in the police force for three years.

232
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,800
Have you caught the killer?

233
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,310
Have you found anything out?

234
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,880
Haven't I been investigating

235
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,500
seriously here?

236
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,430
You two start fighting as soon as
you see each other.

237
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,000
Kui.

238
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,110
Would you mind giving us a moment?

239
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,480
Wait.

240
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,220
Give me the key.

241
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,400
Got it.

242
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,000
Your wound

243
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
needs to be treated at the hospital.

244
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,700
Don't touch it.

245
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,510
What are you doing?

246
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,270
You scared me to death!

247
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,030
Luckily I walked slowly,

248
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,920
or you would've killed me.

249
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,400
Uncle,

250
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,350
couldn't you have said something
while knocking?

251
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,440
You almost scared us to death!

252
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,750
How was I supposed to know
if anyone else was here

253
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,920
besides you two?

254
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,110
With something this serious happening,

255
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,440
shouldn't I be careful?

256
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,940
Why are you here?

257
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,430
I brought Hao back.

258
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,230
So you went there too?

259
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,390
Did you kill Gold-Tooth Wan?

260
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
How did it happen?

261
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,030
So it was you

262
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,620
who set the fire?
You were way too impulsive.

263
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,720
Was it you who killed Gold-Tooth Wan?

264
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,640
It wasn't me.

265
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,770
If not you, then who?

266
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,950
I think it might have been me.

267
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,240
You...

268
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,370
I just pushed him once.

269
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,520
Who knew he would die from that?

270
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,640
Well, I'm relieved it's you

271
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,770
—really relieved.

272
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,910
Yeah, it's a good thing it's you.

273
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,350
Uncle, what do you mean?

274
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,480
Hao and I did it together.

275
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,030
Don't play the hero here.

276
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,590
When you first got hold of that car,

277
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,460
you should have come to me right away.

278
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,110
You should come to me
when you're in trouble.

279
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,960
I can take care of the tough stuff.

280
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,820
Even if the sky falls, I can hold it up.

281
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,680
Your impulsiveness has led to this mess.

282
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,720
It's a shame
that such fine goods were destroyed.

283
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,050
What are you getting at?

284
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,400
Are you more worried about the goods,
or about me?

285
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,070
I'm worried about you.

286
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,880
Of course, I'm worried about you...

287
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,410
I am only worried about you.

288
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,850
What about Mr. Zhen?

289
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,880
Mr. Zhen.

290
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,590
He was grabbing those cans (of drugs)
despite the fire.

291
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,590
He said they were worth a fortune,

292
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,480
so he should save as many as he could.

293
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,550
When Mr. Zhen when crazy,

294
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,180
he couldn't care less

295
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,130
about his life!

296
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,040
I told him it would explode.

297
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,960
I warned him about the explosion.

298
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,890
So he's dead too?

299
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,160
I don't know.

300
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,420
When the police came, I ran away quickly.

301
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,960
If he is not dead,

302
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,970
and gets caught by the police,

303
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,480
what if he rats us out, huh?

304
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,110
Shut up!

305
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,330
Don't eat spicy food or get wet recently.

306
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,000
Thank you.

307
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,440
You're welcome.

308
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,390
Is this clinic safe?

309
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,210
Yes, it's safe.

310
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,280
It's a community clinic after all.

311
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,110
[Injection Room]

312
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,750
Dapeng.

313
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,030
Why bother?

314
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,030
Luo

315
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,170
isn't having an easy time either.

316
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,150
He's getting on in years.

317
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,820
When you were away,

318
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,950
he came to me repeatedly.

319
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,580
He wants to retire early.

320
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,510
I shot down his request every time.

321
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,720
The truth is, we're nothing alike.

322
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,980
He's always complaining and grumbling.

323
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,590
If he doesn't want to work,
he should quit.

324
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,450
Just retire.

325
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,310
That's true.

326
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,070
You know Luo's temperament,

327
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,920
don't you?

328
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,510
He talks too much,

329
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,770
and likes to complain.

330
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,890
It's a bad habit.

331
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,110
Frankly,

332
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,440
when you're not around,

333
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,980
he can finally step up,

334
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,660
y'know?

335
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,100
In terms of professional competence
and literacy level,

336
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,660
he's far behind you.

337
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,490
Don't stoop to his level.

338
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,300
No more fighting from now on.

339
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,590
I'm not the one holding grudges.

340
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,070
He's the one with an attitude toward me.

341
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,680
Every time he sees me,

342
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,340
look at the way he speaks to me!

343
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,920
Frankly,

344
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,310
I'm upset with you, too.

345
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,810
Director Fang,
you have issues with me, too?

346
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,970
Look at you,

347
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,030
you are getting yourself in this state.

348
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,430
How can we not be worried?

349
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,270
How about Yongwei

350
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
and your parents?

351
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,100
How could they not be upset

352
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,880
when they see you like this?

353
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,270
I know.

354
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,750
You can't accept
that Captain Wu died in vain.

355
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,600
Tell me.

356
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,030
What are you going to do?

357
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,130
If we want to catch these drug dealers,

358
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,040
someone needs to go undercover

359
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,670
and infiltrate their organization.

360
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,890
Have you considered

361
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,570
what kind of price

362
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,940
you'll have to pay for doing this?

363
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,780
What about your marriage?

364
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,930
Are you still getting married or not?

365
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,990
How will you explain this to Yongwei?

366
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,120
I'm not marrying.

367
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
You can't just call it off like that.

368
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,260
What about her family?

369
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,080
What will they think?

370
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,750
I don't want to drag her into this.

371
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,460
How about your parents?

372
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,460
If we don't solve this case,

373
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,240
I'm unable to face Wu.

374
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,360
This mission

375
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,610
has to be done by me.

376
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,370
Since you've made up your mind,

377
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,430

from acute myocarditis,

Don't feed me that bullshit

566
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,409
about brotherly love.

567
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,449
As long as Mou Lang is alive,

568
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,969
Mou Haidong will give me more resources.

569
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,850
So the raw materials for this batch

570
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,100
were left to me by him.

571
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,840
Is that all?

572
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,320
Of course,

573
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,630
if our cooperation

574
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,200
becomes more solid,

575
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,880
I'll share more with you.

576
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,090
I love hearing this kind

577
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,330
of talk about sharing.

578
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,160
I don't drink alcohol.

579
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,760
Thank you.

580
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,950
Good things

581
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,330
are meant to be shared.

582
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,770
Is this spot

583
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
suitable for your "disposal" work?

584
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,410
Isn't it a bit crowded here?

585
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,610
It's hidden in plain sight.

586
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,610
It's close to water,

587
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
and there's wind.

588
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,990
Once it blows,

589
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,610
all the smell will be gone.

590
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,190
You want me to make meth here？

591
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,070
You've got to be kidding me
with that idea!

592
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,990
Solutions come from people.

593
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,490
I guarantee there won't be any problems.

594
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,960
Fine.

595
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,280
Then I'll use this place.

596
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,840
This is just a beginning.

597
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,760
The future is limitless.

598
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,360
It will all be yours.

599
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,860
Come on,

600
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,830
I'll show you the raw materials.

601
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,030
This tunnel

602
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,120
was built back in the 1960s.

603
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,210
The storage temperature is ideal.

604
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,620
Nobody knows about it.

605
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,700
It's very safe.

606
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,670
We're here.

607
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,070
It's so cold in here.

608
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,110
All of these are

609
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,680
chemical ingredients for making meth?

610
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,070
This temperature

611
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,390
is optimal for
storing these chemical materials.

612
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,440
That's why when transporting them,

613
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,300
refrigerated trucks are needed.

614
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,450
How many barrels are there?

615
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,540
60 barrels.

616
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,800
So many.

617
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,760
With your abilities,

618
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,450
this should be no problem for you.

619
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,480
This wouldn't have been an issue before.

620
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,290
But now,

621
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,770
I really need to find someone to help.

622
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,450
How much is the rent?

623
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,170
It was purchased back in 1980.

624
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,450
How's the turnover?

625
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,680
Today's turnover is pretty good, sir.

626
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,940
[Qiang Ge Hotpot]

627
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,220
All dishes are served.

628
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,080
Dad.

629
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,080
My uncle has arrived.

630
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,710
Qiang.

631
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,210
Long time no see.

632
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,740
Have some soup.

633
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
This soup

634
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,870
doesn't seem to be made by you.

635
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,400
I don't have time to make soup anymore.

636
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,730
It's from a soup packet.

637
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,680
I knew it.

638
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,600
It doesn't taste like it used to.

639
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Don't tell me

640
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,320
you just came here for soup.

641
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,900
You know me so well, Qiang.

642
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,290
Help me transport some goods.

643
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,590
Is it the same stuff from the Mou family
three years ago?

644
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,480
It's different this time.

645
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,710
They are raw materials

646
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,510
that need refrigerated trucks.

647
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,800
Please don't put me
in a difficult position.

648
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,400
I've been out of that business
for a long time.

649
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,510
Now, shipping goods
requires a delivery order.

650
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,840
It's very complicated.

651
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,880
I'll pay the going rate.

652
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,680
I won't short you a single penny.

653
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,630
You know very well

654
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,530
the police were watching me for so long.

655
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,660
I finally managed to get myself clear.

656
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,030
I'm in a perilous situation now.

657
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,360
Besides, these are chemical materials.

658
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,770
Are you trying to get me killed?

659
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,300
If I get watched again,
I'll be in big trouble.

660
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,480
We're both businessmen.

661
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,360
Would you turn down business

662
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,760
and refuse to make money?

663
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,360
How many?

664
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,220
Six barrels?

665
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,320
Sixty barrels.

666
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,230
Don't forget,

667
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,360
last time you got in trouble,

668
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,160
I pulled a lot of strings for you.

669
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,590
This time, please help me out.

670
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,730
Name your price.

671
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,480
Alright, alright.

672
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,280
Since you've asked,

673
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,420
how can I refuse?

674
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,130
I want 10% of the profit.

675
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,400
5% at most.

676
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,880
This is already the highest market price.

677
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,000
We're on the same side.

678
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,730
You won't be treated unfairly.

679
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,920
As you know, the police have got

680
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,400
all my brothers under surveillance.

681
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,000
I need to recruit new people.

682
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,260
We're hiring people at the last minute?

683
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,620
We have to vet people
before we place our bets.

684
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,080
That's how things are now.

685
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,340
How about this:

686
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,490
I let Qin follow you these days

687
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,960
because he can handle any problems
that come up.

688
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,800
Testing people -

689
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,060
that's his specialty.

690
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,150
That's it.

691
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,580
Cheers.

692
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,320
Any news about Mou Jiahao?

693
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,440
We checked the surveillance cameras
near Hive Community.

694
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,800
We found that Mou Jiahao,

695
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,000
Ma Duozai and Ma Yong

696
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,610
deliberately took a small alley

697
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,990
and then disappeared.

698
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,430
Their phones are all unreachable now.

699
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,390
That won't do.

700
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,970
We're on the back foot.

701
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,400
We need to find a way
to draw him out quickly.

702
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,370
There's someone we can use.

703
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,510
Who is he?
