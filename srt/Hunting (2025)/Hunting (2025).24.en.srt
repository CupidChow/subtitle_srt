193
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,180
I'll notify the demolition team.

194
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,460
The space inside is too narrow.

195
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,660
If we use explosives,

196
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,920
they'll hardly survive.

197
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,380
Then...

198
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,710
Then what should we do?

199
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,450
Let's go up there and talk.

200
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,920
Ventilation shaft.

201
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,130
Turn off the air supply to that room.

202
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,920
We can't blow it up.

203
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,140
It's too dangerous.

204
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,370
This is Yang Yipeng.

205
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,480
Officers inside, please respond
if you can hear me.

206
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,140
Please respond if you hear me.

207
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,670
Copy that, Captain Yang.

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,220
What's going on in there?

209
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,910
The space is very confined here.

210
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,710
And there's no air circulation.

211
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,440
We're getting short of oxygen.

212
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,200
Conserve your energy.

213
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,530
Wait for rescue.

214
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,590
Understood.

215
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,340
Hack their communication channel.

216
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,870
Yes, sir.

217
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,590
Hello.

218
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,040
Uninvited guests.

219
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,530
Who is this?

220
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,300
I'm Andy.

221
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,520
So I'm going to say this only once.

222
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,640
You and all your
ground forces retreat now.

223
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,240
Otherwise,

224
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,170
I can't guarantee the safety of your pals.

225
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,810
Let me be crystal clear about this.

226
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,170
You attacked my base.

227
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,420
And the only things you're going to find

228
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,900
are their dead bodies.

229
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,790
Andy.

230
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,860
We can retreat.

231
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,630
But you must release the officers first.

232
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,030
Release the officers first!

233
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,560
You're not in a position
to negotiate with me.

234
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,040
Captain Yang.

235
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,650
Don't back down.

236
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,610
Don't negotiate with them.

237
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,850
We're not afraid to make sacrifices.

238
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,190
Captain Yang.

239
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,390
We have two options now.

240
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,500
Either we blow it open,

241
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,330
or we retreat.

242
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:10,910
If we retreat,

243
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,240
at least we can ensure
the safety of the fellows inside.

244
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,010
But if we force
our way in with explosives,

245
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,000
there will definitely be casualties.

246
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,800
Captain Yang.

247
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,920
Blow it up.

248
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,060
What are you talking about?

249
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,000
The air inside is thin.

250
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,120
They won't last much longer.

251
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,910
But we don't have any other options now.

252
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,000
We've been following
this lead for so long.

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,750
We can't lose it now.

254
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,670
Is solving the case more important,

255
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,530
or the lives of the people inside?

256
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,880
I promised my Master.

257
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,160
I would take him to complete the mission.

258
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,420
Here's the case.

259
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,480
I'll consult with higher-ups first.

260
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,120
We have another plan.

261
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,740
No need!

262
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,880
Give them the gas.

263
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,630
Understood.

264
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,450
Zhi'an.

265
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,880
How's the situation on your end?

266
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,260
We've received orders from above.

267
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,280
For your safety,

268
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,480
we need to evacuate for now.

269
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,810
We'll evacuate for now.

270
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,590
Captain Yang.

271
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,950
We're prepared to make sacrifices.

272
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,370
Duozai is still inside.

273
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,840
Don't give up.

274
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,050
Zhi'an,

275
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,830
is that you?

276
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,000
Duozai.

277
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,990
Duozai.

278
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,240
Can you hear me?

279
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,910
It's Zhi'an.

280
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,440
Why is that rat still here?

281
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,920
Is he still talking to the policewoman?

282
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,430
We'll go find them.

283
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,240
Split up.

284
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,880
If we can't find them,

285
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,160
we'll all die.

286
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay?

287
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,920
Come on.

288
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:20,970
Come on.

289
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,080
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,640
You fell into a trap because of me.

291
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,700
You've done great.

292
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,740
Take care of yourself.

293
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,130
Wait for Captain Yang to rescue you.

294
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,180
You sound weak.

295
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,860
Duozai, don't worry about me.

296
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,960
Quickly find a place

297
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,990
to hide yourself.

298
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,400
Come out.

299
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,620
Hang in there.

300
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,570
I'll find a way to save you.

301
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,950
The person you need
to help is Captain Yang.

302
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,080
If they can get in,

303
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,420
we still have a chance.

304
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:03,550
Duozai! Duozai!

305
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,410
Can you hear me?

306
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,600
Duozai!

307
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,660
Duozai!

308
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,160
The distance is too far. Signal's weak.

309
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,880
Basement. Basement.

310
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,020
Duozai!

311
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,830
Today you're destined

312
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,690
to die here.

313
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,540
Then we'll die together.

314
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,540
Go! Go! Go!

315
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,540
Hurry! Hurry!

316
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,400
Zhi'an!

317
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,860
Zhi'an!

318
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,760
Find a place to hide.

319
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,380
I'll rescue you soon.

320
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,320
Duozai!

321
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,790
Duozai, don't worry about me.

322
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,640
Quickly find somewhere

323
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,640
to hide yourself.

324
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,450
I've been hiding all along.

325
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,170
I don't want to hide anymore.

326
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,370
I want to be a real assassin.

327
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,680
Zhi'an.

328
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,880
These 20-some years
of my life have meant nothing.

329
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,610
Fortunately, I met you.

330
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,730
You gave me a dream.

331
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,960
We've made countless comebacks together.

332
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,930
We'll win this time too.

333
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,390
Duozai, I'm warning you,

334
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,110
don't do anything stupid.

335
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,750
Duozai, answer me!

336
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,930
Duozai!

337
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,180
Duozai, can you hear me?

338
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,930
What you've done

339
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,490
has made me very

340
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,180
very unhappy.

341
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,910
So now

342
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,050
I'm going to kill that woman.

343
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,190
Leave her alone!

344
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,040
Too late.

345
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,810
You'll never see her alive again.

346
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,880
Bastard!

347
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,500
You'll pay for this.

348
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,080
Andy.

349
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,000
If you dare hurt even one officer inside,

350
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm telling you,

351
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,400
I'll blow this whole place sky high.

352
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,270
Did you hear me?

353
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,790
Are you threatening me?

354
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,010
This is your final warning.

355
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,900
Aren't the Chinese police afraid of death?

356
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,510
We just don't want to see our comrades

357
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,850
die in vain.

358
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,060
I'll say it again.

359
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,070
If you dare touch a single hair on them,

360
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,440
China's narcotics police

361
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,270
will repay you double.

362
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,430
Do you understand?

363
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,610
He's bluffing.

364
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,110
I'm not going to let

365
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,650
anyone threaten me here.

366
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,570
Attention!

367
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,720
I want them dead.

368
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,030
Go take care of them.

369
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,720
Get me that damn walkie-talkie.

370
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,350
Understood.

371
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,390
Go! Go! Go!

372
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,520
He has gasoline.

373
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,030
That way.

374
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,130
Stop him!

375
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,930
Will you guys stop him?

376
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,540
Zhi'an!

377
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,620
Zhi'an!

378
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,550
You need to stay alive.

379
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,430
Duozai.

380
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,940
Duozai!

381
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,570
