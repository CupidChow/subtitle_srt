[Episode 19]

3
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,150
Steady.

4
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,500
On my back.

5
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,390
One, two.

6
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,610
Let's go.

7
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,630
Open the door.

8
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,430
Open the door!

9
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,940
Careful.

10
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,560
Watch his head.

11
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:20,960
Okay.

12
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,490
His head.

13
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,860
Alright.

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't touch me. I'm fine.

15
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,930
Hello, Chief Fang.

16
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,610
Where are his injuries?

17
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,170
Here and here.

18
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,510
A bit serious.

19
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,730
Was your head broken or what?

20
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,860
Why did you turn off your phone?

21
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,880
In denial of what you did, huh?

22
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,080
Watch your attitude.

23
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,350
Yang Yipeng,

24
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,150
you've forgotten

25
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,280
you're a police officer, haven't you?

26
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,870
How dare you act the hero?

27
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,750
You're lucky that nothing huge

28
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,800
happened today.

29
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,880
If you had killed Mou Sen

30
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,680
or he had killed you today,

31
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,400
I would be too embarrassed
to stay in my position as chief.

32
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,430
I just wanted to catch him with my hands.

33
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,430
Who would've known he'd arrive early?

34
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,360
You think I don't know

35
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,590
what you were off to?

36
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,520
Smarty-pants,

37
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,410
you were hoist with your own petard.

38
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,430
Tell me.

39
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,050
Last night, why did you not report

40
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,840
Mou Sen's whereabouts?

41
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,040
How was I supposed to do that?

42
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,140
Would you have let me go
if I had reported?

43
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,200
So you knew it then.

44
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,280
Listen up,

45
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,180
if you had done anything
out of line to Mou Sen,

46
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,770
I would've handcuffed you myself!

47
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,600
Chief Fang,

48
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,460
don't be mad.

49
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,840
He's spent 3 years on this manhunt.

50
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,470
His choice was understandable, right?

51
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,600
So you knew that too?

52
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,779
You're an experienced officer.

53
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,360
From a professional standpoint,

54
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,110
this drug cook hasn't been caught yet

55
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,190
exactly because of your reckless behavior.

56
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,440
Was it the right way to work a case?

57
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,170
That was more like a gang fight.

58
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,960
According to the discipline,

59
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,240
whatever heinous crimes he committed,

60
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,830
he should be put through
the legal process,

61
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,290
and not be punished by you.

62
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,440
For the good of the investigation,

63
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,190
today,

64
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,830
I didn't plan to arrest him at all.

65
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,790
Why not?

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,830
Why didn't you arrest him?

67
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,000
You grumpy dud!

68
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,430
What do you think the reason was?

69
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,430
Use your brain

70
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,600
and think why I let him go!

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,980
I meant to use Mou Sen

72
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,210
to infiltrate the Platinum Road.

73
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,190
This hotbed of crimes on the dark web

74
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,710
is our ultimate target!

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,180
Don't you understand?

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,450
We're now trying to find

77
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,830
all the drug traffickers there
through Mou Sen.

78
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,070
If we caught him now,

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,090
how could we proceed with the plan?

80
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,950
I've said many times

81
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,310
anti-drug campaigns are not
just about arresting individuals.

82
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,190
It's a no-brainer.

83
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,460
Don't you understand?

84
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,080
Always the same speech.

85
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,460
Mou Sen

86
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,920
was just a bait.

87
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,210
I meant for you

88
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,060
to approach him.

89
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,880
But now, it seems

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
we have to come up with

91
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,540
new plans.

92
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,430
Chief Fang, sorry.

93
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,360
I've let you down.

94
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,920
All my hard work in the past 3 years
has gone down the drain.

95
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,430
I apologize to you!

96
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,260
Down the drain?

97
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,280
That's not true!

98
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,430
The point is we can't arrest Mou Sen now.

99
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,850
Do you still not get it?

100
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,240
It's part of a major strategy.

101
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,070
Understood?

102
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,350
I know you're still not convinced.

103
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,610
Try to process it then!

104
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,800
Yang Yipeng,

105
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,970
now that your cover has been blown,

106
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,800
this covert intelligence mission
ends here.

107
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,950
You'll either go home for a rest,

108
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,410
or be reinstated as a member
of the special task force.

109
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,460
Mull it over. Make your choice.

110
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,920
What were you doing?

111
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,230
You should've explained to him,

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,920
right?

113
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,280
What are you trying to say?

114
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,920
I'm saying,
why not take the option to rejoin

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,310
the force?

116
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,370
And be your deputy?

117
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,120
You know that's not what I mean.

118
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,650
Then stop talking about it!

119
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,040
Last time, you left without eating.

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,140
Let's make up for it now.

121
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,830
Thank you.

122
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,490
What's to thank me for?

123
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,360
This is not wine,

124
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,140
but still,
cheers to finally catching Mou Sen.

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,800
Hello?

126
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,650
Okay, I got it.

127
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,159
What's wrong?

128
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,970
Mou Sen wasn't caught.

129
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,270
That couldn't be right.

130
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,120
I arranged a meeting for him.

131
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,250
He promised he'd definitely be there.

132
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,960
He went to your place early.

133
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,520
By the time our people arrived,
he had left.

134
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,310
What about Mr. Zhen?

135
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,360
Mr. Zhen was supposed to be there too.

136
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,290
He knew the plan.

137
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,480
Officer Yang would like to
explain to you in person.

138
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,000
He asked me to take you to him.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,720
What Officer Yang?

140
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,250
I'm talking about Mr. Zhen.

141
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,760
Mr. Zhen is Officer Yang.

143

This is...

144
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,840
He was my father.

145
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,940
This monument is for unnamed heroes.

146
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,790
Those buried here
all sacrificed their lives

147
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,250
in combating drug crimes.

portraits,

151
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,200
or birthdates are presented here,

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,420
we would always remember them
in our hearts.

153
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,800
Captain Wu,

154
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,470
I'm sorry.

00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:26,550
[In loving memory]

156
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,410
I once promised

157
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,160
to never return to the force
until I caught Mou Sen.

158
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,620
But I have to go back on my word.

159
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,840
After being "Mr. Zhen" for nearly 3 years,

160
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,240
I feel like I've almost forgotten

161
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,970
how to be a real police officer.

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,730
It's time I rejoined the force.

163
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,440
But don't worry.

164
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,860
I swear I will catch Mou Sen.

165
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,240
Duozai, wait.

166
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,670
Sorry.

167
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,580
I couldn't keep my promise to you.

168
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,100
Why did you fail to arrest Mou Sen?

169
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,960
The situation changed.

170
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,700
Duozai is leaving Nanzhou.

171
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,610
Where are you going?

172
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,600
I want to take Hao away from here

173
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,400
and start a new life.

174
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,240
How are you going to do that?

175
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,120
Four-Eyes is in Mou Sen's hands now.

176
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,450
How do you take him away?

177
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:49,960
How?

178
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,830
Duozai, think about it.

179
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,910
Actually, we have the same target,

180
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,970
and that's Mou Sen.

were both killed
by drug dealers like Mou Sen.

185
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,520
We can team up.

186
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Do you have a plan?

187
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,790
Mou Sen wants to join the Platinum Road.

00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,870
He can't do that.

191
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,600
Why can't he?

192
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,320
We're not catching drug dealers
for personal vendettas.

193
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,000
Making him approach Mou Sen now

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,160
is getting him in danger.

195
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,550
He'll definitely raise suspicion.

196
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,950
Do you have a better plan?

197
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,840
Do you?

198
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,320
Didn't Zhan Cui meet a tragic end

199
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,720
because you went find her?

200
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,630
She could've fared better.

201
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,030
That was a different matter.

202
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,360
Mou Sen is still at large now

203
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,160
exactly because you went rogue.

204
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,320
I know you're anxious.

205
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,160
So am I.

206
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,200
But we can't send him to a death trap

207
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,320
in order to solve the case, can we?

208
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,790
Duozai makes his own decisions.

209
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,590
I can't force him to do anything.

210
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,080
Got it?

211
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,470
Any decision?

212
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,320
I can't leave this city alone.

213
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,270
But I don't want you to take this risk.

214
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,150
Can you let him think it over?

215
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,960
No!

216
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,970
Duozai, you're coming with me.

217
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,150
Wu Zhi'an, you've forgotten everything

218
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,610
I said to you, haven't you?

219
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,240
Wu Zhi'an!

220
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,270
Hello?

221
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,900
What's Duozai's idea?

222
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,200
I think he might get onboard.

223
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,720
Good.

224
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,680
I've reported to Chief Fang.

225
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,960
If Ma Duozai goes back to Mou Sen
in the current situation,

226
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,620
it'll be hard for him
to gain the latter's trust.

227
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,240
I'll seek alternative options.

228
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,100
What other options do we have now?

229
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,810
Can anyone guarantee
any choice to be 100% safe?

230
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,440
Thank you, Zhi'an.

231
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,450
No one has shown me
this much care for a long time.

232
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,860
What?

233
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,440
I was saying...

234
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,350
You also want to catch Mou Sen soon,
right?

235
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,120
But I can't sacrifice an innocent life

236
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,600
just in order to catch him.

237
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,100
If I did that,
I'd have a guilty conscience forever.

238
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,330
Mou Sen will definitely
be punished one day.

239
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,500
Your father's death wouldn't be in vain.

240
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,150
This is the place.

241
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,120
Right here?

242
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,750
Yes.

243
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,010
When are you leaving?

244
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,120
I have a relative

245
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,270
who owns a factory in Ningcheng.

246
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,640
If you want,

247
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,100
you can start a new life there.

248
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,080
Do you...

249
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,770
really want me to leave?

250
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,910
Mou Sen hasn't been caught yet.

251
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,600
Nanzhou is a dangerous place for you.

252
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
I'm worried they might go after you.

253
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,470
I can stay.

254
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm not afraid of him.

255
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,930
Please don't do anything foolish.

256
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,080
Are you saying it

257
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,090
from a cop's perspective,

258
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,670
or

259
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,180
a friend's?

260
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,790
Either way, it's not worth the risk.

261
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,870
My supervisor has the same opinion.

262
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,120
Well...

263
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,150
Maybe I can figure out a way to trick him

264
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,480
into going there. Then...

265
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,060
Don't.

266
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,360
It's time you got out of this mess.

267
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,960
You know?

268
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,970
I need you to make a vow to me.

269
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,270
You must swear to never ever

270
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,480
act as an informant.

271
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,660
Will you believe me

272
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
if I make that vow?

273
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,240
I will.

274
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,790
Okay.

275
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,680
You have my word then.

276
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,650
Are you going back now?

277
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,320
Yes.

278
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,360
To the old boat's hull.

279
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,560
I'll pack up my stuff.

280
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,800
Keep yourself safe.

281
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,840
Don't worry.

282
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,470
I don't think he dares to go there again.

283
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,690
I'll be fine.

284
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,200
Goodbye then.

285
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,790
Let me know when you make up your mind.

286
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,120
I'll contact that relative for you.

287
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,840
Sure.

288
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,200
[Building 2, Compound A]

289
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,010
Are you mistaken?

290
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,329
How could Duozai possibly betray us?

291
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,200
There must've been a misunderstanding.

292
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,130
Misunderstanding?

293
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,530
What misunderstanding?

294
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,830
Did he ask the police to come?

295
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,970
He used to talk about

296
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,260
calling the police

297
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,550
and turning himself in.

298
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,160
Did he do it?

299
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,420
He was capable of that!

300
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,350
If he did work for the police,

301
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,830
we would've been arrested already!

302
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,200
You have a death wish or what?

303
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,730
Haipeng!

304
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,600
He was deceived by Mr. Zhen.

305
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,470
We really didn't know Mr. Zhen was a cop.

306
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,560
There's no way
Duozai will contact you again.

307
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,820
And you!

308
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
I reminded you many times, didn't I?

309
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,590
What is Duozai like?

310
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,960
A wolf that can't be tamed!

311
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,130
Why did you have to play the good guy

312
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,080
and be blindly compassionate?

313
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,700
You thought you were doing charity work?

314
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,590
Lucky you,

315
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,000
for reaching that place early.

316
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,350
Or you would've been arrested by the cops!

317
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,280
Enough. Stop it!

318
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,230
Isn't Mr. Zhen a police officer?

319
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,470
Why did he hit you so hard?

320
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,080
He was there for revenge.

321
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,590
Mother.

322
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,770
I'm Yipeng.

323
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,480
Yipeng?

324
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,800
You know Yipeng?

325
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,020
Mother!

326
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,350
Here comes my daughter.

327
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,440
Mother.

328
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,240
This young man called me Mother
the moment he came.

329
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,070
Mother,

330
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,070
he is...

331
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,030
I got it.

332
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,600
You should've told me
you were bringing your boyfriend home.

333
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,060
When did you start dating?

334
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,520
Some time ago.

335
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,440
Come on in. Don't just stand there.

336
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,240
Have a seat inside.

337
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,830
Come on.

338
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,200
This young man seems nice.

339
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,530
Let him stay for dinner.

340
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,000
Sure, as you wish.

341
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,280
How long has Mother been like this?

342
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,070
The diagnosis was confirmed
right after you left.

343
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,350
Her condition has deteriorated badly

344
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,080
since your father passed away.

345
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,700
I'm the only one she can recognize now.

346
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,740
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

347
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,200
Would it have made any difference?

348
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,670
Would you have come home?

349
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,300
Actually, I know you came back

350
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,030
on the day of your father's funeral.

351
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,000
Sorry for the mess.
I didn't prepare for your visit.

352
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,060
Come have some tea.

353
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,750
This is my son's favorite black tea.

354
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,550
Sit down.

355
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,030
Thank you, ma'am.

356
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,410
Careful. It's hot.

357
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,850
Slow down.

358
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,510
Good, right?

359
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,930
Very tasty.

360
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,380
This is my son's favorite tea.

361
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,310
Is it?

362
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,590
Where is your son, ma'am?

363
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,680
It's been long since he last came home.

364
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,640
Yipeng

365
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,770
was a naughty child,

366
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,250
who never liked studying.

367
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,550
He enjoyed playing sticks and toy guns.

368
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,550
Later on, he became a policeman.

369
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,110
The strict discipline of the force

370
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,040
disallowed him to often come home.

371
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,370
I know he must've died
in the line of duty.

372
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,810
His sacrifice was for the country,

373
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,920
and for people's wellbeing.

374
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,880
I understand.

375
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,640

00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,830
It's frozen!

561
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,680
[Mr. Zhen]

562
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,960
I know you hate to give up.

563
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,590
So do I.

564
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,240
[Mr. Zhen]

[Delete]

567
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,030
[Messages]

568
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,920
Pink ice.

569
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,600
Ancestral Hall stamps.

570
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,440
It's that guy.

571
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,790
Samples delivered.

572
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,520
Where's Hao?

573
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:21,380
Why are you here?

574
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,159
Are you spying on me?

575
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,040
Mr. Luo told me to come.

576
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,710
In order to save you,

577
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,480
I acted as a mule

578
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,139
twice!

579
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,540
What are you doing?

580
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,310
You're spying on me for them?

581
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,810
So what if I'm spying on you?

582
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,590
Do you know

583
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,190
you nearly ruined our lives?

584
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,870
I did that to save your life!

585
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,469
How was I causing harm to you?

586
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,760
Save my life?

587
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,310
Who do you think you are, a savior?

588
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:03,520
I, Mou Jiahao,
take responsibility for my own doing.

589
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,230
Even if I am to go to prison,

590
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,960
it'll be none of your business!

591
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,890
Do you even know what you are doing?

592
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,970
You're trafficking drugs.

593
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,800
You're harming others.

594
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,280
You're committing a capital offense!

595
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,210
Do you know that?

596
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,820
What do those drug addicts
have to do with me?

597
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,110
I don't care about them at all.

598
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,140
And I don't need your care either.

599
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,700
I can use stamps

600
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,250
whenever I feel like it.

601
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,720
It's none of your business!

602
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:32,920
Fine.

603
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,590
I'll take you for a drug test.

604
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,050
Move it!

605
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,070
If you're tested positive,
I'll call the police!

606
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,550
Duozai!

607
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,410
Are you really sending me to jail?

608
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,330
Don't you forget

609
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,450
you've been a mule more than once.

610
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,810
If I am to be put behind bars,

611
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,330
you'll end up the same!

612
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,140
Okay.

613
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,260
Let's go to prison together.

614
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:04,990
Come with me.

615
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:05,710
Duozai!

616
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,320
Move it!

617
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,480
You're out of your mind!

618
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,360
Act crazy if you want to.

619
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,560
Why drag me into this?

620
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,820
Because you're like a brother to me!

621
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,650
My father already passed away!

622
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:19,730
I...

623
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,620
I can't...

624
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,540
I can't lose you too.

625
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,920
I can't lose you too!

626
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,030
I promise not to cause you any trouble
after I get out.

627
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,390
We'll live a good life.

628
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,030
Don't you want to go to school?

629
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,030
I'll provide for you.

630
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,920
The three of us

631
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,710
will be a happy and harmonious family.

632
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,150
That's right!

633
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,630
Let's drink!

634
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,070
Come on.

635
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:43,440
Cheers.

636
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,110
A family?

637
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,030
I haven't agreed

638
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,850
to let him be your godson.

639
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,630
You two are close like brothers.

640
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,280
Aren't we family now?

641
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,910
We are!

642
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,920
Come on.

643
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,530
And you think I can lose you?

644
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,560
Since we stole that car,

645
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,730
this mess we're in has been getting

646
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,590
bigger and bigger like a rolling snowball.

647
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,280
It's out of our control now.

648
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,030
Hasn't Hao

649
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,840
replied to our texts yet?

650
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,230
I told you this must be a trap.

651
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,280
Thank God
we didn't deliver the samples ourselves.

652
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,190
Poor Duozai.

653
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,230
He became cannon fodder.

654
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:11,760
Haipeng.

655
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,410
Haipeng, come look at this!

656
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,840
Look at what?

657
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,260
Our goods.

658
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,640
Our goods?

659
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,360
They're now for sale online.

660
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,710
That means we've succeeded.

661
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,700
We'll make a lot of money!

662
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,560
Look, our goods have sold out.

663
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,200
[Sorry, products have sold out]

664
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,800
I can't wait to buy a sports car.

665
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,500
I'll sell that old junker of mine.

666
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:41,840
Hello.

667
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,280
Hello.

668
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,030
I'm Andy.

669
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,740
Jiamin, I'll buy you a house.

670
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,230
Jiamin...

671
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,000
Hello.

672
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,440
They've sold out
Does it mean we'll be rich?

673
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,530
Lower your voices.

674
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,220
Excuse me.

675
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,070
Hi,

676
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,960
this is Luo Yuansu.

677
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,240
As far as I know,
your name is not Luo Yuansu.

678
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:12,600
In fact,

679
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,840
you should have the same name
as Mou Haidong.

680
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,770
So I'm guessing your surname is...

681
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,360
Mou.

682
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,150
Yeah.

683
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,990
My name is...

684
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,360
Mou Sen.

685
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,090
Sorted it.

686
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,840
Only Mou Haidong's son

687
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,160
can make pink ice.

688
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,620
I never expected your stamps

689
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,230
to be quite so good.

690
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,670
Thank you.

691
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,870
It's not me praising you.

692
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,440
The market has spoken.

693
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,440
You're welcome to join the Platinum Road.

694
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,640
Hope we can have a happy cooperation.

695
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,290
I have one request.

696
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,560
What's that?

697
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,240
Mou Haidong had an old account

698
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,670
on the Platinum Road,

699
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,400
which is stolen by Xin Sheng He.

700
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,410
I would like to have it back.

701
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,840
That account has been changed.

702
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,900
And it complies with our procedures.

703
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,670
It's not my place to interfere.

704
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,390
In fact,

705
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,630
I should say that it's your fault
for not protecting your account.

706
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,850
It has my old man's money for me.

707
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:17,020
The most valuable thing you have right now

708
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,450
is your skills.

709
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,030
Keep producing good products
for our platform,

710
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,040
and you can be rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

711
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,460
Now, let me get this straight.

712
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,680
It provides

713
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,680
raw materials

714
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:33,990
and sales.

715
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,810
Don't you worry about that.

716
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,190
Suppliers from all over the globe

717
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,880
can join the Platinum Road.

718
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,570
About the operation,

719
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,250
your hacker friend can
learn about it soon.

720
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
He's pretty smart, so it's all good.

721
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,600
I'm curious.

722
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,840
How he get in touch with you?

723
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,960
He attacked our server.

724
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,510
Didn't work,

725
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,170
but it caused us some trouble.

726
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,210
He hacked you?

727
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,750
Very few hackers
can identify our vulnerabilities.

728
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,840
So,

729
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,520
he caught my attention.

730
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,320
I looked through
your application materials,

731
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,450
fast tracked the application process

732
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,400
and told you
to send the products directly.

733
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,710
My apologies.

734
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,850
I didn't know he'd act so radical.

735
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,550
Extreme is a quality

736
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:26,810
Anyway,

737
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,330
now, it's up to you and your partner.

738
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,570
Maybe one day,

739
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,070
we can work even closer together.

740
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,770
Looking forward to it.

741
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,440
You do have a choice.

742
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,040
You can leave Pigpen Boy.

743
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,710
But what can I after I leave him?

744
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,430
Someone offered me a job in Ningcheng.

745
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,790
A job again.

746
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,570
I'm sorry, Duozai.

747
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,250
I don't want to stick with you anymore.

748
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,460
I hate
the idea of being an employee all my life.

749
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,900
But at least you can lead an honest life

750
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,760
with a clear conscience that way.

751
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,440
Do you remember the time when you

752
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,890
saved up money to go abroad?

753
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,450
I remember that.

754
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,360
You're just like how you were back then—

755
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,970
down-to-earth,

756
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,570
and motivated to work hard.

757
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,150
The only difference now

758
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,580
is that your father
is no longer a burden to you.

759
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,950
You should go.

760
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,430
Live for yourself.

761
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,960
It's just that...

762
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,730
It's just...

763
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,140
that we seem to have stepped
on different paths.

764
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,350
I'm grateful to you

765
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:37,980
for not calling the police.

766
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,720
When I...

767
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,300
become rich, I'll go find you, Duozai.

768
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:05,730
[Bingzhou Seafood]

769
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,130
Hello, Mr. Luo.

770
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:09,360
Duozai is leaving Nanzhou.

771
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:10,600
Where to?

772
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,410
Ningzhou, where he'll work in a factory.

773
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,430
I don't want to be a loser my whole life.

774
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,030
So I talked him into leaving.

775
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:22,800
By the way,

776
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,480
why aren't you guys
in the arcade building?

777
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:27,630
The situation is tense.

778
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,090
We went out for a breather.

779
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:29,870
Okay.

780
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,460
I'll come find you.

781
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,550
Hao,

782
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,010
I promised Duozai
not to let you work for me anymore.

783
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:41,660
I...

784
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:43,580
I make my own life decisions.

785
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,160
I've learned a lot from you.

786
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,490
I can be your assistant.

787
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,200
As long as you let me stick around,

788
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,730
I'll be glad to do anything.

789
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,930
Are you sure you'll do anything for me?

790
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,050
Yes.

791
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,280
You should go with Duozai,

792
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,690
and get back to the way you were.

793
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,000
How am I supposed to

794
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,400
get back to the way I were?

795
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,220
I don't want to go back

796
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,590
Neither can I go back now.
