1
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,800
The officer if

2
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,560
It is time

3
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,000
Can I go now?

4
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,080
There is still a few minutes

5
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,800
Let's talk a little

6
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,280
Let's wait for the arrival of my lawyers, well?

7
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,080
As expected from a person coming from Shin J.

8
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,720
You don't want to talk without a lawyer

9
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,800
decent

10
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,320
I will talk just while you are listening

11
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,160
Mr. Tang, that person from your company

12
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,000
Mr. Ping Jiang U

13
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,560
He was killed on our hands while he was in the prime of life

14
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
it is a pity

15
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,880
So I hope after your return

16
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,440
To control your subordinates well

17
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,320
It prevents them from opposing the police

18
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,560
You do not have to tire the officer if he himself is in my education, how do I work

19
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:30,920
Yes

20
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
It is your internal affairs, of course

21
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
But I really wonder

22
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,720
In fact, we received a report

23
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,680
Then we went to check that ship

24
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,800
then

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
We thought it was metamvitamine

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,120
Who knew it was just crystal sugar

27
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,840
Crystal

28
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,520
Crystal sugar smuggling is not a major crime

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,720
What is the reason for resisting the law violently

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,880
And that it ends up killed in his place

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,560
Did he not know that he was crystal sugar?

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,720
Understand

33
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,560
Look for yourself

34
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,320
I know you do not believe me

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,520
The time is over

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
Can I leave now?

37
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,160
Of course you can leave when the time comes

38
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:22,960
Help yourself

39
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,400
All the evidence currently available

40
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,800
Not enough to prove the involvement of Tang Du

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,320
He is seasoned

42
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,079
Certainly there is no evidence

43
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,440
He did not come at all to trade

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,079
He is an experienced expert

45
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,320
Did he not lose control in the end?

46
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,080
Tell me

47
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,560
Do you think Shin Shang is it?

48
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,560
They will start fighting with each other now

49
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
certainly

50
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,240
Drug dealers only care about money

51
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,080
Now that they cannot earn money, they will definitely fight

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,040
You are very smart

53
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
Did you examine that goods?

54
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,680
Yes, I examined it

55
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,600
Yes

56
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,800
Perhaps the police deceived us

57
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,520
Welcome

58
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,720
You cannot pass from here

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,600
Good

60
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,800
Legs

61
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,280
My legs hurt me a lot

62
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,920
Help me get up quickly

63
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,000
Please help me

64
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,800
quickly

65
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,200
Almost, wait for a moment

66
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,280
Thank you, thanks

67
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,760
Thanks

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,600
my dad

69
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,080
my dad

70
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,800
my dad

71
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,200
Why did you lied to me?

72
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,400
Why didn't you wait for me?

73
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Why never listen to my words?

74
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
It has not reached the end yet

75
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,400
It is forbidden to die

76
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,240
Did you hear me?

77
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,880
Even at this moment you are still thinking about money

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,680
Good

79
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,400
Your mother said that she left her for you

80
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,720
I will give you this when you grow up

81
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,440
You are now grew and I can give you it

82
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,400
Do you understand?

83
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,400
It is very precious

84
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Do not lose it

85
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,600
Come, I will help you wear it

86
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,679
thus

87
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,840
Let's see if the length is appropriate

88
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,919
It looks more handsome now

89
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,440
Good

90
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,400
Good

91
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,200
Good

92
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,200
I will go to play

93
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, go and play

94
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,960
Do not lose it

95
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,240
It is very precious

96
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,160
Come, do not draw

97
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,600
If you break your leg, I will not care about you

98
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Children are easy to deceive

99
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,400
my dad

100
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,640
my dad

101
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,040
my dad

102
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,320
my dad

103
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,400
You cannot die

104
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,720
I wake up

105
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,720
my dad

106
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,720
I wake up

107
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,480
my dad

108
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,720
I do not allow you to die, get up

109
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,160
my dad

110
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,440
my dad

111
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,560
You cannot die

112
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,240
Get up

113
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:51,960
You

114
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:52,840
You

115
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,000
Get up

116
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,560
It is not permissible to die

117
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,280
Get up, Dad

118
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,640
my dad

119
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,080
It is not permissible to die

120
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,480
Police

121
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,080
Physician

122
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,000
Are you not d

123
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,520
Physician

124
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,440
Two zones

125
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,720
Two zones

126
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,560
I wake up

127
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,320
doctor

128
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,240
Two zones

129
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,560
Doo Zi, look at me

130
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,200
doctor

131
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,560
quickly

132
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,800
Come here

133
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,080
What is with you? Do you have something to do?

134
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,800
nothing

135
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,640
Isn't just to receive?

136
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,080
Greetings to that rich young man?

137
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,480
In addition

138
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
You were in a relationship before

139
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,080
Be quiet

140
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,400
When were you in a relationship with Lee John?

141
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,720
I just greeted him

142
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,480
I did not ask him to participate in anything

143
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,960
In addition, I made it

144
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,440
This issue solves

145
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
It is completely clean

146
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,560
The police will inevitably arrive at the Li family

147
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,680
Will you betray you John?

148
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't know

149
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,520
I thought you had convinced him

150
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,680
What do you mean by 'convincing him'?

151
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,440
If you don't convince him

152
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,320
It is really a problem

153
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,880
So you blame me now, right?

154
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,120
I do not blame you

155
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
I am just worried about you

156
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,000
You are worried about yourself

157
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,440
We are now in one boat

158
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,040
Whatever happens to any of us

159
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,200
This boat will drown

160
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,400
There is no difference between you and you

161
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,800
So tell me

162
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,160
What should I do?

163
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
You have to be with that rich young man

164
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,000
Think about it

165
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,400
It is a rare opportunity

166
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,680
He is the second son of the yacht club

167
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,080
You will become rich with him

168
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,400
Are you my real brother?

169
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,080
Of course I am your real brother

170
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,600
Be quiet

171
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,120
In fact, it is not a bad idea

172
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,040
What do you think?

173
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,920
Are you really a man?

174
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,520
My little sister

175
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,320
What do you do?

176
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,560
If you make you uncomfortable

177
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,880
I am wrong

178
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,840
I apologize for you

179
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,960
But how will you behave

180
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,040
This is your choice

181
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,320
despicable

182
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,200
You are all

183
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,720
My little sister

184
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,920
You are not a human being

185
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,400
Aren't you the one who made her get close to Lee John?

186
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,320
I said it was possible

187
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
You cannot

188
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,240
I ask you

189
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,160
What did you do on the boat?

190
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,960
That friend insisted on going

191
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Whoever knows that he would cause all these problems

192
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,880
Which friend is this?

193
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,120
Just a bad friend

194
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,240
Now I don't know where he went

195
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
I am sorry

196
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,000
I have involved you with me

197
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,560
Did the police come to search for you?

198
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,960
certainly

199
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,560
The police went to my father

200
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,640
He didn't tell them about you, right?

201
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,240
How can

202
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,720
It is my father

203
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,120
He just told me

204
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,200
Not to interfere in the affairs of the company anymore

205
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,080
I am really sorry

206
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,520
I did not expect this to happen

207
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,600
All this is wrong

208
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,240
It is good that I was there

209
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,760
Otherwise, you are in trouble

210
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,079
certainly

211
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,319
truly?

212
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,040
naturally

213
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,480
Enemy

214
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,800
Don't do this again

215
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,480
Good?

216
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,080
the name

217
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,080
Mado tsay

218
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,400
How are you healthy now?

219
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,600
I'm fine

220
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,440
What is your relationship with what Young

221
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,320
my dad

222
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,800
Your father is adoptive, right

223
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,400
Yes

224
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,760
Regarding what I did earlier

225
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
Is there something you want to admit now

226
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,080
I stole the Shin Chawan Young

227
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,400
Jin was killed, Wan by mistake

228
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,720
I burned the methamfitamine that was in the car

229
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,240
I did all of this on my own

230
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,400
Very straightforward, right

231
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,200
I did everything myself

232
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,040
There is nothing worth hiding

233
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,000
So why were you hiding all the time?

234
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,240
Did you do all of this alone?

235
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,040
Yes

236
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,000
Are you sure?

237
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
I did it on my own

238
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,080
But it was

239
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,800
Another person

240
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,840
from

241
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,160
Chan Hao

242
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,160
Mo Jia Hao, right

243
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,120
It was present

244
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,840
But all of these things have nothing to do with them

245
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,800
I did it

246
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,640
do you know

247
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,920
Where is Mo Jiahao now?

248
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,400
Why

249
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,720
Are you in a hurry to die?

250
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,280
Two zones

251
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,880
Doo Zi was arrested by the police

252
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,920
The police arrested him

253
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,200
Faster and search for a place to hide

254
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,760
Tell my sister too

255
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,040
Why do you stand like this?

256
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,640
Come quickly

257
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,280
Hello, the phone you call closed

258
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:43,920
So tell me

259
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
Why did the Shin Chawan Young stole

260
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,160
Because he did not want me the amount of the insurance he owes to me

261
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,120
I acted out of anger

262
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,440
Out of anger

263
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,840
There were two hundred kilograms in that car

264
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,840
But when I was driving the car

265
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,000
I did not know that there is drugs inside

266
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,240
So why did you destroy it then

267
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,680
Because leaving those things will harm people

268
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,640
Right

269
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,480
You have a strong sense of justice

270
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
Why did not the police not report directly?

271
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,880
I was afraid that I could not clarify the matter

272
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,960
What cannot be clarified

273
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,160
You do not trust the police, right

274
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
Jin, if he dies

275
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,120
I killed him by mistake after all

276
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,800
Is it a mistake or not

277
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,040
Your words are not accustomed to it

278
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,160
We need that

279
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,120
We investigate and collect evidence before we reach a conclusion

280
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,560
do you understand

281
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,080
risk! Do not prepare to the pharmacy

282
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,480
You and your father adopted

283
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,200
How is your relationship

284
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,720
Is it very good?

285
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,600
or

286
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,680
Not good

287
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,800
Ordinary mother

288
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,200
I said

289
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,160
I did all these things on my own

290
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
And no one else is related to it

291
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,560
Yes

292
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,200
So what Young has nothing to do with this matter

293
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,040
But it is involved in other things

294
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,000
I want to ask you, do you know how he died

295
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,760
I don't know

296
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,160
Do you know who was transporting goods

297
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,600
The pharmacist if

298
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,160
What is his real name

299
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,640
I don't know his real name

300
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,400
Do you know it

301
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,560
Yes

302
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,000
Where is it now

303
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,480
I don't know

304
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,560
I just said that you know it

305
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,040
What is Doo Zi, I ask you

306
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,120
Who is this pharmacist if?

307
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,880
Oh what Du Tsai

308
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,880
I ask you

309
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,080
Who is exactly?

310
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,400
Get up, Dad

311
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,080
my dad

312
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:11,920
my dad

313
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,920
Two messages

314
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,560
Doo Tsey woke up

315
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,400
Physician

316
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,240
Two messages

317
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,480
Two messages

318
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,960
Drug dealers have not blessed them since their birth

319
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,800
From the moment they came to this world

320
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,080
A stigma has been placed on them

321
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,520
They cannot get rid of them throughout their lives

322
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,320
This is our destiny

323
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,200
We cannot blame anyone

324
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,800
We cannot rely on anyone

325
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,120
I don't talk to you

326
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,040
Answer me

327
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,480
What a doo, I ask you who is

328
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,480
I told you that I do not know

329
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,240
Good

330
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,880
We do not play words games here

331
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,360
Look at this picture

332
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,560
Is this a person?

333
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,040
Is he the person in drawing?

334
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,520
It is a little similar

335
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,440
Well, this is enough now

336
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,520
We will take it later to improve this image

337
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,240
Good

338
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,320
Abouth ma doo Tsai

339
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,280
It is almost identical to the information owned by the police

340
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,400
It seems that he did not lie

341
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,640
It is true that he did not lie

342
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,160
But it certainly hides something

343
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,120
Yes

344
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,040
Death, which will prove that

345
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,200
He takes responsibility for Moo Jia Hao intentionally

346
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,160
I don't know if it is really loyal or foolish

347
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,400
Doo Tsai thought that he was killed by mistake

348
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,600
That is why he escaped

349
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Are you sure he is

350
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,320
That killer that I got to know in the game

351
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,080
Yes

352
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,520
What do you think of it as a person

353
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,600
I think it is very honest

354
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,400
This can also be seen from interrogation

355
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,320
The drug voluntarily destroyed

356
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,960
This proves

357
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,760
It cannot be complicit with drug dealers

358
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,560
What proves this

359
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,480
Perhaps the drug was destroyed

360
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,800
Just to evade responsibility

361
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,000
We are a police

362
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,880
We need evidence

363
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,160
Zian

364
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,920
Have you found Mo Jia Hao?

365
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,480
It is not in the Internet cafe

366
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,680
Most likely escaped

367
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,800
Check the surveillance cameras around the Internet cafe again

368
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,560
Good

369
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,120
Mr. Luo

370
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,360
How we will deal with what Du Tsey

371
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,200
We don't have more evidence now

372
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,840
They sent him to the detention center first

373
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,080
By the way, how the investigation of the temple festival goes

374
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,160
Wait for a moment

375
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,400
The real cause of the death of One Chan

376
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,480
It is drug use

377
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,120
Then the stroke resulting from intense physical activity

378
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,520
The Shin Chawan Young took a debt dispute

379
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,800
The Doo Tsai problem should not be big, right

380
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,280
If you were the judge

381
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,520
Will he be released in the court directly?

382
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
If it should be detained, it will be detained

383
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,160
The company that provided yacht for the festival

384
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,320
It is an institution called Li Marine Shipping Company

385
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,560
Legal representative Lee Fu Min

386
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
It has been working in the field of maritime transport for a long time

387
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,640
He expressed his severe shock

388
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,600
Regarding hiding drugs on the ship

389
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,120
On that day there was a quick boat

390
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,560
The suspect took it

391
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
All the information left by the suspect was fake

392
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,920
He told me Fu Maine

393
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,280
Their internal mismanagement has

394
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,240
It was allowed to exploit the gaps

395
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,160
He promised to enhance future security measures

396
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,400
What about surveillance cameras?

397
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,200
Nothing was found

398
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
This maritime club

399
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,960
Recently was founded by Li Ligan Shipping Company

400
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,800
This company does not have any criminal record

401
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,600
But I doubt

402
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,560
A person inside the company has been bribed

403
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,920
To cooperate with Lu Yuan Soo in this matter

404
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,400
Well, I understood

405
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,280
Continue

406
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,760
Anne, I want to tell you

407
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,120
Pay attention to your words and behavior

408
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,880
Go and get busy with your work

409
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,840
Understood

410
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,240
Are you a professional killer?

411
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,280
no

412
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,280
Who is there?

413
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,000
Why did you come here?

414
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,080
I feel upset

415
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,200
Is there a way to vent myself?

416
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,640
What do you think of dancing in the club?

417
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,800
Dancing at the club

418
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,320
Is this dance in the club?

419
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,720
Is there a difference?

420
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,040
The difference is very big

421
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,880
What is the most freedom!

422
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,560
Didn't you sleep yet?

423
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,560
Tell you

424
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,920
here

425
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
I am the leader

426
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,640
Do you admit it?

427
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,520
Do you admit?

428
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,520
Do you admit?

429
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,520
I will see if you will recognize or not

430
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,360
Leave it and sit squatting

431
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,320
Sit the squatting

432
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,280
Leave it

433
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,400
Sit correctly

434
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,200
Go down and sit squatting

435
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,840
Sit the squatting

436
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,920
Sit the squatting

437
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,280
You pity it

438
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,120
I know that the policeman should always remain rational

439
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,240
But I must admit

440
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,320
When I see it in this case now

441
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,280
I feel his pain without being able to control my feelings

442
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,480
When we caught it

443
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,960
His father was lying out there

444
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,680
He has just died

445
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,960
I remembered in my mind when my father died

446
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,400
Suddenly I understood his feelings

447
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
That feeling of severe impotence

448
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,600
Doo Tsai is a poor child

449
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,280
He has experienced more experiences than others

450
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,320
His life is never easy

451
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,480
I am a friend

452
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,720
I don't want him to feel that I am deceiving him

453
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,480
You did not deceive him

454
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,600
You help him

455
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,400
If he continues to escape like this

456
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,520
He will commit more extremist acts

457
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,680
That view that he looked at the time

458
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,880
I feel that I will not forget her throughout my life

459
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,160
You love him

460
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,560
We are just friends

461
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,280
Say the truth

462
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,080
We are really just friends

463
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,080
You can worry about it

464
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,960
And you can pity it

465
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,440
But that's all

466
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,120
You cannot invest more feelings

467
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,280
This is not good for you

468
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,720
Lakeen Dusai s Tajkhrat Mukhdarate

469
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,600
He destroyed all of these drugs

470
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,800
It is different from those people

471
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,480
How different

472
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,880
He could inform the police

473
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,000
And police report

474
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,920
Why destroy all the drugs

475
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,400
Uncle Yang

476
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
I think your expectations are very high

477
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,640
My expectations are not high

478
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,960
Rather, he does not trust us as a police

479
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,000
He knows very well in his heart

480
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,520
It is the police like black and white

481
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,560
It will always remain from two different worlds

482
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,600
Isn't it possible to attract it?

483
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,880
To our world

484
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,400
This is not our decision

485
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,160
No one can decide such things

486
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,640
And as I said before

487
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,240
Do not invest more feelings

488
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,480
Do not put great hopes on him

489
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,520
Stay your relationship with him

490
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,200
In the virtual world only

491
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,880
Remember this

492
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,560
Perhaps we will not come back and I as we were before

493
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,640
We have deceived that chef

494
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,000
We cannot let this pass like this

495
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,000
Let me take over, my grandfather

496
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Serious

497
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,320
This time, Mo Lang did not hand him over to him

498
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,280
This can be considered a right thing I did

499
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:03,800
By the way

500
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,400
Where is Mo Lang?

501
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,640
Mo Lang

502
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,920
You have died

503
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,680
When did that happen?

504
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
We threw his body at sea before the deal

505
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,400
What is your madness this time?

506
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,080
I have been crucial to him a little unintentionally

507
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,600
Unintentionally

508
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,200
Do you think I became dementia?

509
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,600
Do not get angry

510
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,720
That fool was not to help us anyway

511
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,440
What did you discover from it?

512
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:36,920
Try to guess

513
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,280
If you did not discover anything important

514
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,520
When you were letting you die

515
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,040
If I tell you

516
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,480
Will you forgive me?

517
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,160
Do not manipulate me

518
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,400
Mu Hi Dong Turk for Mo Lang

519
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,840
An account on the dark network

520
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,960
It contains an inheritance

521
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,160
How much is it?

522
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,760
Twenty thousand virtual currencies

523
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,320
With a market value of three hundred million

524
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,920
Where is the account?

525
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,840
with me

526
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,520
The account management will take from now on

527
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,680
Well, Mr. Du

528
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,840
Serious

529
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,560
I made a lot of effort

530
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,640
To get this

531
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,080
Do I deserve a reward?

532
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,280
Your grandfather raised you

533
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,320
Hope you are better

534
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,920
Shen Shang will be urgently or for you

535
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,480
But not now

536
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,880
Your accomplishments and errors are equal

537
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
No bonus this time

538
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,760
Good

539
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:42,960
Sayyid Two

540
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,120
Is it recently?

541
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,840
Do you use drugs again?

542
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,320
I will investigate the matter

543
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,320
Or two zeas

544
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,200
With regard to the issue of drugs

545
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,960
His position was always firm

546
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,600
It is unlikely to participate in the drug trade

547
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560
But I always feel that it hides something

548
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,120
The young man appreciates relationships and friendships a lot

549
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,280
It is possible that the chemist was affected by the drug factory

550
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,760
How will we deal with it?

551
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,440
Based on the evidence that we currently have

552
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,760
Let's hold him for a while

553
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
Do you insult the yacht?

554
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,520
Yes

555
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,720
But his previous record

556
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,800
It was very clean

557
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
This time when we found them

558
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,040
They said the reason is internal mismanagement

559
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,040
They will reform in the future

560
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,200
But Lynchung doubts that they are

561
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,680
People from the inside have brushed

562
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,160
Do you have a suspect?

563
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,600
not yet

564
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,480
Try to verify the matter

565
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,880
I will do

566
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,040
What will you do?

567
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,240
You are a private customer

568
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,600
It does not suit me intervention

569
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,840
I tell you something

570
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,600
Director Fang transferred your responsibility to me

571
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,760
So who oversees who?

572
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,040
naturally

573
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,080
I am the leader on behalf

574
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,480
What do you think?

575
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,719
This is childish

576
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,159
Look at the curvature of this stick

577
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,400
It should be a large fish

578
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What do you marvel?

579
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,800
It is a childish matter

580
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,679
Here it comes

581
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,280
The thread is tangled

582
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,800
This is really frustrated

583
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,280
You are skilled, well

584
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,639
It is very deep

585
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,719
Be careful

586
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,400
faster

587
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,600
Brother Chen

588
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,840
A problem occurred two days ago

589
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,040
The police attended

590
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,719
And the manager is very angry

591
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,159
I heard that he expelled his son from work

592
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,400
The matter is related to his son

593
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,480
I don't know about it

594
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,240
Watch well

595
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,320
What is his son's name?

596
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,600
Lee John

597
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,640
He always attends his friends to play on the ship

598
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,720
And no one dares to prevent him

599
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:05,840
Good

600
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,400
Be careful

601
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:06,960
My brother

602
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,280
Thank you

603
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,080
Thank you very much, brother Chen

604
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,280
water

605
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,400
Be careful of all

606
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,560
Hong Qun came

607
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,120
LentNafs

608
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,560
I heard that you are a good fighter

609
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,960
To try, well

610
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,320
good

611
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,560
You are also not bad

612
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,160
He is a good fighter

613
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,840
Brother Qun

614
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,320
This is the account

615
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:41,960
Good

616
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,720
Thanks

617
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,560
Let's go

618
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,160
This too

619
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
He no longer talks to me

620
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,400
I hope his anger will calm down

621
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,000
Please, brother Qun

622
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,680
Hi Sayed Du

623
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,800
We have already heard about the issue of this shipment

624
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,680
I didn't really expect this to happen

625
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,440
Once I received the goods, the police raided me

626
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,640
I have no trick

627
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,320
I surrender to my reader

628
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,000
Mr. Duly is truly a seasoned man

629
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,920
He adheres to the rules

630
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,720
As a person younger than you, I have all the respect

631
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,560
In this world the rules must be respected

632
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,200
The spirit of the contract must be preserved

633
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,480
The rules cannot be breached

634
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,240
Sayyid du, then

635
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,640
Could he

636
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,200
Return Mo Lang to now

637
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,920
Who is supposed

638
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,560
To send a person

639
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,280
To deliver it to you safely

640
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,160
But you know

641
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,480
That the police have just raided me

642
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,480
I am afraid that at the present time

643
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,040
It should not be displayed

644
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,680
Understand

645
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,000
Understand

646
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,440
So what Mr. de Hu means

647
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,280
This time I invited you to meet with Shane J.

648
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,280
I did not expect the problem to occur this time

649
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,760
But we can continue the conversation

650
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,160
I am very confident of our cooperation

651
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,480
Mr. Du

652
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,840
We go to your place

653
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,560
Not appropriate, right?

654
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,640
Last time I followed your plan

655
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,640
I went personally with my men to Nan Chu

656
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,640
I was invited by the police to interrogate

657
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,640
This is the same response to the same

658
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,960
You came to Shin J.

659
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,640
To take your brother yourself

660
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,080
I think this is the safest

661
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:39,840
Concept

662
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,440
The words of Mr. De Sahih

663
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,840
Let me confirm the trip schedule

664
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,120
And I will respond to you later

665
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,840
I will wait for your response

666
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:54,880
Mr. Du

667
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,880
Miss I really handed the account

668
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
Virtual currencies

669
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,120
In the account it is now converted

670
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,280
You will arrive within two days

671
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,880
What is also in the account?

672
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,320
Log in to the merchants registered on the platinum road

673
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,000
short

674
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,560
It is a drug license on the dark network

675
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,440
I didn't expect

676
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,880
Mo Hai Dong also joined the platinum road

677
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,080
permission

678
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,720
I remember that Jin Shan

679
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,120
I talked to me about this platform before

680
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,800
Did she join her too?

681
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,800
I am not completely sure

682
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,960
Also, Mr. Du

683
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,320
Miss has a gift for you

684
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,440
This old man

685
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,280
What does he mean?

686
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,800
We cannot really deal with it, right

687
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,160
He has international buyers from above

688
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,840
He is holding Mo Lang politely now

689
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,000
He asks the goods

690
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,240
This issue never ends

691
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,080
We will not go to Shin G and we do not go back, right

692
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,600
For Mu Lang

693
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,800
We must go even if it is a risk

694
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,920
You are afraid

695
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,040
I am afraid

696
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,040
Who am I

697
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,000
I wish I could kill him now

698
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,960
O old man, you cannot deal with it

699
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,240
I know that

700
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,480
Is it not beautiful?

701
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,680
I love her a lot

702
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,120
Yes

703
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,440
This old man

704
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,120
Things he loves old -style

705
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,320
Do not listen when we tell him

706
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,960
I heard it's very fun

707
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,000
Try one

708
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,480
you are mine

709
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,680
Mr. Daqam

710
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,840
Be careful

711
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,120
Watch the stairs Monday

712
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,080
Mr. Du

713
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,640
Sit

714
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,000
Thanks

715
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,840
O young man

716
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,160
Your future is promising

717
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,200
This is an exaggerated compliment, Mr. Du

718
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,720
Eat some candy

719
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:07,920
Mr. Du

720
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,600
Why don't I see Mu Lang?

721
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,400
Do not hurry

722
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,000
There are some things that I want to make sure of you with a face

723
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,120
Please, Mr. Du

724
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,960
Why did you lied to me?

725
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,720
The words of Mr. Du

726
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,400
I did not understand it well

727
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,520
Do you really have all these goods?

728
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,120
I heard that

729
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,120
What the police found was just crystal sugar

730
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,320
This is impossible

731
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,600
Moreover, Miss Tang examined her by herself

732
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,720
Mr. Du

733
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,280
According to the rules of Shen Shang, hee

734
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,280
If you dare to serve a fake goods

735
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,000
When I was

736
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,640
I can sit here originally

737
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,160
Is it not possible to be

738
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,680
The police are trying to arouse the dispute between us

739
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,880
So they said this?

740
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,120
So where did this goods come from, according to your saying?

741
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,120
In fact, these goods

742
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,400
She made it three years ago

743
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,320
The police think that these goods have been destroyed

744
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,880
But in fact, one of the followers

745
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,720
He was able to save most of the goods

746
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,680
And the remainder of the shortage

747
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,800
I made it myself to replace it

748
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,800
Lying

749
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,040
Consequences

750
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,560
Mr. Du

751
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,720
If you dare lying

752
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,960
I think I and my brother

753
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,960
We will never be able to return

754
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,400
So do not go

755
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,120
I heard from Liu Li Bo

756
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,200
That the new goods that you made

757
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,680
Very high purity

758
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,520
It has not been seen before

759
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,000
Although I did not see her myself

760
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,400
but

761
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,200
I am very admired

762
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,800
With your abilities

763
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,880
If you want to stay

764
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,200
I will never bother you

765
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,520
We can continue to cooperate

766
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,200
honestly

767
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,040
We can discuss cooperation carefully

768
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,440
But my coming this time

769
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,840
It has only one goal

770
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,440
It is my brother to return

771
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,280
No problem

772
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,640
Those previous goods

773
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,120
Whether it is real or fake

774
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,080
