had been manufacturing drugs.

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,330
and in exchange, I get to ask you some.

171
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,790
There must be things you want to know.

173
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,770
Fine.

00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,400
Time's up.

563
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,230
Sen.

564
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,230
I have good news for you.

565
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,960
An incident happened at the music store.

566
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,760
The news has spread
throughout the entire circle.

567
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,440
Xin Sheng He's drug supplies

568
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,389
will run out in the next few days.

569
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,690
Our opportunity has come.

570
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,920
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

571
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,790
We'll soon dominate the entire Nanzhou.

572
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,510
This is just a beginning.

573
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,590
Once we set up our Platinum Road account,

574
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,560
we can sell directly online.

575
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,280
Sen, I like you more and more now.

576
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,520
With your intelligence

577
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,030
and my execution skills,

578
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,430
we'll have endless money to spend.

579
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,890
Where's Hao?

580
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,910
Young kids, you know,

581
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,430
he went clubbing with my sister.

582
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,340
Drink up.

583
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,150
Come on.

584
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,880
Come on.

585
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,960
I want some too.

586
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,980

Hello, Mr. Fu.

593

Whiskey, please.

594
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,550
Sexy Kitty.

595
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,290
Mr. Fu.

596
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,580
Who's this older guy?

597
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,030
My buddy, Mr. Zhen.

598
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,820
Azhen.

599
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,990
Your buddy is
much better looking than you.

600
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,380
Are you kidding me?

601
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,890
Did you bring the stuff?

602
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,360
Mr. Fu, have a drink.

603
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,110
Hello, Mr. Fu.

604
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,510
Drink all you want tonight.

605
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,770
It's on him.

606
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,630
Drink whatever you want.

607
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,360
It's on me.

608
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhen.

609
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Don't mention it.

610
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,000
Thanks.

611
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,510
This

612
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,910
is the premium stuff
in the club these days.

613
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,260
It's more expensive than before,

614
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,950
but the high

615
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,610
is like nothing else.

616
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,500
Who's selling it?

617
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,140
It's just a phone number.

618
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,600
I've never met the seller.

619
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,570
Give me the number.

620
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,020
I'll send it to you.

621
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,620
Good.

622
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,390
Sent it.

623
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,860
Thanks, Mr. Fu.

624
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,220
What are you looking at?

625
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,130
The beautiful ladies.

626
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,440
You stay here

627
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,500
and watch me dance.

628
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,590
Go ahead.

629
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:12,960
Four-Eyes Hao.

630
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,150
Why am I dancing alone?

631
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,010
Four-Eyes Hao,

632
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,060
get down.

633
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,440
Who are you?

634
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,760
Can't you see I'm dancing?

635
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,890
Don't try to stop me.

636
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Are you sober now?

637
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,080
Duozai!

638
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,630
I miss you so much.

639
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,610
Why are you so late?

640
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,460
Why did you...

641
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,020
Why are you hitting me?

642
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,420
Are you sober now?

643
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,820
Let's have fun together.

644
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,630
Let's go.

645
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,200
Someone's fighting!

646
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,280
Get him!

647
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,580
Please leave.

648
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,980
This is my friend.

649
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,240
I want to take him away.

650
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,140
I'm not his friend.

651
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,760
Take him away.

652
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,440
Do you understand?

653
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,400
Did you hear that?

654
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,800
-Take him away.
-Get out!

655
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,720
Duozai!

656
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,260
Go! Go!

657
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,440
Let go!

658
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,460
Get your hands off me!

659
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,400
I'm a paying customer here.

660
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,970
You bastard, let go!

661
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,600
Let go!

662
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,370
You bastard!

663
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,060
Are you here
to trash my place?

664
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,550
Fight!

665
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,050
Fight!

666
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,080
Fight!

667
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,680
I've got these two covered.

668
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,690
Kill him!

669
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,240
Fight!

670
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,470
Fight!

671
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,730
Come on!

672
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,480
Good hit!

673
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,960
Grab him!

674
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,190
He's getting away! He's escaping!

675
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,920
Boss!

676
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,240
Get him!

677
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,560
Why are you helping me up?

678
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,350
Hit him!

679
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,430
Don't let him escape!

680
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,400
Duozai.

681
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,440
Four-Eyes Hao is such a disappointment.

682
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,280
Four-Eyes Hao?

683
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,440
I'm talking about you.

684
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,230
He's talking about me.

685
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,440
I'll help him get clean.

686
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,490
Rehab?

687
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,290
Come with me. I'll help you.

688
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,800
No thanks.

689
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,590
I have my own way.

690
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,120
Let's go.

691
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,400
Where are we going?

692
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,860
You don't trust me, do you?

693
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,360
Where are you going?

694
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,220
I don't like owing people favors.

695
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,060
But today I owe you one.

696
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,300
When will you pay me back?

697
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
After I take care of him.

698
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,190
Let's go.

699
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,050
Deal with what?

700
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,700
You know him?

701
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,290
Just an acquaintance.

702
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,250
That's pretty loyal of you.

703
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,660
You stood up for him like that.

704
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,550
How can I survive out here
without loyalty?

705
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,880
Do you know Fu Lao?

706
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,220
Yes.

707
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,160
I know a lot of people.

708
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,880
We've met before.

709
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,360
I know.

710
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,960
You were Li Jun's woman.

711
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,500
I heard he died.

712
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,340
Overdosed on drugs.

713
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,930
Who are you with now?

714
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,170
No one.

715
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,690
Got any stuff?

716
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,590
What stuff?

717
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,720
You know what I mean.

718
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,590
The new stuff from this spot.

719
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,510
Listen to me,

720
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,790
you should stay away

721
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,230
from that stuff.

722
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,440
Let's have a drink sometime.

723
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,190
Get him!

724
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,360
Don't go!

725
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,660
How did you get hurt so badly?

726
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,360
Got into a fight.

727
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,550
Isn't this just

728
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,950
par for the course for me?

729
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,320
Is everything okay?

730
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,560
I ran into Duozai today.

731
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,840
Where?

732
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,720
Near the music store.

733
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,970
He went there again?

734
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,400
I feel like he knew

735
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,130
something was going to happen
at the music store.

736
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,230
They seem to have known before us

737
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,690
that the music store
was selling LSD stamps.

738
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,970
And then they deliberately led us there.

739
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,470
Who are they?

740
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,620
Duozai.

741
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:24,890
And Luo Yuansu.

742
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,540
How do you know?

743
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,010
How did you track down the music store?

744
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,200
We found it at Li Jun's place.

745
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,010
A record called 'White Night.'

746
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,330
Li Jun's place?

747
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,030
A record?

748
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,450
But in theory,

749
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,710
the Baiye Music Store

750
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,000
has already been taken down by us.

751
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,360
So why are there even more

752
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,960
LSD stamps on the market now?
