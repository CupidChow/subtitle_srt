[Episode 9]

3
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,680
Duozai, why are you so late?

4
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,009
Where have you been?

5
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,360
Nothing.

6
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,030
You...

7
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,630
He just collapsed on the ground, you know?

8
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,870
I was terrified.

9
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,280
I'll go check on him.

10
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,190
It's okay. I just...

11
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,520
I just stopped his bleeding.

12
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Why are you getting in my way?

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,180
Move aside.

14
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,840
When did you get out?

15
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,680
Been out for a while.

16
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
This pigpen boy,

17
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,320
he's quite lucky.
He finally pulled through.

18
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,650
Just now at the boat,

19
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,810
I ran into your dad.

20
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,000
What a coincidence.

21
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,520
He was scared out of his wits.

22
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,360
So I came over to help him.

23
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,130
Thank goodness I ran into him!

24
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,810
What's that smell?

25
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,220
Do you smell anything?

26
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,520
Just now...

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,360
Could it be from the bandages
we just changed?

28
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,960
Yes, we changed the bandages.

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,470
It's alcohol and that sort of thing...

30
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,670
To stop his bleeding.

31
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,360
Right.

32
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,450
How do you feel?

33
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,590
Let me explain to you.

34
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,560
Where did it come from?

35
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,000
That's...

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,750
Mr. Zhen.

37
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,180
From that burned car,

38
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,360
he salvaged a few packages.

39
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,200
I only took two cans, you know.

40
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
Because of this stuff,

41
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,030
we got into so much trouble.

42
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,630
Don't you know that?

43
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,680
If I hadn't brought it, he would've...

44
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,010
Are you tired of living?

45
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,030
Canned Braised Pork.

46
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,110
They were produced

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,620
on June 14, 2006.

48
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,310
[June 14, 2006]

49
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,240
How did you know?

50
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,190
Because they are mine.

51
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,400
So it was you

52
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
who stole my goods.

53
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,030
Didn't you say everything had been ruined?

54
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,070
So you were the one who attacked me
at the old shipyard.

55
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,540
I just wanted to get my goods back.

56
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,390
Just now,

57
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,120
I saved you.

58
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,070
Right?

59
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,159
Not only did I save you,

60
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,650
I also rescued

61
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,360
two cans of goods.

62
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,600
Those two cans were rescued by me,

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,390
right?

64
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,310
Two cans.

65
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,040
You just took back two cans.

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,090
So you were the one
running the drug lab by the sea?

67
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,270
So,

68
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,010
are you gonna report me?

69
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,480
You secretly made drugs.

70
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,360
And you had us transport the stuff.

71
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,930
You deliberately dragged us into this,
didn't you?

72
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,780
I used to have a glimmer of hope.

73
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,120
I once hoped you were a good person.

74
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,670
A good person?

75
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,430
What is a good person  anyway?

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Are you morally good people?

77
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,550
You stole other people's stuff,

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
and destroyed it.

79
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,340
You call yourselves good people?

80
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,120
Do you know how important

81
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,820
this shipment is to me?

82
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,000
Those goods are
worth hundreds of millions.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,460
Even if you saved my life
ten thousand times,

84
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,910
I'd still be doomed.

85
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,270
Do you...

86
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,320
Do you know what I went through as a kid?

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
My mother was locked up like a beast!

88
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,000
My father

89
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,240
wouldn't even let me
set foot in the ancestral hall.

90
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,950
I know you had a terrible childhood.

91
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,270
But you don't need to

92
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,390
pin all your hopes on drugs.

93
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,590
Spare me the lecture.

94
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,380
Now my father is in detention.

95
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,370
My brother is in my enemy's hands.

96
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,120
Only this shipment can save me.

97
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,470
If it were you,

98
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,390
and this shipment were the only thing

99
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,250
that could save both their lives,

100
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
what would you do?

101
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,960
Could you still be a good person?

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,600
I didn't know
about your brother's situation,

103
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,660
but there's still a solution
to everything.

104
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,230
There is no solution.

105
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,210
Only this shipment can save me.

106
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,360
When I saved you two before,

107
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,020
I didn't want anything in return.

108
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,830
And I believe you'd do the same for me.

109
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,560
I just want my goods back.

110
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,070
If you return the goods to me,

111
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,840
I can give you a lot of money.

112
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,070
I only have two cans left. Take them ...

113
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,130
Are you kidding me?

114
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,730
This is drug trafficking.

115
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,770
One can is enough for a 20-year sentence.

116
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,060
Do you want to live
inside prison or outside?

117
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,750
This is returning property
to its rightful owner.

118
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,350
These were originally mine.

119
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,750
Fine.

120
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,870
We'll return your property.

121
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,120
We have nothing to do with these things.

122
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,630
We don't want a penny.

123
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,510
Seriously,

124
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,720
there are only two cans left.

125
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,120
Here you go.

126
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,240
Take them.

127
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,630
Let's go.

128
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,360
Go!

129
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,750
Master Du! Master Du!

130
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,270
Master Du!

131
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:55,790
Enough!

132
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,120
Master Du!

133
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
Where are the goods you promised me?

134
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,080
I...

135
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,740
I...

136
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,090
The goods...

137
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,120
We...

138
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,100
We did our best.

139
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,640
Well...

140
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,390
The ingredients have arrived.

141
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,270
The cook arrived too.

142
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,480
Everything was in progress.

143
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,140
But then...

144
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,230
The police...

145
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,420
The police confiscated everything!

146
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
Whose fault is that?

147
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,330
Master Du...

148
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,200
I...

149
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,260
I really did my best.

150
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,010
Stop telling me you did your best.

151
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,660
I've given you many chances already.

152
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,030
Du...

153
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,850
Master Du...

154
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,500
I know...

155
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,030
I know it's my fault.

156
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,800
I still have people in Nanzhou.

157
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,100
I really do have people there.

158
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,490
And the cook is still there too.

159
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,930
We can continue

160
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,320
as soon as we find him.

161
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:50,960
Besides,

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,780
Mou Haidong's deadline
hasn't even passed yet.

163
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,790
Please give me more time,
Master Du.

164
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,320
I'm begging you, Master Du.

165
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,160
In this business, we follow rules.

166
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,750
You're out of time.

167
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,390
But I still have...

168
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,250
I still have...

169
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,610
I...

170
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,220
I still have Mou Lang!

171
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,240
Mou Lang, the one I brought here.

172
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,000
He's Mou Haidong's biological son!

173
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,320
Before he was sent to prison,

174
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,150
he left his son a huge fortune.

175
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,880
Master Du...

176
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,780
You failed to get any information

177
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,440
out of him before, didn't you?

178
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,460
I'm certain

179
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,100
Mou Haidong really left something for him.

180
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,440
You're that certain?

181
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,690
Mou Lang's...

182
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,670
Mou Lang's half-brother

183
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,150
(same father, different mother),

184
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,780
Mou Sen,

185
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,320
who is also the cook, told me so.

186
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,530
He also wants Mou Haidong's inheritance.

187
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,000
Please believe me.

188
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,870
I really couldn't

189
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,690
get that kid to talk.

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,270
Otherwise,
I would have told you everything.

191
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,030
You can't even handle a kid,

192
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,920
you useless piece of trash.

193
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,530
If only...

194
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,450
If you can

195
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,090
get him to talk,

196
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,180
Mou Haidong's fortune
worth hundreds of millions

197
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,050
will all be yours, sir.

198
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,070
Grandpa...

199
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,590
Leave that kid to me.

200
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,370
Do you have a way?

201
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,070
If he has the goods,

202
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,930
I can get it out of him.

203
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,270
Watch them closely.

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,100
If Mou Lang has goods,

205
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,450
you can survive.

206
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,890
Thank you, thank you.

207
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,600
Also,

208
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
I'm quite interested in that cook.

209
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,130
You need to keep in touch with him.

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,910
If he can come to Xinji,

211
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,500
that would be perfect.

212
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,030
I got it.

213
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:52,750
Get in!

214
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
Here are your phones.

215
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Contact the cook.

216
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,800
Thank you.

217
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,080
Come on.

218
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,000
Drink.

219
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,390
Drink.

220
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,720
Have a seat.

221
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Come, take a seat.

222
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,000
Join us!

223
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,390
Let's take a photo. Come on!

224
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,450
Let's take a photo.

225
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,720
Come on. Let's continue.

226
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,790
Come on.

227
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,680
Feeling sick from drinking?

228
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,510
Want some more?

229
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,400
Don't be afraid.

230
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,240
Now that you're at Xin Sheng He,

231
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,790
no one dares to bully you.

232
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,440
They're all my good friends.

233
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,870
Please let me go.

234
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,520
I could let you go,

235
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,050
but it depends on

236
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,740
what you can give to me.

237
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,920
What else do I have left?

238
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,360
Call your dad's lawyer,

239
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,630
Huang Deming.

240
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,320
Uncle Huang is a lawyer.

241
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,520
He won't do anything beyond his duties.

242
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,160
I have been sent abroad
to study since I was little.

243
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,510
The crackdown three years ago
was very sudden.

244
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,960
Dad didn't even have time
to prepare anything

245
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,290
before he was arrested.

246
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,320
What could he have left for me?

247
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,420
Really?

248
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,620
He has an illegitimate son helping him.

249
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,010
Your dad cares so much
about his reputation.

250
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,720
How could he let an illegitimate son

251
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,980
inherit his property?

252
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,500
My dad never allowed me
to get involved with these things.

253
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,040
He never thought about letting me
take over the family business.

254
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,190
He said, "Son,

255
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,630
I don't expect you to be that successful.

256
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,640
I just want you to be happy

257
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,660
and live a healthy life."

258
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,570
He said he just wanted me
to live happily and healthily.

259
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,000
Please don't make things hard for me.

260
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,260
I've lost everything.

261
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,410
Are you satisfied now?

262
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,080
Don't be like this.

263
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,290
I understand.

264
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,030
For people from families like ours,

265
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,180
health,

266
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,360
happiness,

267
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,400
including freedom,

268
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,360
all seem like luxuries.

269
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,650
Relatives in the clan were either
arrested or fled.

270
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,060
No one cares about me.

271
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,820
Yes, I'm from the Mou family.

272
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,740
I was born into the Mou family,

273
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,950
but no one cares how I live.

274
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,960
I finally made it back

275
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,000
just to see my dad one last time.

276
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,080
Dad is all I have left.

277
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,600
What did I do wrong?

278
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,120
I understand.

279
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,670
What exactly did I do wrong?

280
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,550
Okay, I understand.

281
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,870
I know. I understand.

282
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,320
My parents

283
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,450
were also victims of gang infighting.

284
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,530
I'm just like you.

285
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,470
If my grandpa hadn't protected me,

286
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,930
I would probably
have been the next to die.

287
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,310
People like us

288
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,850
have no control over our lives.

289
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,650
Sometimes, our lives

290
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,800
are worse than ordinary people's.

291
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,650
Please let me go.

292
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,680
I'll talk to my grandpa.

293
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,440
Our happy life

294
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
is just ahead.

295
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,510
Captain,

296
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,550
stop searching.

297
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,800
There are really only two cans.

298
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,720
You don't even believe your dad?

299
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,690
Move aside.

300
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,320
You've proved that
you aren't trustworthy
during all these years!

301
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,650
Do you deserve my trust?

302
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,880
Stop searching, Duozai.

303
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,510
If he had any,
he would have taken off long ago

304
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,110
and wouldn't come back to us.

305
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,300
Let him search.

306
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,600
He's always like this,

307
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,850
very stubborn.

308
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,850
Just let him search if he wants.

309
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,060
When I saw him today, it was right there.

310
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,280
Yes, right in there.

311
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,420
Isn't there anything?

312
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,270
If you don't listen to me,

313
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,270
hardship awaits.

314
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,230
Get down.

315
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,690
What are you doing?

316
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,770
I'll give you one last chance.

317
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,829
I swear to heaven,

318
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,310
if I, Ma Yong, have hidden
even one more can,

319
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,490
may I die a terrible death.

320
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,670
Satisfied now?

321
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,000
Seriously.

322
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Who's going to die a terrible death?

323
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,480
Me.

324
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,310
Be more specific!

325
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,460
I'll get hit by a car and die.

326
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,000
That's not harsh enough.

327
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,190
My son will die with me.

328
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,270
Don't drag me into this.

329
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,870
If you want to die, die alone.

330
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,740
It's good you admit you're my son.

331
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,440
Uncle.

332
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,400
If only you really had that many cans.

333
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
Those are money.

334
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,240
Aren't we on the run now?

335
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,030
It's when we need money the most.

336
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,070
Why are you kicking me?

337
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,070
Isn't that right?

338
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,010
Look at the three of us now,

339
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,310
how poor we've become.

340
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,090
What else can we do?

341
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,040
This time,

342
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,270
we've offended both the underworld
and the authorities.

343
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,790
We definitely can't stay in
Nanzhou anymore.

344
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,670
At this moment,

345
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,530
it's up to me to take action.

346
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,560
You mean you have a solution?

347
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,730
No.

348
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,590
But I have connections.

349
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Tomorrow at dawn,

350
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
I'm going to work my contacts.

351
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,210
I'll get you two out of here.

352
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,030
Will you?

353
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,680
Really?

354
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,530
Just listen to him brag.

355
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,590
Captain,

356
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,270
you should trust me,

357
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,650
an experienced sailor.

358
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,310
There seems to be someone over there.

359
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,240
Quick, help him!

360
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,160
Hold on tight!

361
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:19,990
Boss!

362
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,920
Boss!

363
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,400
Are you okay?

364
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,350
You didn't answer my calls.

365
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,550
How did you end up like this?

366
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,640
Get closer, now!

367
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,640
Be careful.

368
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,210
Be careful!

369
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,370
Haipeng.

370
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,620
How's everything on your end?

371
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,500
Me, Liu Libo and Mou Lang

372
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,160
were taken to Xin Ji by Mr. Tang.

373
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,220
We're okay for now.

374
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,470
How are you all doing?

375
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,610
Li Haipeng.

376
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,200
Where is the cook?

377
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,370
Did someone from your side
leak information?

378
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,370
I was about to ask you the same thing.

379
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,620
It must be someone on your side
who caused the problem.

380
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,500
Is the cook still alive?

381
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,010
I don't know.

382
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,990
Let me tell you something.

383
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,680
Your sister and I are being held
by Mr. Tang at Xin Ji.

384
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,810
If you want to save your sister,

385
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,560
you need to bring that bastard
for an exchange.

386
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,250
Why are you looking for him?

387
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,070
Listen to me carefully.

388
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,840
If you want your sister to live,

389
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,760
you must bring the cook for the exchange.

390
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,070
Do you understand?

391
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,840
If the cook doesn't come,

392
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,970
everyone will die.

393
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:34,960
Got it?

394
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,320
Don't worry, I'll find him.

395
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,990
[Call from Yang Min]

396
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,190
Hey.

397
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,480
Just a moment.

398
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,450
Go ahead.

399
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,990
Are you sure Qiang has been caught?

400
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,840
I want a clear answer.

401
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,550
If Qiang has been caught,

402
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,480
we won't be able to stay here
if something goes wrong.

403
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Go check again.

404
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,900
I'll wait for your update.

405
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,790
I need to throw trash.

406
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:34,970
Go ahead.

407
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,870
Done.

408
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,430
That wasn't easy.

409
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,450
[Corner Store]

410
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:47,920
Hello?

411
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,660
Dad.

412
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,450
I told you not to call this number.

413
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,080
I thought you were arrested.

414
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,920
Yang Min said you were with Zhen.

415
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,730
I want to leave.

416
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,440
I don't want to stay here.

417
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,460
Don't run off.

418
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,270
The police are looking for me.

419
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,350
You're safe there.

420
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,620
What should I do?

421
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,530
I'll make some connections
and get you out in a few days.

422
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,070
Got it.

423
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,570
Here's the money, sir.

424
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,820
Hello?

425
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,830
Forensic Technology Division
has locked the location.

426
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,350
Liu Bingqiang should be there.

427
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,270
Stand by for action.

428
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,030
Copy that.

429
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,590
Let's go. Time to work.

430
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:46,960
Chen.

431
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,550
Get the cars and weapons ready.

432
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,170
Got it.

433
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,380
Would you want a popsicle?

434
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:58,960
What?

435
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,700
I'll reward you with half a popsicle.

436
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,050
Why?

437
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,290
Because you just threw away the trash.

438
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,780
That's weird.

439
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,450
Qiang.

440
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,830
The route is all set.

441
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,180
I'll pick up Wen later.

442
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,590
Let's not have any problems this time.

443
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,780
Don't worry, Qiang.

444
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,570
Where have we ended up?

445
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,130
Captain Luo.

446
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,440
Just got a notice from the police station.

447
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,960
This is an abandoned building.

448
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,920
No residents living nearby.

449
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,040
That's perfect.

450
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,280
The location is right here.

451
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,360
Then Liu Bingqiang should be up there.

452
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,590
The situation upstairs is unclear.

453
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,430
Everyone, be careful later.

454
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,680
We can shoot when necessary.

455
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,000
Let's split into teams.

456
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,420
Luo, which team am I leading?

457
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,310
Master, you stay here with Ms. Lin.

458
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,450
I'll be in a group by myself.

459
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,550
Why should I stay here?

460
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,750
I'm worried about Ms. Lin's safety.

461
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,750
Why are you worrying about me?

462
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,860
My experience is no less than yours.

463
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,680
Lin Qiong! Lin Qiong!

464
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,160
It's really for your own good.

465
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,370
Then go watch the intersection

466
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,060
and wait for backup.

467
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,280
Liang, come upstairs with me.

468
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,930
Zixian, you two flank from that side.

469
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,680
Got it.

470
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,520
Go and check outside.

471
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,140
Don't move.

472
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,350
-Don't move.
-Drop the gun!

473
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,830
Freeze!

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,440
Don't move!

475
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,030
Don't move!

476
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,150
Liu Bingqiang!

477
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,440
Come here.

478
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,160
Liu Bingqiang!

479
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,820
Don't move!

480
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,640
I'm shooting!

481
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,750
Liu Bingqiang.

482
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,960
Hands up!

483
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,360
Handcuff him.

484
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,510
Hands up!

485
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,830
Turn around.

486
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,250
Don't move.

487
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,120
Are you okay?

488
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,430
What's going on? What happened?

489
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
Nothing, Master.

490
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,180
Why are you two drinking by yourselves?

491
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,560
Join us!

492
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,550
The four beauties!

493
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,720
Come on, let's drink to the four beauties!

494
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,250
Xi Shi, Diao Chan,
Wang Zhaojun, Yang Yuhuan!

495
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,210
Come on, drink up!

496
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,480
Are you short on supplies lately?

497
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,250
Need good stuff.

498
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,650
Need quality goods?

499
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,940
I've got some good stuff here.

500
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,150
Really?

501
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,500
How about this,

502
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,770
you help me sell goods,

503
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,970
and I'll give you a 30% cut of the profit.

504
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,200
Let me ask around.

505
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,270
What's there to ask?

506
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,350
You must help me.

507
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,750
You have to help me,
whether you ask or not!

508
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,010
Okay, no problem.

509
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,160
Deal?

510
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Come on!

511
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,310
It's all in this drink.

512
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,960
It's settled then.

513
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,200
Let's drink!

514
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,350
-Come on.
-Cheers.

515
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,550
Be happy!

516
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,960
Please ask for me, will you?

517
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,020
I'll be right back.

518
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,290
Take good care of them.

519
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,400
Boss, drink up and enjoy!

520
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,700
What are you doing?

521
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,160
Why is it you?

522
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,180
You want to kill me too?

523
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,880
That's just how things are.

524
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,270
If you don't go to Xin Ji to find Mr. Tang,

525
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:27,930
Liu Libo,

526
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,670
my sister,

527
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,310
and your brother,

528
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,610
they'll all be dead.

529
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,690
Even if I go,

530
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,730
can they really come back?

531
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,930
It'll just be two more corpses.

532
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:43,960
Sen,

533
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,840
how can you say something so heartless?

534
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,720
Don't forget,

535
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,750
you're the one who dragged us into this.

536
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,170
Let me tell you,

537
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,970
if anything happens to my sister,

538
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,610
you'll be the first one I take down.

539
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,670
Mr. Tang wants me,

540
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,850
not your sister.

541
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,640
You're the cook,

542
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,150
so go cook!

543
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,200
Yes, I can cook.

544
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,590
But do you have ingredients?

545
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,190
Do you have any ingredients?

546
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,610
I certainly don't.

547
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,330
Noodles are enough.

548
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,280
Don't need to bring me canned food.

549
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,520
They are from the 200 kilos of goods
I made before.

550
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,790
The Braised Pork.

551
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,070
Where did you find them?

552
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,010
They were picked up by Uncle Ma.

553
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,280
It's not enough.

554
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,240
He said there were only two cans.

555
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,800
Are there really only two cans?

556
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,000
Even a mule wouldn't be able to resist

557
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,390
upon seeing meth.

558
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,480
This old bastard

559
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,840
never tells the truth.

560
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,030
He's always lying.

561
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,210
After I finish eating,

562
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,200
I'll get the goods back from him.

563
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,590
Why are you two sitting so far apart?

564
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,680
Come and sit closer.

565
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,440
There's plenty of room here.

566
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,950
Come on, move over here.

567
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,590
You almost sat on my lap.

568
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,680
You could sit on my lap if you want.

569
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,200
Come on.

570
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,440
Let's drink up.

571
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,160
No sipping allowed.

572
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,550
Finish it all.

573
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,510
Come on, boss.

574
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,790
I'll sing you a song.

575
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,960
Happiness is all that matters.

576
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,780
This song...

577
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,880
Sir, you should have told us earlier
you were bringing friends.

578
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,480
Let's have a drink together.

579
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,080
Go.

580
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,260
We're out for some fun.

581
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,360
Is your injury better?

582
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,510
Is it healed?

583
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,750
That hostess sold me out!

584
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,120
How much do you have left?

585
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,150
About 50 kilos,

586
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,650
more or less.

587
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,630
Is that all you have?

588
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,810
Who are you trying to fool?

589
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,410
It's true.

590
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,270
Tell the truth.

591
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,050
Just about 50 kilos.

592
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,070
Is it more or less?

593
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,200
I didn't weigh them,

594
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,060
so it can't be that precise.

595
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,240
Be more precise.

596
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,550
I swear.

597
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,400
It's 50 kilos.

598
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,460
It was hard enough getting that much.

599
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,050
That girl just now wasn't

600
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,030
as heavy as 50 kilos.

601
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,290
I'm telling the truth.

602
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,390
Give me the goods.

603
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,660
I'll compensate you.

604
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,520
How much compensation?

605
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,870
How much do you want?

606
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,160
2 million.

607
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,720
I'm not quite catching
what you're saying.

608
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,250
How much?

609
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,790
2 million.

610
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,770
Let me tell you something.

611
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
These goods were ours to begin with.

612
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,110
We're taking them back now.

613
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm offering to pay you.

614
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,330
You should be grateful.

615
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,070
It wasn't easy for us

616
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,370
to get those goods.

617
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
I risked my life.

618
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
I even went to jail.

619
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,310
And...

620
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,270
I've suffered a lot.

621
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,070
Finders keepers.

622
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,070
Say that again!

623
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,600
Haipeng.

624
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,430
Uncle Ma.

625
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,540
After what happened at the beach,

626
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,670
the police have tightened security.

627
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,430
How do you plan to move these goods?

628
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,140
This shipment in your hands

629
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,590
is a ticking time bomb.

630
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,780
Both gangs and police will be after you.

631
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,680
So, I'm the only one

632
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,600
who can take this off your hands.

633
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,020
How much?

634
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,610
1 million.

635
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,240
I have no choice.

636
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,410
I have two kids.

637
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,120
I need to send them abroad.

638
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,940
1 million is

639
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,790
for three people's future.

640
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,930
1 million might not even be enough.

641
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,750
You're a good father.

642
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,790
What about me?

643
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,070
Okay.

644
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,310
He said okay.

645
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,150
Hello, Chief Fang.

646
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,350
Yes, Liu Bingqiang
is undergoing rescue procedures.

647
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,030
Kui,

648
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,110
I know you're eager to solve the case.

649
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,570
Could you be more careful?

650
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,440
If something happened to you too,

651
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,230
the consequences would be serious.

652
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,800
Have you thought about that?

653
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,480
Yes, yes.

654
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,840
I used a bit too much force.

655
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,969
Well, Chief Fang,

656
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,960
I'll take responsibility.

657
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,110
If we lose Liu Bingqiang as a lead,

658
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,909
I'll take full responsibility.

659
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,360
About Liu Bingqiang,

660
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,730
report to me immediately
if anything changes.

661
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,150
Okay, understood.

662
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,590
Master.

663
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,800
What's happening?

664
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,280
Nothing serious.

665
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,190
Doctor.

666
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,360
The patient's condition has stabilized.

667
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,110
He is no longer in critical danger.

668
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,350
Okay, thank you.

669
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,030
Captain Luo said

670
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,760
Liu Bingqiang's condition is stable.

671
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,190
Wen has been taken away too.

672
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,280
I've completed my mission,

673
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,280
and can leave now.

674
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,150
You must be really happy

675
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,550
to be leaving this place.

676
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,550
Am I?

677
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,020
Look at that grin on your face.

678
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,230
You can tell that, huh?

679
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,190
Of course.

680
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,440
If there's nothing else,
I'll be on my way.

681
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,220
Wait.

682
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,710
Don't you like fried hairtail?

683
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,280
I fried some for you.

684
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,360
No, thanks. Keep it for yourself.

685
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,180
I'm off...

686
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,100
Thank you, Uncle Yang.

687
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,480
You changed the way how you address me?

688
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,510
You called me dad these past few days,

689
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,760
now it's back to Uncle Yang.

690
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,580
We have completed our mission,

691
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,070
so I should call you "Uncle" again.

692
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,590
Fine,

693
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,050
"Uncle Yang" sounds good.

694
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,400
Remember,

695
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,960
be sure to be careful.

696
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,800
I'm off.

697
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,400
Go on then.

698
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,070
-I really must be off now.
-Go ahead.

699
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,400
Too talkative. Just go.

700
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,550
Bye.

701
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,100
All the goods are here.

702
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,400
The market isn't good.

703
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,360
I'll sell them off cheap.

704
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
They're all here.

705
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,870
[June 14, 2006]

706
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,670
Any problems?

707
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,270
No problem.

708
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,540
You old guy!

709
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,810
All you care about is money.

710
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,840
Spend it wisely.

711
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,050
I will.

712
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,330
How much money is in this card?

713
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,070
I'll give you the remaining 500,000

714
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,840
in a few days.

715
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,370
You're Mou Haidong's son.
I trust you.

716
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,700
No problem.

717
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,220
You'll need a boat

718
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,360
to leave Nanzhou, right?

719
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,270
How did you know?

720
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,120
Leave it to me.

721
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,790
Thanks for your help.

722
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,760
Just call me if you have any news.

723
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,280
I'll treat you to karaoke sometime.

724
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,810
I'm really good at singing.

725
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,550
Good my ass!

726
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,440
Life is vast like the sea. Just be happy.

727
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,370
The young girls are crazy about me.

728
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,820
Don't mess around.

729
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,980
Be careful.

730
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,910
I'm home, Mom.

731
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,520
You're home!

732
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,160
Look what delicious food I brought you.

733
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,540
Fried hairtail!

734
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,480
My colleague made it.

735
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,880
Try some. It tastes wonderful.

736
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,230
Where have you been these past few days?

737
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,710
You didn't even call.

738
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,840
It's my job.

739
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,030
It's confidential stuff.

740
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,590
Alright,

741
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,710
confidential, I understand.

742
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,080
I know your rules.

743
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,850
There's fried hairtail?

744
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,800
Looks like you've been
treating yourself well.

745
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,480
Come on, sit here.

746
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,320
Let's dig in.

747
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,720
I'm fine, I'm fine.

748
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,480
Look at those dark circles.

749
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,070
You haven't been
sleeping well lately, have you?

750
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,190
I'm fine.

751
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,520
Come on, have your meal.

752
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,700
I'm sorry, Mom.

753
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,180
I made you worry.

754
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,360
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your mom.

755
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,360
You worked so hard on your missions.

756
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,800
There's one more dish in the kitchen.

757
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,710
Don't wait for me, just start.

758
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,440
No need, Mom.

759
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,960
-Don't worry. It’s almost done.
-I just came back to change clothes.

760
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,710
I need to leave again.

761
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,880
You don't need to cook anymore.

762
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,260
It'll be ready soon.

763
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,240
I didn't disappoint you this time, did I,

764
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,840
Dad?

765
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,510
This shipment is only 50 kilos.

766
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,170
How can we make this deal work?

767
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,910
We'd better do business with Master Du.

768
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,630
With just this small amount,

769
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,290
can we get your brother
and my sister back?

770
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,770
Will that old man agree?

771
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,290
If he doesn't agree, we'll make him agree.

772
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,150
Fine.

773
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,960
Where do you get all this confidence from?

774
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,060
The 500,000 for Mule,

775
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,600
I borrowed it from loan sharks.

776
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,290
When the deal is done,
I'll pay you back twenty times.

777
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,320
How much?

778
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,800
Twenty times.

779
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,710
That's 10 million!

780
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,110
They got the goods ready so quickly?

781
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,610
Are you kidding me?

782
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,290
He wants to talk to you.

783
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,440
Thank you.

784
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,540
Master Du.

785
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,320
So you're the cook?

786
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,280
Yes.

787
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,400
How can I believe

788
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,460
that you prepared 200 kilos of goods
so quickly?

789
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,490
It's normal for you
to have doubts, Master Du.

790
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,640
Let me put it this way.

791
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,660
I'll have my brother

792
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,560
deliver 20 kilos to another location.

793
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,220
After you verify them,

794
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,240
I'll personally bring the rest.

795
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,360
Then we can talk.

796
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,190
However,

797
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,920
I beg you to release that lady first.

798
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,190
Does she mean something to you?

799
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,960
Yes.

800
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,820
She's my woman.

801
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,370
Alright.

802
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,390
But those 20 kilos goods,

803
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,670
how will your brother bring them in?

804
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,130
By the water route.

805
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Do you have a boat?

806
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,230
My boat probably can't enter Xin Ji.

807
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,210
I might need to trouble you, Master Du,

808
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,510
to meet us at sea.

809
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,360
Fine.

810
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,600
I'll wait for your message.

811
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,540
Thank you for saving my sister first.

812
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,220
Xiaomin means nothing

813
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,440
to them.

814
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,710
But as for Mou Lang...

815
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,790
they won't let him go easily.

816
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,590
Don't worry.

817
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,800
I'll handle the boat situation.

818
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,330
I have friends who can help.

819
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,760
You just said

820
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,630
you needed someone to transport the goods.

821
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,110
Were you thinking of me?
