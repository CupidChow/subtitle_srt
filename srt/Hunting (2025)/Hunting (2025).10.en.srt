00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,060
you need someone to transport goods.

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,870
Do you want me to go?

6
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,090
Of course not you.

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,940
I have someone in mind.

8
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,340
Grandpa.

How's it going?

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,169
Has Mou Lang talked yet?

11
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,740
Not yet.

12
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,480
But I have a good relationship with him.

13
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,960
If that cook gets the goods,

14
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,940
he'll definitely use them

15
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,480
to trade for his brother.

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,750
No problem, Grandpa.

19
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,190
But you need to know your limits

20
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,310
in everything you do.

21

Just look at me and you'll understand.

That's what it means to have great powers.

120

I've made up my mind.

159
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,030
We'll go to Southeast Asia first,

163
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,270
OK?

164

Don't worry. I'm a good driver.

166

You made him your godson,

181
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,900
but I never agreed to that.

182
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,240
You two can drink together.

183

What are you saying, my god brother?

184
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,510
That's ridiculous.

Don't joke around. Come on.

186
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,440
Exactly.

187

Eat this to grab some more money.

188

He calls you godbrother now.

189
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,430
Aren't we family?

190
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,570
I knew your father left something for you.

191
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,370
Aren't we friends?

192
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,400
Friends shouldn't keep secrets

193
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,370

You promised to let us go.

571
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,970
Why did you tie them up?

572
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,650
Because you wanted to turn yourself in.

573
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,560
That would ruin my business.

574
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,390
You weren't planning to help us escape.

575
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,210
You just wanted to get rid of us.

576
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,270
You wanted us to disappear, right?

577
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,330
I'm not as terrible as you think.

578
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,000
But if you don't go with them,

579
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,370
their lives can't be guaranteed.

580
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,990
You want me to be a drug mule.

581
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,010
Your father was a mule his entire life.

582
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,330
Why not follow his footsteps?

583
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,850
No way.

584
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,720
You don't have to go.

585
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,080
You can go back to that girl.

587

I always deliver.

762
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:25,480
Good.

763
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,840
There's one more thing.

764
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,580
I need Liu to help me transport the goods.

765
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:30,430
Liu Libo?

766
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,370
He has influence in Nanzhou.

767
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,250
He knows people

768
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,880
in both legal and illegal circles.

769
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,970
With so many goods,

770
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,450
I can't move it on my own.

771
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,330
You're giving him an opportunity.

772
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,680
Liu Libo has done so much for my family.

773
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,620
We should show our appreciation somehow.

774
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,310
I've already planned the route.

775
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:51,950
It's absolutely safe.

776
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,860
Alright.

777
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,640
We'll do as you say.
