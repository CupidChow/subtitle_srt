Of course.

00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,289
It's white tea.

Kui,

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
when handling tea in the future,

17
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,560
be mindful of your reputation.

18
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,800
What reputation?

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,880
It's grown by my own relatives.

20
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,690
Don't be so nervous.

21
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,130
Chief Fang,

22
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,070
well,

23
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,540
I wanted to talk about

24
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,030
the case of Mou Haidong.

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,240
You see,

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,430
for his son's sake,

27
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,430
he's not even afraid to harm himself.

28
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,710
What a ruthless person.

29
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,800
But regarding the drug maker,

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,750
he refused to say anything no matter what.

31
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,829
So I think this drug maker is

32
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,910
very important.

33
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,960
He must still have some hope

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,360
pinned on the drug maker.

35
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,590
Don't worry.

36
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,250
This drug maker

37
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,060
will definitely continue making drugs.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,160

When people are pushed to the edge,

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,680
they'll always look for a way out.

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,100
So now this drug maker is the key.

43
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,730
They're manufacturing meth

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,700
Along this entire chain,

46
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,850
from production to storage,

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
and then to transportation,

48
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,960
I think we should

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,560
focus our investigation

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,920

Focusing on raw materials?

53
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,420

or shipping out the product,

59
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,030
they always need transportation, right?

60
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,630
Right.

61
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,570
It's easier to start with transportation.

62
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,829

00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,260

67
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,650
He was very cunning.

68
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,079
The evidence chain wasn't complete then,

69
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,340
so he was released after just a few years.

75
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,910
and even opened a restaurant.

76
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,860
I think we should investigate him.

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,190
I agree.

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,250
Lili has never given you gifts before,

195
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,000
right?

196
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,160
You're overthinking.

197
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
She just wants to give me a gift.

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,240
Don't mess this up for me.

199
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,870
Give me my phone.

200
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,560
Come down.

201
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920

00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,770
could you lend us some money?

Really, it's not necessary.

278
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,750
It's OK.

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,790

281
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,810
No, please.

282
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,750
Don't worry.

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,510

That woman was his mother.

329
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,410
Even back then I felt the mother and son

330
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,620
were different from others.

331
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,330
Only when I grew up did I realize

332
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,640
his mother was making drugs.

333
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,650
In a pigpen?

334
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,670
Making drugs?

335
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,570
Wouldn't that stink terribly?

336
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,070
Everyone in the village despised them.

337
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,440
They said his mother was a slut,

338
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,610
and he was a bastard,

339
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,360
and also called him Pigpen Boy.

340
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,720
Mou Haidong was the same.

341
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,880
He'd beat and scold him whenever they met.

342
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,480
Mou even kept his mother

343
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,810
locked up in the pigpen.

344
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,000
He grew up in that kind of environment.

345
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Wouldn't he turn into a psychopath?

346
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,810
I barely spoke to him.

347
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,570
I didn't really know him well.

348
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,270
But he...

349
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,170
he didn't seem like an evil person.

350
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,810
Anyway, after that,

351
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,990
I never saw him again.

352
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,810

00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,840

357
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,650
his mother passed away.

358
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,930
His mother died?

359
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,320
How did she die?

360
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,910
I don't know.

361
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,750
It's probably good he left early.

362
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,610
Otherwise, he might have been arrested

363
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,480
by now.

364
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
He should be fine.

Gold-Tooth Wan's death

366
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,000
has nothing to do with him.

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,550

370
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,770
I just want to work honestly,

371
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,630
and make some money

372
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,760
to leave this place.

373
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,030
Go somewhere I want to go,

374
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,760
and live the life I want to live.

375
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,910
Why is that so difficult?

376
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,970
I'm sorry, Duozai.

377
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,860
If I hadn't stolen those cans,

378
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,360
things wouldn't have turned out this way.

379

What if...

380
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,340
we turn ourselves in?

381
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,370
If we explain everything to the police,

382
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,630
would they believe us?

383
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,360
No way.

384
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,440
Absolutely not.

385
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,730
Turn ourselves in?

386
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,530
If we turn ourselves in

387
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,670
and the police think we're accomplices,

388
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,600
we'll go to jail.

389
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,030
And when I leave the jail,

390
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,030
who's going to give me back my youth?

391
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,150
No way.

392
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,120
Absolutely not.

393
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,850
I refuse to turn myself in.

394
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,700
Why don't we sneak across the border?

395
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,950
Let's get out of here

396
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,810

00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,150
What do you think?

398
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,220
Crossing the border costs money too.

399
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,200
Didn't Pigpen Boy say

400
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,460
he'd find us some work?

401
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,670
You don't want his money,

402
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,030
but we can at least take money

403
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,160
that we earn with our own hands, right?

404
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,550
As you said,

405
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,109
he's Mou Haidong's illegitimate son,

an abandoned child.

407
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,829
He was beaten and scolded since childhood.

408
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,829
How could he teach him those things?

409
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,130
Didn't he say he went to school later?

410
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,530
He looks like a respectable person to me.

411

I haven't seen him for so many years.

412
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,230
He's just being loyal to an old friend.

413
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,510
What else would he want from us?

414
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,110

Why did you go down the mountain

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,200
Because,

458
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,240
there were goods

00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,030

that Gold-Tooth Wan wanted to kill him.

532

Gold-Tooth Wan

533
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,350
was high on drugs before,

534
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,480
really high.

535
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,350
He probably just fell by himself.

536
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,270
So, well...

537
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,550
Is that all?

538
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,640
Yes.

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,510

540
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,200
very well.

541
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,000
His legs aren't even as thick as my arms.

542
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,550
That knife was heavier than his hand.

543
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,790
He's real timid.

544
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,190
He wouldn't kill anyone.

545
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,920
Then who started the fire?

546
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
I don't know.

547
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,180

00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,920
and he saw me,

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,200

556
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,070

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,600

559

563
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,240

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,270
Officer, you're

576
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,160
digging a huge pit

577
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,490
and asking me to jump in.

578
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,510
Ask them to come here and clear things up.

579
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,880
It's their only way out.

580
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,060
Wan Shan's death

581
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,590
has no official ruling yet.

582
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,480
If you really want to help them,

583
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,370
cooperate with us to find them.

584
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,680
Fine.

585
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,590
Officer, what does it mean

586
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,000
that his death has no official ruling yet?

587
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

588
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,240
I've told you everything I know.

589
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,920
I've told you everything.

590
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,850
I can't make up things I don't know.

591
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
So you don't know?

592
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,040
I don't know.

593
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,200
That's fine.

594
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,000
If you don't know, just sit here.

595
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,260
Tell me when you remember something.

596
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,590
I've told you

597
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,650
everything I know.

598
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,030
Mr. Zhen?

599
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,350
What's your name?

600
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,370
I'm talking to you.

601
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,110
Are you dumb?

602
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,550
[Please put used paper in the bin,

603
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,720
and flush after use.]

604
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,830
Mr. Zhen,

605
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,370
why didn't you contact me

606
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,300
when you got out?

607
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,440
Didn't I tell you to contact me?

608
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,680
You did say you had connections.

609
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,350
Who knows if you were just bragging?

610
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,150
If I knew your connections were real,

611
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,610
I would've contacted you.

612
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,410
I didn't expect to see you here.

613
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,680
It must be fate.

614
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,790
Yes. Cheers.

615
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,680
I'm happy now.

616
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,000
This is so spicy.

617
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,840
I still remember

618
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,300
you helped me defeat the prison king.

619
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,250
I didn't have to clean the toilet anymore.

620
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,510
Why bring that up?

621
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,510
Someone like me

622
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,830
could look after you

623
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,590
while we were in there.

624
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,650
But once we're out,

625
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,440
educated people like you

626
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,080
can do much better than us.

627
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,550
I manage this transportation company.

628
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,440
If you want a desk job

629
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,880
with light duties,

630
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,000
just say the word.

631
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,040
No, no.

632
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,450
A guy like me

633
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,000
is good at moving stuff

634
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,400
and transporting goods.

635
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,590
Comfortable positions don't suit me.

636
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,240
I'm not used to that.

637
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,070
Mr. Zhen, what are saying?

638
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,200
Even at the docks,

639
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,040
you'd be a supervisor at least.

640
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,270
How could I let you be a cargo worker?

641
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,940
You really want to help me?

642
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,420
Yang Min, how about this?

643
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,770
Let me work with you.

644
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,330
We transport stuff and make quick money.

645
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,480
OK?

646
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,720
What's so funny?

647
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Mr. Zhen,

648
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,750
I just got out.

649
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,720
Don't make me go back in.

650
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,980
I get it.

651
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,270
Forget I ever mentioned it.

652
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,970
Mr. Zhen.

653
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,720
What?

654
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,550
Let's drop it.

655
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,790
I'm trying to get through the hardship.

656
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,790
Life is

657
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,790
not easy.

658
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,520
No opportunities to make money.

659
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,220
No one is willing to hire someone like me.

660
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,040
Yang Min,

661
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,260
I've never asked you for anything.

662
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,760
But just now I did.

663
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,120
I need your help.

664
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,720
It's really tough.

665
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,880
I'm struggling.

666
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,440
I'm serious.

667
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,050
If you help me,

668
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,640
I'll remember this favor forever.

669
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,790
Mr. Zhen,

670
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,520
I'll see what I can find for you.

671
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,750
Keep your word.

672
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,070
Thanks, buddy.

673
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,440
Good.

674
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,250
I'll finish this drink.

675
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:56,990
[Brother Qiang Hot Pot]

676
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,140
I'm looking for Qiang.

677
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,750
Qiang!

678
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,070
Call Qiang.

679
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,130
Qiang.

680
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,940
Come and have a seat.

681
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,030
Make yourself at home.

682
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:26,880
Just relax.

683
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,700
The soup is good.

684
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,510
Help yourself to some soup.

685
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,760
I'll do it myself.

686
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,610
Take more.

687
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,950
Jiamin.

688
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,250
It's delicious.

689
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,520
I used to make this soup myself.

690
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,240
It tasted so much better than this.

691
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,480
I know.

692
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,420
Yang Min often talked about you in there.

693
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,270
You love delicious food.

694
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,470
You love rules.

695
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,510
You're a very meticulous person.

696
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,270
I know.

697
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,170
What did you say your name was?

698
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,480
What's your name again?

699
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,200
Yang Shu.

700
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,790
You can call me Azhen.

701
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,960
He works in transportation.

702
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,400
He always looked after me in there.

703
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,200
Very reliable.

704
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,960
Yes.

705
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,610
Transportation, huh?

706
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,120
I know all transportation guys

707
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,000
in this area.

708
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,310
How come I've never heard of you?

709
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,830
My guys all started

710
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,130
with box trucks doing odd jobs.

711
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,300
We don't work fixed routes.

712
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,360
That's not working in transportation.

713
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,820
That's just freelancing.

714
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,750
Qiang, that's not how we put it.

715
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,590
My guys and I

716
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,590
started with street vending.

717
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,790
Our connections are just as extensive.

718
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,230
Neighborhoods, back roads,

719
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,680
highways, and national roads,

720
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,200
we know them all well.

721
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,000
How many routes do you operate now?

722
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,720
We don't have many people,

723
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,050
about six or seven guys.

724
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
What's your rate?

725
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,960
Easy.

726
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,960
With Yang Min involved,

727
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,360
I'll give you a discount.

728
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,110
Let's drink soup.

729
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,960
OK.

730
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,650
Cheers!

731
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,510
Zhi'an.

732
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,790
Every time I call you, you're always busy.

733
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,920
Have you forgotten about your friends?

734
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,550
Exactly.

735
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,750
Yeah, it's been a long time.

736
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,790
Exactly!

737
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,590
Exactly!

738
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,270
Right.

739
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,330
You never visit us.

740
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,520
An,

741
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,680
you should drink three cups as a penalty.

742
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,740
I know. I know.

743
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,590
Drink up.

744
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,750
I've been really busy with work lately.

745
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,080
I'll take three drinks.

746
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,070
And today is my treat.

747
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,710
I'm watching you.

748
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,550
Yu, pour her a drink.

749
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,660
Keep an eye on her.

750
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,830
Drink up, An.

751
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,110
Come on, drink this.

752
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,170
You drink with her.

753
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,960
You're just trying to get out of drinking.

754
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,070
-She doesn’t drink.
-She drank it.

755
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,200
You won't even drink the first cup, An.

756
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,260
Let me see the phone.

757
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,910
What's wrong?

758
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,790
Why are you taking my phone?

759
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,160
What are you doing? Drinking or not?

760
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,350
-Stop playing with the phone.
-Yeah.

761
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,950
We rarely get to see each other.

762
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,110
She's just making excuses.

763
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,310
Exactly. She never drinks.

764
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,240
You guys enjoy.

765
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,130
Where is she going?

766
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,320
Where are you going?

767
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,080
Captain Luo,

768
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,040
they're making a deal

769
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,110
at the night market in Dianqian Village.

770
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,370
Can you check this car?

771
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,640
The plate number is 77H32.

772
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,380
[Brother Qiang Hot Pot]

773
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:43,630
[Brother Qiang Hot Pot]

774
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,880
Uncle Yang,

775
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,330
what are you doing here?

776
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
What happened to you?

777
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,400
You've got the wrong person.

778
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,350
Uncle Yang,

779
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,440
where have you been all these years?

780
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,200
Mom said you never came home.

781
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,070
How many times do I have to tell you?

782
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,480
Stop following me around.

783
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,270
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

784
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:28,880
Go away.

785
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,110
Uncle Yang.

786
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,790
The neighbor's daughter keeps stalking me.

787
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,790
I don't know why.

788
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,170
Who is this?

789
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,960
A friend.

790
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,160
If I don't follow you,

791
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,270
you'll just hang out with such bad people.

792
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,270
Isn't that right?

793
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,010
Neighbor's daughter?

794
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,010
After the divorce,

795
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:47,720
you wanted to abandon your own child, too?

796
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,240
Yes, I don't want to see either of you.

797
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,750
Just get out of here.

798
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,240
Fine.

799
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,720
Then don't come looking for us anymore.

800
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,440
Wait.

801
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,880
What's all this shouting?

802
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,590
Enough.

803
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,880
-What's wrong?
-Qiang.

804
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,910
This is Mr. Zhen's daughter.

805
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,230
Azhen's daughter has grown into a lady.

806
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,110
Since she's already here,

807
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,240
we should treat her.

808
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,920
Azhen, you two should stay.

809
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,280
The kid knows nothing.

810
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,030
It's alright.

811
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,110
We're all family here.

812
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,239
Come on, young lady.

813
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,600
Come in, come in.

814
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,690
Let's talk inside.

815
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,159
Why make a scene out here?

816
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,550
Come in and talk.

817
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,070
What is this?

818
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,190
Listen,

819
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,760
if you dare touch meth,

820
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,110
I'll call the police on you immediately.

821
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,110
Don't talk nonsense.

822
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,920
We're eating.

823
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,070
This young lady

824
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,270
is quite impressive.

825
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,230
Azhen,

826
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,980
your daughter doesn't look like you.

827
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,050
It's embarrassing to say,

828
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,510
but when my wife married me,

829
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,239
she brought this burden along.

830
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,739
How could she look like me?

831
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,360
That's quite something of you.

832
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,020
Young lady,

833
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,710
now you're here,

834
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,909
and you're so pretty,

835
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,030
but I don't even know your name.

836
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,630
Let me see your ID.

837
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,920
Are you a cop?

838
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,180
You want to check my ID?

839
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,190
I didn't take it with me.

840
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,520
Whether I'm a cop or not,

841
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,890
you're in my house now.

842
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,840
Let me see it.

843
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,280
What are you doing?

844
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,320
Let go of my hand!

845
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,110
Step aside.

846
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,070
I got this.

847
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,400
I'm leaving, Zhi'an.

848
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,710
Bye.

849
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:20,750
[Police ID]

850
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,130
She didn't bring her ID.

851
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Get away!

852
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,320
Back off!

853
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,710
Let go!

854
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,570
Don't touch me!

855
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,440
Get away!

856
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,630
She came prepared,

857
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,690
and it's even pink.

858
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,920
Let me tell you,

859
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,440
this spray

860
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,360
is made to deal with people like you.

861
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,070
Qiang,

862
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,360
stop it.

863
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,750
You're scaring the kid.

864
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,070
And you

865
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,960
just tell Qiang your name.

866
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,130
She has my surname.

867
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,960
Yang Ying.

868
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,760
Azhen,

869
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,670
since this is our first cooperation,

870
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,880
we need to know more about each other.

871
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,590
Don't be upset.

872
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,590
No, no, not at all.

873
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,380
So, Qiang,

874
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:01,960
if you've asked everything you needed to,

875
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,110
are we done?

876
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,070
Can she leave now?

877
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,710
Azhen,

878
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,380
we're about done talking.

879
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,880
Take your daughter home.

880
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,440
I'll contact you if anything comes up.

881
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:09,960
OK.

882
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,530
Let's go.

883
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,150
Come on.

884
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,230
Let's go.

885
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,830
See you later, Qiang.

886
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,670
Qiang,

887
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,560
are we still going to use him?

888
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,320
He already knows what we do.

889
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,970
Use him or not, we should check him out.

890
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,610
Follow them.

891
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,960
Why did you talk to me?

892
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,250
I didn't know you were on a mission.

893
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,490
And anyone who sees you

894
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,360
looking so miserable

895
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,760
would be curious, OK?

896
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,290
What do you mean miserable?

897
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,420
You have no perception at all.

898
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,560
I have no perception?

899
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,920
Why are you so ungrateful?

900
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,550
At least I helped you

901
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,950
get through that crisis.

902
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,330
I wasn't in any crisis.

903
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,440
If I hadn't been there just now,

904
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,540
wouldn't they have forced you to take it?

905
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,960
I can solve my own problems.

906
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,220
I don't need your help.

907
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,840
Fine.

908
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,370
I won't interfere anymore.

909
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,370
You're so great.

910
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,590
What's so great about me?

911
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,600
Now I suddenly have a daughter

912
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,440
out of nowhere.

913
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,360
One lie leads to a hundred more.

914
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,570
I didn't know I was supposed to be

915
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,480
your neighbor's  daughter.

916
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,220
So I could only

917
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,220
pretend to be your daughter, right?

918
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,410
Fine, good job.

919
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But anyway,

920
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,980
good thing you cut a hole in my pocket.

921
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,890
Otherwise they would've found my badge.

922
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
Isn't everything resolved now?

923
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,490
Why are you sighing?

924
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,360
There's a black Passat behind us.

925
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,360
It has been following us all the way.

926
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,110
You see it?

927
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,590
What should we do?

928
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,760
Call Luo Zhongkui.

929
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,760
Request backup.

930
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,150
Tell him we're heading home now.

931
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,960
OK.

932
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,230
Alright, stop hiding.

933
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:01,960
Come out now.

934
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,400
You're still shouting?

935
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,840
What are you doing here?

936
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,850
This is a coincidence.

937
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,880
Dapeng.

938
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,690
Good. You've improved.

939
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,840
You even know to call for backup now.

940
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,970
It's to protect her.

941
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,000
Everything's ready.

942
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,630
Let's go.

943
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:18,960
Move.

944
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,760
Wait.

945
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,190
There are people tailing us downstairs.

946
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,670
Won't we run into them if we leave now?

947
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,440
I know,

948
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,760
but you're even less safe here.

949
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,760
Let's put on some disguises.

950
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,960
I have a place to hide.

951
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:02,920
Hello,

952
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,480
you clean all this area?

953
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,840
Yes, I clean it all.

954
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
That's hard work.

955
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,180
Do you know the father and daughter

956
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,510
who just went upstairs?

957
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,160
Father and daughter?

958
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,050
That messy guy on the second floor

959
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,150
is often not home.

960
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,500
I've never seen his daughter.

961
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,320
Not even once?

962
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,670
Never seen her.
