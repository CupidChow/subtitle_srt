Let's go!

198
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,860
Run quickly!

199
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,270
To the right!

200
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,360
Go forward!

201
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,770

Leave quickly. It's not safe there.

Let's go.

227
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,210
With injuries like these,

228
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
you definitely need to go to the hospital.

229
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,370
You must have done something serious.

230
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,730
He's definitely trouble.

231
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,510
We can't just leave him to die.

232
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,840
Mr. Luo saved us before.

240

I'll kill you if you don't behave.

Just wanted to ask

275
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,780
if you've noticed
any suspicious individuals.

276
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,620
We haven't seen any at this checkpoint.

What about the other checkpoints?

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,030
Come.

279
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,980
It's like this.

280
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:25,960
Our station has

281
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,110
set up 4 checkpoints

282

Tonight's target is

287
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,370
very important.

288
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,830
He must be seriously injured.

289
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,230
He couldn't have gotten past our blockade.

290
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,770

of drug-making materials.

And

313
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,850
we caught the drug transporters
and the cook's assistant.

That's right.

317

The drug cook got away.

318

He still managed to escape.

Did he leave any clues?

323
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,550
We found

324
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,200
a recently discarded
gas mask at the scene.

325
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,060

Qin Shishan stated that

469
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,440
Liu Libo had always been in contact
with the drug cook

00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,680
through a single channel.

471
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,480
But 3 years ago,

472
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,720
after that batch
of pink meth was destroyed,

473
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,250
the drug cook approached Liu Libo

474
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,610
and they specifically planned

475
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,310
to use the newly made pink meth

00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,600

than the pink meth

according to the DNA test

00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,000
from the gas mask,

490
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,400
the match with Mou Haidong's DNA

491
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,790
is over 99%.

492
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,640
If the drug cook

493
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,030
is Mou Haidong's son,

494
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,880
then everything

495
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,840
makes sense now.

496
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,110
But our records show

497
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,640
that Mou Haidong only has one son.

498
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,170
So he must be
Mou Haidong's illegitimate son.

499
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,960
He remains our primary arrest target.

500

00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,320
put something in your bag, right?

760
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,150
No.

761
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,110
What could I be putting in?

762
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,280
I didn't put anything in.

763
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,740
Come and see for yourself.

764
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,810
Duozai, you...

765
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,760
Give it to me.

766
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,820
What are you doing?

767
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,760
Where did you get this?

768
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,400
I went to check a few days ago.

769
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,510
I took what I had hidden elsewhere

770
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,770
and brought them back.

771
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,320
Two cans.

772
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,710
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

773
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,960
We're completely out of supplies, Sir.

774
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,180
I'm back to save you now, aren't I?

775
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,650
Out of supplies...

776
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,590
Where's Duozai?

777
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,770
He's taking care of the wounded.

778
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,010
I came back to find some food.

779
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,510
Who's injured?

780
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,110
Sir! Sir!

781
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,090
Quick! Quick!

782
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,280
What happened?

783
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,670
Why are you lying on the ground?

784
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,510
Get up quickly!

785
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,150
Bro.

786
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,020
Hurry!

787
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,360
Don't yell, Bro!

788
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,230
Wait, wait!

789
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,000
Hurry!

790
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,230
Lay him down here.

791
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,110
Yes.

792
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,710
Hold his feet. Lift his legs.

793
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,070
Bro, please don't yell.

794
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,120
Bear with it.

795
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,280
If you keep yelling,
you'll attract everyone here.

796
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,000
Stop yelling.

797
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,150
He seems to be in so much pain.

798
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,000
Even if he's in pain, he can't yell.

799
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,960
Think of a way.

800
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,790
What... What is this?

801
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,080
[Canned braised pork]
