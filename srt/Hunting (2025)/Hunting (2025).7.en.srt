00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,710
Who is it?

4
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,229
It's me,

5
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,920
Qin Shishan.

6
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,560
Shishan?

7
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,740
How do you know I live here?

8
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,690
Many truck drivers live in this area.

9
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,590
Besides, you're very famous, Mr. Zhen.

10
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,360
It's easy to locate you.

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,620
Stop making fun of me. Let's talk inside.

12
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,430
What's going on here?

13
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,430
I love spicy food.

14
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,960
What a good daughter you have.

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,090
Such heavy smoke. I'll close the door.

16
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,350
Does she wear B-cup bras now?

17
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,370
Shishan,

18
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,870
please don't joke about my kid.

19
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,430
I'm not.

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,079
Make way.

21
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,280
Dinner's ready.

22
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,150
Hurry.

23
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,710
Shishan, let me get you some tea.

24
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,710
I have Tie Guan Yin,

25
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,240
Cassie Bark Oolong and Da Hong Pao.

26
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,310
Which would you like?

27
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,710
No need. I'm good.

28
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,810
Mr. Zhen,

29
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,960
I've looked around,

30
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,800
but found no photo
of you and your daughter.

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,730
I look back, especially on camera.

32
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,580
Kids grow up fast.

33
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,370
Cherish your time with her.

34
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,110
Yeah, sure.

35
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,150
Does your daughter live here too?

36
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,610
Sometimes she stays over.

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,470
Nothing much to see here.

38
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,280
Come have tea.

39
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,520
Come on!

40
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,770
No need for tea.

41
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,560
Mr. Liu

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,870
has a gift for you.

43
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,990
A gift?

44
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,470
How generous of Mr. Liu.

45
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,410
It's a watch! I love it.

46
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,590
Mr. Liu usually has others
set their watches

47
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,650
by him before carrying out missions.

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,680
Pretty.

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,340
Quite nice.

50
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,240
Alright. I've made the delivery. See you.

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,630
Let's have dinner together.

52
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,630
I can't eat that.

53
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,520
Please stay.

54
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,400

[Attached with
a sketch of the suspect Mou X]

57
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,030
Now you know why he rents two places,
right?

58
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,560
He's worried

59
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,090
that someone might suddenly
search his room.

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,930
That's a valid concern.

61
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,320
He has to be thorough.

62
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,800
If anything happens to him,

63
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,000
at least there will be clues left for us.

64
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,210
His life is constantly at stake.

65
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,310
These years have been rough for him.

66
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,310
What a fool he is.

67
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,430
He has to hold out in suffering.

68
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,560
Put the things back.

69
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,310
I blame that hateful man

70
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,000
for barging in and disrupting me.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,510
I could've cooked this better.

72
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,480
It's okay.

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,850
I'll fix it.

74
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,240
Your mother has gone back to her hometown.

75
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,680
You'd better behave.

76
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,470
I think you're the one who's not behaving.

77
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,670
They gave you a watch.

78
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,350
I'm sure you're up to no good.

79
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,630
Boss.

80
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,250
Is the man Mr. Liu recruited reliable?

81
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,220
I'm observing him.

82
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,800
A girl came out of nowhere,
alleged to be his daughter.

83
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,130
I've never heard of her.

84
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,159
Text me her name.

85
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,270
Okay.

86
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,950
You'll sleep in the room tonight.

87
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,480
Then...

88
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,920
where will you sleep?

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,600
The couch.

90
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,730
Get in the room.

91
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,510
It seems
I don't have their complete trust yet.

92
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,640
For safety reasons,

93
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,730
you must leave tomorrow morning.

94
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,650
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,010
Today,

96
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,070
I caused you trouble.

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
It wasn't trouble at all.

98
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,980
Your mother still hates me,
doesn't she?

99
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,780
She even wouldn't let others
mention your name.

100
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,180
She gets mad at anyone who speaks of you.

101
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,750
I understand.

102
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,700
Do you really understand?

103
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,450
In fact, I resented you a bit back then.

104
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,510
But my mother said,

105
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,610
as the family of a narcotics officer,

106
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,380
we had to brace ourselves
for losing our loved one anytime.

107
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,240
For the good of his young comrade-in-arms,

108
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,390
my father's sacrifice was worth it.

109
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,250
I couldn't fully understand it
at that time.

110
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,840
But now,

111
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,890
being a narcotics officer myself,

112
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,670
I finally do.

113
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,860
Lives are bound to be sacrificed
in battle.

114
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,390
In that particular fight...

115
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,580
The misfortune befell my father.

[In mourning of the passing
of Comrade Wu Jianguo]

117
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,320
Captain Wu

118
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,490
sacrificed his life for me.

119
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,840
It wasn't for anyone.

120
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,150
I believe if you had been in his position,

121
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,150
you would have made the same choice.

122
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,750
My father was a hero,

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,320
[In loving memory of Wu Jianguo]

124
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,780
and so are you, Uncle Yang.

125
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,030
I should apologize to you.

126
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,920
I'd hate for my recklessness

127
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,770
to put you in danger as well.

128
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,910
That would really upset me.

129
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,600
When I saw you
at the hot pot restaurant today,

130
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,080
I knew

131
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,930
you must've been through much suffering
in the past 3 years.

132
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,100
Uncle Yang,

133
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,150
when you have time,
I hope you can come by my home

134
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,750
for fried stuffed pancakes.

135
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,230
My mother's cooking is the same as ever.

136
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,040
Captain Wu,

00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,600
I, Yang Yipeng, a narcotics officer,
am reporting for duty.

138
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,610
My wife made these for you.

139
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,340
Try some.

140
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,250
Fried stuffed pancakes. My favorite.

141
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:26,960
Captain Wu!

142
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,440
Tasty, huh?

143
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:27,790
Very tasty.

144
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,480
Captain Wu!

145
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,540
There's a new task.

146
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,360
We have to go now?

147
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes.

148
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,510

00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,600
Yang Shu does have a daughter

named Yang Ying.

154
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,920
But I haven't been able to
get in contact with his ex-wife.

155
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,320
What should I do next?

156
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,360
Just follow the routine.

157
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,200
We need someone to threaten him with,
don't we?

158
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Okay. Got it.

159
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,150
I'm really getting old.

160
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,320
Can't believe I just fell asleep.

161
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,000
You hadn't slept for 2 days.

162
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,560
Oh, right.

163
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,790
About Yipeng's fake identity,

164
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,790
how's everything going?

165
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,510
Last night,

166
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,840
I already added a daughter to his profile.

167
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,660
Good.

168
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,650
It's time to eat!

169
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,980
What now?

170
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,750
I just woke up.

171
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,320
What are we eating?

172
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,030
Get ready to take action.

173
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,480
Okay.

174
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,940
I wonder if there's breakfast for us.

175
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,720
You wish.

176
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,240
Even cats and dogs
won't eat your terrible cooking.

177
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Then don't eat it.

178
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
But I'm hungry.

179
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,440
-Then shut up and eat.
-You got everything ready?

180
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,960
If you hadn't used my credit
to take out loans online,

181
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,870
you think I would've come here?

182
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,440
-Give me the money,
-Yes.

183
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,570
and I'll be on my way.

184
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,540
Prepare to take action.

185
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,090
What's that?

186
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,270
Are you still using drugs?

187
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,110
-What are you doing? Get off me!
-Are you still using drugs?

188
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,600

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,930
The "magic potions" line
is about the drug ingredients.

566
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,850
Now I understand.

567
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,360
Instead of having a drug deal tonight,

568
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,550
they're going to make drugs.

569
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,590
That's why they need materials.

570
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,720
What's that location on the last line?

571
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,230
The Magpie Bridge

572
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,850
is a location in the game.

573
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,590
But in reality...

574
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,920
Could the Magpie Bridge

575
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,180
be Zhangjiang Bridge?

576
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,030
Right.

577
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,340
Probably.

578
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,300
Zhangjiang Bridge...

579
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Chief Fang, look.

580
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,160
There's a wild beach
near Zhangjiang Bridge.

581
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,870
Zoom in on that beach.

582
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,580
All units, attention.

583
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,720
Prioritize the investigation

584
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,030
on suspicious individuals

585
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,320
and cargo vehicles
near the Zhangjiang wild beach.

586
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,280
Take action now!

00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,280
Yes!

591
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,440
Let's go!

Director Gu.

593
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,710
Sir,

594
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,510
could you lend me your phone?

595
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,000
Okay. But you can't make calls here.

596
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,930
Do it over there.

597
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,870
Got it. Thank you.

598
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,000
Yang Min, what do you mean by this?

599
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,530
Is this a trap or something?

600
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,290
Why are you still so mad?

601
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,110
Calm down and talk it through.

602
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,550
How am I supposed to calm down?

dropped me halfway—
I'll let that slide.

605
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,030
But where is my daughter?

606
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,780
It's just the standard procedure.

607
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Be patient.

608
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,810
Your daughter will be sent back
once the work is done.

609
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,130

obviously has evil thoughts

612
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,860
about my daughter.

613
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:27,970
Listen,

614
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,550
tell me where my daughter is,

615
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,270
or I'll come fight you now!

616
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,230
Mr. Zhen,

617
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,630
no need for such tension.

618
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,150

I'll call you again in 10 minutes.

620
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,020
Here it is.

621
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,590
Get off the truck.

622
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,420
Hand over your phones.

623
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,770
You'll get them back when the work's done.

624
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,800
Hurry.

625
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,360
Yours?

626
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,100
Go, start working.

627
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,510
Got a phone on you?

628
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,450
Where's your phone?

629
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,090
Hurry up.

630
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,600
Can you pause and explain this?

631
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,480
We're almost there.

632
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,320
Slowly.

633
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,670
Be careful.

634
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,600
What exactly are we transferring?

635
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,760
Don't be so nosy.

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,190
Get a move on.

637
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,150

668
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,810
I need to use the toilet.

Didn't you just go?

670
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,670
I have bad kidneys, alright?

671
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,730
Bad kidneys...

672
