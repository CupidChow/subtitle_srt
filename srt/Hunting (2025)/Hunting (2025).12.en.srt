Liu Libo is just a decoy.

306

then do not dwell on it anymore.

Why are there still so many?

344
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,650
The color is different.

345
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,870
The weight is wrong too.

346
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,070

349
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,800
this plan would be perfect.

350

You called the police, didn't you?

351
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,020
You never had 200 kilos of that stuff.

352
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,320
To rescue you both,

353
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,800
I had to take risks.

354
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,430
The only one you really wanted
to save was your brother.

355
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,530
You're different.

356
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:02,980
But to me,

357
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,530
both of you are important.

358
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,680

359
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,570
There's something I must tell you.

360
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,510
Uncle Ma is in trouble.

361
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,850
What happened?

362
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,110
He was transporting the stuff

363
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,190
when the police stopped him.

364
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,040
Why would he be transporting the stuff?

365
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,370
Master Du demanded

366
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,050
to receive all the stuff

367
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,450
before letting both of you go.

368
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,590
And he demanded

369
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,150
that each side send someone

370
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,480
to transport fake stuff

371
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,440
to

372
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,480
divert the police's attention.

373
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,960
Uncle Ma went.

374
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,110
He tried to run through a checkpoint
while transporting the stuff

375
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,840
and was shot dead by the police.

376
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,660
You're lying.

377
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,860
Are you kidding me?

378
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,870
What are you trying to get me
to do with these lies? Tell me.

379
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,330
How would he have that kind of courage?

380
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,920
He was clearly transporting fake stuff.

381
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,580
Why would he run a checkpoint?

382
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,760
I don't know the details either.

383
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,360
But Liu Libo was in the truck at the time.

384
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,340
I suspect Liu Libo
forced him to run the checkpoint.

385
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,190
Duozai.

386
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:49,910
I'm sorry.

387
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,250
I couldn't protect him.

388
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,590
You forced me!

389
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,720
You forced him too!

390
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,030
You had to destroy my family

391
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,560
before you were satisfied?

392
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Are you happy now?

393
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,540
Your father

394
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,750
came willingly.

395
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,590
We didn't kidnap him.

396
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,730
Willingly?

397
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,450
Didn't you guys kidnap him?

398
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,400
Go ahead and kill me if you want!

399
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,210
Listen to me!

400
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,760
Let me tell you the truth.

401
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,270
Your father didn't want you
to turn yourself in.

402
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,330
Do you understand?

403
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,030
He put on an act.

404
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,030
And let me tell you something.

405
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,830
Don't you even know

406
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,030
what kind of person your father was?

407
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,920
He was blinded by money.

408
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,350
He'd do anything for cash.

409
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,310
One million.

410
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,590
Impressive.

411
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,220
Rushing forward
without caring for his life.

412
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,470
What a hero!

413
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,420
Duozai.

414
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,470
I understand your pain.

415
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,800
You don't have to believe me.

416
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,440
But our fate is predetermined.

417
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,070
Drug dealers are cursed from birth.

418
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,430
From the moment we were born,

419
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,030
we were labeled.

420
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,820
A label we can never shake off.

421
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,580
This is our destiny.

422
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,100
We can't blame anyone,

423
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,120
nor can we rely on anyone.

424
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,500
The only one you can trust is yourself.

425
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,250
Get lost.

426
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,120
Get lost.

427
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,990
If you have nowhere to go,

428
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,750
you can work with me.

429
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,370
Be careful, Miss Tang.

430
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,830
Let's leave here first.

431
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,480
Let's go.

432
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,200
Thank you for your hard work, Captain Luo.

433
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,570
Hello, Mr. Zhen.

434
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,030
The test results are out.

435
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,760
They match Yipeng's analysis.

436
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,590
Apart from a small portion being meth,

437
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,790
the rest is just a mixture of rock sugar.

438
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,930
What's the situation with Tang Du?

439
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,830
We brought him
to the station for questioning.

440
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,350
You couldn't get anything out of him.

441
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,580
He refused to talk.

442
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,530
Yes,

443
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,050
he figured it out again.

444
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,840
Tang Du claimed he knew nothing,

445
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,030
and said the person who called Liu Libo

446
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,560
is actually named Hong Kun.

447
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,050
But he admited

448
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,920
he was in contact with Liu Libo.

449
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,200
However, he denied

450
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,790
ordering Liu Libo to transport drugs.

451
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,910
Based on all our evidence,

452
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,850
the truth appears to be

453
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,550
that Tang Du,

454
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,200
through Liu Libo as a middleman,

455
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,680
used Gu Zhifeng's connections

456
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,110
to bring in the drugs.

457
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,800
This was just a smokescreen.

458
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,270
The real purpose

459
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,310
was to conduct a transaction at sea.

460
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,190
But that shipment at sea

461
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,800
wasn't high-purity drugs.

462
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:27,840
Exactly.

463
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,180
That's the strange part.

464
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,680
Going to all that trouble

465
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,410
over fake drugs makes no sense.

466
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,550
I think Tang Du

467
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,020
had no idea that shipment

468
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,880
was actually compromised.

469
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,440
Why?

470
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,200
When I boarded the boat,

471
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,680
they

472
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,480
were desperately dumping
the stuff into the sea.

473
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,400
Peng Jiangyu

474
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,940
fought desperately

475
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,590
and was eventually shot dead.

476
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,680
They didn't seem to know

477
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,140
there was anything wrong
with the shipment.

478
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,020
The drug cook

479
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,710
deceived Tang Du.

480
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,340
That must be it.

481
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,660
His previous shipment

482
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,350
was destroyed at Qipan Mountain.

483
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,200
And the beach drug lab

484
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,220
was also raided.

485
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,240
So in such a short time,

486
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,280
where could they find so much stuff?

487
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,909
So they had to take a risk

488
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,199
and trade fake stuff with Tang Du.

489
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,190
Right.

490
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,060
But that would be incredibly bold.

491
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,949
Tang Du runs Xin Sheng He.

492
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,400
Isn't he afraid of retaliation?

493
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,260
He's not afraid

494
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,880
because he knew

495
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,590
the shipment

496
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,520
would never reach Tang Du's hands.

497
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,940
Here's the case.

498
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,590
The coast guards

499
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,850
just sent me a message.

500
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,600
Someone reported

501
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,520
a drug deal happening at sea.

502
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,800
They even described

503
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,260
exactly which boat it was.

504
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
So think about it,

505
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,469
who could have

506
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
made that report?

507
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,639
The drug cook.

508
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,770
Luo Yuansu.

509
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,460
This Luo Yuansu

510
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,130
is really calculating.

511
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,960
First, he used Tang Du and Liu Libo

512
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,179
to distract us.

513
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:54,880
Then

514
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,840
he played the thief crying "stop thief,"

515
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
reporting to the police himself

516
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,030
and buying time to escape.

517
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,330
That was clever.

518
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,770
But why would he go to all this trouble?

519
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,450
Is it possible

520
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,880
that it was for Mou Lang?

521
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,440
When we were tracking Liu Libo,

522
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,070
I discovered that Liu Libo
had taken Mou Lang

523
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,550
to Xinji as a hostage.

524
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,410
It's very likely

525
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,240
that Luo Yuansu's deal with Tang Du

526
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,520
was all about Mou Lang.

527
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,150
As Mou Haidong's illegitimate son,

528
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,150
he doesn't even qualify
to enter the family shrine.

529
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,730
So why would he risk so much

530
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,110
for Mou Lang?

531
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,210
There must be
huge financial interests behind this.

532
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,880
So Mou Lang

533
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,580
is

534
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,320
the key to these huge financial interests.

535
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,210
These drug dealers

536
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,800
are all cunning as foxes.

537
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,210
You're overwhelmed?

538
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,590
Yes,

539
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,150
I'm overwhelmed.

540
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,970
I didn't accomplish anything.

541
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,230
But this time, Yipeng

542
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,130
should be credited for his work.

543
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,480
Yeah.

544
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,630
He didn't catch Luo Yuansu,

545
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,410
but

546
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,650
he did seize a shipment of fake drugs.

547
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,020
Thank you, Captain Luo.

548
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,800
Thank you.

549
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,860
Alright, alright,

550
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,610
you two start arguing every time you meet.

551
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,990
He talks like a child.

552
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,670
Couldn't you elders
give the youngsters a break?

553
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,920
That's right, old man.

554
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,960
Fine, I'm sorry.

555
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,070
This time,

556
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,950
we didn't catch Luo Yuansu

557
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,040
or get evidence against Tang Du,

558
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,440
but

559
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:18,790
Gu Zhifeng

560
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,270
and Liu Libo

561
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,670
have both been captured.

562
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,930
As the old saying goes,

563
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,070
the mantis stalks the cicada,

564
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,590
unaware of the oriole behind.

565
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,370
We can exploit their conflicts

566
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,440
and take them down one by one.

567
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,640
But Captain Luo,

568
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,680
you really do look old.

569
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,400
When we're together,

570
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,060
I feel like calling you uncle.

571
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,200
Boss.

572
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,150
Stop fooling around.

573
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,880
What's with this "Boss" stuff?

574
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,060
Let me know when you've made up your mind.

575
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,970
I've already lost so much.

576
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,620
We're even now.

577
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,570
I don't want to see you again.

578
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,220
This guy is very stubborn.

579
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,450
He won't betray us, will he?

580
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,320
He can't clear his name anymore.

581
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,400
Let's go.

582
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,510
The yachts at this temple fair

583
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,960
are the tools used by drug dealers
for transportation at sea.

584
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
So I think those yacht owners

585
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,840
might be involved as well.

586
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
We need to investigate them.

587
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Then I'll check on the yacht owners.

588
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,230
Okay.

589
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,140
And then,

590
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,800
about the driver who helped Liu Libo
transport drugs,

591
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,860
how is he doing now?

592
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,390
He hasn't passed the critical period yet.

593
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,590
But his identity has been confirmed.

594
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,350
It's Ma Yong.

595
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,500
Ma Yong?

596
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,800
Is it the same Ma Yong we arrested before?

597
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,190
Yes.

598
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,120
How did he get involved in this too?

599
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,070
Ma Yong...

600
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,920
So now we can basically confirm

601
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,250
that the person
behind Liu Libo is Tang Du.

602
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,760
And the person behind Ma Yong

603
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,020
is very likely
that drug cook Luo Yuansu.

604
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:26,710
Well,

605
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,750
check Ma Yong's phone number

606
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,730
to see who he contacts frequently.

607
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,030
I'll look into it.

608
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,860
Duozai.

609
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,400
You're finally back.

610
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,110
I thought I wouldn't make it back either.

611
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,390
Duozai.

612
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,360
I don't know why

613
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,940
things turned out this way.

614
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,680
We were afraid
you'd turn yourself in.

615
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,250
So we put on an act and deceived you.

616
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,280
They told us

617
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,320
we could get a million if it worked out.

618
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,670
I trusted you so much!

619
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,540
But you

620
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,860
tricked me into being a mule.

621
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:32,950
A mule!

622
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,750
I'm sorry.

623
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,590
It's all our fault.

624
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,630
After you left, we deeply regretted it.

625
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,300
Duozai.

626
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,000
We couldn't even eat.

627
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,930
Uncle Ma asked me to give you this.

628
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,520
What for?

629
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,150
If I had died,
what would I have needed money for?

630
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:57,920
Duozai,

631
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,400
it wasn't like that.

632
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Both of us thought

633
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,330
you couldn't come back from Xinji.

634
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,030
Uncle Ma volunteered to make the delivery.

635
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,400
He said after this job was done,

636
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,790
we could bring you back.

637
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,360
We thought we could
take the money and leave,

638
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,420
never having to live like this again.

639
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,710
It really wasn't like that.

640
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,030
I don't know what to do.

641
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,340
I really don't know.

642
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,590
I really don't know what to do.

643
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,400
Duozai, hit me.

644
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,110
Hit me.

645
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,000
Hit me, hit me!

646
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,200
Which hospital is he in?

647
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:36,730
What?

648
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,810
Which hospital is he in?

649
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,290
I need to claim his body!

650
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,230
I'll check right now.

651
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,730
Captain Luo.

652
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,510
This is Ma Yong's phone.

653
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,170
It contains his call records.

654
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,090
[All]

655
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,400
The person he contacted most is this

656
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:00,920
"Zai".

657
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,450
It's Ma Yong's son,

658
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,110
whose full name is Ma Duozai.

659
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,150
His son.

660
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,550
Ma Duo...

661
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,370
Isn't Ma Duozai the one

662
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,870
involved in the case

663
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,240
with Gold-Tooth Wan?

664
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,760
We've been looking for him

665
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,940
and Mou Jiahao,

666
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,500
but haven't found them yet.

667
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,870
If Ma Yong is connected to Luo Yuansu,

668
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,360
then Ma Duozai as his son

669
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,020
must know something about it.

670
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,920
Ma Yong is in the hospital now.

671
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,800
Can we use this situation

672
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,000
to draw out Ma Duozai?

673
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,400
It's possible.

674
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,810
We can try.

675
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,930
Then you make the call.

676
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,760
Hello, are you a family member of Ma Yong?

677
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,190
Who's calling?

678
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,760
Mr. Ma Yong

679
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,960
is currently undergoing
emergency treatment at the No.2 Hospital.

680
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,550
He hasn't passed the critical period yet.

681
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,010
We hope his family can come
to the hospital as soon as possible.

682
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,550
What happened to him?

683
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,670
Something's wrong?

684
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,240
Yes,

685
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,460
but the situation doesn't look good.

686
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,600
I'm out of town and can't make it.

687
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,350
The patient's condition is very serious.

688
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,010
We hope you can return quickly

689
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,480
to see him one last time.

690
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,600
There's no need.

691
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,640
Isn't he your father?

692
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:47,290
What kind of father is he?

693
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,660
He never fulfilled
his responsibilities as a father.

694
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,510
Please just handle it yourselves,

695
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,110
thank you.

696
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:55,800
You...

697
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,480
Call again.

698
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,370
It's turned off.

699
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,630
That's too heartless.

700
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,220
Not even seeing his father one last time?

701
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,100
Are you crazy, Duozai?

702
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,930
Didn't you hear? Uncle Ma is still alive.

703
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,190
Don't you want to see him one last time?

704
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,390
That must have been the police just now.

705
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,190
How could the hospital
possibly take his phone

706
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,290
to call me?

707
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,450
What should we do now?

708
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,530
I need to see him.

709
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,750
No matter what, I have to see him.

710
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,760
I'll help you.

711
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,640
Uncle Yang said

712
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:45,360
Ma Yong is a good-for-nothing

713
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,400
who's always in debt and selling stuff.

714
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,070
Duozai has wanted
to leave him for a long time.

715
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,460
But that's his father

716
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,880
who raised him.

717
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:55,180
These thugs have no feelings left.

718
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:56,670
Alright, stop gossiping.

719
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,940
It doesn't help with the case.

720
00:43:59,110 --> 00:43:59,760
Let's check

721
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,420
Ma Duozai's

722
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,110
location first.

723
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,480
Maybe not being in Nanzhou
is just an excuse.

724
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,380
I'll go check.
