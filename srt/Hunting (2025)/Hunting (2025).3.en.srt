00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,070
Thank you.

191
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,000
You're welcome.

193
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,070
What do we do with this stuff?

194
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,000
Destroy it.

195
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,560
What are you doing?

196
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,290
Give it to me.

197
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,150
Give it to me!

198
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,860
Hear me out!

199
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,910
Do you know how expensive this is?

200
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,870
It's worth a lot of money.

201
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,820
Are you crazy?

202
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,870
Instead of money,

203
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,070
it'll bring us death!

204
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,040

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,190
Aren't we in need of money right now?

208
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:16,960
We don't have to sell it now.

209
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,910
Let's just keep it.

210
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,670
What if it comes in handy later?

What are you talking about?

215
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,390
Give it to me!

216
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,720
It's not like I'll use the drugs
right away.

How are we going to make money?

222
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,320
First, tell us

223
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,750
who stole your car.

224
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
What car?

225
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The SUV whose license plate is 95998.

226
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,910
Isn't it yours?

227
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,390
It's not mine.

228
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,170
Then why did you chase after it?

229
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,020
Xin Chuanyong, listen up.

230
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,960
You'd better behave.

231
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,290
Refusing to own up won't get you anywhere.

232
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,720
Fine.

233
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,170
Let's put that car aside

234
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,630
and change the subject.

235
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,630
We found some pink crystalline powder

236
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,620
in your office.

237
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,120
You know that, don't you?

238
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,220
I don't know

239
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,780
anything

240
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,920
about the car

241
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,550
and the goods you've mentioned.

242
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,700
You must've caught the wrong guy.

243
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,600
Didn't you say

244
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
they came to you for your goods?

245
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,510
Those goods must've been in the car.

246
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,110
Otherwise, why would you have
chased after it?

247
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,070
You were in the middle of a transaction,

248
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,700
when someone intercepted the goods, right?

249
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,200
Don't try to intimidate me.

250
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,170
I know the cops' tactics.

251
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,990
What crystalline powder?

252
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,620
I just run a car dealership.

253
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,200
Many people visit my place every day.

254
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,060
How am I supposed to know them all?

255
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,440
Some have their pet peeves.

256
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,240
How can you decide a random thing

257
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,430
you picked up at my place is mine?

258
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,310
On what grounds did you arrest me?

259
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,920
Illegal possession of controlled knives

260
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,740
and assaulting an officer
were reason enough to arrest you!

261
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,470
You're not getting out of here.

262
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,960
I demand a medical examination.

263
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,200
I need to see a doctor!

264
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
She kicked me in the groin.

265
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,240
It's hurting!

266
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,119
I'm in terrible pain now.

267
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,569
Get him a check-up.

268
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,160
[Case Processing Area]

269
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,069
Xin Chuanyong denied losing his car

270
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,750
and kept claiming
that Zhi'an had injured him,

271
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,740
with all that shouting and yelling.

272
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,240
He also pretended to be sick and dizzy.

273
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,160
What a weasel.

274
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,350
This is a good thing.

How is it a good thing?

276
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,450
Use your brain. Think about it.

277
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,240
Wait,

278
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,640

279
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,370
I cracked it!

280
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,630
Cracked what?

281
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
What did you find?

282
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,720
I found some records

283
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,380
in Xin Chuanyong's notebook.

284
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,970
Chaiju 200.

285
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,000
CT Troublemaker 2.

286
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,340
Dilly Dally 0.1.

287
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,590
Chaiju refers to

288
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,720
an old wizard in the 709 World.

289
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,270
CT Troublemaker is also a character

290
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,440
in a dungeon of the 709 World.

291
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,070
It's a fire dragon,

292
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,680
with an ugly appearance of a fish,

293
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,880
plus a pair of shrimp claws.

294
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,510
Dilly Dally is a voluptuous girl.

295
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,200
I got it!

296
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,240
They're using game characters

297
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,440
to represent themselves.

298
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,970
Exactly.

299
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,920
Let's say Xin Chuanyong

300
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,030
uses the characters from the 709 World

301
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,440
to refer to real people.

302
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,520
For example,

303
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,350
the old wizard may be Mou Haidong.

304
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,240
Then, "Chaiju 200" is probably

305
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,390
equal to saying

306
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,440
the old wizard Mou Haidong

307
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,510
has 100 kg of drugs in total.

308
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,840
It all matches the previous information.

309
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,130
Zhi'an's deduction

310
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,110
makes sense.

311
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,450
I think

312
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,440
the game jargon written in the notes

313
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,240
is all related to drug trafficking.

314
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,750
"Dilly Dally 0.1"

315
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,830
probably means

316
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,440
he has sold 0.1 kg of drugs

317
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,350
to a woman.

318
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,350
Right.

319
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,640
That's a good guess.

320
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,590
However,

321
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,790
it's all a theory.

322
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,350
We still need solid evidence,

323
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,900
don't we?

324
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,720
Now,

325
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,920
let's have a new review

326
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,030
on all of Xin Chuanyong's
social connections

327
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,640
and find clues as soon as possible.

328
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,030
Shall we?

329
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,310
Everyone, let's get started.

330
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,370
Hold out the files.

331
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,590
Has that watcher of yours

332
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,900
already turned you in?

333
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,740
Before the cops get hold of the goods,

334
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,550
he'll keep his mouth shut.

335
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,160
Sen,

336
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,870
think about the goods he had.

337
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,070
They're enough to get him a sentence.

338
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,130
God knows if he can make it out of jail.

339
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
Suppose

340
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,960
he doesn't turn us in to the police,

341
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,280
we can't get the goods back anyway.

342
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,790
If you had that many goods in your hands,

343
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,000
would you let yourself go to prison?

344
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,880
Of course not.

345
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,160
I'm not a dunderhead.

346
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,500
What would you do then?

347
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,070
Flee.

348
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,770
If I can't, then I'll fight.

349
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Go stand ready.

350
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,880

00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,050
I'd rather not say,

750
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,860
to avoid shedding tears.

751
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,480
Hao.

752
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,250
Where are you?

753
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,030
Anything wrong?

754
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,670
No big deal.

755
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,450
Mr. Zhen.

756
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,890
Thank you.

757
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,630
Are you free

758
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,560
after lunch?

759
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,830
Yes.

760
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:38,720
Well,

761
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,810
then join me in a little project.

762
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
A little project?

763
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,840
Let's go for it.
