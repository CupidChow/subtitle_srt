00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,200
I'm pregnant now.

385
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,430
You can't detain me.

386
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,310
We'll detain who needs to be detained.

387
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:49,960
Let me tell you.

388
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,240
Even though you're pregnant,

389
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
you can't escape legal punishment.

390
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,050
He deceived me.

391
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:58,620
Li Haixing,

392
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,330
if you don't want your child to be born,

393
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,160
only to face a mother in prison,

394
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,500
I advise you to cooperate with us.

395
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,700
You may have a chance to redeem yourself.

396
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,890
Where is Mou Sen?

397
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,630
I don't know.

398
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,910
Last chance.

399
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,090
I really don't know.

400
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,590
He didn't tell me anything.

401
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,160
How would I know he was committing crimes?

402
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
How would I know he was making drugs?

403
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,960
He deceived me,

404
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,200
and then abandoned me.

405
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,410
Go arrest him!

406
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,350
That attitude is unnecessary.

407
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,000
Why are you bullying me?

408
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,130
Stalling isn't helping you.

409
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,920
-Let me tell you again, Li Haixing.
-What’s the point of bullying me?

410
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,850
Why are you targeting me like this?

411
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,100
Why are you doing this?

412
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,280

413
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,240

415
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,520
What's happening?

416
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,160
She's getting quite emotional.

417
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,020
Please wait outside for a moment.

418
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,980

Calm down.

420
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,830
I'll go get a doctor.

421
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,240
This is a hospital.

422
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,310
You two

423
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,160
should be mindful of your influence.

424
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,350
When she gets too emotional,

425
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,150
she could easily miscarry.

426
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,800
There could be many adverse reactions.

427

That's the rule.

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,040
The Mou family has many illegitimate kids.

440

441
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,430

She's not stable.

There's some bleeding.

465
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,490

471
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,050
to the market to buy oranges.

472
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,290
The vendor told me

473
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,890
his oranges were very sweet.

474
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640

Do you understand?

527
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,760
Stop the car.

528
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,690
You deceived my sister,

529
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,640

00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,280
Are you even human?

534
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,080
Of course I'm trying to save her.

535
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,800

00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,760

00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,190
Are we still afraid of death?

544
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,640
Duozai, are you afraid of death?

545
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,900
I used to gamble.

546
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,870
Now it's drugs.

547
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,670

Mou Sen,

564
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,440
you're too selfish.

565
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,190
You don't care about anyone.

he'll do the same to us someday.

569
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,930
Tell me,

570

are you planning to run away alone?

571

Let's go back and find a clinic

574
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,580
to get her settled.

575
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,400
It's better than taking her with us

576
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,600
to the Platinum Road.

577
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,070
Mou Sen,

578
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,510
listen carefully.

579
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,440
If my sister

580
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,070
gets hurt in any way,

581
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,140
I'll kill you and make you pay.

Captain Yang,

584
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,380
Mai Jiamin just called her brother

585
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,410
in the car

586
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,080
and told him she has escaped.

587
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,840
Copy that.

588
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,550
You withdraw first.

589
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,090
OK.

590
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,080
Do you think they'll come?

591
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,840
Mai Jiamin is pregnant,

592
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,030
so they probably will.

593
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,760
If they come, do we arrest them?

594
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,260
There are too many options.

595
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,520
It gives me a headache.

596
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,610
You have moments of indecision?

597
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,360
Hello, Chief Fang.

598
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,160
How's the situation?

599
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,010
The targets haven't shown up yet.

600
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,410
I'm under a lot of pressure from above

601
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,140
for approving this operation.

602
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,320
Success is the only option.

603
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,840
Failure is not acceptable.

604
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,480
Don't worry.

605
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,740
If I fail, I'll resign.

606

Be sure to stay safe.

607
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,680
I know.

608
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,040
Why don't you ask Chief Fang for advice?

609
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,890
I thought about it.

610
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,590

Are you stupid?
