Hello, Uncle.

Duozai,
whom I introduced to you last time,

24
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,310
has he arrived at your place?

25
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,120
No.

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,159
You said he'd come yesterday.

27
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,220
I waited all day but nobody showed up.

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,480
Okay, I see.

Sorry for the trouble, Uncle.

What are you doing?

46
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,560
Your place is small,

47
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,820
but it has everything.

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,310
But my stuff

54
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,159
must be tailored to the specific time,

57
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,430
Nanzhou is a coastal city.

58
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,020
It's windy,

59
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,650
but doesn't get much rain.

60
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,310
So it's drier than other cities.

The ratio of ingredients in my stuff

is different every time.

65
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,920
It's to give customers

67
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,580
Of course, adding meth

68
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,669

neither of them was seen again.

98
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,790
It doesn't look like he was carsick.

That's right.

100
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,130
It's not carsickness.

101
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,360
If it were carsickness,
he wouldn't be unable to stand.

102
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,720
It's clearly Four-Eyes Hao's plan.

yet others we must accept.

152

155
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,750
Andy is the biggest boss
of the Platinum Road.

156
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,680
The biggest one.

157
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,390
So you allowed Duozai

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,190
to venture back to Mou Sen's side

159
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,600
just to get information about Andy?

160
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,130
I didn't.

161
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,670
Why did you give him advice?

162
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,930
What advice did I give?

163
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
Can you calm down?

164
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,390
I told him not to go to Mou Sen.

165
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,150
Mou Sen is dangerous.

166
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,680
Besides,

167
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,600
Mou Sen contacted him,

168
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,270
what does that have to do with me?

169
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,000
You're withholding information,
you know?

170
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,630
Duozai is missing,
and his whereabouts are unknown.

171
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,550
You must
take full responsibility for this.

172
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,790
Why should I take full responsibility?

173
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,850
Zhi'an, calm down.

174
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,510
Captain Yang...

175
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,120
He's not Captain Yang anymore.

176
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,720
Fine.

177

Yipeng

178
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,630
might not know

179
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
that Mou Jiahao would set up Duozai,

180
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,360
Really?

181
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,120
I did follow Duozai to find Four-Eyes Hao.

182
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,750
But what I thought was

183
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,790
if I followed Four-Eyes Hao,

184
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,960
I could find out where Mou Sen was.

185
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,480
I never thought he would betray Duozai.

186
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,360
If there was anything about Duozai,

187
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,600
you should have
reported to the team immediately.

188
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,200
If I had known,

189
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,600
I would have stopped him.

190
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,890
Did Duozai come to you?

191
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,030

Duozai has his own ideas about this.

238
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,360
He's already decided

239
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,680
to return to Mou Sen.

240
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes.

241
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,800
I admit I said something to him,

242
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,000
which might have reminded him.

243
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,960
So when Andy contacted him,

244
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,290
he started his own plan.

245
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,910
Using the Platinum Road account

246
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,240
to lure Mou Sen into bringing him back.

247
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,830
So him being taken by Four-Eyes Hao

248
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,480

I'm telling you again, I didn't do it!

253
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240

258

how I could join them.

Well,

262
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,210

264
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,880

265

Once they see your sacrifice,

266
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,140
they will be deeply moved.

267
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,000
Then they would invite me

268
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,030

There's just one issue though.

276
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,880
Whether he can
make Mou Sen trust him again

277
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,740
depends on him.

278
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,880
But honestly,

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,840
Captain Liu, take your team

567
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,670
and enter through Anbei Lane first.

568
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,320
Get your people in position.

569
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,050
On my signal,

570
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,710
we'll neutralize the lookouts first.

571
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,110
Got it.

572
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,239
Alright,

573
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,190
Yipeng and I will go in first.

574
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,590
Zixian, your Team Two and Team Three

575
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,840
will coordinate the operation.

576
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,510
Understood.

577
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,150
Lin Qiong and Zhi'an,

578
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,080
be ready to move.

579
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,000
Okay.

580
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,550
Liang,

581
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,659
your Team Three

582
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,110
will coordinate with Team Two.

583
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,409
After SWAT neutralizes the lookouts,

584
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,230
wait for my orders.

585
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,830
All right.

586
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,710
Copy that.

587
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,550
Wait for my signal.

588
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:36,880
Okay.

589
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,480
Let's move.

590
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:37,880
Move.

591
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,139
Be careful.

592
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,699
How's it going?

593
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,210
Almost done.

594
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,909
Increase the dosage.

595
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,670
Okay.

596
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,480
Duozai, help me out.

597
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,800
You're too slow.

598
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,760
He finally decided to do it.

599
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,920
What do you think

600
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,320
about moving our factory to Nanzhou?

601
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,550
You don't actually believe him, do you?

602
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,480
That only Nanzhou
can produce top-quality product?

603
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,510
He's just trying to prove his worth

604
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,800
to save his own skin.

605
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,360
But I really do like it here.

606
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,590
Around Nanzhou,

607
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,360
there are several uninhabited islands

608
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,160
where we could build factories.

609
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,110
But I think the cook is dangerous.

610
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,710
He won't willingly be manipulated.

611
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,690
He and I are alike at heart—

612
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,540
we only care about ourselves.

613
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,140
What should we do then?

614
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,440
I like him.

615
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,610
You really like him?

616
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,960
You're jealous.

617
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,770
I like that obsessive look he gets
when he's cooking.

618
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,150
But you're different.

619
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,480
Once I figure out

620
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,000
how the Ancestral Hall stamps

621
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,320
are made,

622
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,960
I won't need him anymore.

623
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,570
I'll take care of him then.

624
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,630
Can you go down and check

625
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,160
if there's anything to eat.

626
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,820
What would you like to eat?

627
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,100
So, what are we eating?

628
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,600
I'll go buy some.

629
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,510
Move it!

630
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,890
Remember what I taught you?

631
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,440
Yes.

632
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,520
The reagent dosage
must be extremely precise.

633
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,730
Even the slightest deviation

634
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,680
will lead to failure.

635
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,000
Take this for drying.

636
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,270
After drying, this material

637
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,890
can spontaneously combust

638
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,280
and explode.

639
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,330
Let me do it.

640
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,490
Give it to me.

641
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,150
We just

642
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,590
have to wait.

646
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,960
You still write a will

647
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,160
before a mission now?

648
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,710
Of course I do.

649
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,320
It's a good tradition Wu started

650
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,650
that we need to carry on.

651
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,190
I let anyone who wants to write one.

652
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,840
Oh, come on.

653
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,760
You even make everyone write wills.

654
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,090
You're just throwing your weight around.

655
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,000
Don't talk nonsense.

656
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,260
How am I abusing power?

657
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,770
I only asked the ones who were willing to.

658
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,320
Besides, we all have to
face it eventually.

659
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,960
We all gotta go sometime.

660
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,590
What's there to be afraid of?

661
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,070
Right?

662
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,110
Just think,

663
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,170
on the day I retire,

664
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,840
I'll show these to my son

665
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,670
how brave and capable his dad was.

666
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,730
Don't you think so?

667
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,190
Would you stop going on about retiring?

668
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,520
You've still got several good years left.

669
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,840
Once we wrap up this case,

670
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,580
you'll be back as team leader.

671
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,370
No way I'm letting you lead me.

672
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880

673
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,920
Definitely not.

There's quite a few of us.

689
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,510
We'll have about ten people coming over.

690
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,640
We'll be there soon.

Captain Liu.

692
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,710
Captain Liu, we've basically identified

693
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,960
about a dozen people up there.

694
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,710

704
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:01,960
you're going?

We're on the final step.

706
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,610
All we have to do is wait.

708
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,160

Yes.

Once the solution cools down,

714
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,810
the stamps can be soaked in it.

715

759
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,840
Why did you kill him?

760
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,960
Why?

761
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,030
Why did you kill him?

00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,510
Go on, kill me!

00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,510
Bastard!

767
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,230
Watch out!

768
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:06,800
Brother!

769
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,030
Brother!

770
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:09,850
Brother!

771
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:12,570
Duozai!

772
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,330
Hao!

773
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,630
Hao!

774
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,380
-Don't move!
-Don't move!

775
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,150
Drop the stick!

776
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:29,810
Don't move.

777
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,380
-Don't move!
-Don't move!

778
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:33,630
You go that way.

779
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,000
Okay.

780
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:41,840
Duozai!

781
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,150
Brother!

782
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,460
Come out, you punk!

783
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:52,840

784
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,000

Come on!

787
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:10,960
Put the gun down!

788
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,550
Police!

789
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,640
Stay calm! Put the gun down!

790
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,710
Mou Sen!

791
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,280
You're all surrounded!

792
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,190
Come out!

793
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:19,920
Don't move!

794
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Or I'll shoot him!

795
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,960
You're all surrounded!
