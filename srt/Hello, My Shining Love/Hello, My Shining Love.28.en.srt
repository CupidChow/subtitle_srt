1
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,360
early

2
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,240
early

3
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,960
You'd better

4
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,160
I'll go first.

5
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,160
Where?

6
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
You'll find out later.

7
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,720
Let's go.

8
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,280
Is the white one nice?

9
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,720
good-looking

10
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,720
Look at the bangs.

11
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,000
He's a good girl.

12
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,000
It's good.

13
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,040
President Ji.

14
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,360
Get changed first.

15
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,800
good

16
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,160
Okay, thank you.

17
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,400
go

18
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,960
Don't be nervous later.

19
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
I'll take you riding.

20
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,840
Just relax.

21
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,760
And enjoy the scenery along the way.

22
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,400
You'll be fine.

23
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,000
good

24
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,040
Here is the white one.

25
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,920
go

26
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,800
go

27
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,560
Let's go.

28
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,160
Great. Wait for me.

29
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,960
That's great.

30
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,760
Good girl.

31
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,200
go

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,280
That's great.

33
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,600
Zimmer

34
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,960
Thank you.

35
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,080
I thought

36
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
It's just

37
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,400
A simple 520.

38
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,760
It's just a meal.

39
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
didn't expect

40
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,520
Your arrangement today.

41
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,520
I'm satisfied.

42
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,520
Actually,

43
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,760
You don't need any pomp.

44
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,640
And gifts.

45
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,400
The most important thing is the heart.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,520
I didn't expect I'm so old.

47
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,800
You can hold a white horse.

48
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,840
Take a walk by the sea.

49
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,000
So romantic.

50
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
What's wrong?

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
You're childish at your age.

52
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,040
But also a girl's heart and a princess's dream.

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,640
Look at you, every day,

54
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,680
In the workplace,

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,600
Each trying to cheat or outwit the other

56
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,480
Can still maintain the innocence.

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
It's worth it.

58
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,320
And I

59
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,280
I just want to be your strong fortress.

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,560
I've been waiting for this sincerity for you.

61
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,880
And pure.

62
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,480
I've heard it before.

63
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,280
The most romantic confession.

64
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,040
Do you like it

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,600
like

66
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,640
Working so hard every day.

67
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,520
From morning to night,

68
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,680
You can't rest for a moment.

69
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,280
Actually, I came out occasionally to enjoy the sea breeze.

70
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,360
Seems to be

71
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,480
It's a luxury.

72
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,240
You know what?

73
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,480
I always have a wish.

74
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,680
Is to live in nature.

75
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,680
When I get up in the morning,

76
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
I heard the birds singing.

77
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,720
It looks green.

78
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
When you look up, you can see the blue sky and white clouds.

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,280
Every day, she enjoys the sun.

80
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,760
To live slowly.

81
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,120
It's great.

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,480
Your wish.

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,840
I will help you realize them one by one.

84
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,080
Stop. Be good.

85
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,440
go

86
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,200
Sida

87
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,640
Why are you here?

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,480
Didn't you go to the movies?

89
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,240
Why are you here?

90
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,400
I thought about it.

91
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,320
It's better for me to work.

92
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,320
But the director and I

93
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,160
I've asked for a leave.

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,280
That you have something to do today.

95
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,040
Aren't you going to find Ruo?

96
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,120
That's right.

97
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,560
You didn't shoot my scene.

98
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,720
Why are you here?

99
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,960
I'm here to record a video for you.

100
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,840
Didn't you say that

101
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,040
Do you want to learn from me?

102
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
I'll share the content

103
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
Record them.

104
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm ready for you.

105
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,880
Thousand yarn.

106
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,360
Thank you.

107
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,040
You're so kind.

108
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
What you should do.

109
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,400
good

110
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,680
Stop

111
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,400
Knock off

112
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,280
director

113
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,320
Call it a day.

114
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,080
Star is here.

115
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,400
Sida

116
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,120
director

117
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,880
Didn't you say you're off today?

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,520
I still want to come back to study.

119
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,960
Alright.

120
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,800
It's early today.

121
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,520
Let's have dinner together.

122
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,240
Let's have a drink.

123
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,160
director

124
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,120
Today, Star is still

125
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,720
What about other things?

126
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,280
I can't go.

127
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,800
It's nothing.

128
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,760
I'm done.

129
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,320
We can get together.

130
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,920
Then, I'm going too.

131
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,400
It's 520.

132
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,880
The crowd is lively.

133
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,040
good

134
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,800
go

135
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,040
I'll go too.

136
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,640
Zihao

137
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,560
You said you didn't like it very much.

138
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,840
Live together?

139
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,400
I'm bored by myself.

140
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,920
Why don't you be bored with everyone?

141
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,720
Easy to go

142
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,800
go

143
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,920
What's up

144
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,800
Nothing?

145
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,040
I just think this day

146
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,920
It's unreal.

147
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,560
It should mean

148
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
When I met you,

149
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,280
It doesn't feel real.

150
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,160
Since I met you,

151
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,720
All this happened.

152
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,800
So many accidents.

153
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,800
I thought

154
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,440
You're so old.

155
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,680
Everything is smooth.

156
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,680
It's rare to see

157
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,960
A throbbing feeling.

158
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,360
But when I met you,

159
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,240
accident

160
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,640
Throbbing heart beat

161
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,400
They all came together.

162
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,440
Do you remember

163
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,240
I owe you a sunrise?

164
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,400
Do you remember

165
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,320
I was actually awake that day.

166
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,800
Because my heart

167
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,080
Is beating fiercely.

168
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,440
To dance for you.

169
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,040
I watched the sunrise alone that day.

170
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,480
But it's weird.

171
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,000
Then I found that

172
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,400
sunrise

173
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,320
We need two people to watch it together.

174
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,080
That's why I'm good.

175
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,440
I didn't see the sunrise.

176
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,240
Watching the sunset is the same.

177
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,680
Look how beautiful the sunset is.

178
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,679
What are you thinking?

179
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,480
Thinking about you.

180
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,520
I'm right here.

181
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,559
I'm still thinking about you.

182
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,000
Now I finally understand

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
What you're talking about,

184
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,960
It's not real anymore.

185
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,360
Because I want it so much.

186
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,240
So I was afraid of losing it.

187
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,240
If a man

188
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,640
Are you willing to

189
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,240
I will.

190
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,280
I haven't said it yet.

191
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
How do you know what I want to ask?

192
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,520
But I heard it.

193
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,800
I heard your heart talking.

194
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,320
Zimmer

195
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,680
I like you.

196
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Let's fall in love.

197
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,680
The director sang well.

198
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,120
pleasant to hear

199
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,160
You're amazing.

200
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,640
The director is amazing.

201
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,720
Director, here's to you.

202
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,480
Thank you for

203
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,280
To take care of me.

204
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,680
Then you have to do it.

205
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,440
Drink less.

206
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,880
Si Da, stop drinking.

207
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,680
Drink more. You'll feel worse later.

208
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,200
Listen up, everyone.

209
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm Star's assistant.

210
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,760
From now on,

211
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Whoever wants to drink, come to me.

212
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,840
To drink with me.

213
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
I'm telling you,

214
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,000
I can drink more than Star.

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,880
It looks good.

216
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,920
Alright.

217
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,920
It's done.

218
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,520
What do you think?

219
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,120
You're amazing.

220
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,880
That's amazing.

221
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,280
It tastes good. I can't tell.

222
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,520
Come on. Let's continue.

223
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,480
Thank you for

224
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,280
The care of Star.

225
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,240
Thank you.

226
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,600
What are you doing?

227
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,360
Let go of me.

228
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm going back to find Star.

229
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,520
Get out of the way.

230
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,880
Can you please stop talking to Star?

231
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,800
To play the clown.

232
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,480
It makes you look stupid.

233
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,040
So what?

234
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
As long as Star is happy,

235
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,480
I don't care what others think.

236
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,280
Sida

237
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,560
Why did you bring me here?

238
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
You used to love

239
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,600
Playing bars?

240
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,680
You've been under too much pressure recently.

241
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,600
As your doctor,

242
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,520
I should take you to relax.

243
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,200
Sit down

244
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,880
doctor

245
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,960
So you just

246
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,160
As a doctor.

247
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,480
You brought me here to relax?

248
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,520
Actually, I want to

249
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,280
Really?

250
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,480
That's right.

251
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,920
As a doctor.

252
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
It's so hot.

253
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,360
I'm not feeling well recently.

254
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,520
The air conditioner is blowing on you.

255
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,400
Don't catch a cold.

256
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,640
Liquor

257
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,120
Have a drink.

258
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,600
Drink it.

259
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,240
Be happy.

260
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,960
Be happy.

261
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,040
Let me relax, right?

262
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,080
good

263
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,160
Sorry, sorry.

264
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,360
Sorry, sorry.

265
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,160
What are you doing?

266
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,480
I want you to relax.

267
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,520
You're hugging and hugging her.

268
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,280
What are you doing?

269
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,520
Or you can hug me.

270
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,720
to have no strength

271
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,600
I'll hug you.

272
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,720
What's up

273
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,680
Be happy.

274
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,760
drink

275
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,920
I can still drink it.

276
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,160
you

277
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,880
Don't let Si Da drink it.

278
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,800
I'll drink his wine.

279
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,760
Fool

280
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,800
As silly as me.

281
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,280
Okay, director.

282
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,360
I'll take care of it.

283
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,280
Received, received.

284
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,520
Miss Hui.

285
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
You're also in this drama.

286
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,600
Yes, you are free today.

287
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,320
To see Si Da.

288
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,520
Take care of Star.

289
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,560
No problem.

290
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,960
Today,

291
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,880
Is there any happy news?

292
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,640
You're so happy.

293
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,720
secret

294
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,320
Okay, I'm busy.

295
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,600
Sida

296
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,040
How are you doing?

297
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,720
sister

298
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,400
Why are your dark circles so deep?

299
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,840
Let the makeup artist come.

300
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll sort it out for you.

301
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,520
Thousand yarn.

302
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,280
It's okay.

303
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,440
Or

304
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,320
Check the lines with me.

305
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,560
Sure. Come on.

306
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,120
this

307
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,240
Which one?

308
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
This is the one.

309
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,440
Are we going to shoot now?

310
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,200
27 episodes are right.

311
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,000
Okay, let's start.

312
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,120
You have no right to see her now.

313
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,800
She doesn't want it at all.

314
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
To see you again.

315
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,040
What if I have to see her?

316
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,960
It said that

317
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,400
You should be tougher.

318
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,480
So I feel

319
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,640
It's not right.

320
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,400
Do you want to try one?

321
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,240
A little tougher.

322
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,320
Be tougher.

323
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,040
good

324
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,240
What if I have to see her?

325
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,240
She has nothing to do with you now.

326
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,120
You are nothing to her.

327
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,000
good

328
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,840
I'll ask you one last question.

329
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,840
Go ahead.

330
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,120
Are you with him?

331
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,360
No, I got the wrong word.

332
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,320
sister

333
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,560
You and Jimo

334
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,600
Are you together?

335
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,520
That's right.

336
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
We are together.

337
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,120
You're one of us.

338
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
I told you.

339
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,080
Zimmer and I are in a relationship.

340
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,760
Eight Diagrams

341
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,960
What about the next one?

342
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,360
If it's gone,

343
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,920
That's it.

344
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,960
Finished

345
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,120
Thank you.

346
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,720
What's up

347
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,760
That may be coming.

348
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,680
I'll go first.

349
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,680
Thank you, sister.

350
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,120
Thousand yarn.

351
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,720
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

352
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,520
come

353
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,680
Take a sip of water.

354
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,160
Thank you

355
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,680
I'm fine.

356
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,120
I was drinking last night.

357
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,400
My head hurts a bit.

358
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
My head hurts.

359
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,560
Shall I take you to the hospital?

360
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm not going.

361
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,480
What if I go to Star?

362
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,600
By the way, I have the antidote.

363
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,400
And took the medicine.

364
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,360
My head won't ache anymore.

365
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,120
What are you taking?

366
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,440
Let me take you to the hospital.

367
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,040
I'm not going.

368
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,280
It's so cold.

369
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
If Sida can't find me,

370
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,000
What should I do?

371
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,200
Who will dress him?

372
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,480
Who brought him hot water?

373
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:08,599
Nothing

374
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,160
If it's not Shen Qiansha, how can I be happy?

375
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,160
How could I?

376
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,079
You are such an idiot.

377
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,560
I don't want to be on the set today.

378
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,280
When I saw you,

379
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,319
Or I'll stop acting.

380
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,359
If I don't show up,

381
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,880
Star is also a scene. Don't think about it.

382
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,280
Don't worry.

383
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,640
director

384
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,720
I remember the last time

385
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,240
Do you like to drink milk tea?

386
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Black coffee.

387
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,080
Wake up.

388
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,960
Yes, I went to bed late last night.

389
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,040
Coffee is good.

390
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,920
Thank you for your hard work.

391
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,800
The leading man is still acting.

392
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,720
What are you waiting for?

393
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,520
In position.

394
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,200
Zihao, this way.

395
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,600
to do sth more quickly

396
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,400
To fix your makeup.

397
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,920
Hurry up.

398
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,400
Then I'll leave.

399
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,320
Get ready

400
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,840
We'll leave when we're done.

401
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Get ready.

402
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,960
Boot up

403
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,480
Five, four, three, two.

404
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,840
I'm not here to see you today.

405
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,440
Where is Xiao Guo?

406
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,640
You have no right to see her.

407
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,840
Does it look like you?

408
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,160
Are you like us?

409
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,040
What if I insist on seeing her?

410
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
There's no other way.

411
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,240
What are you doing?

412
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,680
Stop fighting.

413
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,720
Stop fighting.

414
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,320
Zihao

415
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,440
Stop fighting. Stop it.

416
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,400
Stop fighting.

417
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,840
Stop fighting.

418
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,600
Star Wars.

419
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,600
What are you doing?

420
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,360
What's going on?

421
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,600
Do you want to shoot?

422
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,800
I just don't like him.

423
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,520
it doesn't matter

424
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,120
Anyway, I'm used to being a bad guy.

425
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,720
I'm telling you,

426
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,200
You're not a good person.

427
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,920
How can you bully a woman?

428
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,720
Are you alright?

429
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Where did he hit you?

430
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,200
Hands!

431
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,880
Where is your face?

432
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,560
No,

433
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,040
Zihao

434
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,080
Did you just

435
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,160
A little too much.

436
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,800
If the media sees it,

437
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,280
I have to go to the public relations.

438
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,400
go

439
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't bother me.

440
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,680
Songzihao

441
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,600
Why are you here?

442
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,880
I told you to go back and rest.

443
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,040
Why did you hit Star?

444
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,120
The plot needs

445
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,400
You're talking nonsense.

446
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
I've read the script.

447
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,280
It's a play you added.

448
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,640
Go and apologize to Star.

449
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,800
Apologize to her.

450
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,960
Why should I apologize to him?

451
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,320
He is the one who should apologize.

452
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,760
He didn't take you

453
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,360
to pay attention to

454
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,520
I don't care about you at all.

455
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,440
Are you still willing to

456
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,600
And was ordered by him.

457
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,960
Are you out of your mind?

458
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,360
What's wrong with you?

459
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,200
This is my business.

460
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,240
Don't bother.

461
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
You like him so much.

462
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,000
that's right

463
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,360
That's how I like him.

464
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,800
No matter how he treats me,

465
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,400
I'm willing to treat him well.

466
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,080
What about me?

467
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,920
you

468
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,640
If you apologize to Star,

469
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,400
Make sure that

470
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,680
Never do that to him again.

471
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,680
that

472
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,360
I'll think about it.

473
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,400
To be your friend.

474
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,920
Are you...

475
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
And figure out the situation.

476
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,600
Who wants to be your friend?

477
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,080
Shen Qiansha.

478
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,320
I don't want to be your friend.

479
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,960
I like you.

480
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,560
Listen carefully. I like you.

481
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,160
I just can't bear it.

482
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,920
Star did that to you.

483
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,320
Because I like you.

484
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,480
I feel bad for you

485
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,520
Thousand yarn.

486
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,240
Be my girlfriend.

487
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,920
you

488
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,680
What's wrong with you?

489
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,880
What's wrong with you?

490
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
I'm telling you,

491
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,640
We can't even

492
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,400
Can't be done.

493
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,760
I'm Song Zihao.

494
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,480
How many women want to be my girlfriend?

495
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
I just confessed my love to you.

496
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,720
How dare you scold me?

497
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,560
It's not Shen Qiansha.

498
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,000
Are you out of your mind?

499
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,760
I

500
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,560
Did you hurt your hand?

501
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,360
Let me have a look.

502
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,480
No,

503
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,920
Is something bothering you?

504
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,160
No.

505
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,240
When you were shooting,

506
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,440
The condition is not right.

507
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,560
You've been out of your mind.

508
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,480
I was fine this morning.

509
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,240
What's up

510
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
I thought

511
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
You'll be busy with your relationship.

512
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,120
You won't bother me at work.

513
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,560
How could it be?

514
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,200
You are my real brother.

515
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,280
Even if I go into a relationship,

516
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,960
I won't leave you alone.

517
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,880
Why aren't there cotton buds?

518
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,600
I'll get it.

519
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,560
Don't go away.

520
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,120
But I don't want to

521
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,400
Only to be your brother.

522
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,080
Zhao Yucheng.

523
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,120
I have something to tell you.

524
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,760
Ruonan and I are already together.

525
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,320
She's my girlfriend now.

526
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,760
So you want to tell me

527
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,200
If a man is like Su Xiao,

528
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
You misjudged him.

529
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,520
If you want to say that,

530
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,720
I have no choice.

531
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,560
Frankly,

532
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,280
I don't think you can give Ruonan

533
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Bring happiness.

534
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,440
Because you must be

535
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,360
When I was with Su Xiao,

536
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,320
Is the same.

537
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,960
Give up halfway

538
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,040
It's because

539
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,680
I feel sorry for Su Xiao.

540
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,520
So I will treasure it more.

541
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,600
The relationship with Ruo Man

542
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,640
I won't let it happen again.

543
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,680
Do you feel sorry for Su Xiao?

544
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,360
But I made up for it.

545
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,480
The other women

546
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,600
What is this?

547
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,120
I don't understand, President Ji.

548
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,040
Or have you sent Su Xiao

549
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,640
I forgot it.

550
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,800
And forgot my promise to her.

551
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,520
Right?

552
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,800
It's time to finish.

553
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,640
You think it's time.

554
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,800
It's time to finish.

555
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,040
But I'm sorry.

556
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,320
I don't think so.

557
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,720
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

558
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,280
While you still have

559
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,560
If men and wings are fashionable,

560
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,840
Take a look.

561
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,240
Maybe soon,

562
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,200
It doesn't belong to you anymore.

563
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,640
Why are you so late?

564
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,840
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

565
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,760
Do you know

566
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,080
today

567
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,920
On the set,

568
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Song Zihao fought with Star.

569
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,880
Song Zihao, I'm not saying that

570
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,040
From the past to the present.

571
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,800
Tong Tong led him. I don't know.

572
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,760
How to cure his temper?

573
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,480
What's up

574
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
Let me hold him for a while.

575
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,800
I didn't hug her just now.

576
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,760
What? I think

577
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,480
You look tired today.

578
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,760
I feel tired.

579
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm running low on battery.

580
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,080
I'll charge it for a while.

581
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,680
Then I'm running the motor.

582
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,480
We need to charge.

583
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,480
Then you want a big mouth.

584
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,160
I didn't ask the lion to talk.

585
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,640
Just kiss me.

586
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,840
If a man

587
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,840
Thank you for not giving up on me.

588
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,640
I was going to give up.

589
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,240
You don't want to.

590
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,800
I'll sleep with you tonight.

591
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,640
I'll sleep with you tonight.

592
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,680
Carry me into the living room.

593
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,440
I don't want it. I want to hold it for a while.

594
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,320
I need to charge it.

595
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,280
to wait a moment

596
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,880
He said

597
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,000
We'll sleep together tonight.

598
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,440
To sleep with you.

599
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,600
What do you mean?

600
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,000
What do you mean?

601
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,360
Do you?

602
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,280
Do you want to go further?

603
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,320
How could I?

604
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,840
Am I so casual?

605
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,160
may not

606
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,400
No, no.

607
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:39,960
may not

608
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,880
I need to calm down.

609
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,160
I need to calm down.

610
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,800
I need to calm down.

611
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,680
I'm calm.

612
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,880
I can't calm down.

613
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,040
How can I calm down?

614
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,760
It's time

615
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,200
To use my uniform.

616
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,680
The uniform.

617
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,040
The uniform.

618
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,000
Where did I put it?

619
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,800
The uniform.

620
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,560
It's been a few days.

621
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,440
It's time for you to come back.

622
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,360
It's time for the martial arts.

623
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,160
The uniform.

624
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,720
I'm here. The uniform.

625
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,600
Good cooperation.

626
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,920
Never mind

627
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,080
There's still a chance next time.

628
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,720
Suxiao

629
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,880
Why are you here?

630
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,280
I know you're looking for me.

631
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,320
Do you have something to say to me?

632
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,320
I have a lot to say to you.

633
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,320
During your time away,

634
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,960
I've been living

635
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,160
Guilt

636
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,840
And blame yourself.

637
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,840
I dare not accept love.

638
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,320
I dare not.

639
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,440
To accept a new relationship.

640
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,160
Until I met her.

641
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,800
She asked me to change

642
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,080
Walking dead.

643
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,400
Has become alive.

644
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,400
Every day is no longer numb.

645
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,480
And self-torture.

646
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,600
But looking forward to tomorrow.

647
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,000
Suxiao

648
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,360
I always wanted to see you.

649
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,320
In front of you,

650
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,480
Say sorry.

651
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,080
I can't lie to myself anymore.

652
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,920
I fell in love with Dugu Ruuo Man.

653
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,120
If I don't say it,

654
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,800
Is disrespectful to her.

655
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,520
therefore

656
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,680
This is our last time

657
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,640
We met.

658
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,640
This is farewell.

659
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,960
Right?

660
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,120
It's time to say goodbye.

661
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,680
I'll put the past

662
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,000
to come and go

663
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,680
In my heart.

664
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,720
Keep going.

665
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,560
Suxiao

666
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,640
I will always remember you.

667
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,360
And the love you gave me

668
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,840
To love.

669
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,840
sorry

670
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,200
Thank you.

671
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,080
Bye

672
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,520
Leave now.

673
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,200
Zimmer

674
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,880
Don't worry. Go to love.

675
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,560
Suxiao

676
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,600
Suxiao

677
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,640
Suxiao

678
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,640
Suxiao

679
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,440
Don't worry. Go to love.

680
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,880
Thank you.

681
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,360
You're awake.

682
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,760
Thank you, Ruonan.

683
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,760
Why are you acting so crazy this morning?

684
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,880
Nothing?

685
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,360
I just slept for a while.

686
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,360
A lot easier.

687
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,160
I saw you slept so heavily yesterday.

688
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,120
I knew you must be tired.

689
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,840
I'm here to charge you.

690
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,480
I really want to get up every morning.

691
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,560
I can see you.

692
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,040
Hold you like this.

693
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,080
I'm not going to

694
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,160
I'm sleeping with you.

695
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,640
Last night,

696
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,800
Will you be disappointed?

697
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,160
What?

698
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,560
Look, I went to bed so early.

699
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,000
Nothing happened.

700
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,840
please!

701
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,760
Fill it up.

702
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,440
Fill it up.

703
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,400
How can I fix it?

704
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,360
President Ji.

705
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,920
come

706
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,640
Coffee

707
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,760
What about Thermantha?

708
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,280
In the past three years, not only his works are popular,

709
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,920
And has a personal design brand.

710
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,600
This is her.

711
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
It's mysterious.

712
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,480
And never showed up.

713
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,480
I can't find it online.

714
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,560
Any photo of her

715
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,840
Look at her work.

716
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,960
The brush strokes are sharp.

717
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,400
The color is wild.

718
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,560
She should be

719
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,400
And experienced.

720
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,679
Who has a story.

721
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,120
What a coincidence!

722
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,560
That's what I think.

723
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,920
When I first saw her work,

724
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,400
I think so too.

725
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm afraid it's too high-profile.

726
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,320
That's why I didn't say it.

727
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,960
Do you really understand?

728
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,199
understand

729
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,080
bar

730
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:42,960
Leave.

731
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,639
to do sth more quickly

732
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,040
Let's go.

733
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,880
Drink it while it's hot, Mr. Ji.

734
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,520
Hope that you are well

735
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,400
I'm back.

736
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,240
I never said that.

737
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
But when I met you,

738
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,920
From that moment,

739
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,560
I found that

740
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
Defeated by you.

741
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,840
I thought

742
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,000
The most painful thing.

743
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,120
Than you leaving me.

744
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,960
But now I know

745
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,480
but

746
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,840
But now,

747
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,720
but

748
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,960
But now,

749
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,320
But I just know

750
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,160
What hurts me the most

751
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
You're unhappy.

752
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,760
Love doesn't have to be obtained.

753
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,440
Let me silently

754
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,720
Stay by your side.

755
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,040
What are you talking about?

756
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,080
sister

757
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,760
When did you come?

758
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,640
I just came here.

759
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,080
Sister, have a seat.

760
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,640
Sida

761
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,600
Sida

762
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,840
What about this scene?

763
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,360
Is a confession scene.

764
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,320
It's you who played the character.

765
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,960
When the relationship is explosive,

766
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,440
So, when you're in a mood,

767
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,520
A lot more.

768
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,200
If so,

769
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,480
Can help you.

770
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,640
And help the scene.

771
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,600
OK!

772
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,640
sister

773
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,840
How did you do that?

774
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,960
Don't take the script.

775
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,880
You can use the lines

776
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,120
All of them.

777
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,920
Because I was

778
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,400
Read the script very carefully.

779
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,080
The role of Star

780
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,040
Every character in it.

781
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Every relationship,

782
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,120
Even in every scene,

783
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,280
I marked it.

784
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,000
He wanted to say that when he read the script,

785
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,800
To help him.

786
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,080
To find the state faster.

787
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,680
Sister, this is

788
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,120
It's even better than Star Wars.

789
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,600
It's detailed.

790
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,520
action

791
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,200
tone

792
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,160
It's too thick.

793
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,080
Although I didn't,

794
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,360
And stay on the crew every day.

795
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,400
But it doesn't mean that

796
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,600
I didn't work hard.

797
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,000
The other actors' lines.

798
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,640
I dare not say.

799
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
But Star's lines

800
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,680
I should be...

801
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,800
I can barely recite it.

802
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,440
By the way,

803
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,800
I want to be an actress.

804
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,160
Shen Qiansha, remember that.

805
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,880
Behind a professional artist,

806
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,640
There must be one.

807
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,880
Professional agent.

808
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,920
So in the future,

809
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,320
It's your turn to recite the lines.

810
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,840
Received

811
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,440
Take this script.

812
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Practice with him.

813
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,480
Don't worry, sister.

814
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,240
The one above

815
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,720
Yes, there are some marks.

816
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,840
Okay, come on.

817
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,440
Let's start with this sentence.

818
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,880
Almost.

819
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,800
Si Da, take a look for yourself.

820
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,360
Shen Qiansha, stop right there.

821
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Shen Qiansha, stop right there.

822
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,840
Don't run away from Shen Qiansha.

823
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,680
What should we do in the future?

824
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
Professional agent.

825
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,560
Down, down.

826
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,720
Don't get yourself killed.

827
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,400
Let me ask you something.

828
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,760
Why are you avoiding me?

829
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,080
Get out of the way.

830
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,680
You won't tell me why.

831
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,720
I won't let you go.

832
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,520
I've told you

833
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,360
Many times.

834
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,080
eldest brother

835
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,920
We're not friends anymore.

836
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,640
Excuse me.

837
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,000
Even if it's not a friend,

838
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,840
You wouldn't have seen me

839
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,800
Just run.

840
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,880
Shen Qiansha.

841
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,400
Why are you so ruthless to me?

842
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,600
You're a star.

843
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,120
There's no shortage of people who like you.

844
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
I'm not a friend.

845
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,320
Then Star needs you.

846
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,160
As a friend.

847
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,480
Why can he be your friend?

848
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,400
I can't.

849
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,680
Because I know

850
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,520
And the person you like.

851
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,560
How hard it is to be friends.

852
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,880
Although I don't like you,

853
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,680
but

854
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,120
I don't want you

855
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,400
As sad as me.

856
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,080
I'm willing to.

857
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm willing to

858
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,080
I feel pain and happiness.

859
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,920
I've fallen in love with you.

860
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,880
What do you care?

861
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,000
You and I...

862
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,240
I don't know.

863
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,120
Move out of my way

864
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,560
It's okay to not be friends.

865
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,320
If you are willing to give up Star,

866
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,320
I'll give up on you.

867
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,520
Song Zihao, are you really sick?

868
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,600
Why should I

869
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
To give up Si Da.

870
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,760
There's no other way.

871
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,120
I can only continue to like you.

872
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,280
What are you doing?

873
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,400
A gentleman never talks.

874
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,680
Shen Qiansha.

875
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,080
You really want to fight me?

876
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,000
Shen Qiansha.

877
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,320
You're really too stubborn.

878
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,040
I'm telling you,

879
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,080
Super star, Song Zihao.

880
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,720
You're so big.

881
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,880
Song Zihao, I'm warning you.

882
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,480
Stop liking me.

883
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,440
You have to say it once.

884
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,520
I'll hit you once.

885
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,600
I really like you.

886
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,360
You even said that

887
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,240
I like you. Why are you telling me?

888
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,120
I like you, say it again.

889
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,320
Shut up. I like you.

890
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,040
Shut up!

891
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,760
I love you

892
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,440
Stay by yourself.

893
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,480
I love you

894
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,240
Little girl.

895
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,680
Your legs are so short, you're running away.

896
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,520
How could I fall in love with her?

897
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,760
How about a silly woman?

898
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,640
Why didn't you go to the scene?

899
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,480
What should I do without my acting?

900
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,120
It's okay if it doesn't work.

901
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
Take a walk.

902
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,240
With the director.

903
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,640
About your fight,

904
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,920
It's not good.

905
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,280
There are rumors out there.

906
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,240
It's very powerful.

907
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,840
You have to find a way to make up for it.

908
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,200
I should do what I shouldn't.

909
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,240
Don't bother.

910
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,280
I don't care who you care about.

911
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Do you know?

912
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,560
Now the director

913
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,320
I've been acting for Star Wars every day.

914
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,960
With this addition,

915
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,880
Your leading role.

916
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,400
Will be taken away sooner or later.

917
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,480
Do you really want to be good to me?

918
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,200
Don't give me bad acting.

919
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,080
I know.

920
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,760
You have a grudge against me.

921
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,960
But it's not us now.

922
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,320
During the internal struggle,

923
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,760
Star is trying to steal the show every day.

924
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,560
We need to find a way to stop him.

925
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,720
It's better to have something unexpected.

926
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,920
To make the scene impossible.

927
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,720
I'm warning you.

928
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,040
Don't make such a bad idea.

929
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,040
I won't listen to you.

930
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,680
To play dirty tricks.

931
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,920
I'm dirty.

932
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,920
He's your competitor.

933
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,760
Because he is my opponent.

934
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,320
So I want to compete with him fairly.

935
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,520
I can't let Qiansha look down on me.

936
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,880
This time,

937
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,200
I want to win Star openly.

938
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,320
Shen Qian Yarn. She's fine.

939
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,240
Are you out of your mind?

940
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,400
Shen Qiansha is important.

941
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,680
Your career is more important.

942
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,880
My career

943
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,880
What you care about

944
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,960
Your own business.

945
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,240
You made me

946
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,920
To suppress Sindhi.

947
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,440
Is to

948
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,720
To deal with Dugu Ruuo Man?

949
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,240
Did you win?

950
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,720
I'm telling you,

951
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,160
People like you

952
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,240
I will never be able to defeat Dugu Ruuo.
