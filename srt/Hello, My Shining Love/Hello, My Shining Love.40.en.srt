1
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,400
That's it.

2
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,240
Thank you

3
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,000
Si Da, where were you yesterday?

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,320
Why can't I find you all day?

5
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,880
I went to sort it out.

6
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,800
Your relationship.

7
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm fine. Don't worry.

8
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,320
That's good.

9
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,600
The shooting is about to start.

10
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,720
Get ready.

11
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,400
The director added this yesterday.

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,960
The man's inner monologue.

13
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,840
Get familiar with it as soon as possible.

14
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,680
good

15
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,560
What you missed in life,

16
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,080
Are tiny as dust.

17
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,360
Sida

18
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,880
I gave you this yesterday.

19
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,160
The inner monologue on the title page.

20
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,520
What do you think?

21
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,760
Yes

22
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
Can I tell you something?

23
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,200
Of course I can.

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,440
Here's the thing.

25
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,840
I think the male lead at this time

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,880
The one you love.

27
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,280
Has left him.

28
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,600
What about this monologue?

29
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,160
It's more like he's

30
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,480
A farewell to love.

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,760
When a person decides to

32
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,840
When I put it down,

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,080
Actually, in his heart,

34
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,560
It's heavy.

35
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,600
And relieved.

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
What do you think?

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,040
You're right.

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
How about this?

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,560
After a while,

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,840
Just act according to your idea.

41
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,400
We're at the scene.

42
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,360
And try it on.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,960
Alright

44
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,720
Thank you, director.

45
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,000
I thought

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,800
love

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,760
Is to chase it with all your might.

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,280
Give her everything I can.

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,320
Later, I found that

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,280
And just give it away.

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,240
I will only give her

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,360
More damage.

53
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,040
love

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,520
Like a shadow.

55
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,600
time

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,880
Trailing

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,400
But I can't.

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,880
may

59
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,960
I

60
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,760
I never knew

61
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,160
What does she want?

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,560
I can't give it to you.

63
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,280
Can never give her what she wants.

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,440
I tried so hard to catch him.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,440
To catch up with him.

66
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,959
Is always further away.

67
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,400
More and more fragmented.

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,000
The shadow

69
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
It seems that I have no destiny.

70
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,880
It turns out that my love

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,400
Is reckless.

72
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,080
A direct chase.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
She must be tired.

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,960
therefore

75
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,320
I decided to let go of her.

76
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,640
I've decided to let go of her.

77
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,560
And let go of myself.

78
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,400
Stop

79
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,920
Sida

80
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,320
You did very well this time.

81
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,480
Just like yourself.

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,560
I experienced it myself.

83
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,760
It's amazing.

84
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,080
Thank you, director.

85
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,920
Not bad.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,480
Because it's not a performance.

87
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,200
Is my heart.

88
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,960
Sida

89
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,560
you

90
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,240
What I just said,

91
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
Is how you feel about Ruo.

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,880
Right?

93
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,160
Actually, my love

94
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,560
Is also a burden.

95
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,280
right or wrong?

96
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,320
Thousand yarn.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,040
I remember.

98
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,480
Someone once told me

99
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,200
Everyone's relationship

100
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,520
Are fated.

101
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,240
My relationship with my sister

102
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,880
Are doomed to meet.

103
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,600
And yours.

104
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,040
Your love.

105
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,440
It's never a burden.

106
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,360
But I can't respond to it.

107
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,920
sorry

108
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,960
sorry

109
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,160
As you can see,

110
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,800
The company's share price

111
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,080
The increase has exceeded that.

112
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,640
Five percent.

113
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,800
And the stock market has stabilized.

114
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,280
Follow-up work

115
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,480
Has been developed.

116
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,280
Please believe me.

117
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,320
We'll be back on track soon.

118
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,679
To end this storm.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,920
It's from Wing Fashion.

120
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,000
The board meeting.

121
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,840
Mr. Zhao came here rashly.

122
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,960
Is it inappropriate?

123
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,040
This is Mr. Xu and President Qian.

124
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,920
Equity transfer letter

125
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,800
Now I have

126
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,120
Ten percent of Wing Fashion.

127
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,000
Is the fourth largest shareholder of Wing Fashion.

128
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,040
So I personally think

129
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,520
Have the right to enter the board of directors.

130
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,160
And have the right to be a director.

131
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,680
Zhao Yusheng, you brought the wing fashion

132
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,920
As a place?

133
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,840
Don't try to interfere.

134
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,200
The internal affairs of our group

135
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Sorry

136
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,720
Has intervened.

137
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,360
Mr. Zhao,

138
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,400
As you can see,

139
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,800
You are not welcome here.

140
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,800
Even if you become the majority shareholder,

141
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,640
But if you want to stay here,

142
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,720
There's a place.

143
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,000
It's hard.

144
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,360
According to the bylaws of our group,

145
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,800
Even if you are the majority shareholder,

146
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,960
At least,

147
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,760
The proposal of three directors

148
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,280
So you can sit here.

149
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,120
Right, big guy?

150
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,040
That's right.

151
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Right, Ji?

152
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,520
good

153
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,440
I'll be the first one.

154
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,560
The person who proposed it.

155
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,200
President Qian, Chairman Xu,

156
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,640
What do you mean?

157
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,640
we

158
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,640
And support President Zhao.

159
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,560
What do you mean, Wang?

160
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,000
What did Zhao Yusheng give you?

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,840
You're helping him.

162
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,600
I have a bad memory.

163
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,920
Help me recall it.

164
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,360
You fell into a pit in 16.

165
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,320
When you can't get out,

166
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,400
And hanged himself.

167
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,480
Who saved you?

168
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,120
Tell everyone about it.

169
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,280
Who came to save you?

170
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,360
What we are discussing now

171
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,440
It's about the board of directors.

172
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,360
Okay?

173
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,480
So you dared to question me today.

174
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,400
good

175
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Since you

176
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
And some of you.

177
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,640
Don't take me as your brother.

178
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,880
Let's talk business.

179
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,160
A businessman.

180
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,840
You have to hurt yourself if you don't hurt yourself.

181
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,440
Everyone, the road is your own.

182
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,520
How do you want to go?

183
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,720
It's up to you.

184
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,960
But there's one thing.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Don't regret it.

186
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,960
Mr. Zhao.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,800
please

188
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,080
Zhao Yucheng.

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
What's your purpose?

190
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
There's no purpose.

191
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,880
To join the board? Isn't that

192
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
By the way, everyone,

193
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,560
I've done some research.

194
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,600
Personally, I think

195
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,000
The biggest problem of wing fashion

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,120
At the leadership level.

197
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,040
therefore

198
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm proposing as a shareholder.

199
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,240
To dismiss President Qi Mo.

200
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,440
To find someone else.

201
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,600
Zhao Yucheng.

202
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,080
You're on the board.

203
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,760
It's not yours.

204
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,720
The ultimate goal.

205
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,720
Of course

206
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,560
What are you doing?

207
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,520
And left you with nothing.

208
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,240
Since you want to play,

209
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,120
I'll play with you.

210
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,440
Even if you join the board,

211
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,880
I won't back down.

212
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,360
This is the best way.

213
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,480
Because I want to prove it to Ruonan.

214
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,240
Her choice is wrong.

215
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,280
I'm warning you.

216
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,960
From now on, I won't be punished

217
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,920
You're Su Xiao's brother.

218
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,160
And show mercy to you.

219
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,280
Whether it's men or wing fashion,

220
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,080
I will stick to the end.

221
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,280
Come on

222
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,240
President Ji.

223
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Your contribution to the group

224
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,360
We can see that

225
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,280
to observe

226
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,840
As long as we're here,

227
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,520
This group

228
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,720
I won't give it to him.

229
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,520
Don't worry.

230
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,640
I will support you.

231
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,960
Thank you.

232
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,160
Thank you.

233
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,760
And trust me.

234
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,880
In this way,

235
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
But there are 15 people in the group.

236
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,440
Permanent Directors

237
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,920
There are only seven here.

238
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,880
It's not 100%.

239
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,760
No

240
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,800
My relationship with Lord He

241
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,040
Is usually good.

242
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,200
Recently, I came to ask him to meet.

243
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,760
To talk about it.

244
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,920
We might be able to get him here.

245
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,440
We'll have eight votes.

246
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,400
Yes

247
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,520
And Director Zhu.

248
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,120
His position is also wavering.

249
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,040
We can have a try.

250
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,000
To Zhu.

251
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,880
I have a suitable candidate.

252
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,920
who

253
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,960
Old Wang.

254
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,960
Old Wang.

255
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,000
He must be Zhao Yu Cheng's man.

256
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,920
that's right

257
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,000
We don't have to

258
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,840
Waste time

259
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,720
You should fight for those

260
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,960
Who wavers.

261
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,880
In psychology,

262
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,480
There's a theory.

263
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,680
It's called 28 theory.

264
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,040
It says the most important thing

265
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,280
Only a small part.

266
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,640
The rest is secondary.

267
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,040
Since the other directors

268
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240
I can't confirm the camp.

269
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,840
We might as well take a risk.

270
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,480
To attack Lord Wang.

271
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,120
He and Zhao Yucheng are so close.

272
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,640
I think it's risky.

273
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,680
It's difficult.

274
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,040
I dare not.

275
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,160
Mr. Zhao.

276
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,320
I just got the news.

277
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,800
Fifteen shareholders of Wing Fashion.

278
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,920
We've got eight.

279
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,680
Zimmer will definitely leave.

280
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,960
good

281
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,120
I know.

282
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,600
You're putting a lot of effort into it.

283
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,280
to feel relieved

284
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,440
I promised you.

285
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,400
You won't lose a penny.

286
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,160
I knew you were like this.

287
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,680
Good cooperation.

288
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,120
Good cooperation.

289
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,680
Let's go.

290
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,680
Old Wang.

291
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,600
Why are you here?

292
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,120
Are you looking for my brother?

293
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,560
Do you know?

294
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,520
What are you doing?

295
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,960
Of course I know.

296
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,600
Old Ji,

297
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,920
Zimmer is incapable.

298
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,120
To lead the fashion wing.

299
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,280
He doesn't deserve to sit

300
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,200
As CEO.

301
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,320
I'm looking for your brother.

302
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,600
For the sake of the group, okay?

303
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,880
You're not doing this

304
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,560
The interests of the group.

305
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,840
You did it for yourself.

306
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,360
What did my brother give you?

307
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,200
Take a guess.

308
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,520
Brother

309
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,480
How are you?

310
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,599
So I can spare Zimmer.

311
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,079
The car said

312
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,480
I can't find it now.

313
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,640
Let him go for any reason.

314
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
What's the point of all this?

315
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,880
None of this is

316
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,960
What I want

317
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,040
All I want is Zimo.

318
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,080
But between us,

319
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,560
It's over.

320
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,440
actually

321
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,800
Three years ago,

322
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,720
When I chose to leave,

323
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,720
It's over.

324
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,240
Brother

325
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,040
I gave up.

326
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,440
Let go too, okay?

327
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,080
not good

328
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,560
If it wasn't for him,

329
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,240
Your condition won't recur.

330
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,640
So I can't let him off.

331
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,080
I love him.

332
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,680
I can't watch him get hurt.

333
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,240
When he hurt you,

334
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,840
For you?

335
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,440
Now the wing fashion

336
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,960
More than half of the directors

337
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,240
Has been on my side.

338
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,560
A proposal to dismiss Zimmer.

339
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,920
The vote will be held next week.

340
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,200
You can be soft.

341
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,640
But I can't.

342
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,960
No matter what I say,

343
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,440
You won't change.

344
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,920
yes

345
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,480
Go back to work.

346
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,560
Okay, we'll leave now.

347
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,520
Miss Su.

348
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,240
Are you waiting for President Zhao?

349
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,120
Xiao Wu.

350
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,280
You're not interested in

351
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,320
You know everything.

352
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,920
Miss Su.

353
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,680
These are confidential documents.

354
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,920
I can't tell you.

355
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,640
When are you free?

356
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,040
I want to talk to you.

357
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,040
Wu, sit down.

358
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,320
What to drink?

359
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,200
No need, Miss Su.

360
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,000
Tell me straight.

361
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,560
What exactly do you want to ask me?

362
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,880
I want to know what my brother will do

363
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,840
What are you going to do?

364
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,720
Miss Su.

365
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,280
This is Xiao Wu.

366
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,320
You've been with my brother for three years.

367
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,520
Actually, you know him very well.

368
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,160
I just don't want him to do it.

369
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,680
He will regret.

370
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,520
Are you still mad at me?

371
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,880
Don't move.

372
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,160
Don't move.

373
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,640
Get up, get up

374
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,840
Next to you,

375
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
I'll do it.

376
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,320
Why are you here suddenly?

377
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,280
What do you mean suddenly?

378
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,160
You didn't answer your calls.

379
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,280
And didn't reply to her WeChat.

380
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,520
If I don't come,

381
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,880
I'll probably never see you again.

382
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,840
Who didn't answer your call?

383
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,440
I just want to...

384
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
Think about it alone.

385
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,960
Have you figured it out?

386
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,960
What's wrong, brother?

387
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,560
You don't seem so angry.

388
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,520
Boring

389
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,240
You're so big.

390
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,480
You're still acting like a kid.

391
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,040
That's right.

392
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,880
Boring

393
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,600
If I don't play the way I did when I was young,

394
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,960
How can I persuade you to eat?

395
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,520
come

396
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:45,920
What about me?

397
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,520
I asked someone to make it for you.

398
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,280
Private congee.

399
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,160
Try it first.

400
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,720
If it doesn't taste good,

401
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,080
I'll ask them to change it for you.

402
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,200
To be angry with your brother.

403
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,880
Why did you torture your body?

404
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,480
come

405
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,440
Where is the congee?

406
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,880
The dishes are usually light.

407
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,760
If it's not to your taste,

408
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,080
I'll find someone.

409
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,160
Send another one here.

410
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,640
Brother

411
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,880
This matter

412
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,520
I really don't.

413
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,680
Is there room for manoeuvre?

414
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,080
Eat first.

415
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,520
Don't talk about it.

416
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Then I have to talk.

417
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,240
Eat it while it's hot.

418
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,160
I have something to do.

419
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,120
If this matter is not solved,

420
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,000
I can't eat it.

421
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,560
This matter will be solved.

422
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,160
But in my way,

423
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,400
Don't interfere.

424
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,920
No

425
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,200
A little chance.

426
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,680
I won't give up.

427
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,240
Brother

428
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,000
I know you did it because of me.

429
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,280
To hate Ji Mo.

430
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't hate him anymore.

431
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,680
I forgive him.

432
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,720
Since I was little,

433
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,000
You spoil me the most.

434
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,840
Follow me in everything.

435
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,040
Just follow me once more, okay?

436
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,280
Brother

437
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,120
Let go.

438
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,680
Xiaoxiao

439
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,560
Since I was little,

440
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,120
I'll do whatever you want.

441
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,920
But in the end,

442
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,120
Is to turn you into

443
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,800
This way,

444
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,000
So this time,

445
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,280
I will never change.

446
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,920
I want to ruin his reputation.

447
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,640
There's no turning back.

448
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,680
Brother

449
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,160
I beg you.

450
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,040
I really don't hate him.

451
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,760
But I hate him.

452
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
Xiao Xiao, look at yourself.

453
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,960
Since I was little,

454
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,040
When did you beg someone like this?

455
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,560
But now, for him,

456
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,920
How could you be so humble?

457
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,200
Come and beg your brother.

458
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,440
Xiaoxiao

459
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,560
He hurt you so much.

460
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,200
Why are you still helping him?

461
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,240
I really don't understand.

462
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,160
Because I love him.

463
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,000
If he's upset, I'll be upset.

464
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,880
If he is miserable, I will be miserable.

465
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,000
I don't want to see him hurt.

466
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,480
Because I love him.

467
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,320
You don't want to see him hurt.

468
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,400
When he hurt you,

469
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,880
Have you thought about it?

470
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,600
When he broke your heart,

471
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,560
Have you ever thought about that?

472
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,760
You become like this.

473
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,120
Where is he?

474
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,640
Brother

475
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,400
Stop it.

476
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,440
I won't change any decision.

477
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,040
Or choose me.

478
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,440
Or choose him.

479
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,480
Brother

480
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,360
You know me well.

481
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,640
The decisions I made

482
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,120
I won't look back.

483
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,320
good

484
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,480
Eat the porridge.

485
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,480
Alright.

486
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,200
He doesn't have so many procedures.

487
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,960
We'll visit a few more times.

488
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,920
We're almost there.

489
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,240
Check it for me later.

490
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,760
Is Wang's account abnormal?

491
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
He's probably accepting

492
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,840
Asset survey

493
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,320
Old season.

494
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,840
You can come to my house today.

495
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,200
I'm impressed.

496
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,560
Since you were in fashion,

497
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,040
To cover the sky.

498
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,320
It's been two years.

499
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,200
You've never been to my home.

500
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,280
You're here today.

501
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,200
The purpose of my visit

502
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,360
You should know that.

503
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,200
Old season.

504
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,480
You are smarter than a monkey.

505
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
Don't worry.

506
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,600
Have some tea.

507
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,800
come

508
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,760
My tea is good.

509
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,840
No sweet without sweat

510
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,680
Eat something bitter.

511
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,000
You know which one is sweet.

512
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,520
Where were we?

513
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,120
Continue

514
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,640
The purpose of my visit today

515
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,320
It's hope.

516
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,400
How can you

517
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,760
Vote for me.

518
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,280
Old season.

519
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,440
This wing fashion

520
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,360
You and I, brick by brick.

521
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,240
Put it together.

522
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,760
This is my real son.

523
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,680
No one else knows.

524
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,800
My relationship with this company

525
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,400
How deep is it?

526
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,600
You always know, right?

527
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,000
That's why I have to

528
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,040
To give you advice.

529
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,520
But what about you?

530
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,440
You insist on doing your own thing.

531
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,400
The more you go, the more wrong you are.

532
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,680
The more mistakes you make, the more you go.

533
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,320
Today,

534
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,400
Such an embarrassing situation.

535
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,360
That's why you came to me.

536
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,720
I was embarrassed too.

537
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,960
I know how you feel about the company.

538
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,240
And I know you're

539
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,280
About this matter.

540
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Although the two of us

541
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,960
There was a misunderstanding.

542
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,240
But I still hope

543
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,280
Can you help me?

544
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,440
Even for the future of the group,

545
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,880
And for your personal gains and losses.

546
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,760
I hope you can reconsider.

547
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,280
The gains and losses of this person

548
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,200
It's not worth mentioning.

549
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,280
Old season.

550
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,880
What we're discussing now

551
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,160
Is the future of wing fashion.

552
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,000
In my opinion,

553
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,240
Wing fashion is a good knife.

554
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,200
But it's blunt.

555
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,400
We need to find one.

556
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Okay, whetstone.

557
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,160
Feel the pain. Come on.

558
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,360
Old season.

559
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,920
I'm looking at your complexion.

560
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,120
But it's getting worse.

561
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,520
Listen to my brother.

562
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,320
Whether it's for the company's development,

563
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,000
Or for your health?

564
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,640
You should rest.

565
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,400
You can't do anything.

566
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Hold on.

567
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,600
What do you think, Xiao Lun?

568
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,920
Have some tea.

569
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,880
yes

570
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,880
I'll answer the phone.

571
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,840
Pick you up.

572
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,440
feed

573
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,240
I know.

574
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,760
Old season.

575
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,200
Where is your face?

576
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,720
Do you want some tea?

577
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,520
Can we talk about something?

578
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,760
It turns out that Mr. Wang

579
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,560
The good grindstone.

580
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,720
It's you.

581
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,320
President Ji.

582
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,280
you

583
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,520
What do you mean?

584
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,000
No wonder your attitude

585
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,960
So decisive?

586
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,160
Right.

587
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,560
Five percent.

588
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,680
Is indeed very attractive.

589
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,920
Since Zhao Yusheng promised you,

590
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,600
It's not hard for you.

591
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,960
No

592
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,840
Not Old Ji.

593
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,120
President Ji.

594
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,000
Not Zimmer.

595
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,760
What? Five percent.

596
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,200
What bastard told you that?

597
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,600
I'm telling you,

598
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,480
There's no such thing.

599
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,600
If this happens, my whole family will die.

600
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,160
Do you believe that?

601
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,000
Is it true or not?

602
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,160
You know that.

603
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,160
No

604
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,200
Take leave

605
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,360
No

606
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,040
Old season.

607
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,360
Boss

608
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,000
What you just said is true.

609
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,040
I got a letter before I came.

610
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,920
Anonymous mail

611
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,240
This is a confidential document.

612
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,320
Who gave it to you?

613
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,600
Are you serious?

614
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,680
I was suspecting

615
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,000
The authenticity of this file

616
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,760
But I saw Lao Wang's reaction.

617
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,240
It must be true.

618
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,480
I don't care who sent this document.

619
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,480
Anyway, I want Wang to think

620
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,840
Was sent by Zhao Yucheng.

621
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,680
feed

622
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,920
He's here.

623
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,160
You're looking for me now.

624
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
To admit defeat.

625
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,080
The outcome is still undecided.

626
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,200
It's too early to say that.

627
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,440
Also

628
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,840
There's nothing to say.

629
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,160
This time,

630
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,600
To make a choice.

631
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,520
Let me make a choice.

632
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,760
I think

633
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,360
I'm not the one who should make the choice.

634
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,400
It's you.

635
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,640
My attitude is clear.

636
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,960
Guardian Fashion

637
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,000
Is my choice.

638
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,960
I can admit defeat.

639
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,880
But I only admit defeat to Su Xiao.

640
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,960
I can put the wing fashion

641
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,360
To Su Xiao.

642
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,040
But I won't admit defeat with you.

643
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,680
I won't let Wing Fashion

644
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,600
Into your hands.

645
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,400
This is your choice.

646
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,160
hold

647
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,240
Back to Su Xiao.

648
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,920
Zimmer

649
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,840
I know my sister.

650
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,040
You also know

651
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,160
You know she's really

652
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,240
Always follow sb.'s advice

653
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,080
Give it back to her.

654
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,280
In your own hands.

655
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,320
Is there any difference?

656
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,199
Equity interest

657
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,719
Don't you still have the final say?

658
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,000
Not everyone is the same as you.

659
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Draw water to one's mill

660
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,840
Wing fashion for me.

661
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Not only benefits,

662
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,719
That's great.

663
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,800
I want you to lose

664
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,280
It's not just about benefits.

665
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
But everything.

666
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,880
So I have to go on.

667
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,040
Of course.

668
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,120
My purpose is simple.

669
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,040
Is to let you get out of the wing fashion.

670
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,320
You can't achieve your goal.

671
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,800
I won't stop.

672
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,880
Are you so confident that you can win?

673
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,080
You're wrong.

674
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,800
I'm not sure.

675
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,360
As you said,

676
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,639
Now, it's up to you.

677
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,760
It's too early to say.

678
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,840
Actually, Su Xiao and Ruuo Nan

679
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,720
To find me.

680
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,280
Both of them are for you.

681
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,560
And pleaded with me.

682
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,600
But the more they do that,

683
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,480
The more I want to destroy you.

684
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,160
Since they can't bear it,

685
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,680
I will help them.

686
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,600
I'm not confident of winning.

687
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,200
But I'm determined.

688
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,480
Because I will never

689
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,320
Like you.

690
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,960
Wobble

691
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,280
I'll see you at the board meeting.

692
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,200
Let me remind you that

693
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,640
You're not the only one who can bribe people.

694
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,440
Five percent.

695
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,280
Not much.

696
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,560
President Ji.

697
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,640
Let's go look for him today.

698
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,360
When Old Wang

699
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,640
You're so nice.

700
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,760
He's obviously putting on a show.

701
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,080
Why didn't you

702
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,040
To expose him.

703
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,680
And why are we looking for

704
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,520
Zhao Yucheng.

705
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,880
Zhao Yucheng's reaction.

706
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,240
As you expected.

707
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,400
that's right

708
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,120
As long as I see Zhao Yucheng,

709
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,000
My plan has been completed.

710
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,360
Old Wang, right?

711
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,200
And simple.

712
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,760
Everything is written on your face.

713
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,480
Whether it's soft or hard,

714
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,960
Just say something nice.

715
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,920
Soft.

716
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,360
He will relax his vigilance.

717
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,440
And you hit this for me.

718
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,320
On the phone,

719
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,000
Is an important chance.

720
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,640
It will make him suspicious.

721
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
Psychologically speaking,

722
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,600
A sudden silence.

723
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,280
Will cause people to be anxious and vigilant.

724
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
I just want him

725
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,160
Care about my call.

726
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,920
And care about the contents of the phone.

727
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,040
As long as he panics,

728
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,160
I'm half way there.

729
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,480
What do you think, Xiao Lun?

730
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,760
That's right.

731
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,080
Have some tea.

732
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,720
yes

733
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,360
Answer the phone.

734
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,200
Pick you up.

735
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,160
How about half of it?

736
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,080
Before and after I called,

737
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,160
By a weak person.

738
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,680
And become stronger.

739
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,720
feed

740
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,440
This will enhance the authenticity.

741
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,200
It can make him more suspicious.

742
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,800
So when I said

743
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,760
The details of the contract,

744
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,960
No wonder your attitude

745
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,040
So determined.

746
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,280
Right.

747
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,600
Five percent.

748
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,760
Is indeed very attractive.

749
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,640
Since Zhao Yusheng promised you,

750
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,320
It's not hard for you.

751
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,640
No

752
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,320
It's the most revealing time.

753
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,320
It's still Zhao Yu Cheng.

754
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,240
It's much safer.

755
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,280
Zhao Yucheng is not stable.

756
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,400
Is strong enough.

757
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,400
He thought he was in the clear

758
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,240
So when I said I would win,

759
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,680
When I'm sure,

760
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,200
He started to panic.

761
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,760
When I said

762
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,200
Five percent of the shares,

763
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,920
A man as deep as he is,

764
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,040
Won't allow others

765
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,920
And bit his tail.

766
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,360
Even if these two people

767
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,640
You're suspicious.

768
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,280
You can't guarantee it.

769
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,240
It's done.

770
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,560
Ever heard of the prisoner effect?

771
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,200
I've heard of it.

772
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,400
To interrogate the prisoner, right?

773
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,040
The prisoner effect.

774
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,640
The most important core is trust.

775
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,040
But as it happens,

776
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,720
They are both paranoid.

777
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,440
So,

778
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,600
When their interests

779
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
When it was damaged,

780
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,960
You'll start a fight.

781
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,040
And even defected.

782
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,040
Old Wang, be paranoid.

783
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,720
He knew he was vulnerable.

784
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,680
You are at a disadvantage.

785
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,480
So he didn't dare to look for him.

786
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,440
Zhao Yusheng is facing off.

787
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,320
But Zhao Yucheng is different.

788
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,720
He's more paranoid.

789
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,920
And he is the leader of this matter.

790
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,320
For Wang,

791
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,760
All the power of life and death.

792
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,520
Are all in the hands of Zhao Yu Cheng.

793
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,560
So this kind of thing

794
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
Zhao Yusheng will give himself

795
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,480
Take a soothing pill.

796
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,520
If Zhao Yucheng shows his cards,

797
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,360
Wouldn't it be a problem?

798
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,000
Zhao Yucheng is perfect.

799
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,720
But it's hard for him to trust others.

800
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,800
mistrustful

801
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,640
Is his biggest weakness.

802
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,520
So he won't easily

803
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Show your undercard.

804
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,960
If I'm right,

805
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,480
He should be furious now.

806
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,320
I'll meet you soon.

807
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,360
Mr. Zhao.

808
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,240
You know,

809
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,320
You're in such a hurry.

810
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,240
Call me here.

811
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,360
What's the emergency?

812
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:16,880
Thank you

813
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,200
Don't you think the day after tomorrow

814
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,440
The board of directors?

815
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
So I thought,

816
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,080
I need to confirm with you.

817
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,040
The people here

818
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
Is it OK?

819
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,640
no problem

820
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,800
I think in this world,

821
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,800
I didn't spend money.

822
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,840
That can't be done.

823
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,040
The conditions given by Mr. Zhao

824
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,960
It's already so good.

825
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,120
Who is going against the law now?

826
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,600
Isn't that crazy?

827
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,040
Everyone wants a pie in the sky.

828
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,960
But the pie really fell.

829
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,120
Can you handle it?

830
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,160
I'm not sure.

831
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,840
I think

832
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,880
It's a skill.

833
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,120
Can't you answer it?

834
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,240
Then I'm doomed.

835
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,840
Old Zhao.

836
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,840
You don't have to worry too much.

837
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,600
Where are those old hands?

838
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,640
It's a little slippery.

839
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,400
I admit it.

840
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,560
But they are the same as me.

841
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,000
On key issues,

842
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,440
That's a clear distinction.

843
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,040
Also

844
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,040
After all,

845
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,840
And the interests of everyone.

846
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,400
Are closely related to each other.

847
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,160
Yes

848
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
I also believe that

849
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,680
They shouldn't be so stupid.

850
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,720
At this point,

851
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,240
Because of you, right?

852
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,720
impossible

853
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,640
But then again,

854
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,400
I believe you.

855
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,840
I know you too.

856
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,680
but

857
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,560
Your brothers

858
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,280
After all, I don't know.

859
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,040
So,

860
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,320
To be safe,

861
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,520
I want to add a layer of security.

862
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
What guarantee?

863
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,480
Shares

864
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,720
Agency agreement

865
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,680
that's right

866
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,920
I want to ask Mr. Wang to help me.

867
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,880
Sign this agreement.

868
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,520
such

869
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,720
Our interests

870
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,280
You can tie them together.

871
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,360
As long as the two of us

872
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
On the same boat.

873
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,720
Those old guys

874
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,640
I'm not afraid of them turning against me.

875
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,320
It's a win-win.

876
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,920
Besides, my purpose is simple.

877
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,760
As you know,

878
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,920
I just want Zimmer

879
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,960
Roll out wing fashion.

880
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,760
If this thing is done,

881
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,280
Then I have 10%

882
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,520
Of Wing Fashion.

883
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,000
I'll transfer it all to you.

884
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,960
Think about it.

885
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,160
Mr. Zhao.

886
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,040
A big deal.

887
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,840
admire

888
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,040
but

889
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,920
I looked at it hastily

890
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,960
I found that

891
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,720
Mr. Zhao.

892
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,560
You are tied to me.

893
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,240
You're the one

894
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,120
All shares

895
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,240
For you,

896
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,880
This is just a drop in the ocean.

897
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,440
but

898
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,160
I tied them together.

899
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,520
It's my fault

900
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,800
All the assets

901
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,760
Zhao, you know me.

902
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,760
As for me,

903
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,920
Is a rude man.

904
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,000
And I...

905
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,680
I'm still a coward.

906
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,520
This is the first time

907
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,080
You've earned so much.

908
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,280
It's not easy.

909
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,560
I'm saving it for my son.

910
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,240
I didn't dare to take it out.

911
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,000
I can't afford to lose.
