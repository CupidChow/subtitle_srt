1
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,680
I knew you were hiding here.

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,240
Why didn't you answer my calls?

3
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,600
I don't want to talk.

4
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,160
Is it because of Zimmer?

5
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
I thought

6
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,120
He's different from other men.

7
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,240
I didn't expect that

8
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,040
Are all the same.

9
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,600
It's true.

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,440
What's going on?

11
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,960
You'll never get around it, right?

12
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,560
He didn't even bother.

13
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,199
And jumped into it.

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,880
You're actually colleagues.

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
In this company,

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,440
I'm really looking up.

17
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,240
The meat?

18
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,400
In front of my eyes.

19
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,880
Can the wolf sit still?

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,960
If you ask me,

21
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,440
There are only two words.

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,200
this

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
You deserve it.

24
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,880
Two words.

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,680
Really?

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,640
You deserves it

27
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,200
However

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,320
Although he is inexcusable, right?

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,320
But over the years,

30
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,880
My perception of men

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,280
I believe that

32
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,520
He still cares about you.

33
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,040
You have to trust me on this.

34
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,280
So what?

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,600
Without trust,

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,480
And vulnerable to attack.

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,000
We're not

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,760
At the age of 17 or 18.

39
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,320
The older you are,

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,480
The lack of love,

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,760
I thought he's not impulsive anymore.

42
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,520
But

43
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,200
It's so tiring to love someone.

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,840
Women are emotional animals.

45
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,440
Once you fall in love,

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,320
All precautions will be taken down.

47
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,080
I've put all my weaknesses

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,360
Give it to the other person.

49
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,840
Actually, what a woman wants is simple.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,360
It's just a sense of security.

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,320
And trust.

52
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
Security doesn't mean

53
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,960
You have to report to me all the time.

54
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,360
But I want him

55
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,600
No matter what happens,

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,560
You can think of me in the first place.

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,760
But Zimmer doesn't understand.

58
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,760
But he knew he was wrong.

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,680
And he's willing to make up for it.

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,480
It's too late.

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,600
Love is like a tug of war.

62
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,920
To be even.

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,720
Now there's one more person on his side.

64
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
I lost before I could compete.

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,280
Are you crazy?

66
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,960
How could you lose?

67
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,760
Fall down.

68
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,960
You can stand up.

69
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,400
You can start again.

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,920
Su Xiao is right.

71
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,400
Memory is powerful.

72
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,200
I have no confidence.

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,080
To win their love for years.

74
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,800
It's better to give up.

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,000
If a man

76
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
In your work,

77
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,480
Is so decisive.

78
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,279
You never admit defeat.

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,480
Why are you...

80
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,680
I ran into Su Xiao.

81
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,080
And defeated you?

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,280
If you like it,

83
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,520
You have to fight for it.

84
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,960
Why did you give it to him?

85
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Chen Fei'er, please leave me alone.

86
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,320
Okay?

87
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,440
And don't tell Zimmer.

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
She said I'm here.

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,960
I don't want to see him now.

90
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,880
Alright

91
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,240
I know.

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,800
If a man

93
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Love is

94
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,720
The impulse under the action of hormones.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,960
If you love someone,

96
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,720
You need to feel it with your heart.

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,960
You're not thinking with your brain.

98
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,000
Ask your own heart.

99
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,680
You really...

100
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,200
Are you really willing to give up?

101
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,120
Go home early.

102
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,120
If a man

103
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Are you waiting for her?

104
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Did you two have a fight?

105
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,560
That's right.

106
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
I made a wrong decision.

107
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,720
And hurt Ruonan.

108
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,880
What wrong decision?

109
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,840
I'm confused now.

110
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,560
I can't explain to you.

111
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,720
Who you need to explain.

112
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
It's not me.

113
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,080
It's Ruo.

114
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,200
I chose to quit.

115
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,280
Is to believe that you can give her

116
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,840
But now,

117
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,200
You didn't do that.

118
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,600
And made her cry again and again.

119
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,880
I really don't understand.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,280
The love you said

121
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,160
Is it true?

122
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,680
I love her.

123
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,600
I really love her.

124
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,080
So I lost my mind.

125
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,840
I want to see her right now.

126
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,200
To make up for everything I've done.

127
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,720
Then why don't you

128
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Why are you still sitting here?

129
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,760
She's at the company now.

130
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,680
Hurry up.

131
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,520
Go apologize to her.

132
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,440
Brother

133
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,360
I'm telling you today.

134
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
Where is she?

135
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,480
Not because I admit defeat,

136
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
I really don't want to.

137
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,200
If I see her crying again,

138
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,920
Thanks.

139
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Dugu is like a man.

140
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,800
There's nothing to get through.

141
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Cheer up.

142
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,400
Why are you here?

143
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Don't say anything.

144
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,560
I have nothing to say to you.

145
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,360
Get out of here.

146
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,200
Let go

147
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,600
Let go of me. I won't let go.

148
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,240
I didn't sleep last night.

149
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,240
I've been waiting for you.

150
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,720
The waiting process

151
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,800
It's too long.

152
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,600
I was scared.

153
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,560
I was scared too.

154
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm afraid of losing you.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,760
If a man

156
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,520
I really can't live without you.

157
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,080
I beg you.

158
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,720
Don't leave me.

159
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,080
Can you give me another chance?

160
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
If you're a male,

161
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,360
Since you want a chance,

162
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,360
I'll give you a chance.

163
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,360
Go back and tell Su Xiao

164
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,000
Come to see me after you handle it.

165
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
But you must remember that

166
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,320
This is the last time.

167
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,160
I'm not young anymore.

168
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,600
I've seen too many.

169
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,360
I won't allow myself to be

170
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,920
In the state of worrying about gains and losses,

171
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,200
Love is a luxury for me.

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,400
The little trust I have left today

173
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,440
I'll give it all to you.

174
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,920
Trust me.

175
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,240
I won't let you down.

176
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,920
Hello, Aaron.

177
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
Gather all the shareholders.

178
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,800
I have a meeting.

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,200
What's the hurry?

180
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,080
I have no idea

181
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,680
I'm coming.

182
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Sit down.

183
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,280
What's wrong? Today,

184
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,080
What's the hurry?

185
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,440
Not Old Ji.

186
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,160
What are you doing today?

187
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,320
In such a hurry.

188
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,040
sit

189
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,600
Today, I called everyone here.

190
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,400
Is to announce

191
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,640
Important personnel changes.

192
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,320
I want to cancel it.

193
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,240
As the Director of Design of Cermanza.

194
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,560
President Ji.

195
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,040
I disagree with that.

196
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,040
I have made a decision on this matter.

197
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,600
I will find someone as soon as possible.

198
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,560
To fill the gap.

199
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,160
Have you decided?

200
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,000
Have you decided?

201
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,480
Then we can only execute it.

202
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,960
Is it necessary to hold this meeting?

203
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,480
Old season.

204
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,160
The question about Sermantha

205
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,320
At the board meeting,

206
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,720
Haven't you expressed your attitude?

207
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,040
The Sermantha is very suitable.

208
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,520
Our wing fashion

209
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,920
And since she came,

210
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,040
It's very important

211
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,720
All kinds of problems.

212
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,760
Has been relieved.

213
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,760
In this case,

214
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
I don't understand.

215
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,760
Why are you

216
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,800
To target her like this?

217
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,760
Wing Fashion is a group.

218
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,320
What I want is

219
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,560
A pure designer.

220
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,400
Not only the design is pure,

221
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,320
Your attitude should be pure.

222
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,360
Samantha doesn't fit my requirements.

223
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,120
Are you talking about purity?

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,800
It's pure and not pure.

225
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,640
I don't know.

226
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,320
But it seems that

227
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,040
Is not so pure.

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,280
Ji, may I remind you

229
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,440
Don't let personal relationships

230
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,800
To work.

231
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,840
Especially don't affect

232
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,360
To the wing fashion.

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,640
If you insist on doing this,

234
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,920
I have to withdraw my shares.

235
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,240
All of you,

236
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,440
Self help

237
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,760
I agree with Mr. Wang.

238
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,720
If you insist on doing this,

239
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,840
I'll withdraw my shares.

240
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,720
I'll withdraw my shares.

241
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,760
You want to threaten me?

242
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,280
This is not a threat.

243
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,320
I have no choice.

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
I've been watching you

245
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
Push it into the sea.

246
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,360
I can't stop it.

247
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:37,960
I can't...

248
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,720
Looking at my money,

249
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,840
Don't waste your time, old Ji.

250
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,560
good

251
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,200
Since we all agree that

252
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,400
Samantha should stay.

253
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,720
I respect everyone's opinions.

254
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,040
but

255
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,840
I can only stay with her.

256
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,320
Ji, what are you doing?

257
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
Are you threatening everyone?

258
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,160
I announce that

259
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,360
I want to resign.

260
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,520
President of Wing Fashion.

261
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,640
you

262
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,720
No

263
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,120
President Ji.

264
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,720
Are you kidding me?

265
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,280
No

266
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,200
He's being childish.

267
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,000
What do you mean?

268
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,880
Mr. Wang

269
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,960
What should we do now?

270
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,920
President Ji.

271
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,040
Why are you doing this?

272
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,360
This is what I have to do.

273
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,960
I want to fulfill

274
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,760
A man's promise.

275
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,240
This promise is too expensive.

276
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,640
Wing fashion is all you have.

277
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,760
You can't just do that.

278
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,280
And give up easily.

279
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,960
As long as she's there.

280
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,400
Zimmer

281
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,960
I want to talk to you alone.

282
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
Do you want to stay away from me?

283
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
I had kept my distance.

284
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,360
And draw a clear line.

285
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,080
But you crossed the line.

286
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,280
I thought

287
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,200
There are no boundaries.

288
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,760
Since you left me three years ago,

289
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,720
And deceived me.

290
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,160
There will be a line between us.

291
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,640
Zimmer

292
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,880
Do you have to be so ruthless?

293
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,960
Is not ruthless.

294
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,400
You're too aggressive.

295
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,480
I respect you very much.

296
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,200
therefore

297
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,200
Please respect me.

298
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
And the one I love.

299
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,840
Suxiao

300
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,920
I admit that I am guilty to you.

301
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,840
But if

302
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,520
You got Ruo Nan involved.

303
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,440
I feel guilty about you.

304
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,720
Will slowly disappear.

305
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,320
I won't let anyone

306
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,040
And hurt Ruo Man.

307
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,960
I told you.

308
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,760
So you just...

309
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,200
Give up wing fashion.

310
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,640
You used this way.

311
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,800
Are you punishing me?

312
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,440
I didn't punish anyone.

313
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,400
I just want to give Ruonan

314
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,200
One explanation.

315
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,920
Wing fashion is you.

316
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,040
And founded it.

317
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,720
It needs your explanation.

318
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,200
I've told it.

319
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
Wing fashion is your dream.

320
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,480
Now it's back to the owner.

321
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,640
I'll give you all my shares.

322
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,280
If the wing is fashionable,

323
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,760
Is our last tie.

324
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,520
From now on,

325
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,400
Let's not contact each other.

326
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
You guarded it for me.

327
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,320
Wing fashion for three years.

328
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,240
Now, for Ruuo,

329
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,640
Are you giving up wing fashion?

330
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,040
Yes

331
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,160
Not only wing fashion,

332
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,240
For Ruuo's sake,

333
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,640
I can give up everything.

334
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,800
Zimmer, come back.

335
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,200
Zimmer

336
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,920
Come back.

337
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,640
Zimmer

338
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,560
Sida

339
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,880
Are you inside?

340
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,079
She's too tired recently.

341
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,000
You're resting.

342
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,160
Tell me what you want.

343
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,480
Embrace the future.

344
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,760
It will begin soon.

345
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,840
An invitation letter

346
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,760
I didn't receive it.

347
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,480
After all, he's a male 2.

348
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,000
Why don't you let us go?

349
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,240
Later, I found out

350
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,280
It's Tong Tong again.

351
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,920
She was behind it.

352
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,160
It's not the first time.

353
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,560
We can't go to the press conference.

354
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,600
You can't go.

355
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,680
I don't care.

356
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,920
There's still a chance.

357
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,000
But this is your first play.

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,440
If we don't promote it,

359
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,880
Isn't that a waste of time?

360
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:01,840
No way

361
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,040
I'm looking for Ruo.

362
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,880
Thousand yarn.

363
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,480
I

364
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,520
I don't want to be tired anymore.

365
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,040
How about this?

366
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,440
Do it for Ruo.

367
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,000
I

368
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm afraid I can't handle it well.

369
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240
You can...

370
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,000
I think you...

371
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
More and more progress.

372
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,880
Not only work well,

373
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,040
Moreover, when dealing with people,

374
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,680
You know more and more about priorities.

375
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,280
We are all in this industry.

376
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,160
The newbies.

377
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,840
Not only do I need to be disciplined,

378
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,160
You have to be disciplined.

379
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,280
It's OK.

380
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,760
Well

381
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,160
Mr. Lu,

382
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,720
Zi Hao is not feeling well.

383
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,360
He can't attend the press conference.

384
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm really sorry.

385
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,720
The male lead is not coming.

386
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,400
Then, my press conference

387
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,560
What are you doing?

388
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,960
He went to film.

389
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,920
Give me a hand here.

390
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,720
I'm telling you,

391
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,800
My patience is limited.

392
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,960
Don't challenge my bottom line.

393
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,280
I'll be honest with you.

394
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,520
He is really because of the schedule.

395
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,360
I can't.

396
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,480
The most we can do is

397
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,200
Can only participate in online interaction.

398
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,240
Then forget it.

399
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,200
I won't bother you anymore.

400
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,400
The publicity in the future.

401
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,160
Even Zihao.

402
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
You don't have to attend.

403
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,480
That's not good, right?

404
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,000
After all, Zihao is the male lead.

405
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,160
You know he's the best.

406
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,720
When you're shooting, give it to me.

407
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
So many things.

408
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,920
Now the promotion period

409
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,080
Are you trying to fool me again?

410
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,280
If the male belt is rich,

411
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,080
Why is there not so much to do?

412
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,280
I'm telling you now.

413
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,200
Put it here.

414
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,440
If Zihao continues to behave like this,

415
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,480
Follow you.

416
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,640
Will be doomed sooner or later.

417
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,880
Let's go. Don't bother.

418
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,720
Hello, President Lu.

419
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,120
I'm Ruo's assistant.

420
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,560
I want to borrow your

421
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,360
A few minutes.

422
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,480
About the press conference.

423
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,440
Do you think so?

424
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,480
How about this?

425
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,160
Before the elevator reaches the first floor,

426
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,440
Finish what you have to say.

427
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,480
no problem

428
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,760
What are you doing?

429
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,760
I'm buying time.

430
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,200
Alright

431
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,040
There are three minutes left.

432
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,960
Hurry up.

433
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,640
Lu is always like this.

434
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,320
I'm here to talk to you.

435
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,440
About the press conference.

436
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,080
I know Song Zihao

437
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,160
The fans are many and the traffic is huge.

438
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,040
It's enough to hold up.

439
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,600
And more fans.

440
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,720
No matter how much traffic,

441
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Can't hold the agent.

442
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
Why are you doing this?

443
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,440
This play is based on

444
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,640
Song Zihao's traffic

445
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,240
But now he won't attend the press conference.

446
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,800
His fans won't buy it.

447
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,720
Song Zihao will not attend the press conference.

448
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,800
Just now,

449
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,480
Tong Tong told me

450
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,280
He said he was seriously ill.

451
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,680
Can't attend the press conference.

452
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,040
What serious illness?

453
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,280
Is to pretend to be ill and get money.

454
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,320
When we started to talk about the price,

455
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,280
With a high price.

456
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,680
If Song Zihao is not popular,

457
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,840
I'm not mad at you.

458
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,720
Don't be angry, President Lu.

459
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,640
I'm sure it's not...

460
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,760
Song Zihao's original intention

461
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,680
He definitely won't.

462
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,840
To attend the press conference.

463
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,160
What he cares about most is

464
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,640
To the public.

465
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,800
There must be

466
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,840
Is there any misunderstanding?

467
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,280
As for the press conference,

468
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,240
There are many new dramas on the market.

469
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,680
As long as the role is good enough,

470
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,960
Sometimes, men are better than men.

471
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,080
You still want to be brilliant.

472
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,160
Although I admit that

473
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,440
Sida is not experienced enough.

474
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,920
And the popularity is not enough.

475
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,560
But he worked hard.

476
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,360
And he has the advantage of good looks.

477
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,320
In the drama.

478
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,640
You're really something.

479
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,960
So, I think he's

480
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,160
What's missing is an opportunity.

481
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,360
As long as I have this chance,

482
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,240
I'm sure he won't.

483
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,200
To disappoint you.

484
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,440
How about this?

485
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,520
Let Star attend the press conference.

486
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,080
If the press conference is successful,

487
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,360
Then all the press conferences

488
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,320
I asked him to attend.

489
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,120
And the promotion of STAR

490
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,840
Really?

491
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,960
Great, President Lu.

492
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,760
Thank you so much.

493
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,480
You're really good at teaching.

494
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,200
If all the men and sisters

495
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,480
Smart and capable, promising.

496
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,640
Thank you, President Lu.

497
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,040
I won't waste your time.

498
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,760
That's it.

499
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,280
I'm leaving. Don't bother.

500
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,680
Thank you, President Lu.

501
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,760
Shen Qiansha, you can do it.

502
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,760
Sure, Qiansha.

503
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,840
Is President Lu

504
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,760
Is notoriously difficult.

505
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,000
You can solve it.

506
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,960
Namely

507
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,600
This time, you're

508
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,560
And made great achievements.

509
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,600
Not only for Sida,

510
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,920
And dampened the spirit of Tong Tong.

511
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,000
Nice work.

512
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,440
It's so refreshing.

513
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,760
Low-key and low-key.

514
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,920
I'm sure Star will be popular.

515
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,200
That's why I'm confident.

516
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,120
To do this.

517
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,960
We definitely can't.

518
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,360
And bow to Tong Tong.

519
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,320
Are you right?

520
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,200
Male sister, female sister.

521
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,400
If a male sister,

522
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,720
When I was away,

523
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,360
A great event happened.

524
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,080
Thousand yarn.

525
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,400
You're doing great.

526
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,880
You've really grown up.

527
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,760
Not only can I be the leader,

528
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
And it's done beautifully.

529
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,240
Mr. Lu called me just now.

530
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
He said he admired you.

531
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,120
Young and bold,

532
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,720
Let me cultivate you.

533
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

534
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,960
Take this opportunity

535
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,080
I want to announce

536
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,880
Starting from tomorrow,

537
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Qiansha is no longer

538
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,360
My personal assistant.

539
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,480
She's going to be

540
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,600
Executive Broker

541
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,320
From now on, I'll handle the SDA.

542
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,440
All the activities

543
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,840
congratulations

544
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,600
very good

545
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,400
That's it.

546
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
You're so happy so early.

547
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,280
To perform the work of a broker.

548
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,600
Is very tedious.

549
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,160
You can practice your temper.

550
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,560
Come on.

551
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,920
Okay, copy that.

552
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,480
Thousand yarn.

553
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,440
Come on

554
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,480
Si Da, did you hear that?

555
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,360
I'm your executive manager now.

556
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,280
I'm not the one

557
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,160
Who doesn't understand anything.

558
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,720
I'm your executive manager.

559
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,560
Yes, I heard it.

560
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,960
Should you speak louder?

561
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,480
Let the people downstairs listen to it.

562
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,000
No way

563
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,720
This is the turning point of my life.

564
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,640
I became your executive manager.

565
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,840
It means that I might

566
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,200
To be your manager.

567
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,920
It shows my efforts.

568
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,240
Has paid off.

569
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,400
I still can.

570
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,560
Do you know how happy I am?

571
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,800
I know.

572
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,400
It's the same as my first time.

573
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,520
Although at that time,

574
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,720
Only to act like a passer-by.

575
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,680
But I want to tell the world

576
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,560
I finally became an actor.

577
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,120
yes

578
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,040
Do what you like.

579
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,080
You're really proud.

580
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,000
And lucky.

581
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,600
You know what?

582
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,760
I used to...

583
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,280
You don't even know

584
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,200
What do you like?

585
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,080
I don't know

586
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,000
What do you want?

587
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,040
You're so muddled.

588
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,440
After more than 20 years,

589
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm finally

590
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,600
Back home.

591
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,680
Because of you,

592
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,600
When I'm hot,

593
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,160
I became an artist's assistant.

594
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,240
At that time, I thought

595
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,600
I can only have love in my life.

596
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,320
I will only love you.

597
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,280
But things are different now.

598
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,000
You've been through so much.

599
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,040
I suddenly realized that I

600
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,640
I really like this job.

601
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,320
Really?

602
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,480
I'm willing to rush for it.

603
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,600
Even if it's...

604
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,040
A little feedback.

605
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,680
I will be very satisfied.

606
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,960
Maybe this is what you said.

607
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,920
Dream.

608
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,400
I was lucky I found it.

609
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,800
I must become

610
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,400
People like Ruo

611
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,040
I want to use my work

612
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,480
To prove his worth.

613
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
I found your eyes

614
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,720
There is also light.

615
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,920
Really mature.

616
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,920
But when it comes to relationships,

617
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,440
You're not that mature.

618
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,480
But don't worry.

619
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
I'm yours now.

620
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
Executive Broker

621
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,840
I'm at work.

622
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,480
I won't bother you.

623
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,440
Really?

624
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,160
perfect

625
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,320
It's time to get off work.

626
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,840
go

627
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,200
I'll take you to a big meal.

628
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,960
Alright.

629
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,600
Let's go.

630
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,680
The plan I just mentioned

631
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,240
All of them.

632
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,720
Okay, then print it to all departments.

633
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,400
OK

634
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,080
Okay, thank you

635
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,640
it doesn't matter

636
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,480
If you're a male,

637
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,640
Why are you here?

638
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,680
President Ji resigned.

639
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,360
President Ji and Director Su

640
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,520
To draw a line.

641
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,000
Under the pressure of all the shareholders,

642
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,800
To fire her.

643
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,880
But the shareholders

644
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,720
They all disagree.

645
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,040
And threatened him with withdrawal.

646
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,840
When Mr. Ji got angry,

647
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,720
During the meeting,

648
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,920
To resign.

649
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I know.

650
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,760
He did it for you.

651
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But wing fashion,

652
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,520
Wing Fashion needs him.

653
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,240
He's gone.

654
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,720
Wing fashion is a piece of sand.

655
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,320
The shareholders are all trying to

656
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,080
In my own interest.

657
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,200
No one is down-to-earth.

658
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,040
To do something.

659
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,160
So if the male sister

660
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,600
I can only ask you for a favor.

661
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,320
Please help me persuade him back.

662
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,880
Okay?

663
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,280
You're back.

664
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,960
Try the dishes I made.

665
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,520
Why did you resign?

666
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,240
I told you I would fix it.

667
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,280
I want you to solve Su Xiao's problem.

668
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,600
I didn't ask you to resign.

669
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,000
What's wrong with quitting?

670
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,320
At least you can be honest.

671
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,440
To stay by your side.

672
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,320
But I don't want you to

673
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,440
To give up my career.

674
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,000
That's your dream.

675
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,440
You can't live up to your dream.

676
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,200
You can look for another job.

677
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,600
But losing you

678
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,520
You can't find it anymore.

679
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,520
As for the dream,

680
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,200
Everyone has many dreams.

681
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,080
You are my dream.

682
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,080
But you have so many dreams.

683
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,160
I think as long as I achieve

684
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,880
That's enough.

685
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,160
I will be satisfied.

686
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,680
If a man

687
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,320
Don't worry about me.

688
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,640
And resign?

689
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,720
Yes, I've experienced it.

690
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,000
After careful consideration,

691
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,960
The life of each of us

692
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,200
There's a choice order.

693
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,720
And you are the first.

694
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
As long as I have you with me,

695
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,120
Any difficulty or adversity,

696
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,080
I can handle it.

697
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,760
But the important thing is,

698
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,800
You must be there.

699
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,000
If a man

700
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,320
I said I won't let you down.

701
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,560
I know the sincerity of a 30-year-old.

702
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,480
Hard-earned

703
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,920
All the broken things

704
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,200
I will make it up.

705
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,440
Guard it well.

706
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,120
but

707
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,640
Wing Fashion needs you.

708
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,720
You're their spiritual teacher.

709
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,000
Wing fashion is like

710
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,960
My son.

711
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,840
It's time to let it go.

712
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,000
Isn't Star the same?

713
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,320
Don't you also let go?

714
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,480
I think we should

715
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,760
Take a good rest.

716
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,360
To get back the feeling of life.

717
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,680
but

718
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,200
The way you work,

719
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,600
Is really charming.

720
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,160
He's handsome.

721
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,720
Do you want to think about it?

722
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,560
When I was working,

723
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,200
attractive

724
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,880
And charming in other ways.

725
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,160
Do you want to try?

726
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,960
After the assessment,

727
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,040
I haven't finished the assessment yet.

728
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,240
Are you eating or not?

729
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,520
Eat. I'll change my clothes.

730
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,280
early

731
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,680
early

732
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,960
breakfast

733
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,600
Try it.

734
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
The talisman doesn't fit your appetite.

735
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,000
It's so sumptuous.

736
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,760
Please sit down.

737
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,480
So thoughtful.

738
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,480
I used to rush to work.

739
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,840
Has developed

740
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,480
The habit of not eating breakfast.

741
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,280
Is running around on an empty stomach.

742
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,400
There's something missing.

743
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,280
I just realized that

744
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,760
It's not an empty stomach.

745
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,600
Is empty.

746
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,880
Because it's sparsely populated in the morning.

747
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,000
I feel so lonely.

748
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,040
after

749
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,320
I'll make breakfast for you every day.

750
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,520
I sent you to work every day.

751
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,440
such

752
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,880
You're not lonely anymore.

753
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,440
You are full of men.

754
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,360
In the past,

755
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,800
Is a president.

756
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,320
Now you're all over me.

757
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,240
can or cannot?

758
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,080
You're too talented.

759
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,360
To serve you.

760
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,680
Why are you overqualified?

761
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,200
Besides, you've been

762
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,200
You don't have to do it.

763
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,960
A great career.

764
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,480
Is successful.

765
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,160
Is valuable.

766
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,960
To experience life.

767
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,880
Go through life.

768
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:27,960
Look.

769
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,360
I'm taking care of you now.

770
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,040
And feel happy.

771
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,880
It's very valuable.

772
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,160
How about the STAR press conference in a few days?

773
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,760
Do you want to come with me?

774
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,200
Yes, of course.

775
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,280
From now on, every minute of my life

776
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,840
It's all yours.

777
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,600
As you wish.

778
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,200
Why?

779
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,800
Don't waste it.

780
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,120
It's so easy.

781
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,600
Do you need cupping service?

782
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,760
No, don't be romantic.

783
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,200
Then acupuncture is ready.

784
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,280
Let's go. Have breakfast.

785
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,000
Look at this chair.

786
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,680
I'm really impressed.

787
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,720
As the old saying goes,

788
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,240
The train runs fast.

789
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,560
It's all because of the headband.

790
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
This locomotive

791
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,920
You run so fast.

792
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,520
We're going to

793
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,440
All of them.

794
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,840
But it's okay.

795
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,320
Wing fashion as long as

796
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,640
We old people

797
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,000
You won't be able to turn the sky.

798
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,800
According to the articles of association,

799
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,440
We need to vote now.

800
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,480
The new president.

801
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
The people on the list

802
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,920
Including me.

803
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,280
It's all wing fashion.

804
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,640
Has made outstanding contributions.

805
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Besides Zimmer,

806
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,000
Who contributes the most to wing fashion?

807
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,040
Sacrifice the most.

808
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,520
I believe in everyone's heart,

809
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,360
There must be an account.

810
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,040
good

811
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,360
Let's start from me.

812
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,240
Let's start the voting.

813
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,960
The new president.

814
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,560
I

815
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,280
Thermansa

816
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,160
We are voting for the new president.

817
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,080
What are you doing?

818
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,440
everybody

819
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,880
I know the latest wing fashion

820
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,920
The morale of the troops is low.

821
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,160
But it's so fast.

822
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,760
So I abandoned the old and replaced the new.

823
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,680
Is it a little hasty?

824
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,400
Zimmer, he left.

825
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,800
More hasty.

826
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,080
Okay, go on.

827
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,520
Mr. Wang

828
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,400
You and everyone here

829
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,160
Besides regular meetings,

830
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,280
Actually, I'm busy.

831
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,240
I didn't have time to show up.

832
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,760
yes

833
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,000
Wing fashion has been

834
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,160
For three years.

835
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,200
But still a

836
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,120
A new brand.

837
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,320
A brand needs

838
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,120
Is a man who personally

839
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,920
The president who really knows it.

840
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,800
When Zimmer was in office,

841
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,680
He is not only

842
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,800
The president of Wing Fashion.

843
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,040
He's fashion designer.

844
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,320
The invisible spokesman.

845
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,360
Many female consumers

846
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,600
It's all because of Zimmer.

847
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,400
personal charm

848
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,560
I chose to use it.

849
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Wing Fashion Products

850
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,600
Zimmer

851
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,720
The label has become

852
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,640
It's tightly bound.

853
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,760
He is a brand.

854
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,080
So at this moment,

855
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,600
If you change the president,

856
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,240
There are only disadvantages and no advantages.

857
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,120
So what are you saying?

858
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
What I mean,

859
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,960
To invite President Ji back.

860
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,520
impossible

861
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,160
please

862
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,200
Who will?

863
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,600
Go and invite them.

864
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,239
You'd better invite them.

865
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,120
It's better for me to go.

866
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,400
I'll invite President Ji back.

867
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,639
Mr. Zhao.

868
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,120
You still have time to drink.

869
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,719
Drink more.

870
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,880
I should drink arsenic.

871
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,520
No

872
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,040
That

873
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,440
You can drink it.

874
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,159
Can you drink while talking?

875
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,600
sit

876
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,480
Can I talk now?

877
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,480
I almost blew up today.

878
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,040
The board of directors has chosen half of the president.

879
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,320
It's almost done.

880
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,240
And then suddenly,

881
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,280
There's a Thermantha.

882
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,440
And insisted on getting Qi Mo back.

883
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,400
I would definitely disagree.

884
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,840
But she's still alive.

885
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,560
What are you talking about?

886
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,680
I don't know when I gave it to her.

887
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
40 percent of the shares.

888
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,720
To threaten me.

889
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,120
I will definitely punish her.

890
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,280
Give her some color.

891
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,600
I told you about it.

892
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,600
Don't bother.

893
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,280
I'll bear the consequences.

894
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,800
Since she wants to do this,

895
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,120
Just let her go.

896
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,640
No

897
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,680
Not Mr. Zhao.

898
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,240
Let her go.

899
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
Then Qi Mo will come back.

900
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
Then Qi Mo will come back.

901
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,040
Sure.

902
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,240
Mr. Zhao,

903
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:53,960
you

904
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,160
What I mean now,

905
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,800
But it's the same as when you promised me.

906
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,920
It's not the same.

907
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,920
She's my sister.

908
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,160
Sister.

909
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,760
younger sister

910
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,160
It's not the time

911
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,920
At this point,

912
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,800
You suddenly

913
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,760
What sister?

914
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,520
And I spoil her.

915
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,680
You know what?

916
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,080
Wing fashion

917
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,520
Who will it belong to?

918
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,800
She has the final say.

919
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,480
Not Mr. Zhao.

920
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,920
What she wants.

921
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,120
I will do everything I can.

922
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,200
Help her get it.

923
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,120
Yes, but

924
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,520
What is she going to do now?

925
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,560
You too.

926
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,720
Just fulfill her requirements.

927
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,960
good

928
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,600
But President Zhao

929
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,960
Don't worry.

930
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,960
We were drinking

931
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,720
The wine in the same bottle

932
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,080
Understood

933
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,240
The wine is good.

934
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,720
Brother

935
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,480
Where are you?

936
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,800
I need you.

937
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Drinking in the daytime

938
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,200
I don't want to die.

939
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,120
Besides wine,

940
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,920
What else can I do now?

941
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,960
Forget the pain for a while.

942
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,400
I know you're in pain.

943
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,920
You can't hurt him.

944
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,040
Your own body.

945
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,440
Besides,

946
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,920
Wing fashion has returned to

947
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,880
In your hands.

948
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,760
What you want,

949
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,880
It will be soon.

950
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,280
This is not what I want.

951
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,200
I don't want wing fashion.

952
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,360
I want Zimmer.

953
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
But I think

954
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,880
He's getting further away from me.

955
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,080
He even started to hate me.

956
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,360
I was thinking

957
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,440
I should quit.

958
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,960
Xiaoxiao

959
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,040
In fact, I just avoid it.

960
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,760
I won't let you forget the pain.

961
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,360
You have to stick to it.

962
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,920
otherwise

963
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,320
Everything you have done before,

964
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,600
Has become meaningless.

965
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,080
Whether it's work or life,

966
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,880
Nirvana and rebirth.

967
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
You must go through the pain.

968
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,120
And this pain may be

969
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,440
Will be your weapon in the future.

970
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,320
It's useless.

971
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,400
He doesn't want to see me.

972
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,760
You will see him soon.

973
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,800
Alright, thank you.

974
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,680
Thank you

975
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,520
Isn't that Dugu Ruuo?

976
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,240
The man next to me

977
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,160
Which male star?

978
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,040
That's President Ji of Wing Fashion.

979
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,800
He's here to impress his girlfriend.

980
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,800
Really?

981
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,000
Two, two.

982
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,560
Please stay.

983
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,880
Let's take a photo.

984
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,960
All right? Look over here.

985
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,880
I want to

986
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,960
Hold your hand.

987
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,880
Never let go.

988
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,360
That's not the president of Rui Qi Group.

989
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,040
Mr. Zhao?

990
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,920
It's true.

991
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,400
Long time no see

992
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,560
I didn't expect to meet you here.

993
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,480
How have you been

994
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,880
Hold it so tightly.

995
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,880
Are you afraid that you can't catch it?

996
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,080
It's almost time.

997
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,960
Let's enter.

998
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,800
go

999
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,240
Don't be afraid of being photographed this time.

1000
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,480
Just shoot it.

1001
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,640
To let them know

1002
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,240
I have a super sense of security.

1003
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,720
And trustworthy boyfriend.

1004
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,720
There are some things

1005
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,040
You don't have to face it.

1006
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,360
Leave it to me.

1007
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,240
Listen to you.

1008
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,920
Hello, everyone.

1009
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,000
I embrace the future.

1010
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,400
Sida

1011
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,880
Sister, you're here.

1012
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,000
You are so energetic.

1013
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,960
Brother, you're here too.

1014
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,240
What about

1015
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,080
Are you nervous?

1016
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,840
Don't be nervous.

1017
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,240
I heard there are many people here today.

1018
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,760
Song Zihao's fans.

1019
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,200
If they know

1020
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,240
If Zihao didn't come,

1021
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,440
I will definitely take it out on you.

1022
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,720
Are you ready?
