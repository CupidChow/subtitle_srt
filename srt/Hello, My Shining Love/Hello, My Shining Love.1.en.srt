1
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,760
The pupil is enlarged.

2
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,720
Frequent wink

3
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,560
Contraction of intereyebrow turn muscle

4
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,440
The throat is swallowing.

5
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,080
Cross your hands.

6
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,680
Rub your fingers back and forth.

7
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,160
All the emotions and expressions

8
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,480
Both represent nervousness.

9
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,200
And anxious.

10
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,160
It's stressful.

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,760
Where is the human body?

12
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,680
Can express all kinds of emotions.

13
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,080
The facial imaging

14
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,039
Is the most obvious.

15
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,360
Which is our psychology.

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,000
What you said,

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
Microfacial expression

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,480
Microfacial expression

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,680
Shortest

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,280
Can last 0.04 seconds.

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,760
Although the emotions

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Will only flow out for a moment.

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
But as long as I capture that moment,

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,760
You can know what the other person is thinking.

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,040
The teacher

26
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,760
If everyone

27
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,960
Facing someone,

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,520
And react the same way.

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,680
Just like on the screen,

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,760
The same way.

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,320
That means those people

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,200
The person I'm facing.

33
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,560
Extremely dangerous.

34
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,520
Be careful.

35
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,200
If you're a male,

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
If you're a male,

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,080
Male sister.

38
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,880
The trainees for the interview have arrived.

39
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,600
Are we all here?

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,000
We're waiting for you.

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,360
Get out

42
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,680
Get out

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,040
Get out of here.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,480
Where did you find it?

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,200
Did you pull it on the way?

46
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,440
I'm sorry, Sis.

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,440
I'll look for it again.

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,240
feed

49
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,240
what

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,640
OK!

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,360
What now?

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
It's Song Zihao.

53
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
He suddenly disappeared again.

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,640
The studio has stopped working.

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,920
Here we go again.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,320
Go back to the crew now.

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,240
It's not too late.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
Are you going back by yourself?

59
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
I'll escort you back.

60
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,720
I've been shooting continuously.

61
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,920
For a whole year.

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,560
This year,

63
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,720
I've been on the crew.

64
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,960
Even a day off,

65
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,720
Nothing.

66
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,440
I don't even have

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,840
Ordinary office workers are worse than

68
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,440
Salaryman, Salaried Man

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
At least you can have a vacation.

70
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,880
You have to enjoy

71
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,240
The treatment of stars.

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,440
And enjoy the rights of ordinary people.

73
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,400
Who do you think you are?

74
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,320
I knew it.

75
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,440
You don't care at all.

76
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,360
My feelings.

77
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,400
Don't you want me to give you

78
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
To make money?

79
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
In your eyes, I'm

80
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,800
To make money.

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,640
good

82
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,360
Anyway, I'm not shooting today.

83
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,280
What can you do to me?

84
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,520
Zihao

85
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,960
You said that.

86
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,160
It will break my heart.

87
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,200
Do you think

88
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,720
I asked you to work on the crew.

89
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,960
Is it for me?

90
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,040
If you

91
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,360
If we can't finish the drama,

92
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,520
The crew won't release him tomorrow.

93
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Then you'll take the advertisers

94
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,720
And the media.

95
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,240
They'll say that you're a big name.

96
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,720
Do you think that

97
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,960
Is it good for you?

98
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,320
Why don't you understand my efforts?

99
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,320
Alright, alright.

100
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,920
Don't cry.

101
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,680
Don't cry.

102
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,200
Can't I go back to the crew?

103
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,480
Don't cry.

104
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,200
Well

105
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,920
And shoot well.

106
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,920
Don't be sad.

107
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
He already knows he's wrong.

108
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,400
What hurt?

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,040
If I don't,

110
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,920
Two tears,

111
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,960
How can I lure him back?

112
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
The crew shooting.

113
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,280
Do you really take him back?

114
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,800
How can I be so strong?

115
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,720
Then just now,

116
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,320
What are you waiting for?

117
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,240
Go to the crew and watch him.

118
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,880
You will lose money if you delay the progress.

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,400
Hello, President Ji.

120
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,160
Hello, President Ji.

121
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,840
How are you doing?

122
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,560
Are you almost there?

123
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:52,880
Hello, President Ji.

124
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,480
Hello, President Ji.

125
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,960
Hello, President Ji.

126
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,800
Good morning, President Ji.

127
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,920
President Ji.

128
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,040
President Ji.

129
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,520
Why are you so late?

130
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,320
We are all here.

131
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,000
Waiting for you.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,600
President Ji.

133
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,240
The design style of the new season is really good.

134
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
I like it so much

135
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,680
I asked you out several times.

136
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
You ignored them.

137
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,640
After the show today,

138
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Let's have dinner together.

139
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,800
Today's show

140
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,560
For wing fashion,

141
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,520
Is very important.

142
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,800
I hope you can put all your energy

143
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,880
And attention.

144
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Put them on the runway.

145
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,680
I won't allow anything to go wrong.

146
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,360
All right, get ready.

147
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,880
An An.

148
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,800
You are indeed the main model.

149
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,520
Look, she's good at acting.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,680
No.

151
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,720
On the contrary, she's very nervous.

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,480
How can you tell?

153
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,400
When she smiles,

154
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,040
Consciously,

155
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,360
To contract the facial muscles.

156
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,280
But the eyebrow and eye muscles

157
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,440
But it didn't shrink.

158
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,640
The person's eye muscle

159
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,120
Is not dominated by consciousness.

160
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,200
Can't be disguised.

161
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,320
So,

162
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,040
It means that

163
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,240
Very anxious.

164
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,880
I think it's better to be careful.

165
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,840
Keep an eye on her.

166
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,120
Don't let anything happen.

167
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,600
President Ji.

168
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,680
No, something's wrong.

169
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,600
An An is gone.

170
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,760
I've searched the whole backstage.

171
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,120
No one answered my calls.

172
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,520
Didn't I ask you to watch her?

173
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,240
I went to the bathroom.

174
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,280
therefore

175
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,240
sorry

176
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
Why did you lie to me?

177
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,840
I trusted you so much.

178
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,880
Why did you cheat?

179
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,480
My relationship

180
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,760
Stop

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,720
good

182
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,080
Okay, transfer.

183
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,840
We have changed the scene.

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,880
Director, director.

185
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,720
We can't shoot the next scene.

186
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,680
I can't shoot it.

187
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,080
Yes

188
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,240
Someone is going to jump off the roof.

189
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,200
Where?

190
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,560
I can't shoot it.

191
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,960
Can we change the scene?

192
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,600
No.

193
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
You have to follow the previous scene.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,920
We can't shoot today. Let's shoot tomorrow.

195
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,880
Is that okay?

196
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,560
Go and have a look.

197
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,520
Don't jump.

198
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Don't come.

199
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,400
Come here.

200
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,640
I jumped with her.

201
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,040
Don't be impulsive.

202
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,560
calm

203
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,280
Don't.

204
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,840
Don't.

205
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,840
Don't be impulsive.

206
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,320
Don't be impulsive.

207
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Say it properly.

208
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,840
Who are you?

209
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,320
Am I telling you the same thing?

210
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,920
You made such a fuss.

211
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,840
I want everyone

212
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,880
As a witness?

213
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,640
Why are you

214
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,200
And pulled this girl to jump off a building.

215
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,640
What does she have against you?

216
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,800
What a naughty girl!

217
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
You cheated on me.

218
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,080
Other men

219
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,360
You want to break up with me now?

220
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,200
I didn't.

221
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,280
I broke up with you.

222
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,680
Because I can't stand you.

223
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,000
A perverse desire for control.

224
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,800
You're always being paranoid.

225
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,040
It has nothing to do with him.

226
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,360
For you.

227
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,960
I can die.

228
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,840
That's because I love you.

229
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,560
You know that.

230
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,200
No,

231
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
But even if I die,

232
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,680
I have to take you with me.

233
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,160
No, no. Don't.

234
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,680
Calm down.

235
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,520
I finally understand.

236
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,000
There was a third person.

237
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,560
Then you shouldn't dance.

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
If you jump,

239
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,280
Then you are cheap.

240
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,360
The man, the mistress.

241
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,680
Take that...

242
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,720
The man's number.

243
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,640
Give it to me.

244
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,360
I'll call him right now.

245
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
You can confront each other.

246
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,040
Make it clear.

247
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,360
You're going to jump anyway.

248
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,200
We'll decide to dance together.

249
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
Or three people?

250
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,280
It's not too late.

251
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,520
Yes

252
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,320
feed

253
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,080
Hello, do you know Chen An An?

254
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,240
Now her boyfriend is holding her.

255
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,040
To jump off the top floor of Dachang Park.

256
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,840
Come right now.

257
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,760
If they really

258
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,080
If you jump,

259
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,640
In my life,

260
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,160
And took two lives.

261
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
Hurry up.

262
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,880
Within ten minutes,

263
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,640
Alright.

264
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,600
Calm down.

265
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,440
I'll be there soon.

266
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,640
We found An An.

267
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,400
I'll go there first.

268
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,120
He'll be there soon.

269
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,680
Don't be nervous.

270
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,440
We'll be there soon.

271
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,360
Don't come over.

272
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,280
Don't be nervous.

273
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,440
I

274
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,240
I just want to talk to you.

275
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,560
actually

276
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,480
What happened to you.

277
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,440
I've been there.

278
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,000
My husband

279
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,120
With a woman.

280
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,520
Last week,

281
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,960
He divorced me.

282
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,440
He also took all my assets.

283
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,840
Are you married?

284
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,200
You're acting again?

285
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,960
At that time,

286
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,760
And pregnant.

287
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,360
Then he asked me to go to the hospital.

288
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,840
Take my child

289
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,560
And knocked it off.

290
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,960
I hate that scum.

291
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,560
I want to die with him.

292
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,240
Because I want him to know

293
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,160
In this world,

294
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,400
No one loves him more than I do.

295
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,520
Are you making up a story to lie to me?

296
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,280
Now that I think of that time,

297
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,440
My heart still hurts.

298
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,800
My heart is broken.

299
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,520
The more I talk, the sadder I get.

300
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,400
I don't want to live.

301
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,320
Brother, let her go.

302
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,240
Let go of her.

303
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,600
It's too dangerous.

304
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,440
Let's die together.

305
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,640
The two of us have suffered a lot.

306
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,880
Let go of her.

307
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,520
I want to die too. Calm down.

308
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,280
Calm down.

309
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,240
I can't calm down.

310
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,560
I want to die anyway.

311
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,440
Let's die together.

312
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,440
Let go of her.

313
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,560
What does it have to do with you?

314
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,880
What are you doing?

315
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,840
Enough?

316
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,440
President Ji.

317
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,400
Don't come over.

318
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,680
This man is crazy now.

319
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,000
Shut up.

320
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,000
The lover is here.

321
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,240
Are you nervous?

322
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,640
Don't get me wrong.

323
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,600
This woman has nothing to do with me.

324
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,360
Why are you talking like this?

325
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,480
I asked you to save her.

326
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,560
Talk him down. Hurry up.

327
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,280
Persuade him to come down.

328
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,400
One rejected me.

329
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,520
So many times.

330
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,840
Why should I save her?

331
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
refuse

332
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,320
What do you mean?

333
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,320
I did pursue An An.

334
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,720
But she rejected me.

335
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,480
That she has a boyfriend.

336
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
It's you.

337
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,680
Such a low-quality man.

338
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,000
You rejected me for him.

339
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,720
You won't regret it later.

340
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,840
I didn't regret refusing me.

341
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
President Ji,

342
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,400
scumbag

343
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
You're here to watch a play.

344
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,920
I'm sending you here.

345
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,120
A timely help.

346
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,400
You're adding fuel to the fire.

347
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,760
Are you stupid?

348
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,640
For him.

349
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,480
Now I'm desperate.

350
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,880
You're paranoid.

351
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,320
I misunderstood your girlfriend.

352
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,120
Then why did she break up with me?

353
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,120
I can't live without her.

354
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
It's better to die together.

355
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,280
Don't.

356
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,600
Do you want to think about me again?

357
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
Such a low-quality person.

358
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,920
He's too extreme.

359
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,640
Get rid of her.

360
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,320
What did you say

361
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,560
Say it again.

362
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,440
Hurry up.

363
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,000
Go, go.

364
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,160
You are a liar.

365
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Are you all right?

366
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Are you all right?

367
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,560
Are you with him?

368
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,840
No

369
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,800
I don't know him.

370
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,680
I'm here to eat melons.

371
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,480
Why are you doing this to me?

372
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,440
I'm here.

373
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,680
Why is that?

374
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Good gracious!

375
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,320
My life is so big.

376
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,080
I'm fine.

377
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,160
You scared me to death.

378
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,560
Hands.

379
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,320
You're fine. I'm fine.

380
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,000
Your butt is pressing on my hand.

381
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Butt

382
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,120
How could it be?

383
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,160
You did it on purpose.

384
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,560
Do you think I want to answer it?

385
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,720
A butt fell from the fifth floor.

386
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,800
Who wants to pick you up?

387
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,320
It's not even my butt.

388
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,440
This is a thousand catty pendant.

389
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
My hands are probably broken.

390
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,560
My waist.

391
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,440
My leg.

392
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,880
My leg hurts so much.

393
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,680
Where does it hurt? My whole body hurts.

394
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,040
I don't know if he has a concussion.

395
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,840
An actor?

396
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,440
ambulance

397
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,440
ambulance

398
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,680
There are steps.

399
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,200
Male sister.

400
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,240
If the male sister heads this way,

401
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,880
Are you all right?

402
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,880
Tong Tong.

403
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,920
Male sister.

404
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,040
I'm fine.

405
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,960
I'm telling you,

406
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,240
Don't take advantage of me

407
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,920
Lazy.

408
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,960
I know.

409
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,080
Don't come to see me.

410
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,520
I'm fine. Work hard.

411
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,480
good

412
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,440
She passed out.

413
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,000
I

414
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,080
Push, push! Hurry!

415
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,960
Push it up.

416
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,760
Slow down.

417
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,040
this Official Account message template I just learned that

418
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,600
Young actor Song Zihao

419
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,920
And my agent.

420
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,840
I've received

421
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,760
The firsthand news.

422
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,200
Actor Song Zihao

423
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,480
And bullied by my agent.

424
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,920
They even had a heated argument.

425
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,320
On the surface,

426
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,840
They are good partners.

427
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,480
Actually

428
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,080
Their relationship is very tense.

429
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,400
Even this kind of thing can be done.

430
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,160
Am I here for free?

431
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,800
You should know that

432
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,800
The damage

433
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,040
It's not my image.

434
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,440
Is the image of the company.

435
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,480
Song Zihao is now

436
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
The mainstay of the company.

437
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,840
A lot of big plays outside assigned him

438
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,000
To be the leading man.

439
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,240
It's rumored that

440
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,000
Songzihao

441
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,280
He's going to cancel the contract with our company.

442
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,240
Male sister.

443
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,200
I didn't expect it to be so serious.

444
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,560
Besides, it's not me.

445
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,160
Caused it.

446
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,600
It's my fault.

447
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,720
Please don't explain to me.

448
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,920
I'm not qualified yet.

449
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,520
By the way,

450
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,720
Didn't you say that

451
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,960
The lighting of the house is not good.

452
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,360
Do you want to redecorate?

453
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,400
But recently, the company's business

454
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,360
That's a lot.

455
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,120
You don't have the time.

456
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,040
Keep an eye on the decoration.

457
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,560
Then rent out the house.

458
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
And rent a house for me.

459
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,320
In my neighborhood.

460
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
It's close to the company.

461
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,480
It's convenient to work.

462
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,079
Okay, I'll do it right away.

463
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,240
I'll go out first.

464
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:07,960
Well

465
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,520
Mr. Ji, Yuxing Entertainment

466
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,880
A list of artists.

467
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,720
And resume.

468
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,359
To cooperate with us.

469
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,760
Star Entertainment has been

470
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,960
The development momentum is fierce.

471
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,480
Signed a lot under his banner.

472
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,200
A popular artist.

473
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,360
The director of the brokerage department

474
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,200
And he's very capable.

475
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,240
Good at hype.

476
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,640
To cooperate with them,

477
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,520
Is conducive to the development of our group.

478
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,200
Don't bother.

479
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
And hyped it.

480
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,600
Don't be like that.

481
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,560
Who are too utilitarian.

482
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,280
There's one more thing.

483
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
Have you got news about the house?

484
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,320
For sale.

485
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,200
Not really.

486
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
But the landlord decided to rent it out.

487
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,000
Inform the owner.

488
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,960
I rented this house.

489
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,320
The lease.

490
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,200
The longer it takes, the better.

491
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,240
The house is really

492
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,320
It means so much?

493
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,200
What does it mean to you?

494
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,040
Tell me about it.

495
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Don't ask too many questions.

496
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,400
Anyway, I will definitely get this house.

497
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,400
Why are you here?

498
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,120
Don't you have a relationship

499
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,320
Who jumped off the building together?

500
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,360
Who are you?

501
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,080
I'm Dugu Ruuo's assistant.

502
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,280
When you jumped from the building,

503
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,320
I was there too.

504
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,720
I remember now.

505
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,000
The owner of this house

506
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Dugu is like a man.

507
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,840
Yes, this is a male sister's house.

508
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,720
You really have a narrow path.

509
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,080
It's her.

510
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,320
It's difficult now.

511
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,280
Let me look at the house first.

512
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,520
Let me show you.

513
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,800
This is the kitchen. No need.

514
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,480
I know this family better than you.

515
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,520
This house is quite new.

516
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,760
It's only been three years.

517
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,160
And it's well-decorated.

518
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,520
If I hadn't rented it out,

519
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,080
Than the current price.

520
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,080
Take a look.

521
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,800
If nothing else,

522
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,640
If it's too big a problem,

523
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,480
We will

524
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,400
Sign the contract.

525
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,080
It's too messy.

526
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,680
sloppy

527
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,320
I think it's OK.

528
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
what

529
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,160
What did you say

530
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,680
Was rejected by Wing Fashion.

531
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,280
Do they know what they are doing?

532
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,920
When we meet a star,

533
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,840
But the biggest agency

534
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,600
It's usually someone else.

535
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,880
Let's work together.

536
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,640
Now, we'll bring it up ourselves.

537
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,280
You pushed so many artists.

538
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,600
They don't want any of them.

539
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,640
Is their boss

540
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,400
What's wrong with you?

541
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,640
Self-willed

542
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,120
Shortsighted

543
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,360
Wing Fashion has such a president.

544
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,840
Will be closed sooner or later.

545
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,400
If you don't cooperate, you won't.

546
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,680
What's the big deal?

547
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,800
In the future,

548
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,200
To the blacklist.

549
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,520
Their boss

550
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,600
What's his name?

551
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,920
Zimmer, right?

552
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,800
Don't let me hear it from now on.

553
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,040
This person's name.

554
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,160
I'm definitely not going to

555
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,040
No brain, no taste.

556
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,600
Who has no future.

557
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,840
Sir, someone is here.

558
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,120
Why are you here again?

559
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,160
Male sister.

560
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,880
He's a renter.

561
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,160
Really?

562
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,600
Well

563
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,800
What a coincidence.

564
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,040
That's right.

565
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,600
I also think it's a coincidence.

566
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,120
By the way, I forgot to introduce myself.

567
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,240
Allen

568
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,960
I'm the one you're talking about.

569
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,320
Shortsighted and headstrong.

570
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,160
It's hard to use your brain.

571
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,000
There's no future.

572
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,080
Wing Fashion President

573
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,120
Zimmer

574
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,760
Since you heard it,

575
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,040
Let me get this straight.

576
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,240
Since I first met you,

577
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,800
I think we two

578
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,800
Eight characters are different.

579
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,040
If you make a mistake in your life,

580
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,120
So, this house

581
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,320
I won't rent it to you.

582
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,160
Leave.

583
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,680
But my deposit

584
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,000
To the agent.

585
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,200
You can't change your mind.

586
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,920
It's just money.

587
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,600
Give it back to you, Tong Tong.

588
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,040
Give him the money and let him go.

589
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,320
Male sister.

590
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,720
Aren't you afraid of being harassed?

591
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,080
Then rent the house to him.

592
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
Just move away.

593
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:21,640
Just move away.

594
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,240
Tong Tong.

595
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,920
I've known you for so many years.

596
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,600
This is the first time you're so smart.

597
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,960
How about this?

598
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,240
After careful consideration,

599
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,080
I've decided to

600
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,240
I rented it to you.

601
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,640
After all, the agency fee has been paid.

602
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,840
I don't like it.

603
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,960
To trouble others.

604
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,800
But I have one condition.

605
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,720
No matter what happens,

606
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,680
You can't cancel the lease.

607
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,640
If it happens,

608
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,040
What accident?

609
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,800
I'm not responsible.

610
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,960
Okay, that's what I want.

611
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,160
Mr. Ji,

612
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,200
Enjoy your stay.

613
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,880
President Ji.

614
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,840
What is this?

615
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,680
The decoration drawings I designed

616
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,880
You haven't lived here.

617
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,080
How could I?

618
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,280
It's so clear.

619
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,680
Don't ask so many questions.

620
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,080
According to the restoration on the drawing,

621
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,000
It's fun.

622
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,400
In the door.

623
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,680
The accessories you ordered must have arrived.

624
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,360
It's fake.

625
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,440
President Ji, who did you offend?

626
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,960
Why does he hate you so much?

627
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,800
I have offended many people.

628
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't know who I offended.

629
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,080
Hurry up. Clean it up.

630
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,320
Let's go.

631
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,280
Or what?

632
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,440
Hurry up. Go.

633
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,960
How can we live here?

634
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,560
Spray the disinfectant on me.

635
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,800
Some toy mice are so scared.

636
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,280
go

637
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,920
go

638
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,120
go

639
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,720
Dugu is like a man.

640
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,720
Just right

641
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,800
Dugu is like a man.

642
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,000
Do you recognize this?

643
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,480
I just moved in.

644
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,200
I received this kind of threatening card.

645
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,440
Give me an explanation.

646
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,040
It's obvious that

647
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,720
To come to you.

648
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,560
I'm anxious to go to the press conference.

649
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,240
There's nothing to explain.

650
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,760
Call the police yourself.

651
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,800
I'll call the police today.

652
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,400
And harass them tomorrow.

653
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,920
Should I call the police every day?

654
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,800
That's your business.

655
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,080
It's up to you.

656
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,640
You must have

657
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,720
You know about this, right?

658
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,520
That's why on the day you signed,

659
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,760
So,

660
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,880
You liar.

661
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,320
You were the one

662
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,920
To move in.

663
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,960
As I said,

664
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,160
If something happens,

665
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,640
I'm not responsible for it.

666
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm still busy.

667
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,760
I'm leaving now. Bye.

668
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
Don't go yet.

669
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,960
Dugu is like a man, right?

670
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,120
We received a report.

671
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,640
So I want you to assist in the investigation.

672
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,640
How could it be you?

673
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,200
I've told you

674
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,160
You must

675
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,000
Give me an explanation.

676
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,280
If you don't cooperate,

677
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,160
I can only let you

678
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,000
To solve the problem.

679
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,520
Police officer.

680
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,440
Let's start.

681
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,360
OK

682
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,040
According to Mr. Ji's report,

683
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,800
Are you signing the lease?

684
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,720
When we signed the contract,

685
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,800
Deliberately hid the information of the house.

686
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,880
Which led to anonymous harassment.

687
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,440
This is Mr. Ji.

688
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,080
Received threatening messages.

689
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,120
Who sent it?

690
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,240
Why is my name on it?

691
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,640
Is someone trying to hurt me?

692
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,280
It's horrible.

693
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,240
Police officer.

694
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,320
You have to protect me.

695
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,320
Dugu is like a man.

696
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,880
Are you pretending not to know?

697
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,200
Police officer.

698
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,400
She's lying.

699
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,000
Who are you to say I'm lying?

700
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Do you have any evidence?

701
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,960
A person's surprised expression.

702
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,360
Only one second.

703
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,840
No matter how irritating it is,

704
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,120
Or more than a second.

705
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,320
You kept

706
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,480
A state of surprise.

707
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,160
It means your surprise is fake.

708
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,880
You know that.

709
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,640
There's something wrong with the house.

710
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,080
Are hiding it on purpose.

711
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,160
Stop it.

712
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Even if you don't know this house,

713
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,480
There's something wrong.

714
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,600
But this card is for you.

715
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,400
You were threatened.

716
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,080
You can call the police now.

717
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,480
Let's start an investigation.

718
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,720
I'm scared.

719
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,640
I'm a weak woman.

720
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,880
Working here alone.

721
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm scared.

722
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,160
If the police offend someone,

723
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,520
They want to take revenge on me.

724
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,360
What should I do?

725
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,920
You're scared alone.

726
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,240
The eyebrow will twist significantly.

727
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,080
There will be vertical frown lines.

728
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,760
When you pretended to be scared,

729
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,760
Don't keep your mouth open.

730
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,040
Pay attention to your wrinkles.

731
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,000
And eyebrow.

732
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,240
He's lying.

733
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,840
I'm a psychology major.

734
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,720
Specialized in microexpressions.

735
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,920
Don't mention a living person.

736
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,560
Stand in front of me.

737
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,120
Even if a female is here,

738
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,360
I will analyze it.

739
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,400
After the press conference this morning,

740
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,000
I received it this afternoon.

741
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,120
This threat card

742
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,160
I'm helpless now.

743
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,000
And you kept framing me.

744
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,240
How can I be a human?

745
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,280
Don't get worked up.

746
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,800
You should at least try to persuade him.

747
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,840
When you're sad alone,

748
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,320
The chin will be tightened or raised.

749
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,440
Do you think she has it?

750
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,400
Keep acting.

751
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:05,880
That's enough.

752
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,640
The more you analyze her, the more she cries.

753
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,360
Don't cry, miss.

754
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,280
We're following the law.

755
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,600
Since you are also a victim,

756
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,160
We won't.

757
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,200
To make things difficult for you.

758
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,280
The play is good.

759
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,760
Not an actress.

760
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,160
It's really a pity for you.

761
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,160
How dare you scold me?

762
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,280
I know tomorrow's headline

763
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,200
What will it be?

764
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,040
The agent of Yuxing Entertainment.

765
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,640
And was taken away by the police.

766
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,200
Just because you called the police,

767
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,280
All my efforts were in vain.

768
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,040
I heard that your company is very good at

769
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,680
The method is hype marketing.

770
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,520
You were brought to the police station in public.

771
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,720
But increased the exposure.

772
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,560
If you count the loss marketing,

773
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,680
You won't lose.

774
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,000
So I have to thank you.

775
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,160
If you had told me

776
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,760
To communicate well,

777
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,520
It won't fall

778
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,360
The current situation

779
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,520
I have nothing to say to you.

780
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,560
Move away.

781
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,080
I never want to see you again.

782
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,520
Are you being unreasonable?

783
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
I rented this house.

784
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,080
And you're the one to blame.

785
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,120
The house is mine.

786
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,520
I'm right.

787
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,760
I can rent if I want.

788
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,320
If you don't want to rent, you can't.

789
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,840
I don't want to get married

790
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,240
It has nothing to do with you.

791
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,480
You think I want to

792
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,680
It's worth half a penny.

793
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,880
If it weren't for this house,

794
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,120
I'm too lazy to talk to you.

795
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,280
That's great.

796
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,400
You should move out.

797
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,480
From now on, the well water won't violate the river.

798
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,520
I won't move.

799
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,560
You have to move it for me.

800
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,800
And lack of originality.

801
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,360
There's no ego style.

802
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,960
To follow suit.

803
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,280
The clothes I designed

804
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,200
It's not for those stars.

805
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,680
To understand beauty.

806
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,040
Who pursue beauty.

807
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,600
Look at your design.

808
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,400
And the lines.

809
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,880
Who can wear it except stars?

810
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,120
Take it back and redo it.

811
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,800
Let's go.

812
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,920
You are so angry today.

813
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,520
I didn't sleep well last night.

814
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,040
The problem of my house

815
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,720
Has not been solved.

816
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,200
Where should I sleep?

817
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,760
This woman is so difficult.

818
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,760
She asked me to cancel the lease.

819
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,880
I haven't moved in for a few days.

820
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,000
She asked me to move out.

821
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,040
I planned to

822
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,440
To buy that house.

823
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,440
Now you've ruined my plan.

824
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,960
She really wants you to move?

825
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,600
I thought she was

826
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,080
To scare you?

827
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,280
It's not because you called the police.

828
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,520
To embarrass her in person.

829
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,680
Can she hate me?

830
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Or else,

831
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,640
I'll apologize to her.

832
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,680
Do you think it's useful?

833
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,360
That's fine.

834
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,000
He's stubborn.

835
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,720
If you don't eat the salt or the oil,

836
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,880
Ordinary people can reason with her.

837
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
She wouldn't listen.

838
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,840
Since I moved to that house,

839
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,720
I haven't slept for a whole day.

840
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,840
My eyelids have been dancing for a whole day.

841
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,800
I feel something.

842
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,440
Something bad happened.

843
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,680
Suxiao

844
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Where are you?

845
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,240
Suxiao

846
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,760
sorry

847
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,880
sorry

848
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,840
Why are you here?

849
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,800
sorry

850
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,480
Don't pretend to be pitiful here.

851
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,520
I won't forgive you.

852
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,200
Move out tomorrow.

853
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,360
Actually, I've been waiting for you.

854
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,240
Don't leave me, okay?

855
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,560
Why did he say that?

856
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,800
Actually, I've been waiting for you.

857
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,000
Don't leave me, okay?

858
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,800
Do you?

859
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,920
The reason why he wouldn't leave,

860
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,200
Because of me.

861
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,200
Is he in love with me?

862
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,440
It's true.

863
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,240
It's perfect.

864
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,480
Is also a kind of trouble.

865
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,280
What should we do?

866
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:11,960
It's true.

867
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,480
It's really

868
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,520
It's too annoying.

869
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,440
About what you said to me yesterday,

870
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,480
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

871
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,920
But I hope you can

872
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,400
Stop acting like

873
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,120
An unrealistic fantasy.

874
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,280
To be honest, your type

875
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,880
It's not my style.

876
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,000
What are you talking about?

877
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,520
I know.

878
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,080
You have to

879
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,720
To let you give up your love for me.

880
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,560
It's a bit of a imposition.

881
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,239
In particular,

882
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,960
Or me?

883
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,400
Such a perfect woman.

884
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,960
perfect

885
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,639
In advertising.

886
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,440
About the house.

887
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,800
I've thought about it for a while.

888
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,000
I think your attitude of apologizing

889
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,360
And sincere.

890
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,560
Since you've

891
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,400
And realized his mistake.

892
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,159
I can forgive you once.

893
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,040
Wait

894
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,560
Who said I apologized?

895
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,840
What are you apologizing for?

896
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:44,880
It's you.

897
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,840
At midnight last night,

898
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,040
And came to my house.

899
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,400
Crying and apologizing to me.

900
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,560
And ask me to forgive you.

901
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,920
You have something.

902
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,440
Hypochia?

903
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,000
Who is it?

904
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,040
Who is it? Last night,

905
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,880
She came to my home.

906
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,960
And asked me to forgive him.

907
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
move

908
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,080
I definitely want to move.

909
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,480
Where are the trainees today?

910
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,120
Where are you practicing?

911
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,480
They are mainly responsible for

912
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,640
The body training.

913
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,200
Has gathered in the rehearsal room.

914
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,640
Pick some strong ones.

915
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,720
To move to my house.

916
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,640
And practice your body shape.

917
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,360
Move, move.

918
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,240
Hello, Aaron.

919
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,200
Come here.

920
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,680
I think there's a thief in my house.

921
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,320
You're back.

922
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,680
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

923
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,240
Without my permission,

924
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,680
And come into my house?

925
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,840
Those things at the door

926
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,040
You moved it.

927
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,160
That's right. I moved it.

928
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,600
But you're wrong about one thing.

929
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,000
This is my home, not yours.

930
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,800
I have sent the rent

931
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,960
To your account.

932
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,880
And one month's penalty.

933
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,520
So this contract

934
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,280
To void

935
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,760
Do you think the whole world

936
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,200
Should focus on you.

937
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,840
Did you suffer any trauma?

938
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,600
To have such a strong desire for control.

939
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Is everyone's idea

940
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,520
I want to be like you.

941
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,760
To be satisfied?

942
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,200
Don't think you have learned it.

943
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,080
How many years of psychology?

944
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,880
You can control everyone.

945
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,680
Remember your expression now.

946
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,400
This is the real fear.

947
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,280
In the future,

948
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
Use this.

949
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,760
My heart beats so fast.

950
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,240
They were scared by that pervert.

951
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,040
feed

952
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,520
what

953
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,960
I'll be there.

954
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,040
key

955
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,360
When I calmed down,

956
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
We should talk about it.

957
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,960
I can't talk to you now.

958
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,720
I have something urgent to go out.

959
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Do you have a car?

960
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,400
Can you give me a lift, please?

961
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,600
Please, it's urgent.

962
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,960
I'm not used to being a driver.

963
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
If you give me a lift,

964
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,040
I'll talk to you now.

965
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,480
package

966
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Male sister.

967
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,960
He's dancing there.

968
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,760
We're shooting tomorrow.

969
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,640
Why would he come here?

970
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,480
I can't stop him.

971
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,560
He insisted on coming.

972
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,280
Sorry, sorry.

973
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,080
Song Zihao, are you crazy?

974
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,640
You're here.

975
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,360
Are you crazy enough?

976
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,360
There are so many people watching.

977
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,320
You will be ruined.

978
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,520
Come with me. So what?

979
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,800
I'm having a good time. Come on.

980
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,040
Let's get together.

981
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,320
Songzihao

982
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,080
Before I get angry,

983
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,720
Hurry up.

984
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,880
What are you doing?

985
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,600
What are you doing? I didn't see it.

986
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,560
He doesn't want to go with you?

987
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,040
Let's go.

988
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,480
That's right.

989
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,080
Who are you?

990
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,720
Do you know Zihao?

991
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,520
I know who she is.

992
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,240
Isn't she the one

993
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,640
To bully Song Zihao's manager?

994
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,000
It's her. You.

995
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,280
Who told you to bully Zihao?

996
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,080
Don't touch me.

997
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,040
Why did you bully Zihao?

998
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,520
You have something to say.

999
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,360
Don't touch me.

1000
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,840
Don't do anything.

1001
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,320
Don't touch me.

1002
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,800
Go with me. Hurry up.

1003
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,760
Don't talk. What are you doing?

1004
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,800
No, no. Don't.

1005
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,400
Speak nicely. Don't do anything.

1006
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:11,960
Who are you?

1007
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,040
It's none of your business.

1008
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,800
Don't care who I am.

1009
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,640
I just don't like you.

1010
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,160
A group of people are bullying a woman.

1011
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,280
He's my boyfriend.

1012
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,760
If you need help,

1013
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,520
What about

1014
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,960
Don't leave.

1015
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,400
Dugu is like a man.

1016
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,360
Come back.

1017
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,840
Make it clear.

1018
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,520
go

1019
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Make it clear.

1020
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,120
Song Zihao, stop right there.

1021
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,760
Do you still remember

1022
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,000
Stop you from coming here?

1023
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,880
Have you been drinking?

1024
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,920
You're allergic to alcohol.

1025
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,240
If your face is swollen,

1026
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,800
How are you going to film tomorrow?

1027
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,720
Sure enough

1028
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,120
I know that

1029
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,480
You should have a drink.

1030
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,360
You're popular now.

1031
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,760
You can do whatever you want.

1032
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,200
Don't you want the image?

1033
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,800
What image?

1034
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,320
Is the image you set for me?

1035
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,880
I'm working with your performance.

1036
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,800
You chose to enter the industry.

1037
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,400
You should be responsible for your choice.

1038
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,480
No job is

1039
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,040
You don't have to pay the price.

1040
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,840
You can't just enjoy

1041
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,480
Fame and fortune in front of the camera.

1042
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,960
And refused to compromise.

1043
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,440
Stop lecturing me.

1044
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,560
I'm tired of it.

1045
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,240
I've had enough.

1046
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,880
This life without freedom,

1047
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,600
Cancel the contract.

1048
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,480
Anyway, I'm popular now.

1049
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,480
And I won't worry about finding it.

1050
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,920
The company that paid the penalty for me.

1051
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,320
You think it's red?

1052
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,560
It's all because of you.

1053
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,640
You used to be

1054
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
The unknown newbies,

1055
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,200
I'm the one who took you

1056
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,720
I'll take you to the station.

1057
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,800
The director and the capital.

1058
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,240
At that time,

1059
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,440
Aren't you like this?

1060
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,240
At that time,

1061
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,200
At least you know how to be grateful.

1062
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,640
Remember to call me sister.

1063
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,040
You're popular now.

1064
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,040
You're a big name.

1065
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Causing trouble everywhere.

1066
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,320
When I didn't solve it,

1067
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,160
I'm telling you,

1068
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,800
I'm your manager.

1069
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,880
I'm not your nanny.

1070
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,560
I hate your face.

1071
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,320
It seems that people all over the world

1072
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,640
It's impossible to leave you.

1073
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,400
Do you know why?

1074
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,200
Are all the people avoiding you?

1075
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,600
That's because

1076
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,920
You're too arrogant.

1077
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,680
You don't care.

1078
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,600
The feelings of others.

1079
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,960
In your eyes, only work

1080
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
Only gains and losses,

1081
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,120
So you are doomed to be unloved.

1082
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,800
That's why Lin Huan left you.
