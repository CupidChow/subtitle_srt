1
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
Besides, in the adult world,

2
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,520
the standard to measure the pros and cons.

3
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,160
It has never been in front of

4
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,160
love, love and bread,

5
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,600
I won't get married for bread.

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,240
But I will strive for bread.

7
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,680
Let love be free from hunger.

8
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,280
I can buy bread myself,

9
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,840
but I can't buy love.

10
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,560
That's why love is so precious.

11
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,760
Your bread love theory

12
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,080
is quite interesting.

13
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,080
You must think it's funny.

14
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,960
It's not like

15
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,040
you look like

16
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,400
a girl I know,

17
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
She once

18
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
said the same thing to you,

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,160
I loved her without hesitation.

20
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,240
even

21
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,600
In spite of the objections of the people around us,

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,080
what happened next?

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,960
Is she happy?

24
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm not happy at all.

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,840
But the man

26
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
who made her unhappy,

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,800
But you live a happy life.

28
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,560
And fell in love with another woman.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,560
I forgot about that girl.

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,080
But if that man

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,960
really had feelings for him,

32
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,520
If he forgets,

33
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,160
it will be hard for him.

34
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,480
In fact, I think,

35
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,120
so what if I remember it?

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,560
I'm just torturing myself.

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,440
Instead of being stuck in memories,

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,480
you won't be happy.

39
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,360
It's better to choose to forget.

40
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,560
Isn't it a good thing?

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,600
But he has

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,160
no right to forget.

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,960
And I have no right

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,480
to fall in love with someone else.

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,000
This is the first time

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,320
I've seen you so emotional.

47
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,480
That girl should be

48
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,040
very important to you.

49
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,840
I lost my cool.

51
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,000
It's okay.

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,720
It's fine.

53
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,840
At least, I think

54
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,120
you look like a real person.

55
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
Mr. Ji,

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,120
Zhang Le resigned.

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,120
He left a letter of resignation

58
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
yesterday and left.

59
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,520
The HR department couldn't reach him either.

60
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,360
Personnel asked me to tell you,

61
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,320
in case something happened to him.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,399
According to my observation,

63
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,600
Zhang Le,

64
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,880
It's a typical self-personality.

65
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,640
Introverted and thoughtful,

66
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,920
and like to dig into the bottom of the line,

67
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,680
Something really happened to him.

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,320
Something happened,

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,040
but it wasn't Zhang Le,

70
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,600
-It's Yi Fashion. -Bad

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,280
news for

72
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,520
Mr. Ji.

73
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,720
Ruiqi Group's Gao Ding series,

74
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,560
and Wing Fashion's

75
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,400
Venus Creative Event,

76
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,480
It's exactly the same.

77
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,760
If the design of the interior is leaked out,

78
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,400
that's Zhang Le.

79
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,800
No wonder he resigned in a hurry.

80
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,160
She went to Ruiqi.

81
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,600
Sida

82
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,560
What about Ruonan?

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,240
She

84
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,480
went out with Zhao Yucheng.

85
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,440
Zhao Yucheng,

86
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,320
where did you go?

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,840
How would I know?

88
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
I think if you keep wasting your time

89
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,640
like this,

90
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,000
Then our products for the new season

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,280
will be completely aborted.

92
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,920
It will cause huge losses.

93
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
This will directly affect

94
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,680
the sales performance of the whole year,

95
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,680
Besides, peers and consumers,

96
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,800
they will definitely have some opinions

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,840
about Wing Fashion.

98
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
This will affect

99
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,040
our corporate image.

100
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,760
The current situation is unavoidable,

101
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,800
so we must race against time to deal with it quickly.

102
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,880
Do you have any countermeasures?

103
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,480
My proposal is a two-pronged approach.

104
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,520
What about the outside world?

105
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,400
We'll sue Zhang Le and Ruiqi

106
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,840
through legal channels,

107
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,600
Internally,

108
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,000
we need to speed up the production process.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,760
As soon as possible

110
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,880
in the shortest possible time,

111
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,080
Put the product on the market.

112
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,720
In this case,

113
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
we can reduce the loss.

114
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,320
What do you think?

115
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,040
In my opinion on the contrary,

116
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,960
I think production should be stopped,

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ruiqi has released

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
a promotional video for the new season,

119
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,240
No matter how fast we produce,

120
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,560
we can't go public at the same time.

121
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,280
And speeding up production

122
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,400
will lead to a decline in the quality of clothes.

123
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,920
I can't bet on

124
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,720
Yi Fashion's reputation.

125
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,200
I think our priority

126
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,840
right now,

127
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
It needs to be redesigned.

128
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
Zhang Le took it away,

129
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,840
It's just a few design drawings

130
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,000
and a concept.

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,920
It can't be the climate.

132
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,960
If it's just a copycat,

133
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
I won't care about the plagiarism.

134
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,120
Of course I have to.

135
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,080
But not now.

136
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,120
It's not too late for the legal department

137
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,040
to prepare the prosecution documents,

138
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,440
and then sue Zhang Le after our design

139
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,000
is put into production again.

140
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,560
Le Zhang

141
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,840
Shouldn't we sue Ruiqi?

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,760
That's right.

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,640
Even if we sue Ruiqi,

144
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,840
we will use Zhang Le

145
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,880
as a scapegoat.

146
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,560
We might as well

147
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,840
be magnanimous.

148
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,080
Don't give the media more opportunities

149
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,280
to add fuel to it,

150
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,200
That's right.

151
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,280
Directors,

152
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,200
I believe,

153
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,680
This plagiarism incident,

154
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,480
will not affect

155
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,400
Wing Fashion,

156
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,040
Mr. Ji,

157
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,600
you're amazing.

158
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,280
Something happens when you say something happens.

159
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,920
But what happened to Ruiqi?

160
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,600
It feels like it's against us.

161
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,960
Hey,

162
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,120
Sida?

163
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Hello, brother.

164
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,600
You finally answered the phone.

165
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,520
Tell me,

166
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,120
have you noticed?

167
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,960
If there's something wrong with the man

168
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,840
next to the male sister,

169
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,440
You mean Zhao Yucheng, right?

170
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,040
Yes, yes, yes. That's him.

171
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,960
How is he?

172
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
What do you think of him?

173
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,200
I just want Ruonan

174
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,040
to stay away from him.

175
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,480
Brother,

176
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,560
You're finally united with me.

177
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,440
In the past two days,

178
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,520
I've been worried sick.

179
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,880
Zhao Yucheng,

180
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,160
who bothers Ruonan every day

181
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
for work reasons,

182
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,680
I'm worried that if you get cheated,

183
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,400
you know what, brother?

184
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,800
Although both of you are my rivals in love,

185
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,280
I trust you more.

186
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,160
Because I can tell that

187
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,400
you care about Ruonan,

188
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,640
So Zhao Yucheng is

189
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,800
having dinner with Ruonan now,

190
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,440
I'm afraid of him.

191
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,240
What?

192
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,560
Let's eat

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,840
Where is it?

194
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:53,960
Hello,

195
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,640
thank you.

196
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,800
Hello,

197
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,640
thank you.

198
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,600
Mr. Zhao,

199
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,520
this is the proposal for the new album,

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,360
I asked you to come here for dinner,

201
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,560
not for work.

202
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,480
Besides,

203
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,880
about Sida's album proposal,

204
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,280
Why did you show it to me?

205
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,800
It's not just an album,

206
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,360
it's one of the publicity directions,

207
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,280
This is a publicity campaign

208
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,880
after the release of the new album,

209
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,960
When the time comes,

210
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,000
we will promote it

211
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,640
online and offline,

212
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,520
Mr. Zhao is so sincere

213
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,600
about cooperation.

214
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,400
With our new plan,

215
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,200
we can take advantage of today,

216
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,440
I'll give you a sneak peek.

217
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,640
You're really

218
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,080
a good agent.

219
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,919
I really don't miss any chance.

220
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,000
The artist who sells you,

221
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
I mean,

222
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,600
If this album

223
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,440
sells well,

224
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
If you really want to consider

225
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,800
Sida as your spokesperson,

226
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,560
Both of us will benefit.

227
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,440
Really?

228
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,800
He'll be worth a lot of money in the future.

229
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,000
Have you considered starting your own business?

230
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,680
If so,

231
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
I can be your investor,

232
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,800
Me

233
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,520
I don't plan to do that for now.

234
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,560
Just for now.

235
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,040
What if we have one in the future?

236
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,080
I can't say for sure.

237
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,160
I think you're

238
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,320
a good investment project,

239
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
I'm very interested.

240
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,040
Thank you.

241
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,200
Besides, I don't think

242
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,960
your current boss

243
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,200
would appreciate a talent like you.

244
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,320
Over the years,

245
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,560
my boss has taught me a lot,

246
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,280
He also helped me a lot.

247
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,880
If I didn't

248
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,720
have our boss,

249
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,960
I wouldn't be who I am now.

250
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,600
What's more,

251
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,320
Yu Xing's resources are actually very good,

252
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,560
It's good for

253
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,480
Sida's future development.

254
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,400
So I've never thought about

255
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,280
leaving the company,

256
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,200
People in the mall,

257
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,120
if only they were half

258
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,440
as loyal as you.

259
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,920
It doesn't matter. You can

260
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,200
think about it

261
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,720
as much as you want.

262
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,880
If you have any ideas,

263
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,800
you can come to me,

264
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,320
Mr. Zhao, you're really

265
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,760
a casual person,

266
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,600
I have a proposal.

267
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,720
So I took you down.

268
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,440
We're just casual acquaintances,

269
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,000
so I don't want to be

270
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,520
just casual acquaintances with you.

271
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,720
I need to get to know you better.

272
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,840
Drink something. Drink something.

273
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,880
We have a light meal.

274
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,080
This kid,

275
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,320
you look ruddy and shiny recently,

276
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,520
Are you saying I'm fat?

277
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,320
Have I gained weight?

278
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,640
Is my face round?

279
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,680
Is it round?

280
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,360
Did I say "fat"?

281
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,080
Actually, it's good that you're fat.

282
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,640
You used to be too thin,

283
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,320
It's more beautiful now.

284
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
You don't understand.

285
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,800
Being a model requires

286
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
sharp edges and corners to be photographed.

287
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,040
At the end of the day,

288
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,080
you can't have any fat at all.

289
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,440
Bone is the beauty.

290
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,920
You're exaggerating.

291
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,080
Nervous.

292
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,320
I think you're doing well now.

293
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,960
No way.

294
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,960
I need to go on a diet.

295
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
It took me a long time to lose weight.

296
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,000
I can't go back to the past.

297
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,760
Me,

298
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,200
Shadow.

299
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,600
Shadow?

300
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,840
Yes.

301
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,720
A little more,

302
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,080
and then this lip,

303
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,840
I'll drink this then.

304
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
And that lip,

305
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,120
help me make it fuller.

306
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,720
Got it?

307
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,800
Don't let anyone see

308
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
that I've gained weight,

309
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,600
So fast.

310
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,040
What took you so long?

311
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,120
We were supposed to have dinner together.

312
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,080
What do you want to eat?

313
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,840
Do you know that?

314
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,080
I can't even wear

315
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,040
the smallest size clothes now.

316
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,080
Why are you so angry?

317
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,240
You're in good condition

318
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,520
now. You're healthy.

319
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,960
Your complexion is ruddy. Besides,

320
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,280
you can't fit in a small size,

321
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,120
Just wear a bigger size.

322
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,440
Do you know you can't wear it?

323
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
The smallest size clothes,

324
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,360
for a model,

325
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,680
What does it mean?

326
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm a model.

327
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,440
I can't be fat.

328
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,960
Being fat ruined

329
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,000
my love and my career,

330
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,560
It's all based on thinness.

331
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,160
I don't want to be that

332
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,880
fat guy that nobody likes,

333
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,120
Chen Fei'er, who said you gained weight?

334
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,880
Now I have to keep track

335
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,360
of your weight every day,

336
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,640
You're not fat at all.

337
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,200
You just have a little more collagen

338
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,240
on your face.

339
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,640
You are very healthy now.

340
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
As long as you keep going,

341
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,440
you can lose weight healthily.

342
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,000
Chen Fei'er,

343
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,320
the way you used to live,

344
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
You're overdrawing yourself.

345
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,240
That's sick.

346
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,560
Chen Fei'er, don't think too much.

347
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,160
Okay?

348
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
Even if you gain weight,

349
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,520
the person who likes you,

350
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,640
I'll still like you.

351
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,120
Even if no one likes you anymore,

352
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,240
don't you still have me?

353
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,320
I like you.

354
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
After thinking about it,

355
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,400
I still can't overcome

356
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,920
my fear of the past.

357
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,800
I'd rather be morbidly thin.

358
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,840
But I don't want to be

359
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
a healthy fat man either,

360
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,360
I want a lot of people to love me,

361
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,120
and I want everyone to pay attention to me.

362
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,240
It's not enough for you

363
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,120
to like her alone.

364
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
So from today on,

365
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,240
you are no longer my personal doctor.

366
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,680
Thank you for taking care of me

367
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
during this time,

368
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,840
You're fired.

369
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,480
Thank you for sending me back.

370
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,120
Don't be so polite.

371
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,240
I'll go upstairs now.

372
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,600
Be my girlfriend.

373
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,560
Mr. Zhao,

374
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,480
you're great.

375
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,640
But I just

376
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,720
regard you as my working partner.

377
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,600
Don't reject me in a hurry.

378
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,280
We have plenty of time anyway.

379
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,880
When you

380
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,440
get to know me well,

381
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,760
Then make a decision.

382
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,160
Whether I accept it or reject it,

383
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,600
I'll respect it, okay?

384
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,720
All right,

385
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,800
I'm going upstairs now.

386
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,520
-Thank you. -Good night.

387
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,160
Good night.

388
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,880
How long are you going

389
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,720
to pester Ruonan?

390
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,240
What on earth do you want?

391
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,960
I just want to torture you.

392
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,240
You'll never forget Su Xiao

393
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,560
for the rest of your life,

394
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,680
Yes.

395
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,840
I'm sorry for Su Xiao.

396
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,120
But that's my own business.

397
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,280
It has nothing to do with you.

398
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,240
Are you qualified to criticize me?

399
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,840
Since that year,

400
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,880
you took Su Xiao away from me.

401
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,760
Now you're chasing Ruonan.

402
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Now you still think that

403
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,000
I stole Su Xiao.

404
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,160
You really haven't made any progress

405
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,520
over the years.

406
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,840
You really don't have the right to love Su Xiao?

407
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,880
What about you?

408
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,800
Do you love Su Xiao?

409
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,760
You love her, don't you?

410
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,520
Then why did you come

411
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,200
after Dugu Ruonan?

412
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,640
Aren't you the same as me?

413
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,280
My love for Su Xiao,

414
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,080
is not something people like you can understand.

415
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,760
That's right.

416
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,760
When I first met Ruonan,

417
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,120
It's because of you.

418
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,560
The more you care about her,

419
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,840
the more interested I am in her.

420
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,280
If you're doing this

421
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,360
to piss me off,

422
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,040
Then you made it.

423
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,080
If you

424
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,440
approached Dugu Ruonan

425
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,600
to get back at me,

426
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,840
Then I won't let you go.

427
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,760
I will protect Ruonan.

428
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,920
Have you ever thought,

429
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,440
I'm really in love

430
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,960
with Dugu Ruonan?

431
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,400
As I said,

432
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,320
I'm after Ruonan,

433
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,040
It's because of you.

434
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,800
But I never said that

435
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,880
I would hurt Ruonan,

436
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,320
And in my opinion,

437
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,760
you're the one who hurt Ruonan,

438
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,120
You should be the one

439
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,520
who left Ruonan.

440
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,520
Because you've

441
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,840
failed Su Xiao.

442
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,440
How is it going now?

443
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,320
Are you going to ruin Ruonan's life

444
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,440
as well?

445
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,079
I don't think

446
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,640
you deserve to love her.

447
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,400
That's between Su Xiao and me.

448
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,000
You have no right to blame him.

449
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,599
Of course I'm qualified.

450
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,440
Because Su Xiao is my sister.

451
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,040
She's my beloved sister.

452
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,560
I swore to protect her

453
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,920
for the rest of my life.

454
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,680
But in the end,

455
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,880
you ruined it.

456
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,800
Su Xiao loves you so much,

457
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,720
but you don't trust her.

458
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,080
I can't even tell that

459
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,000
she's lying.

460
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,160
Aren't you a psychologist?

461
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,400
Can't you see through

462
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,200
other people's minds?

463
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,520
But why can't you

464
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,120
understand Su Xiao?

465
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
That's why I'm more determined.

466
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,920
You really don't deserve Su Xiao.

467
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,640
You're not good enough for Ruonan.

468
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,120
I'm sorry.

469
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,440
You shouldn't apologize to me.

470
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,240
You should apologize to Su Xiao.

471
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,720
Have you ever thought that

472
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
Su Xiao might be watching you all the time.

473
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,280
Watching you fall in love

474
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,000
with someone else bit by bit,

475
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,280
And what I want to do,

476
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,160
is that I will never allow

477
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
Su Xiao to be in your life,

478
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,840
Just a passer-by,

479
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,120
I won't let you go.

480
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,160
Su Xiao loves you so much,

481
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,880
but you don't trust her.

482
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,240
I can't even tell that

483
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,080
she's lying.

484
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,560
Aren't you a psychologist?

485
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,560
Can't you see through

486
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
other people's minds?

487
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,680
But why can't you

488
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,320
understand Su Xiao?

489
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,680
We're back.

490
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,640
Mom and brother are back.

491
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,360
You're back.

492
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,040
Come on,

493
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,920
Say hello to your dad and sister.

494
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,400
Don't be embarrassed

495
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,360
to call me.

496
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,520
He's not my father.

497
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
What is he talking about?

498
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,040
He's not my father.

499
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,400
Don't say that again.

500
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,720
All right, all right.

501
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
Give him more time.

502
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,680
Come and sit here.

503
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,480
Brother, why are you crying?

504
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,720
Are you hurt?

505
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,240
Let me treat you.

506
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,360
Are you feeling better?

507
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,720
Yes.

508
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,960
I've always wanted

509
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,800
a brother. I'm so happy

510
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,920
that you're here.

511
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,360
I promise

512
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,560
I won't let you get hurt again.

513
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,720
Brother, you'll protect me too.

514
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,480
Am I right?

515
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,640
Yes.

516
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,920
I'll protect you.

517
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,280
I'll always protect you.

518
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,840
According to the data

519
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,560
of each test report,

520
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,600
It can be judged that

521
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,280
Miss Su is suffering from

522
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,520
advanced breast cancer.

523
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,000
I suggest an immediate surgery,

524
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,640
or else, if it's delayed,

525
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,120
Once the cancer spreads,

526
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,560
it will be difficult to control the disease.

527
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,080
He's my boyfriend.

528
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,040
You mean he's a psychologist?

529
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,200
But why?

530
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,440
He can treat others.

531
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
But you didn't know

532
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,840
you were lying?

533
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,760
I don't know what you think.

534
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,320
But in my opinion,

535
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,960
he doesn't understand you at all.

536
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,320
He doesn't trust you. He's not good enough

537
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
for your brother. Stop it.

538
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,120
Stop it.

539
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,080
You did so much for him,

540
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,280
but he fell in love with another woman.

541
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,360
I will make him

542
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,240
remember you forever,

543
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,240
No matter how much it costs.

544
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,080
What's wrong?

545
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
Who bullied you?

546
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,240
I'm that jerk.

547
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,800
I fired Ali

548
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,080
because I was afraid of getting fat.

549
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,600
I'm afraid no one will like me,

550
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,480
or I won't be a supermodel.

551
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,920
I'm the

552
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
selfish one,

553
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,360
You vain bastard.

554
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,080
Silly girl.

555
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,280
Come on.

556
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Tell me,

557
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,120
if I tell you like this,

558
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,960
Will Ali be sad?

559
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,560
I don't think he'll want to

560
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,680
talk to me anymore.

561
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,600
Since you care so much about him,

562
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,480
why do you have to say

563
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,480
such harsh words?

564
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,840
Because,

565
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,840
get close.

566
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,680
That's why he's so unscrupulous.

567
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,360
Are you in love with him?

568
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,280
It's impossible.

569
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,200
He and I are just friends.

570
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,760
And he's not

571
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,720
my type,

572
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,920
But I don't like him,

573
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,640
but,

574
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,720
I like

575
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,640
being friends with him.

576
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,480
What a jerk.

577
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,040
Ji Mo is a jerk.

578
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,280
Ji Mo

579
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,640
He's the one who approached me.

580
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,120
He's also the one who cares about me.

581
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,680
But after he ran away,

582
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,000
there was no news at all.

583
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,640
Is it my fault?

584
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,480
Ruonan,

585
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,760
have you ever thought about it,

586
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,600
Ji Mo is always like this.

587
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,400
Maybe with you,

588
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,000
and the relationship between you,

589
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,440
It has nothing to do with it.

590
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,120
What are you trying to say?

591
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,280
There's something

592
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,600
I've always wanted to tell you,

593
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,680
Ji Mo's ex-girlfriend,

594
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,960
Su Xiao, is dead.

595
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,760
I've thought about many possibilities,

596
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,680
but I've never thought about this possibility.

597
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,320
I also said a lot of

598
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,600
cruel words to him,

599
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,400
He didn't tell me anything.

600
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,840
Why didn't he

601
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,960
tell me the truth,

602
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,880
Maybe he wants you to give up.

603
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,280
That's why I didn't tell you.

604
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
I believe Ji Mo

605
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,200
has tried very hard to love.

606
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
But it turns out.

607
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,280
He can't love you.

608
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,560
Because there's nothing he can do.

609
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,040
Get out of the shadow

610
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,840
of Su Xiao's death.

611
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,120
Now,

612
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,400
he's punishing himself,

613
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,640
It has nothing to do with you.

614
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Don't blame yourself.

615
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,240
Then he can tell me,

616
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,960
at least I can help him out.

617
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,160
I'm telling you,

618
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,360
if he doesn't want

619
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,200
to come out,

620
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
How can you help me?

621
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,840
You've already experienced

622
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,880
Lin Huan,

623
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,840
You accompanied him

624
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
through the lowest ebb of his career,

625
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,240
But what happened?

626
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,520
You're already in your thirties,

627
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,240
you can't afford to waste or gamble.

628
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,320
Not to mention Ji Mo.

629
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,520
He has a psychological problem.

630
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,840
This kind of psychological problem,

631
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,280
There's no end in sight.

632
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,160
Do you understand?

633
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,160
What if I want to take a gamble?

634
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,200
Let me tell you this,

635
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,680
if your opponent

636
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,800
is a living person,

637
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,880
Maybe you still have a chance to win.

638
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,360
But the other party is dead.

639
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,280
You don't even have a chance to compete.

640
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,040
Do you understand?

641
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,840
Because her best look,

642
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,000
has been fixed at that moment.

643
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,200
You can't erase

644
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,760
her memory in Ji Mo's heart,

645
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,200
Trust me,

646
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,000
don't compete with the dead.

647
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,720
You're going to lose.

648
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,320
Hey,

649
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,600
Ali,

650
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,920
it's Ruonan,

651
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,160
Is Ji Mo with you?

652
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,840
Do you know where he is?

653
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,320
Ji Mo.

654
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,920
Ji Mo,

655
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,320
Ji Mo,

656
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,320
Are you there?

657
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,440
Didn't you say

658
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,520
you don't want to see me again?

659
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,840
But I still have something

660
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,080
to tell you,

661
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,480
I already know.

662
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,080
Knowing that Su Xiao is dead,

663
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,600
you've been living

664
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,960
in pain and memories,

665
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,240
You don't dare to love

666
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,640
and reject all the possibilities of love.

667
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,360
You've been punishing yourself.

668
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,640
I admit,

669
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,320
when I found out

670
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,160
Su Xiao was gone,

671
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,440
I also thought about backing down,

672
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,000
because I'm not confident

673
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,640
that I can take her place.

674
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,800
I'm also a person

675
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,360
who's afraid of getting hurt,

676
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,120
But for love,

677
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,000
I want to be brave again.

678
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,160
I also know that you have

679
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,600
a big wound in your heart,

680
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,200
I'm willing to accompany you.

681
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,880
Wait for the wound to heal slowly.

682
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,840
Can you give us

683
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,000
another chance?

684
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,480
Thank you for saying these words to me.

685
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,080
But,

686
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,400
I'm not sure

687
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,560
when my wound will heal?

688
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,800
I can't keep you waiting for nothing.

689
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,400
I've already hurt

690
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,120
a woman,

691
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,760
I can't hurt you anymore.

692
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,400
So,

693
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,320
you are more suitable for a good man,

694
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,000
Good for you.

695
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,360
Don't make any changes

696
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,360
or compromises for me.

697
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,640
So you're rejecting me?

698
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,440
Have you thought it through?

699
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,880
For someone like me,

700
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,240
I won't repeat

701
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,560
what I just said.

702
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,760
You can leave.

703
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,600
In this way, in my heart,

704
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,720
you are still the one that makes me feel excited.

705
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,680
Ruo Nan who makes me proud.

706
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Don't be sad.

707
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,720
There's nothing to cry about.

708
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,560
Come on.

709
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,200
Drinking in the morning,

710
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,520
celebrating my breakup

711
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,800
and my dismissal

712
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,160
from Fei'er.

713
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,400
You don't have to spend

714
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,120
24 hours at last,

715
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,440
It's time to be on standby.

716
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
I can finally arrange

717
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
my own time.

718
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,840
You're lovelorn,

719
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
too. Don't talk nonsense.

720
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,800
We're doctors

721
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,840
and patients,

722
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,560
How could a doctor

723
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,800
like a patient?

724
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,160
All right, all right.

725
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,600
I know I can't

726
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,840
hide it from your perspective, okay?

727
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,320
He's my brother.

728
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,280
Sida, wait for me.

729
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Where are you going?

730
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,960
You don't have to worry about

731
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,600
where I'm going. You're a lady,

732
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,280
I don't know how to do anything.

733
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,040
Don't stay here.

734
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,920
Go where you should go.

735
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,760
What's wrong with Miss?

736
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,520
I think you're

737
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,200
prejudiced against me.

738
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,800
I don't know. I can learn from you.

739
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,080
Did you know

740
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,920
everything at first?

741
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,160
Someone taught you that, too.

742
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,680
Yes.

743
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,040
At first, just like you,

744
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,200
I didn't know anything.

745
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,120
Everyone says I'm a loser,

746
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,840
so do I.

747
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,040
But when I met Ruonan,

748
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,160
I changed my mind.

749
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,400
She has been encouraging me

750
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,440
and supporting me. Do you understand?

751
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,280
Sida?

752
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,800
Did you quarrel with Dugu Ruonan

753
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,080
because of me,

754
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,160
That's why you did this to me.

755
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,680
Yes.

756
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,280
I know you like her.

757
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,720
But,

758
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:57,920
You.

759
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,200
His attitude towards me

760
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,280
is too different.

761
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,560
If you want me to change

762
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,440
my attitude towards you,

763
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,280
Just change your attitude

764
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,320
towards her, okay?

765
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,280
I don't like her for a reason.

766
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,080
What reason?

767
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,120
Tell me,

768
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,440
tell me,

769
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,800
I just don't like it anyway.

770
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,280
I don't like her from top to bottom. Whatever. Anyway,

771
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,120
I like her.

772
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,240
She's not worthy of your love.

773
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,320
You don't even know

774
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,160
who she is?

775
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,480
She only cares about profit,

776
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,840
and she said that Zhao Yucheng

777
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,320
is a useful person.

778
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,120
A woman like that

779
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,240
won't fall for you.

780
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,720
Silly girl.

781
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,960
Are you done?

782
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,800
I don't want to hear

783
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,880
your nonsense anymore, okay?

784
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,400
I'm not talking nonsense.

785
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,160
Sida

786
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,280
Sida, don't be mad.

787
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,280
I was wrong. I was wrong.

788
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,120
From now on, I promise,

789
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,480
I will never speak ill of her again.

790
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,520
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

791
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,560
Don't follow me anymore.

792
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,440
You have your own private car,

793
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,040
why don't you take it?

794
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,440
You insisted on taking the bus.

795
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,560
What you've done

796
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,880
is really meaningless.

797
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,120
Don't get in the car.

798
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,240
Hello.

799
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,720
Miss, get in the car.

800
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,000
It's all your fault.

801
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Because you're here,

802
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,400
I can't get on the bus.

803
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,760
Stop following me.

804
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,240
Sida?

805
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,280
Sida?

806
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,840
Sida?

807
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,720
Why are you here?

808
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
You just asked me,

809
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,080
why did you take the bus?

810
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
Because you're in the car,

811
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
I want to get closer to you.

812
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,120
You asked me why

813
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,160
I didn't like Ruonan,

814
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,000
That's because she's my rival in love,

815
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,159
because I like you.

816
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,000
Ruonan.

817
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,760
Ruonan.

818
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,480
Why is everyone paying attention to me?

819
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,400
Is it obvious that I've fallen out of love?

820
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,800
Mr. Zhao of Ruiqi Group

821
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,760
is different.

822
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,520
You even sent flowers

823
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,720
with such good taste,

824
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,200
I just looked it up online,

825
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,560
and it's a gradient tulip.

826
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,200
It costs a lot of money

827
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,280
to buy a bunch of rare varieties from abroad.

828
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,040
The pursuit is so fierce,

829
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,920
which woman can withstand it?

830
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,280
That's right. No one can handle it.

831
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,560
What are you looking at?

832
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,520
Ruonan … Ruonan … Ruonan … Ruonan … You

833
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,360
don't have to work?

834
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,840
Let's go.

835
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,440
Sida

836
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,960
Sida, congratulations.

837
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Sis is going to be

838
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,360
Mr. Zhao's girlfriend.

839
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,360
Looks like the spokesperson of Ruiqi,

840
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,520
you're the only one.

841
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,440
-Let's go. -Hello. Do you like the

842
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,600
flowers Mr.

843
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,360
Zhao gave you?

844
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,800
What you're doing

845
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,480
will embarrass me.

846
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,360
I know

847
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,320
sending flowers may be a little vulgar

848
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,480
for girls,

849
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,960
But these gradient tulips,

850
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,160
I asked someone

851
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,280
to fly them here from Holland.

852
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,360
Because today is

853
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,640
the first day I pursue you,

854
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,600
And the flower language of tulip is confession,

855
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,680
I just want to use it

856
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,160
to express my love for you.

857
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,920
Sister.

858
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,800
This flower.

859
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,240
A client gave it to me.

860
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,360
Really?

861
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,000
This is my new publicity plan.

862
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,360
In the next step,

863
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,920
I plan to focus on

864
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,880
the Internet,

865
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,280
Ruonan,

866
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,160
you made this overnight.

867
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,960
This is more detailed than the proposal

868
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,320
made by our publicity team,

869
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,160
Yes,

870
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,960
it's amazing.

871
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,440
As a propagandist,

872
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,120
sometimes it's like

873
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,040
a man pursuing a woman,

874
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,160
You have to consider your own advantages,

875
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,040
and then grasp each other's preferences.

876
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,120
At the right time,

877
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,160
at the right place,

878
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,400
Make the most appropriate way to pursue it.

879
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,400
Take him down in one fell swoop.

880
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,560
No way.

881
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,960
You can't do that.

882
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,560
Sida

883
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,560
Do you have a problem with the publicity plan?

884
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,960
No,

885
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,680
no, no, no,

886
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,520
It's great.

887
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,000
You've been under

888
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,760
a lot of pressure lately.

889
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,320
I've been under a lot of pressure lately.

890
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,560
I don't think Zhao Yucheng really

891
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,640
chased me away.

892
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,560
Sida?

893
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,920
Sida?

894
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,840
Do you have to give me an explanation?

895
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,040
Confess?

896
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
What confession?

897
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,680
Don't pretend you don't know,

898
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,560
don't you remember,

899
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,880
My confession to you,

900
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,800
have you forgotten that we kissed?

901
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,360
Qiansha, stay away from me. Qiansha,

902
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,680
tell me,

903
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,800
Will you accept me or not?

904
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,600
Do you like me or not?

905
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,000
If you don't accept or like me,

906
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,880
why don't you like me?

907
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,560
I don't like

908
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,080
it. I see.

909
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,280
because

910
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,800
That kiss was your first kiss.

911
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,440
Am I right?

912
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,760
I'm the woman who took away your first kiss.

913
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,000
Don't worry,

914
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,360
I'll be responsible for you.

915
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,160
Sida?

916
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,400
You've gone too far.

917
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,040
I also want to save face, okay?

918
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,280
That's how disgusting I am.

919
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,200
I'm in a heterosexual

920
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,560
relationship,

921
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,360
Obstacle.

922
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,480
Obstacle!

923
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,440
Get away from me!

924
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,280
Then.

925
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,160
When you were

926
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,040
with Dugu Ruonan,

927
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,120
It won't be like this.

928
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,880
Sida

929
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,960
Sida, are you okay?

930
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,200
Don't scare me, Sida.

931
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,720
Sida, wake up!

932
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,760
Don't scare me.

933
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,120
Sida, don't scare me.

934
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,560
What's wrong with you, Sida

935
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,000
Sida

936
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,800
Sida, don't scare me.

937
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,480
Is there anyone?

938
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,680
Someone fainted.

939
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,120
Guards,

940
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:57,960
Sida?

941
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,600
Is there anyone?

942
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,120
This is not the fabric

943
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,320
I want. Really?

944
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,800
This is the fabric

945
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
I bought myself,

946
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,680
Have you checked every batch?

947
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,120
Some of the fabrics here

948
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,120
are made of silk,

949
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,880
Some of them use chemical fiber silk

950
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,880
to simulate the astringency and elasticity of silk,

951
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,200
The chemical fiber simulation silk is too slippery,

952
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,400
feel it yourself,

953
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,960
As the supervisor,

954
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,400
don't you have any common sense?

955
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,280
I didn't know the other party would adulterate

956
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,080
the following batches of fabrics,

957
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,400
I didn't take a closer look.

958
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:49,880
Withdraw.

959
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,880
Redo it.

960
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,040
I can't do it.

961
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,920
The factory has shipped the goods.

962
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,120
If you do it again,

963
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,080
it will take a lot of time and effort.

964
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,000
It will delay the delivery.

965
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,160
Yes, Mr. Ji.

966
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,600
If we call it off now,

967
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,520
the company will lose a lot.

968
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,560
I won't let this batch of fabrics

969
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,440
flow into the market.

970
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,680
This will not only affect

971
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,000
Yi Fashion's reputation,

972
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,520
What if you're allergic

973
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,240
to this fabric?

974
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,120
Who will bear the consequences?

975
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,320
Are you going to bear it?

976
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,080
My idea is to educate people,

977
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,240
not harm them.

978
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,840
Withdraw.

979
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,680
Redo it.

980
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,600
Mr. Ji,

981
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,720
you're a little

982
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,920
emotional today.

983
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,880
It's rare for you to lose your temper like this.

984
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,280
They don't even understand

985
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,240
what this means to me,

986
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:45,840
Meaning.

987
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,960
What do you mean?

988
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,960
You don't need to know.

989
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,360
Get out.

990
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,520
What did you do to Sida?

991
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,400
Why did he faint?

992
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,240
I really,

993
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,320
I didn't do anything just now.

994
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,560
But it's

995
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,320
what I did before,

996
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,560
It doesn't count.

997
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,480
What did you do to him?

998
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,640
Nothing.

999
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,400
Nothing What is it?

1000
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:26,920
I...

1001
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,960
I just kissed him,

1002
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,920
What?
