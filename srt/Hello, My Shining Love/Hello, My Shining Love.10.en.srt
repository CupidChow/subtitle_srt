1
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,680
My physique is good.

2
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,040
Go now. Don't catch a cold.

3
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,400
The smell of a neat freak

4
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,560
is quite good.

5
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,680
It smells so good.

6
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,600
I didn't expect that,

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,880
He's quite considerate.

8
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,480
What am I doing?

9
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,560
Dugu Ruonan,

10
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,680
don't smell her clothes

11
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,560
like a pervert, okay?

12
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
Can you stop talking to yourself?

13
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,720
You can do it.

14
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,000
Wake up, okay?

15
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,080
Okay, okay,

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
wake up.

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,800
Yes.

18
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Have a good rest.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,520
I'm leaving.

20
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,480
Where are you going?

21
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Go back to the car.

22
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
There are no extra quilts.

23
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,320
You can't lay the floor here.

24
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,040
You,

25
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,360
You can go back to the car in this way.

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,720
The car is so far away,

27
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,960
you'll catch a cold.

28
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,880
Besides, we don't have any gas now.

29
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,080
I can't turn on the heating.

30
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,440
You … You … Just stay.

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,960
Did you catch a cold?

32
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,360
Why is it so hot?

33
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,480
-Who are you? -Who

34
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,560
are you?

35
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,240
Fei'er,

36
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,360
you scared me to death.

37
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,400
If you don't go home in the middle of the night,

38
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,480
why are you squatting at the door?

39
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,960
Brother Ji Mo drove her away.

40
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,720
I thought they went home.

41
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,200
As a result, there was no one at home,

42
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,080
and Ji Mo's cell phone

43
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,040
couldn't reach Ji Mo

44
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,120
and he took her away.

45
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,760
They

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,880
haven't come home yet.

47
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,320
And they lost contact at the same time.

48
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,320
So he left me behind,

49
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,640
because Ruonan,

50
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,680
Do you think

51
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,440
something happened to them?

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,120
How could he not be in trouble?

53
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,320
Then I'll call the police. Why should I

54
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,000
call the police now?

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,640
Will the police

56
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,000
take care of your child?

57
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,640
What does this have to do

58
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
with having a baby?

59
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,240
It's none of your business.

60
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,320
I'm not leaving today anyway.

61
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,200
I'm going to sit here.

62
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,880
I want to see it.

63
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,200
When are they coming back?

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,760
Aren't you going to sit down?

65
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,280
Have a seat.

66
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,480
Are you asleep?

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,240
Not yet,

68
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
but after taking antipyretics,

69
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,480
I'm already sleepy.

70
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,880
You can't sleep?

71
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,840
Think about the whole day today.

72
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,360
It's really a magical day.

73
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,320
When things happened to me

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,640
at work,

75
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,560
I'll be very anxious.

76
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,240
The whole person

77
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,040
is like an arrow falling on the string,

78
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,440
Over the years,

79
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,640
I seem to have gotten used to

80
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,440
this state of tension,

81
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,280
I didn't expect you

82
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,200
to run away.

83
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,280
I can't believe it feels good.

84
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,600
and

85
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,360
I have an inexplicable sense of security.

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,880
Maybe it's because

87
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,200
I have you with me.

88
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,640
Actually, when you think about it,

89
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,520
you're not bad.

90
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,720
I don't have many friends.

91
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,280
I think

92
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,000
there are more people who hate me

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,760
than those who like me.

94
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,480
It doesn't matter.

95
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,080
I don't care

96
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,520
if others like me or not,

97
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,800
But for those who helped me,

98
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,480
I will always remember them.

99
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
From now on,

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,800
ask me for help if you need anything.

101
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,880
Just tell me.

102
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,960
As long as I can help.

103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,640
I will definitely help.

104
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,920
We'll be friends from now on.

105
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,680
A friend does everything,

106
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,720
but you're the only friend

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,920
who's so noisy.

108
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,720
No, no, no. I'm going to sleep.

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,040
Wake up.

110
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,240
When did you wake up?

111
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,160
I didn't sleep at all.

112
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,000
I wiped your sweat for the whole night,

113
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,040
and your fever didn't go down until dawn,

114
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,120
right? Thanks.

115
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,360
It's okay.

116
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,120
I can't sleep anyway.

117
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,840
Then.

118
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,440
Did I sleepwalk?

119
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
You slept like a log last night.

120
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,960
The snoring guy

121
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,160
didn't even say a word

122
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,200
in his dream. Why are you looking at me?

123
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,920
Nothing. Let's go.

124
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,160
Hurry up!

125
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
There are a lot of things to deal with in the company,

126
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,480
I just need to take care of you.

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Is this woman

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
more effective than medicine?

129
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,240
Fei'er,

130
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,720
Fei'er,

131
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,840
Wake up!

132
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,760
It's dawn.

133
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,000
What time is it?

134
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,760
It's ten o'clock.

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,360
It's 10: 00 p. m. and 10:

136
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,720
00 a. m.

137
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,360
Ji Mo and Ruonan haven't come back yet?

138
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,600
Are you okay?

139
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,360
foot numbness

140
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,520
Are you okay?

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,560
Where are you going? I won't wait.

142
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,920
You're not waiting anymore?

143
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,240
Don't wait any longer.

144
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,480
Why?

145
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,800
Wishful waiting

146
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,480
won't work out.

147
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,560
Ji Mo,

148
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,960
what did I think?

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,720
Did you come to me for treatment?

150
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,000
What's the result?

151
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,280
You're here to rest, aren't you?

152
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,360
Yes.

153
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,880
My mind is in a mess today.

154
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,360
I want to find a clean place

155
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,320
to relax.

156
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,000
What's wrong?

157
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,160
Your sleepwalking has been getting worse recently.

158
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,960
It's not getting worse.

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
Instead, it's getting better.

160
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,560
I'm not sleepwalking anymore.

161
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,240
And the quality of sleep

162
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,280
is better.

163
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,880
Then the medicine is working.

164
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,240
It's not because of the drugs.

165
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,040
It's because of one person,

166
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
one person,

167
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,200
Is there a possibility that

168
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,760
once I get close to someone,

169
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,960
It can relieve

170
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,000
sleepwalking,

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Look,

172
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,240
your sleepwalking

173
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,800
is rooted in your heart.

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,760
Maybe this person

175
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,360
gives you a sense of security.

176
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,880
It makes you rely on and trust.

177
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,680
In your subconscious,

178
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,480
you've already opened your heart

179
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,760
to this person.

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,720
A kind of

181
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,040
security dependency is established,

182
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,400
-Me and her. -Yeah.

183
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,360
It's impossible.

184
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,920
Don't

185
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,920
talk too much.

186
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,680
I suggest you

187
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,720
keep your current stable condition.

188
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Perhaps,

189
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,280
this person is the cure for you.

190
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,040
Yes

191
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Poison? There's absolutely

192
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
no way between us.

193
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,040
It's good that

194
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,120
you can't fight poison with poison.

195
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,800
Why didn't Song Zihao

196
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,000
tell me he woke up?

197
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,240
You're surprised, aren't you?

198
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,640
how

199
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,640
You didn't want to see me wake up,

200
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,120
so you didn't get what you wanted.

201
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,800
Sorry,

202
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,720
there must be

203
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,960
some misunderstanding between us.

204
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,640
I think we should sit down

205
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,680
and have a good chat.

206
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,320
Misunderstanding,

207
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,600
while I was in a coma in a car accident,

208
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,320
Find a new person to replace me right now.

209
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,600
You stole

210
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,840
all my commercials.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,360
This is a misunderstanding.

212
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:17,840
I'm

213
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,600
useless now.

214
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,200
He just kicked me away.

215
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
Now I'm awake.

216
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,240
If you keep posting it,

217
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,040
you can't make the deal, can you?

218
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,800
If that's

219
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
what a male sister wants,

220
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,720
You and I can forget about

221
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,040
our friendship, right?

222
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,240
You did this, didn't you?

223
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,320
Ruonan,

224
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,720
how can it have anything to do with me?

225
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
You signed a contract with Mr. Wu?

226
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,320
This is the truth.

227
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,280
I advise you,

228
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,480
you'd better not keep begging

229
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
and refuse to let go.

230
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,240
It's more or less a shame for yourself.

231
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,360
I left my face.

232
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,240
Don't think I don't know,

233
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,560
What are you doing in private?

234
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
Are you allowed to speak here?

235
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,160
Get lost!

236
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,480
I hope you can calm down

237
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,680
and think about it,

238
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,960
Don't ruin

239
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,120
our previous efforts

240
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,240
on impulse.

241
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,640
I've never thought about

242
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,520
giving up on you.

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,840
I cherish

244
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,160
the friendship between us.

245
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,480
Well,

246
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,760
if you terminate your contract with Sida now,

247
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,960
So I thought about staying

248
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Sida or me.

249
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,880
It's up to you.

250
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,200
Sida or you

251
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,520
are both important.

252
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,720
Now is not

253
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,040
the time to talk about it,

254
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,920
I won't give up on

255
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,240
any of my artists easily.

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,160
From now on,

257
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
you and I will make a clean break.

258
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,320
Zihao, why did you

259
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,080
change your agent?

260
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,480
Rumors about Dugu Ruonan

261
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,400
squeezing artists on the Internet,

262
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,960
Is that true?

263
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,720
Yes. Is that true?

264
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,280
Please tell me.

265
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,200
Please explain.

266
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,520
Yes, Zihao,

267
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,760
please respond.

268
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,040
Dugu Ruonan and I,

269
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,920
in terms of work philosophy,

270
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,640
Long-term discord,

271
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
all this time,

272
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,160
Dugu Ruonan

273
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,120
never takes into account

274
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,000
my personal demands,

275
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,680
You've arranged endless things for me.

276
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,640
Heavy work,

277
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,800
which has greatly exceeded

278
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,000
the load of my body,

279
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,640
It's dangerous to my health.

280
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,040
It also had a serious impact

281
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,520
on my spirit.

282
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,880
I can't stand her disrespect

283
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,200
for the artists.

284
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,720
I can't be with someone

285
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,240
who has no humanity or bottom line,

286
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,200
Then we'll work together.

287
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,640
So,

288
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,720
I made the decision

289
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,880
to change my agent.

290
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,080
What is the truth

291
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,160
behind the car accident?

292
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,240
Yes, please tell me.

293
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,600
What's the truth?

294
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
As for the rumors on the internet,

295
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,400
all I can say is,

296
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,680
There's no smoke without fire.

297
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,320
Because of

298
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
the car accident,

299
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,880
It gave me a thorough understanding

300
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,400
of some people,

301
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,200
But considering,

302
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,880
after all, we've worked together before.

303
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,560
I don't want to hold

304
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
anyone accountable.

305
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,200
For me now,

306
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,040
the most important thing is,

307
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,880
With my new agent

308
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,240
together

309
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,560
Put the work

310
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,880
I pushed back on track.

311
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,640
So that the fans who support me,

312
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,760
can see my new work

313
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
as soon as possible,

314
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,960
In return for everyone's love and waiting for me

315
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,040
during this period of time,

316
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,360
Zihao, look over here.

317
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,560
Please look over here.

318
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Zihao, take a look here.

319
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,000
Please take a look here.

320
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,240
Zihao, look here.

321
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,080
No problem.

322
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,840
-No problem. -Hello, Mr. Ji.

323
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,960
I want something

324
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,840
with that texture. Can it come out?

325
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,520
Alan, don't worry.

326
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,240
Thank you. Thank you.

327
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,840
Arran,

328
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,600
Boss,

329
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,440
How was the shooting?

330
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,600
Everything is ready.

331
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
We'll just wait for Fei'er.

332
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,200
There's something wrong with Fei'er's condition.

333
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,440
It seems like

334
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
we're about to shoot this.

335
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,240
Why haven't you changed your clothes?

336
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,520
I won't wear

337
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,680
an undesigned dress like this.

338
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,080
Why are you in such a mood?

339
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
Didn't you approve of the clothes?

340
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,160
Anyway, I won't shoot anymore.

341
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,160
I won't shoot it if you say so.

342
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,840
So many people are waiting.

343
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,960
What are you dissatisfied with?

344
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,040
I'm not satisfied with you.

345
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,960
Come on,

346
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,080
let's stop the work

347
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,680
at hand.

348
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,960
Let's go out for some fresh air.

349
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,760
Come on,

350
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,280
let's go.

351
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,320
Is it because of yesterday?

352
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,360
Yes, that's right.

353
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,120
I, Chen Fei'er, was the only one

354
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
who rejected others,

355
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,200
No one dares to refuse me.

356
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,880
No one dares to stand me up.

357
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,160
You don't have the right

358
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,640
to tell me what to do.

359
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,240
And he always disappears.

360
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,120
Tell me,

361
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,920
where did you go last night?

362
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,359
With whom? This is my personal life.

363
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,920
I have no obligation to tell you.

364
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,920
Don't rely on me to like you.

365
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,560
You can look down on me like that.

366
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,160
I've never belittled you.

367
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,240
You are belittling yourself.

368
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,000
Don't you forget,

369
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,640
you're a model by profession?

370
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,119
It's working hours,

371
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,319
and,

372
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,839
My principle is not to involve

373
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,560
any personal feelings in my work.

374
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,040
I hope you'll do the same.

375
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,880
I hope you can be more professional.

376
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,280
You're the only one who has principles, right?

377
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,840
I have my principles,

378
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,720
too. My principles are,

379
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,400
Judging from my mood,

380
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,160
I'm in a very bad mood now.

381
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,800
So I won't shoot anymore.

382
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,160
Sis, why are you here?

383
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Today is your commercial day.

384
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,160
Of course I want to come.

385
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,720
I thought you wouldn't

386
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,600
come today.

387
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,440
Song Zihao held a press conference,

388
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,400
saying that he wants to change his agent, you know?

389
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
I know.

390
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,000
I met him before the press conference.

391
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,280
Sis,

392
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,120
Don't be too sad.

393
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,240
And me,

394
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,360
I'll always be there for you.

395
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,120
I'm fine.

396
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,440
What's wrong with your eyes?

397
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,760
Why are your dark circles so heavy?

398
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,480
We're shooting a commercial today.

399
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,720
Didn't you sleep well yesterday?

400
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,120
Sleep well.

401
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,120
What happened to you last night?

402
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,240
Sida?

403
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,960
You don't have to shoot today?

404
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,640
You can go back now.

405
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,240
Director,

406
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,800
the shooting time has changed,

407
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,200
Why didn't you tell us?

408
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,760
No, the shooting time has changed,

409
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,400
Yes

410
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,080
The main character of the shoot has changed.

411
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,640
I'm sorry. The sponsor has changed.

412
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,200
It's mainly

413
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
a substitution.

414
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,360
No,

415
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,440
you begged Sida

416
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,360
to shoot the commercial,

417
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,880
If you want to change people now, you can change people.

418
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,120
No,

419
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,440
Song Zihao's popularity

420
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,680
is high

421
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
after all,

422
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,160
And that ad was originally

423
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,320
signed with Song Zihao,

424
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,880
Now you want him to wake up.

425
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,680
And they are willing to cut the price.

426
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,400
So, of course,

427
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,080
the company will give priority to him.

428
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,400
Well,

429
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,760
what about Sida?

430
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's work together in the future.

431
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,240
I need to get ready.

432
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,440
-Director. -Director, don't go. -Sister, forget

433
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,880
it.

434
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,760
Didn't I shoot the commercial today?

435
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,680
There are irrelevant people

436
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,280
present.

437
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,560
It's an eyesore.

438
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,640
Song Zihao,

439
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,880
are you the one behind this?

440
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,680
It's despicable to use price reduction

441
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,200
to squeeze

442
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,200
Sida out.

443
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,720
Sis,

444
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,720
Forget it. Let's go.

445
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,000
You're so close to me.

446
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,320
Looks like you did a good job of brainwashing.

447
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
You'll be

448
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,400
a pug soon.

449
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,120
Sida, right?

450
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,360
I advise you,

451
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,280
you'd better

452
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,240
stay away

453
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,040
from such a mercenary woman.

454
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,800
I don't know

455
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,040
if she'll use you up someday.

456
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,360
Just one kick?

457
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,600
I'm warning you,

458
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,040
you can insult me,

459
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,640
But you can't insult Ruonan.

460
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,160
Sida

461
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,360
Don't argue with him.

462
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,040
Let's go.

463
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,360
Why are you so excited?

464
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,480
You slept together?

465
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Sida, are you okay?

466
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,360
How could you learn to fight?

467
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,320
Let's see who dares to touch him.

468
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,840
Sis, I'm fine.

469
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,480
It's interesting.

470
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,080
Don't hit Song Zihao.

471
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,240
Stop it!

472
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,520
Don't hit me!

473
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,440
Let go!

474
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,840
Stop fighting!

475
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,560
-Let go! -Don't hit me!

476
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,680
Sida

477
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,040
Stop fighting.

478
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,920
Don't hit me!

479
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,080
All right,

480
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,400
let go,

481
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,760
Does it hurt?

482
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,280
It doesn't hurt.

483
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,240
It hurts.

484
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,360
How many times have I told you?

485
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,080
The most important thing to be an artist

486
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,440
is to control your temper,

487
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,400
You know what?

488
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,240
Everything you say and do now,

489
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,840
a lot of people are watching you.

490
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,160
You'll ruin your future if you're not careful.

491
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,760
Don't act rashly.

492
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,160
Also,

493
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,440
being an artist's face is the most important thing.

494
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,680
If you don't protect your face,

495
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
and fight with others,

496
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,800
But I really can't stand it.

497
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,680
Why did they hit me and scold me?

498
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,560
It doesn't matter.

499
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,200
But I just can't stand them

500
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,240
bullying you,

501
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,920
Many people bullied me.

502
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,120
Are you going to fight every one of them?

503
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,640
Go ahead.

504
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
The most important thing to be an artist

505
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,600
is patience.

506
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,440
It's stressful

507
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,480
to be in our line of work.

508
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,160
You can't let your temper

509
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,360
lead you to anything,

510
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,760
Remember,

511
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,520
it's instinct to lose your temper.

512
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,440
Controlling your temper is the ability.

513
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,200
Oh,

514
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,080
It hurts,

515
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It hurts a little.

516
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,720
Where does it hurt?

517
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,040
Didn't you just say it doesn't hurt anymore?

518
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
My arm hurts too.

519
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,480
It hurts here.

520
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,520
Did you hurt your wrist

521
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,800
in the fight? Where?

522
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,080
Where?

523
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,440
Sis, are you caring about me?

524
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,120
No matter how painful it is, I can take it.

525
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,080
Sister, let me ask you a question.

526
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,680
What is it?

527
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,800
Where did you go last night?

528
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,040
Why do you ask?

529
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,960
I went to your house yesterday

530
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,120
and found you weren't home,

531
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,560
Later, Fei'er also came,

532
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,320
and we waited for you all night.

533
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,800
You and Fei'er have been waiting for me

534
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,560
for the whole night,

535
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,600
there won't be anything important.

536
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,960
I don't know.

537
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,600
Fei'er seems to be in a hurry.

538
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,600
She was very worried that

539
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,760
something would happen to you and your brother.

540
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,520
So where did you go?

541
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,840
Why didn't you come back all night?

542
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,480
Ji Mo's car

543
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,160
broke down halfway yesterday.

544
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,680
We had to stay in the suburbs

545
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,640
for one night.

546
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,520
What are you two

547
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,680
worrying about?

548
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,320
What will happen to me when I'm old?

549
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,600
Yeah,

550
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
but when Fei'er left,

551
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,600
I think she's angry.

552
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,720
What did she say?

553
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,000
Wishful waiting,

554
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,440
nothing good will come of it.

555
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,080
It's weird.

556
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,440
Is it because of Ji Mo?

557
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,680
I have to find her and make it clear.

558
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,280
Newcomers nowadays

559
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,240
are going too far.

560
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,400
You even dared to use it.

561
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,520
If it becomes really popular someday.

562
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,000
I have to ride on top of you.

563
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,440
Stop it! Get out of here!

564
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,480
I know you're upset

565
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,160
and angry,

566
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,000
But there's no need to

567
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,280
lose your temper with your assistant.

568
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,720
The people you want to deal with,

569
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,280
should be Dugu Ruonan and Sida.

570
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,160
This is definitely not over today.

571
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,160
Otherwise, I won't be able to swallow it.

572
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,720
Don't worry.

573
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,480
When you were fighting just now,

574
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,440
I took a picture of you.

575
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,560
I'll show you a good show sooner or later.

576
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,440
Tell me. What can I do for you?

577
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,520
You should go first.

578
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,800
I heard you waited all night last night.

579
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Let me tell you,

580
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,360
let me ask you something,

581
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,720
Who were you with last night?

582
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,480
Where are you?

583
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,040
I knew you'd ask this.

584
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,280
I was with Ji Mo

585
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,000
last night,

586
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,840
I knew it.

587
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,240
There's a story.

588
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,000
Don't worry,

589
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,720
I have nothing to do

590
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,120
with Ji Mo.

591
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
What you're worried about

592
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,520
doesn't exist at all.

593
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,080
Me,

594
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,760
What are you worried about?

595
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,800
I'm not worried about anything.

596
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,200
You like Ji Mo, right?

597
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,000
Chen Fei'er,

598
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,480
do you take me as your best friend?

599
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,560
He used to tell me everything,

600
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,880
when he was abroad for a few years,

601
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,840
You even want to send me a video

602
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,960
when you break up. Why is this,

603
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,920
You didn't tell me.

604
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,240
Because I'm afraid you like Ji Mo,

605
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,560
too. Yes, I do.

606
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,640
But it was just for fun

607
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,800
at first,

608
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,080
At that time,

609
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,120
you and Ji Mo

610
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,040
didn't have a good relationship.

611
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,720
So I didn't tell you,

612
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,520
but I got serious

613
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,320
later on.

614
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,880
At that time,

615
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,120
your relationship with Ji Mo

616
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,080
also got better.

617
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,840
But it's better than I thought.

618
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
So I was

619
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,320
afraid to tell you,

620
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,280
What are you afraid of?

621
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,720
I'm afraid it'll affect

622
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,120
our relationship,

623
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,600
I'm afraid you'll back down

624
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,840
when you find out. I know you too well. Ruonan,

625
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
In the past, whenever someone bullied me,

626
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,440
you would stand up for me

627
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,720
in the first place,

628
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,440
And as long as

629
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
it's something I like,

630
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,640
You'll do everything you can

631
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,840
to help me get it.

632
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,440
So if I tell you that

633
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,280
I like Ji Mo,

634
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,360
And if you like him too,

635
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,160
you will give him to me.

636
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,840
I don't want to risk losing you.

637
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,800
I don't want to risk it.

638
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,520
Come here, girl!

639
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,200
You must have lost your mind

640
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,360
when you're in a relationship.

641
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,840
What's on your mind,

642
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,440
you little fool?

643
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,600
As long as you know me,

644
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
you should know that

645
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,200
we have completely different views.

646
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,480
Only you like

647
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,040
Ji Mo's

648
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,080
kind of stuff.

649
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,480
I don't like it at all.

650
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,760
Really?

651
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,520
You didn't lie to me, did you?

652
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,760
Please,

653
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,920
take him away quickly.

654
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,680
Then I can

655
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,760
get my house back.

656
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,200
I really don't want to see that

657
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,720
arrogant face.

658
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,480
I don't think he likes me.

659
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,680
We had a big fight today.

660
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,640
Do you know

661
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,440
what he told me?

662
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,960
He said his principle is,

663
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,400
you can't mix

664
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,560
any personal feelings in your work,

665
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,240
I think I was totally rejected.

666
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,000
Miss, what's your last name?

667
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,760
Who are you?

668
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,960
Are you the Chen Fei'er

669
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,200
I know?

670
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,880
Is there no

671
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,000
Chen Fei'er in the world

672
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
that you can't take away?

673
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,880
Who are you?

674
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,200
That kind of thing,

675
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,800
Chen Fei'er, you can take it,

676
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,320
I think so.

677
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,200
I, Chen Fei'er,

678
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,880
there's no other man

679
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,960
I can't take.

680
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,600
-Right? -Yes, he's

681
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,440
back.

682
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,320
How are things going

683
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,240
with Song Zihao?

684
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,200
It seems that something is not going well.

685
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,920
Tell me.

686
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Let's analyze it together.

687
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,240
According to the contract,

688
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,120
we don't interfere

689
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,600
in each other's privacy.

690
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,640
You seem to be in breach of contract.

691
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,960
Can I ask you to move out?

692
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,360
What's wrong?

693
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,440
What did I do to you?

694
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,320
If you put on a bad face,

695
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,840
aren't you fine in the morning?

696
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,280
You didn't mess with me,

697
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,120
but you did,

698
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,400
It's useless to have eyes

699
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,440
on someone you shouldn't provoke, right?

700
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,040
Discharge everywhere

701
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,560
to seduce people. Who did I seduce?

702
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,400
You're not a dog, are you?

703
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,560
Bite whoever you see.

704
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,800
Then you can move out.

705
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,960
Inexplicable.

706
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,800
What are you doing?

707
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,480
I just don't like you.

708
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,840
What's wrong with you?

709
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,240
You ate explosives.

710
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,800
Cockroaches.

711
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,360
Let go!

712
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,640
Okay,

713
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,320
Don't go. Clean it up.

714
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,120
If you come back alone as a man,

715
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,760
I'm afraid

716
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,520
who are you looking for?

717
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,640
It's been two hours.

718
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,280
What the hell is

719
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,160
it? Isn't it

720
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,720
a bit too exaggerated?

721
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,200
I have to shoot a magazine in a couple of days.

722
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,040
The more exaggerated it is,

723
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,680
the more sympathetic and angry the fans will be.

724
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,160
Don't forget our goal,

725
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,680
is to step on Sida.

726
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,600
Let him and Dugu Ruonan,

727
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,880
completely unable to turn over.

728
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,440
He is not cruel and his position is unstable.

729
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,160
This is Dugu Ruonan,

730
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,320
According to what you taught me,

731
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,400
if we can't do anything bad

732
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,520
to ourselves.

733
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,640
What if one day Sida?

734
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,960
He took your place.

735
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,960
Are you willing to accept it?

736
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,400
Report,

737
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,840
I did 200 push-ups,

738
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,440
Add underwater breath for half an hour,

739
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,480
and today's task has been successfully completed.

740
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,600
What?

741
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,760
Song Zihao is seriously injured.

742
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,120
How is that possible?

743
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,040
This is slander!

744
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,520
I'll deal with it right away.

745
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,040
I'll go with you.

746
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,520
No, thanks.

747
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
I told you the other day

748
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,440
that I was serious about moving.

749
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,760
I'll pay the penalty.

750
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
Find your house and move it out.

751
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,840
What's wrong again?

752
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,200
Now the public opinion on the Internet is down,

753
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,640
and everyone is

754
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,800
fighting for you?

755
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,360
You're the only one

756
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,720
who can think of such a dirty trick.

757
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,240
But the effect is quite good.

758
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,000
Dugu Ruonan,

759
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,000
this is the result of you

760
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,400
going against me.

761
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,640
What are you doing here?

762
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,720
What are you trying to do?

763
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,440
Wax,

764
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,000
you've grown your skills now.

765
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,400
You even know how to lie.

766
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,000
With this little trick of yours,

767
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,360
how dare you fight with me?

768
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,840
Hurry up and clarify the facts.

769
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,440
Otherwise, I won't stand on ceremony.

770
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,920
Now everyone knows that

771
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,360
Sida beat Zihao,

772
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,120
Photos and videos are there,

773
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,760
witnesses and physical evidence are there,

774
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,480
Even if you go to the media

775
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,600
and tell

776
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,800
the truth,

777
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,040
Who would believe you?

778
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,040
Okay.

779
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,760
Since you're shameless,

780
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,640
then let's tear each other apart.

781
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,600
No one can get away with it.

782
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,920
I won't let Zihao clarify it.

783
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,040
What gossip?

784
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,680
If you want to deal with us,

785
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,840
bring it on.

786
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,040
Are you crazy?

787
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,440
Yes,

788
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,000
the injury is fake,

789
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,840
I was deliberately

790
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,040
trying to frame you.

791
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,960
You'll never be able to turn over.

792
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,200
What can you do to me?

793
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,360
You finally admit it yourself.

794
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,000
That's what I want.

795
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,320
Injuries are fake,

796
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,960
and it's illegal to manipulate public opinion

797
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,680
by fraud,

798
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,440
Give it to me.

799
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,440
Give it to me.

800
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,440
Give it to me.

801
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,760
Enough.

802
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,040
Delete the recording.

803
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,320
Delete the recording.

804
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,360
Let's call it a day.

805
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,240
Why?

806
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,400
They were the ones who framed him first.

807
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,600
I don't have the right to let my artist

808
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,000
take the blame.

809
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,960
Just because Song Zihao

810
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,280
is the top artist in the company.

811
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,120
Just because Sida is not as popular as Song Zihao,

812
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,240
you've been in the industry for so many years,

813
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,440
Don't you know the rules?

814
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,440
This circle

815
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,760
is the biggest vanity fair.

816
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,040
The word fame and fortune

817
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,200
comes before and benefits after.

818
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,400
First the fame, then the advantage.

819
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,320
I'll listen to whoever's famous.

820
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,760
What about Sida?

821
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,920
He just started his career.

822
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,120
You have to take this kind of blame.

823
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,240
It will affect

824
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,080
the child's future,

825
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,160
How about

826
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,240
this? Don't bring Sida with you.

827
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,760
I'll give you back your position

828
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,680
as the Director of Brokerage,

829
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,440
Don't you always want to

830
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,720
make a comeback?

831
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,920
As for Sida,

832
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,760
don't waste your

833
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,920
time and energy.

834
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,320
I won't give up on Sida,

835
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,560
since he chose to follow me,

836
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,400
I have to be responsible.

837
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,080
I'm returning

838
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,120
the position of Director of Brokerage

839
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,560
to you. Don't do it

840
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,960
for a newcomer.

841
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,840
Are you sure? I'm sure.

842
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,120
Okay,

843
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,880
Let me remind you,

844
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,680
you and the company,

845
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,240
We signed a confidentiality agreement.

846
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,880
If this recording gets out,

847
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,760
it will have a bad impact on the company.

848
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,240
You have to take legal responsibility.

849
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,120
I advise you

850
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,840
to recognize the truth.

851
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,679
So what if

852
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,480
you tell

853
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,800
the truth?

854
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,520
Can Sida turn over?

855
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,960
The company can do it anytime.

856
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,280
If you hide him,

857
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,120
his life will be

858
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,360
even sadder then.

859
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,000
If you keep doing this,

860
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,320
not only will you not be able to help him,

861
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,840
It'll ruin him.

862
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,480
Are you okay?

863
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Bad news.

864
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,480
Didn't I ask you to keep an eye on Fei'er

865
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,360
and make a promotional film?

866
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,760
Fei'er said she won't shoot

867
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,239
anymore. Be gentle!

868
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,440
What's going on?

869
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,280
She also said that she would never

870
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,199
work for Yi Fashion again.

871
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,760
No,

872
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,120
between Fei'er and Mr. Ji,

873
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,240
If it's so stiff,

874
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,480
what if we break the contract later?

875
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,720
We have to find a way to coax her.

876
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,600
We tried to coax her.

877
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,240
But she's too determined,

878
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,560
how can you coax her?

879
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,680
I'm going to coax her in the name of Mr. Ji.

880
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,160
How about you go

881
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,160
and buy a bunch of flowers,

882
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,320
Send it to her

883
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,280
in the name of Mr. Ji.

884
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,960
-Hurry up. -Okay.

885
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,920
I'll go now.

886
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,240
What's going on?

887
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,320
What should we do?

888
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,680
What are you doing? You're in a panic.

889
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,240
No, it's okay.

890
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,640
You don't look right. Are you

891
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,160
hiding something from me?

892
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Mr. Ji,

893
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,480
please stop reading

894
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,000
my face, okay?

895
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,280
As long as you remember,

896
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,680
everything I do is for your own good.

897
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,040
Someone sent flowers

898
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,760
for no reason?

899
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,800
Take a look

900
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,640
and throw it away.

901
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Don't you know I'm allergic

902
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,760
to pollen?

903
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,560
The fans are different.

904
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,720
It's from Ji Mo.

905
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,680
But doesn't he know the situation?

906
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,200
Are you allergic to pollen?

907
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,440
Throw it away.

908
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,040
No way.

909
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,080
Look at you.

910
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,640
Throw it away.

911
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,720
Don't throw it away!

912
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,000
It's a waste to throw it away.

913
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,200
Then what should we do?

914
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,680
How about this?

915
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,680
I'll put it outside.

916
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,920
Look through the glass,

917
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,600
Okay,

918
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,680
Stay away from me.

919
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,280
Nymphomaniac.

920
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,160
Don't open it.

921
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,840
The flowers should have arrived.

922
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,520
Why didn't it work?

923
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,280
Why hasn't he come yet?

924
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,360
What time is it now?

925
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,680
Why isn't Fei'er here yet?

926
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,280
-Yes. -What time is it? -Why? -Yes. Mr. Ji, I've

927
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,960
already

928
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,160
called.

929
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,320
She didn't answer.

930
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,120
What does she take her job for?

931
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,960
So many staff members

932
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
are waiting for her.

933
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,520
Change someone else tomorrow.

934
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,000
No, no. Let's call it a day.

935
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,080
Wait a little longer. Maybe a little longer.

936
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,480
Who said I won't shoot anymore?

937
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,120
Sorry, Fei'er is here.

938
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,920
Fei'er,

939
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,520
Mr. Ji has been waiting for you.

940
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,880
If something happens again

941
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,840
during the shooting,

942
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,880
Terminate the cooperation.

943
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,480
I don't work with

944
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,440
irresponsible people,

945
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,920
I promise I won't give you anything,

946
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,200
okay?

947
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,640
Even if I die,

948
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,840
I'll take a good picture of you,

949
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,360
too.

950
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,880
I'll get back to work.

951
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,120
Okay,

952
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,000
This one looks good.

953
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,000
Okay, let's get started.

954
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,200
Okay, change your position.

955
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,440
Okay,

956
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,840
Look at it from another angle.

957
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,880
Excuse me,

958
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,760
sir. Hold on.

959
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,840
It's over. Pollen allergy.

960
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,680
Stop taking pictures.

961
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,200
No, I can hold on.

962
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,880
I promised Ji Mo nothing would go wrong.

963
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,200
Otherwise, he'll be angry again.

964
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,840
I can do it.

965
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,680
Go on. Do you care

966
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,800
if he's angry or not?

967
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,920
I'm not scaring you.

968
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,600
Pollen allergy,

969
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,360
if not treated in time,

970
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,160
It's dangerous.

971
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,040
Is it that serious?

972
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,400
It's very serious.

973
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,600
Why did it stop?

974
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Sorry, Mr. Ji.

975
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,080
Fei'er is fine.

976
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,040
Keep shooting.

977
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,240
Why is your

978
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,080
neck so red?

979
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm allergic.

980
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
I ate something allergic

981
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,040
before I came here. Maybe

982
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,800
you can just cover it with powder.

983
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,960
Fix it later. You know

984
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,320
you have to work today,

985
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,320
Still not jealous?

986
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,600
What if people who don't know think,

987
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,680
you're allergic

988
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,480
to Yi Fashion's clothes?

989
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,640
Can you be more professional?

990
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,560
Mr. Ji,

991
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,720
if Fei'er hadn't

992
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,440
received the flowers from you,

993
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Could she be allergic?

994
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,440
After all this,

995
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,640
you still insist on shooting,

996
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,080
You don't know anything about it.

997
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,440
Are you blaming her now?

998
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,680
Xiao Xiao, stop it.

999
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,480
I sent you flowers.

1000
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,240
What flowers?

1001
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,320
Sorry, Mr. Ji.

1002
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,320
The flowers I sent in your name,

1003
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,360
I want to ease them.

1004
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,080
What's wrong with Fei'er? -Drive

1005
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,680
to the hospital. -Hurry up

1006
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,120
Hey,

1007
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,720
Are you okay? What's going on?

1008
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,840
You're awake.

1009
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,240
Yes.

1010
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,200
Are you feeling better?

1011
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,400
I really don't know.

1012
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,480
You're allergic to pollen,

1013
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,160
so your attitude was bad just now.

1014
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,520
I apologize to you. I'm sorry.

1015
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
It's okay.

1016
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,080
Who told me to like you?

1017
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,800
Actually, Fei'er, you don't have to.

1018
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,320
Do you know why?

1019
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,240
Do I like you?

1020
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,000
Because you don't know how to do it.

1021
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,520
Judging a person

1022
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,920
because of his appearance,

1023
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,440
You won't discriminate against fat people.

1024
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,160
You even

1025
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,160
think about them intimately,

1026
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,320
Me,

1027
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,680
I used to be

1028
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,240
a fat man.

1029
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,760
Even though I've lost

1030
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,120
a lot of weight now.

1031
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,760
But my heart

1032
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,280
is still inferior,

1033
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,440
Sometimes,

1034
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,640
I secretly fantasize,

1035
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,280
If one day you fall in love with me,

1036
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,600
even if I become ugly,

1037
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,560
You're getting fatter.

1038
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,160
And you won't abandon me.

1039
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,960
It's you.

1040
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,360
He cured me.

1041
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,760
Fei'er,

1042
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,080
actually, you are very good and excellent.

1043
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,880
No matter you are fat or thin,

1044
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,360
there are many people who love you.

1045
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,280
I like you,

1046
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,120
but it's not me.

1047
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,120
Is it Ruonan?

1048
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,640
What does it have to do with her?

1049
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,240
I know you like her.

1050
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
It's just that

1051
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,840
I've always been selfish,

1052
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,040
I've been lying to myself.

1053
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,880
Because I know Ruonan

1054
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,600
will help me and give way to me.

1055
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,320
But

1056
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,920
no matter how scheming I am,

1057
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,080
The result is still the same.

1058
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,960
But losing to my best friend,

1059
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,400
I feel much better.

1060
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,280
No.

1061
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,280
If I don't have feelings for Dugu Ruonan,

1062
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,480
I won't like her.

1063
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,160
You know, liking someone

1064
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,560
is like

1065
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,880
having allergies,

1066
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,280
You can't hide it.

1067
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,960
You care about her,

1068
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,480
care about her, be nervous about her,

1069
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,560
Be soft on her,

1070
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,320
Ji Mo Think about it carefully,

1071
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,960
You really don't have feelings for her?
