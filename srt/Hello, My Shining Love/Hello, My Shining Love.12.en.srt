1
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,480
You want to quit the entertainment industry?

2
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,199
Yes

3
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,760
What's the reason?

4
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,840
I'm tired.

5
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,480
I'm tired of

6
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,680
the intrigue all day,

7
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,880
Trembling days.

8
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,960
What about Ruonan?

9
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Don't you like her?

10
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,120
I want to abandon her.

11
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,640
I've said everything I need to say.

12
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,880
I won't go back.

13
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,480
You're lying.

14
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,880
Even a drama spirit like Dugu Ruonan,

15
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,640
can't hide it from me.

16
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,480
Not to mention you.

17
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,800
Your acting is terrible.

18
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,160
Stop acting in front of me.

19
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm going home to sleep.

20
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,360
Sida

21
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,120
If you're a man, don't run away.

22
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm not here to be a lobbyist.

23
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,960
I'm telling you

24
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,320
as someone who's been there before,

25
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
I ran away from it too.

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,240
But for the rest of the day,

27
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,080
every minute of my life,

28
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,160
I'm regretting it.

29
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,840
Sida?

30
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,960
If you really

31
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,840
care about Ruonan,

32
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,360
Don't be a deserter.

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,040
Don't hurt someone

34
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,920
who cares about you out of anger.

35
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,720
Doing so

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,880
will only push her further and further away.

37
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm not hiding,

38
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,480
I'm just hoping,

39
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,240
Push her farther and farther away.

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,040
I just hope that

41
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
she won't talk to me anymore.

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,360
Get rid of my burden

43
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,920
that will only drag you down.

44
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,200
It's not easy for me

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,960
to do this, brother.

46
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,240
But I can't

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,440
stay with her anymore.

48
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,680
I'll only cause her more trouble and pain

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,080
if I stay.

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,200
That's how

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,080
I like someone,

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,240
Did I do anything wrong, brother?

53
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,520
Love is not the reason to hurt.

54
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,240
You'll only make her sadder if you leave.

55
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,040
No, I won't.

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,560
She'll forget about me.

57
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,240
This pain is only temporary.

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,200
What do you know?

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,960
You know nothing.

60
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,680
Do you think forgetting someone

61
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,320
can be done by talking casually?

62
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,800
Don't say goodbye in the name of love.

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,520
Those who are left behind

64
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,720
are the ones who suffer the most.

65
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,880
Please come in.

66
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,200
Who are you?

67
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,680
Chen Fei'er,

68
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
why are you here?

69
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,840
Didn't you ask me to come?

70
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,120
Yes, it's been a long time.

71
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
I thought you wouldn't come.

72
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,280
What's wrong?

73
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
Your recent

74
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,440
gluttony and vomiting are getting worse.

75
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,760
It's more than that.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I have more severe symptoms,

77
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,680
more severe symptoms,

78
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,760
suffer from insomnia

79
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,800
Anxiety and sentimentality,

80
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,600
even in the middle of the night,

81
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,320
I always shed tears inexplicably,

82
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,840
Sometimes I want to hit people

83
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,320
or smash things,

84
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,720
Go on.

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,680
And to make matters worse,

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,520
I was shopping like crazy on the internet,

87
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,080
But when I opened the parcel,

88
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,280
I didn't feel excited at all.

89
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,880
Can you understand the pain?

90
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,760
I get it.

91
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,880
How long have you

92
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,360
had this symptom?

93
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
Am I beautiful?

94
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,720
It's beautiful.

95
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,920
Are you in good shape?

96
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
You have a good figure.

97
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,160
But Ji Mo doesn't like me.

98
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,880
He rejected me directly.

99
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,200
Even after rejecting me,

100
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,560
you can say it naturally,

101
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,720
We are friends.

102
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680
In front of him,

103
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,960
I have no sense of existence at all.

104
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,360
So your symptoms

105
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,880
came into being after

106
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,800
Ji Mo rejected you.

107
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,440
Let me ask you,

108
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,920
have you been very concerned about

109
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,600
your body changes recently,

110
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,960
You value your appearance,

111
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,640
and what the opposite sex thinks of you.

112
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Vomiting

113
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,160
is just a sign of

114
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,280
your fear and inferiority complex,

115
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,480
And overeating?

116
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,520
It's because you don't feel safe.

117
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,680
In our technical terms,

118
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,000
existence is perception.

119
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,560
What you just described

120
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,280
about your own strengths,

121
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,360
It all stays

122
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,520
on top of your appearance,

123
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
That is to say,

124
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,280
in your subconscious,

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,920
that men are generally

126
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,880
shallow,

127
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,760
Am I right?

128
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,320
It has something to do

129
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,360
with your past experience.

130
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,600
Your experience,

131
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,480
is the source of all your fears.

132
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,920
Your analysis makes sense.

133
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
Not bad.

134
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,400
Urban women,

135
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,480
they are more easily

136
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,800
influenced by external evaluation,

137
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,000
For example, money,

138
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,480
appearance,

139
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,040
Including love relationship,

140
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,560
these are the causes of

141
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,280
their inner instability.

142
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,120
The fact that Ji Mo rejected you

143
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,800
is the cause of

144
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,040
your anxiety.

145
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,720
He erased your sense of existence.

146
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,600
That's why you're reacting

147
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,440
like this.

148
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,039
Now that you've figured it out,

149
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,159
you can prescribe the medicine.

150
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,320
What about your illness?

151
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,240
There's no way to cure it with medicine.

152
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,880
You can only adjust yourself.

153
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,400
Re-recognize yourself.

154
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,040
Make yourself more active.

155
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,560
to improve your mood.

156
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,640
For example, sports,

157
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,720
for example,

158
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,920
enriching your spiritual world.

159
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,720
The most important thing is

160
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,960
to reduce your dependence on external evaluation.

161
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,040
But I have poor self-control.

162
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,360
I don't like sports either.

163
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,880
Not in the spiritual world.

164
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
I don't like reading either.

165
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,640
Does watching a romantic movie count?

166
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't watch romantic movies these days,

167
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,800
just watch Peppa Pig.

168
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,480
Just relax, okay?

169
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,560
Sorry, Miss Chen Fei'er,

170
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,880
I have a meeting later.

171
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,800
How about we have a good

172
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,400
talk some other time?

173
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,240
I'm really sorry.

174
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,360
How much do you pay per month?

175
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,400
Why do you ask?

176
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,520
Because I want to

177
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,160
hire you.

178
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,520
Dr. Ai.

179
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,280
Dr. Ai.

180
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,480
I've made it clear to you.

181
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,400
Even if you offer me ten times the price,

182
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,320
I won't resign.

183
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
Be your personal psychologist.

184
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,080
If I want to make money,

185
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,480
I can go to a private hospital.

186
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,200
I went to the public hospital

187
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,320
to help those who want to see a private clinic,

188
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,800
But ordinary people who don't have money

189
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,760
and suffer from mental illness,

190
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,960
Instead of a celebrity like you

191
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,480
who spends money to chat with you, okay?

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,120
-Let go. -Let go of the star. What's wrong?

193
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
Can't a celebrity get sick?

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,760
The pressure we're under,

195
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,160
is even greater than that of ordinary people.

196
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,840
There are more psychological problems,

197
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
just because he is a public figure,

198
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,040
So our behavior

199
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,760
will be magnified.

200
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,400
I even have to sneak around

201
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,760
to see a patient,

202
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,760
It's impossible for me to queue up here

203
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,320
every day to see you.

204
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,480
Yes, I admit that

205
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,400
we earn more than ordinary people.

206
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,880
So I'm also prepared to bear

207
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,840
more psychological pressure.

208
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,960
But I'm human too.

209
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,760
There are times

210
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,920
when I can't stand it,

211
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,840
I also want to find someone

212
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,960
to talk to me,

213
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,200
Am I wrong?

214
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,560
All right. Don't do this.

215
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,360
Miss Chen Fei'er,

216
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,920
it's not that I don't want to help you.

217
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,160
But for all your demands,

218
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,040
I really can't satisfy you.

219
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,960
No, no, no.

220
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,800
Stop it, okay?

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,520
In public,

222
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,560
what are you doing here and there?

223
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Didn't you make people misunderstand?

224
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,840
All right, that's it.

225
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,440
Then I'll spare the weekend,

226
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,120
and give you

227
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,200
a private psychological counseling,

228
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,080
How about this?

229
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,600
Do you have a girlfriend?

230
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,360
Not yet.

231
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,520
That's great.

232
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,800
I don't have a girlfriend.

233
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,920
Why are you so happy?

234
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,960
So after you get off work,

235
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,120
I'll take care of all your private time.

236
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Be my personal psychologist.

237
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,080
Anyway, you're single,

238
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,160
so you don't need to be with your girlfriend,

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,840
okay? No.

240
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,360
Okay, okay.

241
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,960
Okay,

242
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm really Miss Chen Fei'er.

243
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,480
I'm really impressed.

244
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,240
I have a bad feeling.

245
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,120
Gosh.

246
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,720
Hello,

247
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
I'm the waiter here.

248
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,760
What would you like to eat?

249
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,280
Sida?

250
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,800
Hurry up.

251
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,520
It's closed.

252
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,600
Okay,

253
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,760
right away. It's always so slow.

254
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,840
Cut it out.

255
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,160
Is this still home?

256
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Dugu Ruonan,

257
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,800
you've reached

258
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,880
the bottom line of my life.

259
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,960
Can we still live here?

260
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,760
I'm going to break down, okay?

261
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,920
You didn't take a shower, right?

262
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,720
I didn't wash my hair

263
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,120
or brush my teeth,

264
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,200
Don't lie down.

265
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,680
My limbs are going to degenerate.

266
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,040
Come on, let's go out for some exercise.

267
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,640
Boxing

268
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
is a reverse sport,

269
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,520
That is to say,

270
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,880
every time you throw a heavy punch,

271
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,960
We need to take a step back.

272
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,120
So that you can exert your strength better.

273
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,440
You're at a stage

274
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,400
where you're retreating,

275
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,840
We need a winning blow.

276
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,680
You can think of this arena

277
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
as a workplace.

278
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,640
Think of me as your rival.

279
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,720
Come on

280
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,520
Just vent your anger to the fullest.

281
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,360
Are you sure?

282
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,560
Although I'm an amateur,

283
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,320
I'm more than enough

284
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,480
to beat you.

285
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,440
Come on.

286
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,160
I forgot to tell your sister

287
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,400
that she was a Ladies'Fighting Champion when

288
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,840
she was in college.

289
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
It's so spicy.

290
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,160
It's okay,

291
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,400
The bottom of the pot I ordered with Sida last time

292
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
is even hotter than this.

293
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,200
Every time I wanted to cry,

294
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,120
I would come to eat spicy pot.

295
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,920
Order the spiciest pot bottom,

296
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,400
then make yourself so hot

297
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,720
that you cry,

298
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,360
This way, when I want to cry,

299
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,440
no one will find out that

300
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm actually crying.

301
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,160
Cry if you're sad.

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,080
If you miss Sida, go to him.

303
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
It's as simple as that.

304
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,560
I know Sida very well. Sida

305
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,640
is a very good girl,

306
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,600
A very hard-working and serious child,

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,400
unless he has no choice,

308
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,560
He will never say that

309
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,640
he wants to quit.

310
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,480
But what can I do?

311
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,720
In this situation,

312
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,520
it's hard for him to follow me.

313
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,920
Every time

314
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,280
I had a setback before,

315
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,680
I will tell myself,

316
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,480
I will definitely be able to rebound.

317
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,680
Just endure it and you'll get over it.

318
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,040
But if you stay up for a long time,

319
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,360
you will lose confidence.

320
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,320
It's like a rubber band.

321
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,680
It will wear out if you stretch it for a long time,

322
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,960
and now

323
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,520
I'm the broken rubber band.

324
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,440
Hurry up and eat. The food is rotten.

325
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,040
Why are you still eating spicy food?

326
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,400
If I don't eat them all,

327
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,600
you'll have to eat them.

328
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,840
It's so spicy that it hurts your stomach.

329
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,560
I'll take you to a place after eating.

330
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,040
Why did you bring me here?

331
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,680
I just finished the hot pot,

332
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,840
so I'll take you to calm down the spicy food.

333
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,000
What... What are you doing?

334
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,720
What's wrong? Together?

335
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,400
No, thanks.

336
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,960
No, no, no, no. I don't need it.

337
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,119
I don't need to be spicy.

338
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,319
I'm fine. I really

339
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,319
don't need it.

340
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,640
All right, I won't mess with you anymore.

341
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,079
Actually,

342
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm going to teach you one,

343
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
A new way to shed tears.

344
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,359
When I saw you

345
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,280
eating hotpot to hide your tears,

346
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,720
In the past,

347
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,240
I came here whenever I was in a bad mood.

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,560
Then lie on the water.

349
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,800
Slowly sink to the bottom

350
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,200
and you can't see anything with your eyes closed.

351
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,280
I can't hear anything.

352
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,400
Everything feels like

353
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,880
it has been thrown into another world.

354
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,960
You don't have to worry about it.

355
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,360
When you cry in the water,

356
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,560
you can blend in with the water

357
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,280
in the pool.

358
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,800
No one else can tell.

359
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,640
Most importantly,

360
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,840
it won't hurt your stomach.

361
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,240
Why are you so nice to me?

362
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,280
Don't get me wrong,

363
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,320
I just don't like

364
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,760
you pretending to be strong.

365
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,320
I'm so touched.

366
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,280
How could I be moved?

367
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,080
It's because I just finished eating hot pot,

368
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,000
Exactly

369
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
What time is it? Is it late?

370
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,240
It must be late.

371
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,280
I'll go back first. Bye.

372
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,080
Good morning.

373
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
Here. I made breakfast for you.

374
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,400
And the shirt you put

375
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,760
in that dryer,

376
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
I took it out.

377
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,600
I've ironed it for you.

378
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,800
You can wear it

379
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,000
to work. You changed your sex.

380
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,400
I'm not used to this.

381
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,760
Do you have any requests?

382
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,640
Why do you miss me so much?

383
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,160
I just want to

384
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,840
thank you for being with me

385
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,960
and enlightening me all this time,

386
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,400
That's why

387
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,640
you came back to life with blood.

388
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,320
What's your next plan?

389
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,640
Are you looking for Sida?

390
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,160
Yes.

391
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,040
I'm going to

392
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,640
get him back.

393
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,120
Sida?

394
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,600
Sida?

395
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,240
Sida?

396
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,840
Sida, are you looking for Sida?

397
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,440
Yes, you know him

398
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,160
and I live next door.

399
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,920
He's from his hometown.

400
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,640
I don't think he's here.

401
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,920
Do you know where he went?

402
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,440
At this time,

403
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,600
he should be working in a restaurant,

404
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,680
-The restaurant

405
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,640
is nice to you. -Hello.

406
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,240
Are you the boss here?

407
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,560
Yes.

408
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,880
Does Sida work here?

409
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
That's right. What do you want to see me for?

410
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,480
I want to make a reservation.

411
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,680
Make a reservation?

412
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,760
Fine, fine.

413
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,080
Chef,

414
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,760
is there anyone outside today?

415
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,200
Why don't you need to cook? All the dishes

416
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,600
are cleared. What dishes are you cooking?

417
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,560
Clear the field,

418
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,200
Then.

419
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,440
The boss asked me to stay,

420
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,400
saying I was short-handed,

421
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,040
I'll go out and have a look.

422
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,760
What are you looking at?

423
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,720
Clean all those pots.

424
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,880
And then check the ingredients

425
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,120
in the freezer.

426
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,560
Anyway,

427
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,560
don't go out until you're done.

428
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,640
Hurry up.

429
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,120
Sis,

430
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,720
Haven't you missed me for a few days?

431
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,240
Why are you here?

432
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,600
Because my artist is missing.

433
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,720
I'm here to take him back.

434
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,960
I've decided to give up.

435
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,320
I won't go back with you.

436
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,480
Don't reject me in a hurry.

437
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,640
these

438
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,360
When you were a group performer,

439
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,000
you acted in 41 plays,

440
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,680
I found all the scenes

441
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,040
with you in them.

442
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,120
I remember you told me,

443
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,200
when you played the corpse,

444
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,240
I can't breathe.

445
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,440
I'll go check it out.

446
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,000
Your body really doesn't have ups and downs.

447
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,640
What's wrong?

448
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,840
Are you okay?

449
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,520
Are you okay, bro?

450
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,480
Hurry up.

451
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,280
And the mentally handicapped girl you played,

452
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,520
was bullied by a group of people in the play.

453
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,400
But in your eyes,

454
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,880
there is still a kind of

455
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,800
purity.

456
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,400
You acted really well.

457
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,360
I was moved by you.

458
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,520
I didn't even notice

459
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,520
that myself.

460
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,320
But I noticed it,

461
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,200
and I can recognize it at a glance.

462
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,560
Because it's glowing.

463
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,960
I just want to remind you,

464
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,080
don't forget

465
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,960
the characters you once created,

466
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,280
The one who has been working hard,

467
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
who once embraced his dream.

468
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,640
You shouldn't have come, sister.

469
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,800
I'm just a loser.

470
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,320
It will only drag you down.

471
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,440
Without me,

472
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,200
you wouldn't have any negative news.

473
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,640
Without me, you wouldn't be

474
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,000
scolded by your fans,

475
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,800
Without me,

476
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,000
you might have succeeded a long time ago

477
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,240
and you would have found a better artist.

478
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,680
But without you,

479
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,720
I have no reason

480
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,080
to persist.

481
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,480
I'm not afraid of negative news,

482
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,560
and I'm not afraid of being harassed by fans,

483
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,760
I'm not afraid of being beaten.

484
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,160
I'm afraid my artist will give up

485
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,240
if he says he wants to.

486
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,640
Didn't you promise me?

487
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,160
If you want to go to the podium together,

488
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
I'm waiting for you

489
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,000
to thank me loudly on the stage?

490
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,960
Don't cry,

491
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,480
boys

492
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,800
like to cry so much,

493
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,800
Stop crying.

494
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm not crying.

495
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,520
Recite the artist's rule.

496
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,960
I can only listen to you,

497
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,880
everything you ask me to do,

498
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,800
I want to do all of them.

499
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,440
What you don't want me to do,

500
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,560
I can't even think about it.

501
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,560
I can't hide from you and lie to you.

502
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
If I don't contact you,

503
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,960
your phone must be turned

504
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,120
on 24 hours a day.

505
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
Text messages must be answered

506
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,880
within two minutes.

507
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,240
You said I can't go west if I'm pointing east?

508
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,040
You want me to be a vegetarian?

509
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,240
You can't cheat.

510
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,120
I shouldn't have given up.

511
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,400
I know.

512
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,080
Why are you laughing?

513
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,960
Is there anything to be happy about?

514
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,760
No.

515
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
It's weird.

516
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Where are we going today?

517
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,440
Go to the bank

518
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,280
and give money to your teachers,

519
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,360
You can go straight to class

520
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,640
after the money is paid.

521
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,520
If you pay for it,

522
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,680
the company doesn't care about you anymore.

523
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,200
They just want to

524
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,840
put it off until the contract expires,

525
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,960
Terminate the contract directly.

526
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,240
They give up on you

527
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,520
but we can't give up on our own.

528
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,840
Where are the teachers

529
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,920
I found for you?

530
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,000
They are the best and most experienced

531
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,240
in the industry,

532
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,520
I'm sure I can train you

533
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,600
to be a professional artist.

534
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,320
The training fee is expensive, right?

535
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,320
As for the money,

536
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,480
you don't have to worry about it.

537
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,720
Just have a good class.

538
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,480
What?

539
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,960
The balance is insufficient.

540
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,760
No way. I've been working

541
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,720
for a few years.

542
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,800
I saved a lot of money.

543
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,920
Here's the thing.

544
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,080
I checked the records.

545
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,600
When the subscription period for the wealth management products

546
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,000
you booked is up,

547
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,880
The bank will transfer the account automatically.

548
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,120
In addition, in recent months,

549
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,240
you have almost zero income,

550
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,400
If you need money urgently,

551
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,880
you can apply for a bank loan,

552
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,160
You just need to provide some collateral,

553
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,480
like a car,

554
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,200
Or real estate. Okay,

555
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
I got it.

556
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,760
Miss Chen Fei'er,

557
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,240
based on

558
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,680
your personal situation,

559
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,200
A tailor-made schedule,

560
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,400
which is divided into work, rest, diet,

561
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,720
There are also three directions of exercise,

562
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,840
which can not only

563
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,360
regulate your

564
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,560
gluttony and vomiting

565
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,720
but also make you feel very happy recently.

566
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,840
I didn't expect you to put so much effort into it.

567
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,480
Of course,

568
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,800
I've agreed

569
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,560
to be your personal doctor.

570
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,600
I should be

571
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,560
responsible for you.

572
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,080
Thank you for being serious.

573
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
Let me buy you a drink.

574
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Wine,

575
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,520
You can't drink too much.

576
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,880
Your vomiting for a long time

577
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,360
makes your stomach very fragile.

578
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
Drink this.

579
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,360
You didn't allow me to drink when you came here.

580
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,200
Let me drink some water.

581
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,720
That's right.

582
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,520
Lemonade is good.

583
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,080
All benefits but no harm.

584
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,080
I can't eat meat anymore.

585
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,120
I can't drink yet.

586
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,720
Tell me,

587
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,080
what's the meaning of my life?

588
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,360
Okay,

589
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,840
I hope I won't be happy

590
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,560
with your cooperation in the future.

591
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,080
Happy cooperation.

592
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,400
Chen Fei'er, answer the phone.

593
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,280
I want to borrow some money from you.

594
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,160
I want to borrow money.

595
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,680
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

596
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,720
Why didn't you knock?

597
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,400
You don't close your doors at night,

598
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,440
and,

599
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,600
When I was washing up,

600
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,360
I heard you talking to yourself,

601
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,160
You're sighing.

602
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,600
Are you okay?

603
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,160
He's the president of Yi Fashion.

604
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,400
He must be rich.

605
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,720
If I borrow money from him,

606
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,520
he will lend it to me.

607
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,240
Don't even

608
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,800
think about it.

609
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,760
You're guilty even if you want to.

610
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,080
Narcissist,

611
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,400
I want to ask you how to get rich overnight?

612
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,760
Robbing a bank?

613
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,320
I found that all you can think about

614
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,920
is money.

615
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,080
Are you that greedy?

616
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,200
Are you short of money?

617
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,200
Me,

618
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,320
Gold broker,

619
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,760
how many idols have you made famous,

620
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,080
I'll be short of money.

621
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
I won't be able to spend it all.

622
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,280
Don't study my expression.

623
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,760
You're a gorilla. I'll study it.

624
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,960
You can go back to sleep if you're fine.

625
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,760
Actually, I want to borrow some money from you.

626
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,240
Why can't I open my mouth?

627
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,240
Am I shameless?

628
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,800
When I saw his face,

629
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,120
I couldn't speak.

630
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,200
The bank.

631
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,880
Bank flows,

632
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,800
tax certificates,

633
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,400
There are invoices for the house purchase contract,

634
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,920
and a real estate license is missing.

635
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,800
Okay,

636
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,160
All the information is here.

637
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,800
After the review,

638
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,240
if there are no problems,

639
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,000
Then the loan will be approved.

640
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,840
The whole cycle

641
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,040
will take about two weeks.

642
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,280
Just go back

643
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,200
and wait for the notice.

644
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,520
I guess I can still

645
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,680
get my house back.

646
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,760
As long as you can repay the loan on time,

647
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,120
this house will always be yours.

648
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,000
By the way, this is the receipt.

649
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,720
I'll put it

650
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,960
in this information bag

651
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,840
for you.

652
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,560
If you have

653
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,880
any questions later,

654
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,280
You can contact me at any time.

655
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,080
Have a seat.

656
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,200
I'm going to hand in

657
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,640
the information now.

658
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,080
-Thank you. -Okay.

659
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,240
No way.

660
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,120
The texture of this fabric is too hard,

661
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,480
the air permeability is too poor,

662
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,200
It doesn't fit well with the skin.

663
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,440
If you wear it in summer,

664
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,360
it will be very uncomfortable.

665
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,080
But we've tested it

666
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,320
with instruments.

667
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
All the conditions are up to standard.

668
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,240
Just using the instrument,

669
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,200
have you

670
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,960
tested it yourself?

671
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,200
I'll ask the purchasing department

672
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,400
to re-purchase the fabric.

673
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,520
Mr. Ji,

674
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
I think you,

675
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,840
When you're serious,

676
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,040
you're so charming and handsome.

677
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,440
Really?

678
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,920
Nonsense.

679
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,600
It's your first day knowing me?

680
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,760
I'm not always so serious.

681
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,640
So handsome?

682
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,480
That's why you've always been handsome.

683
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,200
Well, will you go to

684
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,920
the group dinner tonight?

685
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,360
No, I'll go home.

686
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,440
Mr. Ji, you've changed.

687
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,560
Look at

688
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,320
your favorite one,

689
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,320
overtime and dinner.

690
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,600
Now you're back as soon as

691
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,280
you get off work.

692
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,560
Did you fall in love with him?

693
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,080
I like the feeling

694
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,280
of going home.

695
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,560
That's right.

696
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,080
Are you still

697
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,760
going to buy that house?

698
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,360
Of course I have to buy it.

699
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,560
The reason I moved in,

700
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,920
is to buy that house.

701
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,400
If you buy it,

702
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,640
Ruonan will have to move out.

703
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,400
What a coincidence.

704
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,760
Not only to rob the house,

705
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,240
but also to rob the parking space.

706
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,800
This is the first thing I like.

707
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,880
You're just going to take it?

708
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,480
Grab it,

709
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,000
What do you want? It's mine.

710
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,720
No, you're too bossy.

711
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,080
This is not a private parking space.

712
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,920
You mean the parking space?

713
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,680
Who knows which idiot

714
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,280
parked my parking space?

715
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,000
That's why I came

716
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,240
to park in the public area,

717
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,680
How about this?

718
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,360
I'll move the car and park it for you.

719
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,320
You changed your sex,

720
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,440
and suddenly you're so nice to me,

721
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,840
Why are you talking like that?

722
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,480
This house is already mine.

723
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,040
I won't grab the parking space with you.

724
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,159
No need to move.

725
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,800
Wait a minute.

726
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
There should be new parking spaces available,

727
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,040
but as compensation,

728
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,840
You have to wait for the parking space with me.

729
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,800
Just wait and see.

730
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,560
We don't need to

731
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,600
go for a ride together. Wake up

732
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,160
when we get there.

733
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,560
It's getting dark.

734
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,440
Where are we?

735
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,960
You'll know when you get off the bus.

736
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,520
Why did you bring me to the river?

737
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,040
Didn't you say you would take me for a ride?

738
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,120
Why did you bring me here?

739
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,720
Don't you think it's beautiful?

740
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,680
It's really beautiful here.

741
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,000
It's like

742
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,440
we're in another world,

743
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,840
Look up again.

744
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,880
So many stars.

745
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,640
So beautiful.

746
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,920
In all my years in Shanghai,

747
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,960
I've never seen

748
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,440
such a beautiful star,

749
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,720
I know you've been under a lot of pressure lately,

750
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,680
and even though Sida is back,

751
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,640
But there are many problems

752
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,320
to face,

753
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,040
So I brought you here to relax.

754
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,600
Tell me,

755
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
how nice it is to keep going like this.

756
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,200
If you like it,

757
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,400
I can bring you here more often.

758
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,560
I'm not talking about the night view,

759
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,680
I'm talking about life now,

760
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,160
I used to think,

761
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,360
security is work,

762
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,120
The house,

763
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,920
and the deposit in the bank.

764
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,800
But now I think,

765
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,120
if none of this happens,

766
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,680
It doesn't matter.

767
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,440
I still have

768
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,720
a full sense of security.

769
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,080
You know when I get drunk,

770
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
I have bad habits.

771
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:03,840
I know.

772
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,840
Me,

773
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,960
I don't want to go back today.

774
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,480
Since we've seen the night view,

775
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,160
why don't we stay and watch the sunrise?

776
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,600
All right.

777
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,240
It's still early at 4 o'clock.

778
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,360
Get some sleep.

779
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,840
Remember to call me. I'll call you

780
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,320
when the time comes.

781
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,640
You can go upstairs first.

782
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,520
I have to go to the company.

783
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,720
Okay.

784
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,080
Why are you back so soon?

785
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,280
Explain it to me.

786
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,840
If I didn't notice,

787
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,520
Have you already

788
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,240
sold the house,

789
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,240
Dugu Ruonan,

790
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,760
have you gone too far?

791
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,040
I have no choice.

792
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,760
I don't have any money.

793
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,040
So I had to mortgage the house

794
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,480
to the bank,

795
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,440
But don't worry,

796
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,480
I've been working very hard

797
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,160
to make money.

798
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,720
I'll redeem the house soon.

799
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,960
Won't you ask me for it if you don't have money?

800
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,520
What do you take me for?

801
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,240
A tenant that can be evicted at any time?

802
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,480
I don't want to trouble you.

803
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,200
Have you troubled me a lot?

804
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,760
So you think I'm troublesome?

805
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,520
Yes.

806
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,120
You're a big problem.

807
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,520
You keep hanging around in front of me every day.

808
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,080
To disturb my life and my emotions,

809
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,840
I was fine on my own,

810
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,560
You had to show up in my life

811
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,960
and ruin everything,

812
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
You're driving me crazy.

813
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,800
You know what?

814
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,640
So you don't want to see me?

815
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,320
Yes.

816
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,720
I want to keep my distance from you.

817
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,800
Okay,

818
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,480
Since you think I'm troublesome

819
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,240
and don't want to see me,

820
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,440
Then you can move out.

821
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,320
I forgot.

822
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,600
You won't move out.

823
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,360
Because you're still here

824
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,560
waiting for your ex-girlfriend,

825
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,480
So you were nice to me before,

826
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,800
because of this house, right?

827
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,760
Without this house,

828
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,800
you don't want to talk to me at all.

829
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,920
Whatever you think.

830
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,400
You just can't forget your ex-girlfriend.

831
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,640
Three years ago.

832
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,160
Hey,

833
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,640
Su Xiao is in the hospital

834
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,560
now. She's dying.

835
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,920
Come and see her for the last time.

836
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,280
She had breast cancer a year ago

837
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,920
and her condition

838
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,080
wasn't very serious at that time.

839
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,080
She has been taking medicine to control it.

840
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,960
But it got worse

841
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,160
in the end.

842
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,760
Now,

843
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,040
she's being treated in the hospital.

844
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
She has lost

845
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,520
all her hair.

846
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,520
She broke up with you,

847
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,800
because she didn't want you to follow her.

848
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,000
Together with the pain,

849
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,080
she did this,

850
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,320
She did it because she loved you.

851
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,320
Where's Su Xiao?
