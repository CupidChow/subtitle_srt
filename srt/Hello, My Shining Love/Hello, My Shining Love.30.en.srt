1
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,080
As for the new season,

2
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,920
What is the design?

3
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,120
Why did you repeat it?

4
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,400
Previous concepts and elements

5
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,760
I want something new.

6
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,480
It's not like this.

7
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,400
To deal with me.

8
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,480
Redesigned

9
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,920
President Ji.

10
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,080
Don't you mean

11
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,000
It's Sermantha.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Nirvana?

13
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,440
I told you I wouldn't use her.

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
But the general draft of the induction,

15
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,480
Haven't you already sent it?

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,000
Entry Press Release.

17
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,680
Mr. Ji, look.

18
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,880
President Ji.

19
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,160
Why are you still here?

20
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,840
I told you.

21
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,120
I will fight for it.

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,320
That's how you fight for it.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,240
You think I did it?

24
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,520
Zimmer

25
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,760
You doubt me so much.

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,000
It makes me sad.

27
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,080
Even if you are in love with someone else,

28
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,640
As for you,

29
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,960
For so many years.

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,040
Am I that kind of person?

31
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,200
Don't you understand people?

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,240
Then look at my eyes.

33
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,520
Did I lie?

34
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,800
one

35
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
two

36
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,680
three

37
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,519
four

38
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,240
five

39
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,960
six

40
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,000
seven

41
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,720
eighteen

42
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,800
Seventy-nine

43
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,280
eighty

44
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,400
That's good. It's 80 yuan.

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,760
Fierce

46
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,560
It's okay. I haven't practiced for a long time.

47
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,040
I'm doing sit-ups.

48
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,520
Help me.

49
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,880
Alright.

50
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,360
Why are you so nervous?

51
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,120
Are you nervous?

52
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,120
I'm excited about dating you.

53
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,760
Appointment?

54
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,080
It's just a good health.

55
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,080
It's not a date.

56
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,840
It's called fitness.

57
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,760
The two of us

58
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,880
Then it's a date.

59
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't flatter yourself.

60
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,360
At most, you're a sparring partner.

61
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,200
Why are you training with me?

62
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,280
I didn't ask anyone else to be my sparring partner.

63
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,320
Why are you looking for me?

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,480
I can find whoever I want.

65
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,520
What do you care?

66
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,200
Sorry

67
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,840
I couldn't resist.

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,720
Chen Fei, I'm sorry.

69
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,640
You were so hot just now.

70
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,280
So I really...

71
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,160
Can I apologize to you?

72
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,040
Chen Fei Chen.

73
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
How can you hit me?

74
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,920
Chen Fei.

75
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,160
you

76
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,800
No, no. Chen Fei.

77
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,600
No

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,160
Listen to me. I'll explain it to you.

79
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,160
Can I apologize to you?

80
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,760
sorry

81
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,560
I didn't mean to

82
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,160
Kiss you.

83
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
How can you forgive me?

84
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,640
Chen Fei, tell me.

85
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,960
This is a public place of the gym.

86
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,800
Don't touch me.

87
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,440
I beg you.

88
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:10,720
Alright?

89
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,440
Chen Fei'er.

90
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,520
Now we should

91
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,800
It's a relationship.

92
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,280
You are being paranoid

93
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,760
You kissed me just now.

94
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,920
Isn't this a relationship?

95
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,760
Of course not.

96
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,720
Why?

97
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,280
Do you want me to be responsible for you?

98
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,080
I don't care.

99
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,120
You kissed me anyway.

100
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,440
You should be responsible for me.

101
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,280
Is that bite or kiss?

102
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,920
And Ellie, I'm telling you,

103
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,760
Don't do that in front of me.

104
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,880
Play this trick.

105
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,440
Who likes to bite people.

106
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,400
It's cute.

107
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,000
The person who came to you

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,480
It's Su Xiao.

109
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,560
The dead are back.

110
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,680
She's still your subordinate.

111
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,280
Oh, my God.

112
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,720
It's too fantastic.

113
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,720
I think

114
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,920
She's not good at coming.

115
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Where is it?

116
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,640
When will you be back?

117
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,760
I've been busy recently.

118
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,880
I'm still working overtime.

119
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,920
Go to bed early.

120
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,720
Good night!

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,840
Here's my advice.

122
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,920
Don't lie to him.

123
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,160
What can I do?

124
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,200
I can't act in front of her.

125
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,840
You don't have to act.

126
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,680
You tell her the truth.

127
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,640
That's enough.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
No.

129
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,679
If the man is insecure,

130
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm afraid that she will think too much.

131
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,320
Senior Brother, please give me a piece of advice.

132
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,640
You're right.

133
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,159
Have you rejected Su Xiao?

134
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,039
And you're always

135
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,159
If you think about it, right?

136
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,360
Tell her the truth.

137
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sure she will understand.

138
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,600
And the person you love

139
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,800
It's Ruuo's fault.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,880
For her,

141
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,640
This is the biggest.

142
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,480
And feel safe?

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,720
What do you think?

144
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,960
A man's sense of security

145
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,400
Men are linear thinking.

146
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,280
They think love

147
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Is a sense of security.

148
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,680
As for women,

149
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
Women think differently.

150
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,520
They are more sensitive than men.

151
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,520
They need more than love.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,240
Pay more attention to feelings.

153
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,960
I know Ruowan.

154
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,280
She was betrayed.

155
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,320
Is very sensitive in this aspect.

156
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,400
I won't let her worry.

157
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,320
I'm talking about you.

158
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,160
You convinced me.

159
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,480
It's true.

160
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,720
It's too easy for a woman to struggle.

161
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,400
Really

162
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,880
Explain to her.

163
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,160
She said you covered up.

164
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,280
You can't explain.

165
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,240
She said you agreed.

166
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,120
It's too hard.

167
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,880
It's too hard.

168
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,600
What are you going to do?

169
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,960
I want to know what to do.

170
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,320
Why are you here?

171
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,320
I just want to talk to someone.

172
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,600
Or keep it to yourself.

173
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
It's too hard.

174
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,040
But the problem is,

175
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,680
You have to solve it first.

176
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,880
Su Xiao's case

177
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,800
What are you going to do?

178
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,040
Go back to work overtime.

179
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,800
The only thing I can do now

180
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,440
Complete the design and increase sales

181
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,760
Convince the shareholders

182
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,320
To stop them.

183
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,480
With Su Xiao as the designer,

184
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's go.

185
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,600
This is really

186
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,000
You have so many reasons to escape.

187
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,600
overtime

188
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,280
We'll be busy during this period.

189
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,120
busy

190
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,160
feed

191
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,640
The question mark

192
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,480
Fhjfhfhgfjfgjfghjfh

193
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,080
Do you want the truth or a lie?

194
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,200
Truth

195
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,840
I think

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,920
abnormal

197
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,200
And I didn't hear it from you before.

198
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,480
How busy he is.

199
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,520
He's the boss.

200
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,680
Even if he has to work overtime,

201
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,480
But it doesn't mean

202
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
To work all night.

203
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
What's the most important point?

204
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,040
Why did he end up

205
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,080
To apologize to you.

206
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,240
I think

207
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,560
He felt guilty to you.

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
Based on my years of experience,

209
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,840
And intuition.

210
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,720
smell

211
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,600
I think

212
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,160
There's a big problem.

213
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,480
Right?

214
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,600
You think there's a problem?

215
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,080
What should I do now?

216
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,760
I want to...

217
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,840
And ask him directly?

218
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,920
Or send a text?

219
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,600
But if I ask like this,

220
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,200
Will it appear

221
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,160
I'm very paranoid.

222
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,240
Of course I can't.

223
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,080
Are you stupid?

224
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,440
Even if you ask,

225
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,400
Do you think he will...

226
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,320
Tell you what?

227
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,480
No.

228
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,920
And I think Zimmer

229
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,800
He's not the kind of person

230
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,280
A capricious person.

231
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,720
My suggestion.

232
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,760
If you don't observe for a few more days,

233
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,840
Then we'll take a look at the situation.

234
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,880
We still need a few more days.

235
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,800
I can't make it today.

236
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,200
Dugu is like a man.

237
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
Can you be successful?

238
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,400
I'm telling you,

239
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,400
Love depends on fate.

240
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,600
Getting along with each other depends on learning.

241
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,560
Men are like children.

242
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,280
This candy.

243
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,200
You have to give them one by one.

244
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,720
You gave too much at once.

245
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,920
I will get tired of it.

246
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
OK!

247
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,480
You're so annoying.

248
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,960
Hang up after using me.

249
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,920
Is really a close friend.

250
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,240
Woman.

251
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,600
do

252
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,280
Are you ready?

253
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,520
good

254
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,800
Ask them to

255
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,880
Report to the company.

256
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,240
Contract issues

257
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,680
I'll handle it.

258
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,720
That's it.

259
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,040
Allen

260
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,000
President Ji.

261
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,000
Received this morning.

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,800
From Director Hu.

263
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,360
And said that all the designers would resign.

264
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,880
All resigned.

265
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,560
Are you kidding me?

266
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,400
Every employee has

267
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,280
The constraints of the contract.

268
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,600
If you want to resign, just resign.

269
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,840
That's what I think.

270
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,640
But just now,

271
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,480
I received a legal notice from Rui Qi.

272
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,680
Saying that they're not interested

273
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,400
I'm fully responsible.

274
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,960
And the penalty for each employee

275
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,320
Will be paid to us today.

276
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,720
It's Rui Qi again.

277
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,080
President Ji.

278
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,560
The shareholders are all here.

279
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,840
Is waiting for you in the conference room.

280
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
Get everything

281
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,960
Find them all.

282
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,680
President Ji.

283
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,240
We heard that the Design Department

284
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,920
This morning,

285
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,000
And resigned.

286
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,480
Yes, I just found out.

287
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,080
A clothing group.

288
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,560
The design team is the foundation.

289
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,680
Is the center of gravity.

290
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
Now the whole team has been poached.

291
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,120
If this matter gets out,

292
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,960
How can we

293
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,920
In this industry,

294
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,160
It's the new season now.

295
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,800
So, I think the competitors

296
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,080
He's likely to come here.

297
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,920
This is my chance.

298
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,160
To defeat us.

299
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,440
So our opinion is that

300
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,240
You can make Samantha

301
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,600
And her team will be on duty soon.

302
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,440
Filling vacancies

303
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,160
No way

304
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,960
I disagree.

305
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,320
why

306
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,040
President Ji.

307
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,600
You're right about Samantha.

308
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,560
If you disagree now,

309
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,360
It's you again.

310
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,200
Give us a reason.

311
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,960
The current situation is that

312
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,440
There's no way, Mr. Ji.

313
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,560
I have my own reasons.

314
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,840
No comment. I'm sorry.

315
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,720
What about the company's interests?

316
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,280
Namely

317
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,680
I think

318
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
Since the founding of our group,

319
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,040
All the big and small transactions

320
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,040
We all listen to you.

321
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,480
I have always respected

322
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,360
Your opinion.

323
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,680
But I'm sorry, Mr. Ji.

324
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,360
This matter today is very important.

325
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,960
No more.

326
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,240
It depends on your personality.

327
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,560
This is simply not

328
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,640
About you alone.

329
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,280
President Ji.

330
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,360
Someone saw Thermantha.

331
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,280
And Mr. Zhao of Ruiqi.

332
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,480
In private.

333
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,080
So if you don't know

334
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,240
If Rui Qi takes them away,

335
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,920
Our loss

336
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,160
Will be huge.

337
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,800
She is the last one

338
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,760
A straw, Mr. Ji.

339
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm sorry.

340
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,560
Before you came,

341
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,120
We've discussed it for a round.

342
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,080
While Thurmantha

343
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,360
You still want to stay here.

344
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,560
The contract must be signed today.

345
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,800
No, I won't use it.

346
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,680
This designer

347
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,160
What President Ji is concerned about now is

348
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,880
The whole design team is gone.

349
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,480
Didn't he say one or two people

350
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,640
Enough.

351
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,800
You've taken the gunpowder.

352
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,200
Old Ji must have

353
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,240
Your own reason.

354
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,800
Old season.

355
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,960
You don't have to give the reason.

356
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,000
You have to give me

357
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,120
Old Wang, why?

358
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,480
No matter what the reason is,

359
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,520
I will support you, okay?

360
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,760
I really can't talk about it.

361
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,200
I'm serious.

362
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,240
You have your own reasons.

363
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,720
Not Old Ji.

364
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,800
What's wrong with you recently?

365
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,400
What's wrong with you, Ji?

366
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,680
good

367
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,160
Let me remind you.

368
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,640
Thermansa

369
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,960
To join our company.

370
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,360
The industry already knows.

371
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,120
In this sensitive period,

372
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,080
If you don't use her all of a sudden,

373
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,720
If the outside world knows about it,

374
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,080
All of our original designers

375
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Has resigned.

376
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,760
Do you know what will happen?

377
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,200
Even if you can ignore the company,

378
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,360
You can be willful.

379
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,360
You have to think about it.

380
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,560
Take care of yourself, Ji.

381
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,120
A few days ago,

382
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,680
In this office.

383
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,760
You told all the shareholders

384
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,760
Within three months, if it's effective,

385
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,200
Can't improve significantly,

386
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,560
You have to resign.

387
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,880
You will not be the president.

388
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,960
What is it, brother?

389
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,600
Are you really going to do that?

390
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,080
such

391
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,000
Please give me some time.

392
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,920
I'll think about it.

393
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,440
Before tomorrow morning,

394
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,960
I will give you an answer.

395
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,560
you

396
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,960
I have to wait.

397
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,960
One day we will

398
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,520
How much have you lost?

399
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,800
The procedures have been prepared for you.

400
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,640
You will pick up the car the day after tomorrow.

401
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,040
You'll be fine.

402
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,119
Thank you. You're welcome.

403
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,440
Bye

404
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,599
Actually, you don't have to.

405
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,000
To come here in person.

406
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,440
Just ask them to bring it here.

407
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,240
Nothing.

408
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,400
This matter

409
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,119
Is my responsibility.

410
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,440
I will definitely come.

411
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,839
And the last time I saw you,

412
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,880
I have a way of

413
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,079
It's inexplicable.

414
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,160
kind

415
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,599
Well

416
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,680
I've been

417
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,080
I haven't heard that word.

418
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,360
Because usually,

419
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,800
Who met me for the first time.

420
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,120
Will find me difficult.

421
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,600
Our preferences are very similar.

422
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
Your bag

423
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,160
I have an identical one.

424
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,920
What a coincidence.

425
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,840
I really like this bag.

426
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,400
Remember that time,

427
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,760
It was out of stock when I bought it.

428
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,520
Fortunately, there are many commodities.

429
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,080
If there's only one,

430
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,800
You can't tell who got it.

431
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,840
If there's only one, I'll give it to you.

432
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,040
Really?

433
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,840
Really

434
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,120
He's not a boyfriend.

435
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,720
That's right.

436
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,120
A boyfriend? Who would let him?

437
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,160
Your WeChat Moments

438
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,920
The one inside.

439
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,160
The back of the photos of Yunnan.

440
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,760
Is he your boyfriend?

441
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes

442
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,720
He must be nice to you.

443
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,800
It's good for me.

444
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,840
In life,

445
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,680
And took care of me.

446
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,360
I helped a lot with my work.

447
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,080
And he can always

448
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,480
You can see right through me.

449
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,280
It's amazing.

450
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,320
So we get along.

451
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,480
It's quite natural.

452
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,640
I really envy you.

453
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,840
Actually, this time,

454
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,160
To get my ex-boyfriend back.

455
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,800
It's a pity that

456
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,760
He already has a girlfriend.

457
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,560
Then,

458
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,280
Are you going to give up?

459
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,760
I want to get him back.

460
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,560
I'm thinking about their relationship.

461
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,560
If we really love each other,

462
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,240
I can't do anything.

463
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,720
But if an ex-boyfriend

464
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,160
You still have my words in your heart.

465
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,720
I must fight for it.

466
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,440
right or wrong?

467
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,920
Let me be the one

468
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,000
The touchstone.

469
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,720
Do you think

470
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,320
I'm a bad woman.

471
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,480
That's not true.

472
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,560
It's just that

473
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,440
I don't know if I should bless her.

474
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I can only say that

475
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,720
I hope you won't leave any regret.

476
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,560
Well

477
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,320
I also hope

478
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,920
Let's talk about it.

479
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,040
You're really my lucky star.

480
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,280
You just said that

481
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,440
My ex-boyfriend asked me to meet.

482
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,280
Really

483
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,640
Well

484
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,920
Then go quickly.

485
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,600
Bye.

486
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,880
Bye

487
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,040
Maybe next time,

488
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,960
We will meet again.

489
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,520
She's weird.

490
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,920
It's rare for you to ask me out.

491
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,840
What does your brother want to do?

492
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,080
My brother is helping me realize my dream.

493
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,200
Are you questioning me?

494
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,760
I thought you were talking to me.

495
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,880
To take office.

496
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,120
Over the past three years,

497
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,360
You've changed a lot.

498
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,640
I was too weak.

499
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,480
I don't ask anything of you.

500
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,160
But it's because

501
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,680
I'm not telling you what I think.

502
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,280
We missed it.

503
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,920
Don't you think so?

504
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,360
I'm not

505
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,400
Three years ago, Su Xiao.

506
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
And my request

507
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,080
It's not an emotional request.

508
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,720
What I want is simple.

509
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,560
I want to continue my dream.

510
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,840
People who really care about the past

511
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,200
It's not me.

512
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,560
It's you.

513
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,520
that's right

514
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
I care about the past.

515
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,040
Because I used to have something

516
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,440
owe

517
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,320
So I want to make it up to you.

518
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,080
But I care more about the present.

519
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,880
I don't want to get hurt

520
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,120
It will affect Ruo Man.

521
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,320
She is my bottom line.

522
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,480
Are you in love with her?

523
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,520
yes

524
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,760
I fell in love with her.

525
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,040
You haven't changed at all.

526
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,440
You've become more cruel.

527
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,360
But I have to warn you.

528
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,680
For Sermantha,

529
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:32,960
Wing fashion

530
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,440
Wing fashion

531
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,840
Is just one of the choices.

532
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,360
But for wing fashion,

533
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,640
Thermansa

534
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,200
Is the only thing

535
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,120
Is the best choice.

536
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,400
I have one condition.

537
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,680
You want me and my whole team

538
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,760
Incoming wing fashion

539
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,520
You must acquire my brand.

540
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,880
I don't want money.

541
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,200
I want ten percent of the shares.

542
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,720
no problem

543
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,000
Ten percent is not a small amount.

544
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,640
Don't you think about it?

545
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,880
Of course.

546
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,960
If it's an exchange of benefits,

547
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,440
I'm relieved.

548
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,960
Wing fashion is because of you.

549
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
Can you come here?

550
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,480
It can make up for you.

551
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,040
However

552
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,640
I have one condition.

553
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,720
What's the condition?

554
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,840
You and I can only

555
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,040
Working relationship.

556
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,640
Outside of work,

557
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,960
We can't have any connection.

558
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,720
good

559
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,480
I promise you,

560
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,000
Good cooperation.

561
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,160
Suxiao

562
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,320
This is my last time.

563
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,440
To call you.

564
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,280
Thank you.

565
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,040
Let me grow up.

566
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,920
Let's call it a day.

567
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,640
Go ahead.

568
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,280
Alright.

569
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,120
Slow down.

570
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,480
Go straight ahead.

571
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,040
What? It's so mysterious.

572
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,760
We're almost there.

573
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,000
Okay, one more step forward.

574
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,680
One step.

575
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,040
to be ready

576
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,000
I let go.

577
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,880
What about

578
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,200
Where is this?

579
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,080
This is our home.

580
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Didn't you say that

581
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,680
Get married if you have a house?

582
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,880
You have a house now.

583
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,800
Marry me

584
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,320
Stop it.

585
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,720
I just came back.

586
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,480
After two years,

587
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,080
But I can't wait.

588
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,080
What do you mean?

589
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,720
Don't you see that?

590
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
I'm proposing to you.

591
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,200
I'm a girl.

592
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,480
I don't need to be reserved.

593
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,400
You're a boy.

594
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,680
What principles do you insist on?

595
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,640
Zimmer, marry me.

596
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,880
Marry me. Let's get married.

597
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,600
Xiao, why don't you understand?

598
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,040
What do I mean?

599
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,400
Don't listen to me.

600
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,560
Zimmer

601
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,880
We're here.

602
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,800
Let's put one here.

603
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,360
It's a big sofa.

604
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,200
Then what?

605
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,560
If we have a fight,

606
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,400
I will punish you for sleeping on the couch.

607
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Then this way.

608
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,400
here

609
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
Let's put a desk.

610
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,280
And put an easel.

611
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:03,880
And look.

612
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,000
In the psychology book,

613
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,880
I can draw the design.

614
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,240
This way.

615
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,040
Look. Look this way.

616
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,200
Suxiao

617
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,080
Xiao

618
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,040
Where are you, Xiao?

619
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,960
Suxiao

620
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,080
Suxiao

621
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,880
Where are you?

622
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,920
Suxiao

623
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,920
How many times has the doctor said it?

624
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,800
Can't you drink?

625
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,040
brother

626
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,480
I'm really sad now.

627
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,440
Just let me indulge for a while.

628
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,360
all right?

629
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,000
Zimmer still won't let you in.

630
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,960
No,

631
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
He agreed to my request.

632
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,520
He promised me

633
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,480
The shares.

634
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,080
That's a good thing.

635
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,240
You should be happy, right?

636
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,920
No

637
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,040
When he promised me,

638
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,600
It means he's moved on.

639
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
He put it down.

640
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,800
I didn't put it down.

641
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,640
fruit juice

642
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,680
Thank you

643
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,680
What's up

644
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,120
Was recognized.

645
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,160
Why is it so empty today?

646
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,840
And asked me out for a date and a movie.

647
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,400
It's not a date.

648
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,720
Don't think too much.

649
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,200
Isn't this a date?

650
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
This is an experiment.

651
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,360
I want to test

652
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,920
I was wrong about you.

653
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,080
It still feels like

654
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,280
test

655
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,280
test

656
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,920
If you don't want to, I'm leaving.

657
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,840
Test whatever you want.

658
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,640
As long as we can be together,

659
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm happy.

660
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,200
Let's go.

661
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,360
here

662
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,360
That's strange. No one is here.

663
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,720
I specially picked one.

664
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,120
A remote place.

665
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,920
Because it won't be filmed.

666
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,480
When I used to date secretly,

667
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,280
You always do that.

668
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,800
You said it's not a date.

669
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,640
It's all right.

670
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,680
It's all right.

671
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,160
Nothing

672
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
someone

673
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,480
It's okay.

674
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,040
Has he left? Is he?

675
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,800
Are you leaving?

676
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,080
Let's go.

677
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,320
Let's go.

678
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,880
Nothing

679
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,640
My shoulders are sore.

680
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,480
It's a little sour.

681
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,880
For a long time.

682
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,640
So now,

683
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,400
Is it still an illusion?

684
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,200
I don't know.

685
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,240
What does it feel like?

686
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,760
Then...

687
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,040
I'll buy another movie.

688
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,400
And then we can feel

689
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,840
No

690
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,200
The problem of the film.

691
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,640
Let's find a place.

692
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,560
And talk to each other.

693
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,000
Have some wine.

694
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,400
Alright.

695
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,920
Where are we going?

696
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,120
Go to your house.

697
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,280
feed

698
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,560
Right now?

699
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,640
Alright

700
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,360
I know.

701
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,360
Something's wrong.

702
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,840
There's a patient in the hospital.

703
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,720
Something went wrong.

704
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,880
So I have to go.

705
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,840
Have you got anything to do

706
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,320
So busy.

707
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,680
Then go.

708
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,880
We won't have this shop after this village.

709
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,240
I'm fine. I am a chain store.

710
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,800
After the village is full of my shops.

711
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,200
We should strike while the iron is hot.

712
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,160
Then next time,

713
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,480
When will the iron be struck?

714
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,680
When it's hot, you can make the iron.

715
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,520
that

716
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,080
I'll be waiting for your call.

717
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,680
Asked me to forge iron.

718
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,720
Stop

719
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,080
Sida is finished.

720
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,320
congratulations

721
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,440
Congratulations to Star.

722
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,800
Thank you, teachers.

723
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,000
Thank you, teachers.

724
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,080
congratulations

725
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,440
Thank you, director.

726
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,240
Thank you

727
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,960
Star did well this time.

728
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,160
Especially this drama.

729
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
Has made great progress.

730
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,040
Thank you, director.

731
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,960
Thank you for your concern.

732
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,480
The Star Wars

733
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:31,960
To meet

734
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,080
A director like you

735
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,200
Is his luck.

736
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,560
You're lucky.

737
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,600
I ran into Ruo.

738
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,760
Such a good agent.

739
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,000
Follow her.

740
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,960
have boundless prospects

741
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,840
Certain

742
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,880
Thank you, director. Come on.

743
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,960
Hard work, director.

744
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,440
Thank you for your hard work.

745
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,320
Bye.

746
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,000
Thank you

747
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,240
I can feel it.

748
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,200
These months,

749
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,840
Your intention to this role

750
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,560
Thank you.

751
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,680
You're doing well.

752
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,640
Of course

753
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,080
Qian Sha has worked hard.

754
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,400
And you're doing well.

755
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,040
It's not hard.

756
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,360
As long as Star is good,

757
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,760
Everything I do is small.

758
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,840
It's done.

759
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,720
Congratulations

760
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,200
Thank you, sister.

761
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,200
Are you all right?

762
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,320
It's okay.

763
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,120
Wear more.

764
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,400
I'm going there.

765
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,000
To see the other main creators.

766
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,760
Qian Sha, take him back to the dressing room.

767
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,600
good

768
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,240
Don't worry, sister.

769
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,040
Let's go.

770
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,000
go

771
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,360
Congratulations.

772
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,520
Right?

773
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,600
I saw a boat in the lake ahead.

774
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,800
Do you want to go boating?

775
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,040
How about rowing?

776
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,080
Why are you sitting here alone?

777
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,760
Mr. Qian, the investor of the next drama,

778
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,720
To visit the class.

779
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,920
Go and say hello.

780
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,200
The next scene.

781
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,720
I have sent you the script.

782
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,960
You haven't read it?

783
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,040
After the show is finished,

784
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,320
You need to join the team.

785
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,200
The shooting cycle of that play is short.

786
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,440
The pay is high.

787
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,560
The script is a big project.

788
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
The broadcast platform is big.

789
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,600
When it's on next year,

790
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,800
Your price will double.

791
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,560
What big project?

792
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,960
I think it's another money game.

793
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,080
The preparation time is so short.

794
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,520
There's no time to polish the script.

795
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,199
I guess this time,

796
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,280
You didn't even read the script.

797
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,400
Just answer it.

798
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,000
a row

799
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,600
I'm telling you for the last time.

800
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,120
I will never act again.

801
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,159
The characters are shallow.

802
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,480
The role of facial makeup.

803
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,040
This is a bad play.

804
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,800
To my future career.

805
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,880
There's no help at all.

806
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,960
Got it?

807
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,560
Zihao

808
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,880
It's the time of actors.

809
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,280
Who cares that you created

810
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,000
How much art value?

811
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,480
People only look at the commercial value.

812
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,520
You must have one.

813
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,480
Take another one.

814
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,280
Only in this way can I guarantee

815
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,040
Exposure rate

816
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,440
Once you stop,

817
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,199
There's a gap.

818
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,040
Someone else will replace it.

819
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,600
Your position.

820
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,199
The audience will soon forget you.

821
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,360
What are you talking about?

822
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,920
The heat exposure rate

823
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:50,920
I think you have

824
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,040
Only money.

825
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,679
Anyway, this is a bad play.

826
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,719
I'm not going.

827
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,880
Who wants to go?

828
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,080
I was wondering

829
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,320
It turns out that Dugu is really

830
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,800
So that you can join the team seamlessly.

831
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,320
At that time,

832
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,600
Why are you so obedient?

833
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,280
Because she's an orphan.

834
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,080
No matter how much I complain to her,

835
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,280
No matter how hard you work against her,

836
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,040
But I know in my heart,

837
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,160
She's a professional.

838
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,160
I believe in her eyes.

839
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,160
Because she never harmed me.

840
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,520
Although she always

841
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,560
To talk about benefits.

842
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,760
But what she really focuses on

843
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,680
Is fame and reputation.

844
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,520
And you...

845
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,120
In front of everyone.

846
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,440
People and animals are harmless.

847
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,400
You said that

848
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,520
For my own good.

849
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,280
But I'm the one

850
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,000
To really use me.

851
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,240
And the one who exploited me.

852
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,840
Don't treat everyone as a fool.

853
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,480
I know a lot of things.

854
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,680
I just don't want to face it.

855
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,320
Now you are complaining to me.

856
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,040
It's useless.

857
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,320
The contract of this play has been signed.

858
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,960
You have two choices now.

859
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,560
Or stay here.

860
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,800
Behave yourself.

861
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,160
Or you can take care of yourself.

862
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,680
A huge penalty.

863
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,600
Song Zihao, I'm warning you.

864
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,000
It's better not to

865
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,240
To make trouble for me.

866
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,000
Tong Tong.

867
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,520
I heard that

868
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
You gave Song Zihao

869
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,440
And took the part of President Qian.

870
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,280
Which drama did I pick for Zihao?

871
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,120
What does it have to do with Ruo?

872
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,160
Do you know?

873
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
The main creator of that drama

874
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,600
Are all inexperienced.

875
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,880
You lied to your fans.

876
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,160
The drama of cheating the traffic.

877
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,360
A drama that deceived fans.

878
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,400
So what?

879
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,920
As long as there's traffic.

880
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,640
We can make money if we have traffic.

881
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,280
Why are you so shortsighted?

882
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,480
An artist's career

883
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,640
Is limited.

884
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,240
Whether it's time or energy,

885
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,960
As long as he uses the wrong place,

886
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,560
It's hard for him.

887
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,800
When you're back to the peak,

888
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,800
What you're doing is consuming him.

889
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,280
Have you ever thought about

890
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,240
His future.

891
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,920
What about consumption?

892
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,640
It's not like he didn't get paid.

893
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,200
Ever since Song Zihao and I

894
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,680
It's much better than

895
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,960
To make a lot more money.

896
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,760
Although the agent

897
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Is tied to the artist's interests.

898
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,800
But it doesn't mean that

899
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,640
As a tool for making money.

900
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,480
There are many temptations in this circle.

901
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,800
Take it.

902
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,240
You will stand on your feet.

903
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,960
You can't go far if you want quick success.

904
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,440
I don't care at all.

905
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,240
How far can I go?

906
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,640
What I care about now

907
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,120
How high can I climb?

908
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
If you're a male,

909
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,480
In your current state,

910
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,240
Who are you to teach me a lesson?

911
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,600
Let's go and see.

912
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
Sooner or later,

913
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,400
I will let you

914
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,720
And won the battle.

915
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,800
I've studied the script.

916
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,360
The male number two is

917
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,760
A rare role.

918
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,560
Especially his personal setting.

919
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,600
Plump and solid.

920
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,640
But also affectionate route.

921
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,320
The female audience

922
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,720
Is my favorite.

923
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,680
If you act well,

924
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,720
It will be you.

925
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,840
In my acting career,

926
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,080
A good beginning.

927
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:39,960
you

928
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,520
Do you still want the script?

929
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,080
Keep it.

930
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,880
This is the real meaning.

931
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,000
My first play.

932
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,000
She taught me

933
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,280
What is an actor?

934
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,960
What is acting?

935
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,760
She taught me

936
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,200
A really good actor.

937
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,040
Should be like a sponge.

938
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,040
Can absorb constantly.

939
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,160
And release the feelings.

940
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,800
It's me.

941
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
My dream.

942
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,280
To teach me acting.

943
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,280
It's also her.

944
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,960
Teach me.

945
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,360
What is love?

946
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,840
Now I finally understand

947
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,440
Why are you...

948
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,520
Will like Ruo.

949
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,280
She really has a kind of magic.

950
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,160
Can explore the potential of everyone.

951
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,240
Every time she appears,

952
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,480
It's like a reassurance.

953
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,880
And feel safe.

954
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,880
If I ever

955
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,240
It's good to be like her.

956
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,560
You are now.

957
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:39,720
Do you remember

958
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,840
When you first came here?

959
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,560
I felt that

960
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,720
Are you here to play?

961
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,640
Once the freshness is gone,

962
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,920
And leave.

963
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,040
But not anymore.

964
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,640
I feel like a new person.

965
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,840
I believe

966
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,320
You will be like her one day.

967
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,880
Will become

968
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,000
An excellent agent.

969
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,640
Really?

970
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,680
You really think so?

971
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,960
When have I ever lied to you?

972
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,880
Great, Star.

973
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,720
No way

974
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,840
I'm an agent now.

975
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,880
I want to restrain myself.

976
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,920
I want to be professional.

977
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,520
But I'm still so happy.

978
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:11,840
Sida

979
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
With your words,

980
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,000
Everything I do is worth it.

981
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,000
I'll pack up now.

982
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,960
Just leave the script for me.

983
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,520
good

984
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,160
The contract of this play has been signed.

985
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,960
You have two choices now.

986
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,120
Or stay here.

987
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,520
Behave yourself.

988
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,680
Or you can take care of yourself.

989
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,080
A huge penalty.

990
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,120
The script is all over the place.

991
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,800
Why are you here?

992
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,960
You don't have to serve Si Da.

993
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,760
The manager sent Star's stuff

994
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,400
It's misplaced.

995
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,800
I'll take it.

996
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,320
Are you all right?

997
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,440
I think you look very bad.

998
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,920
Why?

999
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,560
Now you care about me.

1000
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,640
Who cares about you?

1001
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,320
I'm looking at the two of us here.

1002
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,960
I'm afraid something will happen to you.

1003
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,520
Don't worry.

1004
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,360
I won't get you into trouble.

1005
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,720
Anyway, if something happens,

1006
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,160
No one will care about me.

1007
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,920
That

1008
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,520
Star and I are leaving tomorrow.

1009
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,160
You must work hard.

1010
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,760
Don't move.

1011
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,080
You're giving others a hard look.

1012
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,680
It will affect you.

1013
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
I know.

1014
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,320
You're really bad at learning from Duguoruo.

1015
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,320
More and more annoying.

1016
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,960
I don't know how to be a good person.
