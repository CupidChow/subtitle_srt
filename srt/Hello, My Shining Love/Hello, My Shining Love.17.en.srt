1
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,800
Mr. Zhao.

2
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,240
You are a big group.

3
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,720
There's no need to use celebrity endorsements.

4
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,360
To raise your popularity.

5
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,840
So the celebrity of the endorser

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,880
Is not important.

7
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,280
What matters is that

8
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,520
Is this spokesman

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,640
Is consistent with your brand image.

10
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,040
We're Sida.

11
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,400
Although he's a newbie,

12
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,840
But he's in a relationship with a man.

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,960
We've only met for the third time.

14
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
We just started to build

15
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,480
Working relationship

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,400
therefore

17
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,280
I don't want you to worry too much.

18
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,199
Actually, sometimes,

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,880
Work is the same as love.

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,200
You need to take it easy, right?

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,640
Sorry

22
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,560
I was too anxious.

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,360
it doesn't matter

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,000
What about me?

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,480
Spent many years abroad.

26
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,920
during time

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,640
With a lot of big group clients.

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,920
Have talked about cooperation.

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,800
Most of them usually

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,440
You won't be able to

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,920
I'll talk to you about work first.

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,520
But spend a lot of time

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
To know who you are.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,800
then

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,920
And evaluate the project.

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,520
Well

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,360
Because they believe

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,680
No matter what you do,

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,120
The biggest risk factor is people.

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,640
This is called

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,840
Be a man first.

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,680
Yes

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,400
You can't stop looking at your phone.

44
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,640
Will be reduced.

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,440
sorry

46
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,320
It's my fault.

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,360
it doesn't matter

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,560
Who wants to find you.

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,120
Will definitely

50
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,480
The first time I found you.

51
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,120
He hasn't contacted you.

52
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,680
That means

53
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,400
He didn't want to contact you.

54
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,160
President Ji.

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,600
Huan Ya agreed to let us go.

56
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,360
Is it sponsored?

57
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,200
No,

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
why

59
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,240
We used to sponsor them.

60
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,120
They are not very enthusiastic

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,840
Did you agree?

62
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,640
I went to talk to him today.

63
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,920
For the sponsorship,

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,560
I noticed him.

65
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
Hold hands.

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,520
And made it into a prayer.

67
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,760
It means that he has begun to

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,840
And our cooperation.

69
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,160
It seems that this year's festival sponsor

70
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,240
If you want to win,

71
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,800
Is not an easy thing.

72
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,840
What should we do then?

73
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,360
The film and television industry

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,160
Recession

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,880
The film festival needs money.

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
The preparation is not good.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,320
The attention will drop.

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,280
In this case,

79
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,360
They refused to sponsor them.

80
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,120
He must want to

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,600
And gain more benefits.

82
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,240
Allen

83
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,320
Check it out.

84
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,160
Which company?

85
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,240
Is competing with us.

86
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,040
Okay, I'll do it.

87
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,960
Come and have a look.

88
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,040
Okay, here.

89
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,840
good

90
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,320
OK

91
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,080
If a man

92
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,400
Mr. Zhao.

93
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,280
It won't affect your work.

94
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,960
It's okay.

95
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,520
good

96
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,160
Sorry

97
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
The photographer.

98
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,520
Can we stop for a second?

99
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,520
Just a few minutes.

100
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,200
It's okay. Thank you.

101
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,880
Sorry

102
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,880
Mr. Zhao.

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
Let me introduce her to you.

104
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,080
This is Star.

105
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,800
Sida

106
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,480
This is Rui Qi Group's

107
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,280
chief executive officer

108
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,040
Mr. Zhao.

109
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,080
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

110
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,800
Hello

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,320
You're here at the right time.

112
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,800
I happened to take photos with Star.

113
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,840
I want you to have a look.

114
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,560
In front of his camera,

115
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,520
These displays

116
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,640
And the photo of him is

117
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,560
If you're wrong,

118
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm here today.

119
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,920
Not to talk about business.

120
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,600
But

121
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,680
For my own personal affairs,

122
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,960
I want to ask you a favor.

123
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,120
The Central Asia Film Festival invited me

124
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,000
To attend a charity event.

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,120
You know I just came back.

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,800
I don't have a suitable partner, so...

127
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,400
I want you to help me.

128
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,560
I'm afraid I can't help you with this.

129
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,880
Star Wars is coming.

130
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,360
So I don't have any time.

131
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,280
So there are so many things

132
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,920
Only you can handle it.

133
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,960
No assistant?

134
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
Si Da is new.

135
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,000
The company didn't give us

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,720
Sent an assistant.

137
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,800
If you don't mind,

138
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
I can introduce you to

139
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
No need, President Zhao.

140
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,680
Thank you for your concern.

141
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,320
I'll take care of her.

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,880
Sida

143
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,720
Don't let the photographer wait too long.

144
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,680
Go back and take photos.

145
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,200
Thank you, President Zhao.

146
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,440
Thank you

147
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,720
Sorry. Go on.

148
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,400
Photographer

149
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,080
Okay, thank you

150
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,520
I'm here.

151
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,520
My friend...

152
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,640
Why are you so late?

153
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,480
Talk to me quickly.

154
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,120
Pretend I'm busy.

155
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Seems to be busy.

156
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,120
What? Hurry up.

157
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,160
Who are you avoiding?

158
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,080
behind

159
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,560
Hurry up and speak.

160
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,320
Who is that handsome guy?

161
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,600
Always looking this way.

162
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,040
CEO of Ruiqi Group

163
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,800
Mr. Zhao.

164
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,000
So handsome.

165
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,080
Sorry.

166
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,520
didn't expect

167
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,560
Are you really so busy?

168
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
I won't bother you.

169
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
This is the invitation.

170
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,880
I hope you can think about it.

171
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,880
Maybe it's really not done.

172
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,160
I promised her.

173
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,320
Thank you

174
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,240
I'll go first.

175
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,360
Thank you, President Zhao.

176
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,520
Bye

177
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,640
Thank you, President Zhao. Bye.

178
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,280
Lean a bit more.

179
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,120
Nice

180
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Zhao Yucheng is good.

181
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,480
If it weren't for me now,

182
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,640
To cultivate your character,

183
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,840
I won't let him off.

184
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,560
Then please, the female donor.

185
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,960
Take him away.

186
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,160
And help me with the endorsements.

187
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,000
The donor

188
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,120
From the way he looks at you,

189
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,040
I can see

190
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,640
He came for you.

191
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,640
What? He just came back without a girlfriend.

192
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,920
That's an excuse.

193
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,640
Like this,

194
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,600
He's a rich man.

195
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Who wants to eat him.

196
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,320
aplenty

197
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,160
But what about her?

198
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,600
You are the one.

199
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,480
If a man

200
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,560
Seriously,

201
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,520
Think about it.

202
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
Ruiqi Group.

203
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,160
Is a high-end brand in China.

204
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,440
On the level of beauty and ability,

205
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,800
In the business world.

206
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,080
And he didn't tell me

207
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,040
Say one more word.

208
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,880
What does that mean?

209
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,240
He's not flighty.

210
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,120
It's not good.

211
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,280
I checked it out.

212
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,200
He has no rumors.

213
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,000
Honey,

214
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,840
You can lock on to the target.

215
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,120
I think

216
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,320
He's better than Zimmer.

217
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,520
Sister Fei,

218
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,520
I'm here for work.

219
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,840
Instead of listening to you

220
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,080
Gossiping about men.

221
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,000
You're really affecting me.

222
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,680
My working state.

223
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,560
Why don't you go out?

224
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,240
I

225
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,559
You ate gunpowder today.

226
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,600
You're talking so fast.

227
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,720
What's your attitude?

228
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,960
Chen Fei.

229
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
I think what you said

230
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,400
It makes sense.

231
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,280
Zhao Yucheng is really good.

232
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,000
The point is,

233
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,400
Older than me.

234
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,800
And mature.

235
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,440
You should be measured.

236
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,720
Unlike some

237
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,600
The younger boys,

238
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,720
You don't have to do anything big or small.

239
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,840
You have no sense of propriety.

240
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,280
You will cause me trouble.

241
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,240
Okay, I've decided to go.

242
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
excellent

243
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,720
to work hard for sth

244
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,440
As a new singer,

245
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,200
We only have

246
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,760
For a month.

247
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,880
Time is short.

248
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,560
You can't make any mistakes.

249
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
We have contacted

250
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,040
All the platforms

251
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,080
And TV station

252
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,000
And music programs.

253
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,320
We have agreed to cooperate.

254
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,680
Now, there are only some

255
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,720
A popular variety show.

256
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,800
We haven't reached an agreement yet.

257
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,800
The senior of the company

258
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
In the Belt and Road Initiative.

259
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,720
We can

260
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,240
To match their theme.

261
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,040
It doesn't matter if you don't pay Star.

262
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,360
The most important thing is the exposure rate.

263
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,200
Well

264
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,200
For the album.

265
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Has been decided.

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
You can run to several major cities in the country.

267
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,200
For the signing ceremony.

268
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,120
Please have a look.

269
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,280
to

270
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,680
At the beginning,

271
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,800
We need to

272
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,280
As much as possible.

273
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
Prepare the materials in advance.

274
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,000
The publicity must be about

275
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,120
And try to sing.

276
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Movie and TV theme.

277
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,800
Can train your business ability.

278
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,840
Don't be afraid to work hard.

279
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,000
Don't be afraid to pay.

280
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,120
It's from the period of Star Advertising.

281
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,920
How many shapes?

282
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Please have a look.

283
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,560
Not bad.

284
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,840
It's good.

285
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,080
How come he doesn't have

286
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,600
More formal clothes.

287
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,520
Star is a newbie after all.

288
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,200
I haven't found it yet.

289
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,520
The right sponsor.

290
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,360
Indifferent

291
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,000
Leave it to me.

292
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,400
good

293
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,600
Why are you here?

294
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,720
What about

295
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,760
Welcome me?

296
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,520
Your professional fake smile

297
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,800
I'm really familiar with it.

298
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,480
What do you want me to do?

299
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,840
You know me.

300
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,360
The new album of Star is coming soon.

301
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
But he has been

302
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,160
Without a formal dress.

303
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,000
You know,

304
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,400
Such an important thing.

305
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,080
You're a big brother.

306
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,440
Is there a little bit?

307
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,720
You should show it.

308
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,240
It's my pleasure.

309
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,000
Is it free?

310
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,240
It's free.

311
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,880
good

312
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,000
But you know,

313
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,440
I'm not the kind of person

314
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,880
Who doesn't pay.

315
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,560
But if you want it,

316
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,520
It's also possible.

317
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,120
I can transfer it to you.

318
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Star is going to release

319
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,640
The new album.

320
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Are you busy?

321
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,960
This album is very important

322
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,880
It's important.

323
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
I will pay attention to every detail.

324
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,480
That's it. I'm going to attend

325
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
The party of the Central Asia Film Festival.

326
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,360
Central Asia Film Festival

327
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,240
that

328
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,680
Such an important occasion.

329
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
Do you have a tux?

330
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,600
No,

331
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,240
Indifferent

332
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,600
Just buy one.

333
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,160
Why are you staring at me?

334
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,000
Come with me.

335
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,920
Don't always ignore yourself.

336
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,680
You also need

337
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
A suitable dress.

338
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,040
The fitting of clothes is the most basic.

339
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,760
Can highlight the female

340
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,880
The beauty of lines.

341
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,160
Is the most important.

342
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,520
President Ji.

343
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,960
Guess what I just

344
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,760
Who called?

345
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,000
The organizer of Huanya.

346
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,720
Saying that they have decided

347
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,560
With Rui Qi,

348
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,000
As the sponsor this year.

349
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,920
And sent you an invitation.

350
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,920
It's Rui Qi again.

351
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,280
Tell me, this ring...

352
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,640
These people are funny.

353
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,200
Don't cooperate with us.

354
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,800
Send us an invitation letter.

355
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,760
What are you doing?

356
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,720
Isn't it disgusting to us?

357
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,400
I believe in Director Hu's character.

358
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
He didn't send the invitation.

359
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
No, who is it?

360
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,080
It should be Rui Qi.

361
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,640
Rui Qi is also strange.

362
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,360
I remember they used to

363
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,720
Film and television investment

364
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,000
And real estate.

365
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,520
Yes?

366
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,640
Why are you suddenly wearing

367
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,760
Interested in it.

368
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
It's Rui Qi who stole Wei Cen's book.

369
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,000
I think Rui Qi is simple.

370
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,440
To steal resources from us.

371
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,640
It's obvious that

372
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,720
They came for us.

373
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,240
Check it for me.

374
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
The background of Rui Qi

375
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,800
Well

376
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,280
Then...

377
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,000
This invitation

378
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,840
go

379
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,960
I want to see him face to face.

380
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,400
Is Song Zihao coming today?

381
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,280
What time is it?

382
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,360
It's 8: 00 now.

383
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,160
Is that their car?

384
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,920
I'm coming.

385
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,720
Dugu Ruuo, hurry up.

386
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,920
My God, Dugu is like a man.

387
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,080
It's Dugu Ruuo.

388
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,280
This way.

389
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,000
Dugu is like a man.

390
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,000
In the light,

391
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,839
I'm prettier.

392
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,079
Thank you

393
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,400
This is mine.

394
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,720
My good friend.

395
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,160
To make it for me.

396
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,119
It seems that your friend

397
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,599
I really know you well.

398
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,400
Yeah, he really knows me.

399
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,160
Miss Dugu,

400
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,040
Please smile.

401
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,920
Thank you

402
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,160
Mr. Zhao.

403
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Please come to the front sign in.

404
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,280
Take a group photo.

405
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,520
Please look at the camera.

406
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,360
This way.

407
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,200
Can you come closer?

408
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,840
Come closer?

409
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,200
Let's take a group photo.

410
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,880
You and Dugu Ruonan

411
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,760
To attend the dinner together.

412
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,240
Does it indicate that you will have

413
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,160
Further cooperation.

414
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
If I can,

415
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,240
Of course I'm the happiest.

416
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
Because I personally admire

417
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,200
Dugu Ruuo's ability

418
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,800
If you can agree,

419
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,320
Whether at work or in private,

420
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,520
I wish I could.

421
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,760
To further contact and understand

422
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,920
Mr. Zhao.

423
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,680
What you said just now,

424
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,560
It's easy to cause misunderstanding.

425
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,960
If you're a male,

426
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,160
Entertainment circle

427
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,640
The most important thing is the topic.

428
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,600
Just give it to them.

429
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,800
I'm an agent.

430
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,280
Is a behind-the-scenes worker.

431
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,640
I don't need a topic.

432
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,720
You don't need it.

433
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,000
But Star needs

434
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,320
At present,

435
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,440
STAR has the best resources.

436
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,360
You're the golden manager.

437
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,800
Then the media will focus on you.

438
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,880
Will also focus on Star.

439
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,680
I bet

440
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,120
Tomorrow's entertainment headlines

441
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,200
It must be the media

442
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,040
Are speculating.

443
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,840
Sida

444
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,800
Will become

445
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,400
The spokesman of Rui Qi Group.

446
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Thus

447
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,040
I promoted Rui Qi Group.

448
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,520
You promoted Star.

449
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,440
And the media

450
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,400
And got the news they wanted.

451
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,560
It's a win-win.

452
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,160
It's true that there is no evil and no business.

453
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,160
You can act better than me, Mr. Zhao.

454
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,240
It's not all acting.

455
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,440
I want to go further with you.

456
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,920
Contact and understand that sentence.

457
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,120
It's true.

458
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,120
Why did you take a photo with me?

459
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,880
The topic

460
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,560
Was taken away by Dugu Ruuo Man.

461
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,880
I didn't expect that

462
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,360
They developed so fast.

463
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,200
Dugu Ruuo is really

464
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,080
You're so resourceful.

465
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,520
Why don't you learn?

466
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,080
Can you respect me a little bit?

467
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,440
You don't have the ability.

468
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,640
It's up to you.

469
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,600
And make some achievements.

470
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,320
Do you think others can see you?

471
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,640
You're also

472
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,160
Abandoned by Dugu Ruoruo?

473
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,800
What's the spirit?

474
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,160
Tell me again.

475
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,400
feed

476
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,440
feed

477
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,760
The dress fits me well.

478
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,960
You look beautiful.

479
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
How do you know?

480
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,560
Did you come to the scene?

481
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,920
I just want to see you.

482
00:20:59,360 --> 00:20:59,960
you

483
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,400
Are you free after the dinner?

484
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,120
Yes

485
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,400
that

486
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,760
See you after the dinner.

487
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,960
See you later.

488
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,240
Look.

489
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,640
Mr. Zhao of Ruiqi Group is here too.

490
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,200
I heard that he rarely

491
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,000
In public.

492
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,200
It's a rare opportunity.

493
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,240
Let's go and say hello to him.

494
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,280
Maybe in the future,

495
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,360
There will be business cooperation.

496
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,000
That makes sense. Let's go.

497
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,080
Mr. Zhao.

498
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,480
Mr. Zhao.

499
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,440
Nice to meet you.

500
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,200
Nice to meet you.

501
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,880
Mr. Zhao.

502
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,160
Mr. Zhao.

503
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,080
Please.

504
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,480
Excuse me.

505
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,320
Talk to you later.

506
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:12,920
good

507
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Long time no see

508
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,760
Your expression should be

509
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,720
Remember me?

510
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,880
therefore

511
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,640
You should remember Su Xiao.

512
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,480
Let's give a warm applause

513
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,360
Congratulations to Mr. Wang.

514
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,960
To take photos of our treasures.

515
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,560
You're my date tonight.

516
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,960
I don't want

517
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,000
You're distracted by anything.

518
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

519
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,120
this

520
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,600
Is the last item of the night.

521
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360

Was once a famous person.

A token of love for his wife.

525
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,000
In the past 200 years,

526
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,960
In history,

527

Never appeared in public.

528
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,840
So powerful

529
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,480
A precious necklace.

530
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,360
This is a charity dinner.

531

The biggest surprise.

Of course

541
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,160
I'm here to attend this dinner.

542
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,440
One is for charity.

550
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,320
This is the best publicity.

551
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,040

552
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,240
Mr. Ji of Wing Fashion.

553
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,440
Why haven't you come yet?

554
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,800
His name is on the register.

555
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,680
But just now,

556
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,880
Seems to have left.

557
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,880
Let's go.

558
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,840
Right

559
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Why are you here and gone?

560
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,960
Thank you

561
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,920
Nothing

562
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,320
Who is there now?

563
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,280
Do you want to bid?

564
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,760
If not,

565
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,080
I'm counting down.

566
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,320

567
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,320

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,120
The Mount Everest.

576
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,280
Zimmer just left.

577
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,760

578
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,200
Please invite Mr. Zhao Yucheng and our

Mount Everest for a group photo.

580
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,160
Zimmer

581
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,080
Why are you out?

582
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,360
Don't you have something to tell me?

583
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,080
Nothing?

584
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
Namely

585
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,440
Something happened recently.

586
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,640
And collect your thoughts.

587
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,360
What happened?

588
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,680
Tell me.

589
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,840
Nothing?

590
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,760
Go back first.

591
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,760
You're lying.

592
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,440
You said that

593
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,240
You have to cover up.

594
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,800
When I'm feeling,

595
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,400
The blink speed will be increased.

596
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,960
You were like this just now.

597
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,040
You're wrong.

598
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,640
What's wrong with you?

599
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,040
Recently, I'm a little confused.

600
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,200
I want to be alone.

601
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,840
When I was in trouble,

602
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,520
It's all because of you.

603
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,040
What's the matter now?

604
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,480
You can tell me.

605
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,000
I'll share it with you.

606
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,120
No need.

607
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,280
But we agreed to be friends.

608
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,120
Don't you think so?

609
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,480
Friends should help each other.

610
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,040
I

611
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,200
Every night,

612
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,560
Are waiting for you to find me.

613
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,640
When I go home every day,

614
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,200
At the door, I would think

615
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,600
Will you show up?

616
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,840
Wait for me at the door.

617
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,680
I went to bed late every night.

618
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,120
Because I'm waiting.

619
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,360
Would you text me?

620
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,520
You don't have to wait any longer.

621
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,080
What do you mean?

622
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,280
Just think of us

623
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,360
Nothing happened, right?

624
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,120
sorry

625
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,600
Congratulations to President Zhao.

626
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,880
The Mount Everest.

627
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm curious.

628
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,440
Take this necklace.

629
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,880
For your own collection?

630
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,040
No

631
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,560
I'm planning to put this necklace

632
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,040
For my date tonight.

633
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,160
Dugu Ruoruo is a male.

634
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Dugu is like a man.

635
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,880
Where are you?

636
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,240
Show up.

637
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,040
Happiness has already

638
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,720
Has befallen you.

639
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,040
It must be that bastard Zimmer again.

640
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,720
And made Ruuo cry.

641
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,720
What are you doing?

642
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,160
It seems that this gift

643
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,840
What a pleasant surprise.

644
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,000
Our Miss Duguoruo,

645
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,800
I'm at a loss.

646
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,760
Miss Dugu,

647
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,440
Don't be so moved.

648
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,680
Come to the stage.

649
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,200
Accept your gift.

650
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Hold on, everyone.

651
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,520
To show my sincerity,

652
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,480
I'm going to

653
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,440
I'm Dugu Ruuo's young lady.

654
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,800
Wear this necklace.

655
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,600
Sorry to bother you

656
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,640
Okay, President Zhao.

657
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,680
It's so touching.

658
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,000
Finished

659
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,720
If you don't accept it,

660
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,520
No one can close it.

661
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,560
It's over.

662
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,280
If a man

663
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,560
If a man

664
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,240
What happened between you and Zimmer?

665
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,000
Nothing?

666
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,200
We won't meet again.

667
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,000
No

668
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,480
You were fine before.

669
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,000
What?

670
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,600
Can you not ask me now?

671
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,120
If you're a male,

672
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,480
Mr. Zhao, take you home.

673
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,520
Go back first.

674
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,040
I have something to solve.

675
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,200
please

676
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,160
What happened?

677
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,400
Mr. Zhao.

678
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,159
Thank you.

679
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,400
I can't take this.

680
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,120
This is my gift.

681
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,840
How could you take it back?

682
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,560
Then you might

683
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,159
To make an exception for me.

684
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,600
I hope that

685
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,560
Are equal.

686
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,360
And I don't like to owe others.

687
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,320
If a man

688
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,440
You are always hard on yourself.

689
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,280
We must be equal.

690
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,239
Actually, it's for myself.

691
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,520
The biggest inequality.

692
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,600
Mr. Zhao.

693
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,840
I can't accept your kindness.

694
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,120
good

695
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,320
that

696
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,360
I'll keep it for you temporarily.

697
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,199
Then you must promise me.

698
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,239
Go somewhere with me.

699
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,159
Maybe next time.

700
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,400
I'm a little tired.

701
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,600
I want to go back and rest.

702
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,440
You just rejected me once.

703
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,880
Are you going to reject me a second time?

704
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,679
How could I

705
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,360
You have no face.

706
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,920
Alright then.

707
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,720
The scenery here is beautiful.

708
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,280
You can see

709
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,600
The beautiful scenery of the Bund.

710
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,440
Hello

711
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,120
According to what I told you,

712
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,720
Get ready.

713
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,560
Okay, please wait a moment.

714
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,280
Thank you

715
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,760
What are you thinking?

716
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,160
The night view here is so beautiful.

717
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Do you often come here?

718
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,000
The night before I left Shanghai,

719
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Once.

720
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,200
He often came back.

721
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,880
You still remember

722
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,960
The wine here must be unforgettable.

723
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,280
In fact,

724
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,520
Is not an irrelevant experience.

725
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,080
But the feeling inside.

726
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Just like the beautiful scenery you just thought of.

727
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,520
Unforgettable because it is beautiful.

728
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,840
But I'm different.

729
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,720
This place

730
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,040
Unforgettable

731
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,720
It's pain.

732
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,560
pain

733
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,320
When I first came here,

734
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,080
I've learned that

735
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,600
Who are very important to me.

736
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,800
Seriously ill.

737
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,160
I don't know what to do.

738
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,000
I don't know what to do.

739
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,520
Right here.

740
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,320
I drank the whole night.

741
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,320
Before dawn,

742
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,960
I finally cried.

743
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,000
Of course

744
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,680
I'm not crying because of venting.

745
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,080
But to remember

746
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,800
Remember the pain.

747
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,040
I need it.

748
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,520
To remind me all the time.

749
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,000
What should I do?

750
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,520
The pain is so rational.

751
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,040
You're so self-destructive.

752
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,960
Actually, men are

753
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,040
Rational

754
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,840
Women are sensitive.

755
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,840
And rational people

756
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,160
The memory of pain

757
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,480
Will be more profound.

758
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,400
So a man's self-healing ability

759
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,600
It's better than a woman.

760
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,440
Every time I want to cry,

761
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,080
To eat hotpot.

762
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,720
A lot of chillies.

763
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,000
Eating and crying.

764
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,760
It's like

765
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,400
I was crying because of the heat.

766
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,880
Because I hate crying myself.

767
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,520
I hate the way I look vulnerable.

768
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,920
Then a man told me

769
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,560
The way I'm sad,

770
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,520
It hurts my stomach.

771
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,880
He said

772
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,520
I can go swimming.

773
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,120
Because if you cry in the water,

774
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,480
No one will find out.

775
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,480
I'm exhausted.

776
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,560
I've sent it to you.

777
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm going home.

778
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,840
Bye

779
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,360
Okay, bye.

780
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm leaving.

781
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,120
Bye

782
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,000
That

783
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,960
to wait a moment

784
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,560
Help me with the zipper.

785
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,560
I can't reach it.

786
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,680
It's not zipping.

787
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,680
You're a big man.

788
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,920
Why are you gossiping?

789
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,480
I asked you to help me. Hurry up.

790
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,520
How long is the zipper?

791
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,000
What are you thinking?

792
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,440
Nothing, nothing.

793
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,480
I pull the zipper.

794
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,760
Then you didn't answer the phone.

795
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,880
It's ringing all the time.

796
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,120
Really

797
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,160
Zimmer

798
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,680
Hello, Ellie.

799
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
Come and drink with me.

800
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,120
The old place.

801
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,160
Zimmer, right?

802
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,760
Wait for me. I'll go with you.

803
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
I want to settle a score with him.

804
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,240
No

805
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,000
It's not appropriate for you to go with me.

806
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,320
You and I used to know each other.

807
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,720
A girl is very alike.

808
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,640
She's the same as you.

809
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,880
You are always optimistic in front of people.

810
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,760
And strong side.

811
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,560
Because she didn't want

812
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,200
You put your vulnerable side

813
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,760
To show others.

814
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,000
This is for you.

815
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,840
I'll stay with you.

816
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,080
Tonight,

817
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,560
Cry if you want to.

818
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,200
I've gone through

819
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,040
When you want to cry.

820
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,000
When I was young,

821
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,640
I want to give my tears to you.

822
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,040
And let the whole world know

823
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm sad.

824
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,600
Now I'm old,

825
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,440
It's more practical.

826
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,880
Actually, it's good to think about it.

827
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Everyone has their own

828
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,360
Experience and past

829
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,760
Why should I ask them

830
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,760
Without traces,

831
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,680
Actually, this is the first time

832
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,440
When I saw you,

833
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,960
I thought you were special.

834
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,920
I think you have a lot of experience.

835
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,800
There are many stories.

836
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,240
But in my heart,

837
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,720
But still keeps a naivety.

838
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,560
At my age,

839
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,320
Stay innocent.

840
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,760
Is not a good thing.

841
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,520
wrong

842
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,520
I think it's good.

843
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,840
Because it's so rare.

844
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,040
So precious.

845
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,840
Especially for us.

846
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,840
At this age,

847
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,720
Actually, there's a saying.

848
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,040
I've been wanting to tell you.

849
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,320
Who made you cry.

850
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,200
It's not worth thinking about.

851
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,800
Thank you for today.

852
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,640
And thank you for the wine.

853
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,960
It's my pleasure.

854
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,680
Have a drink with you here.

855
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,560
If you want to drink in the future,

856
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,920
You can always come to me.

857
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,560
Are you all right?

858
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,720
Sit and drink.

859
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,240
Sit down, please.

860
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,080
I'll drink with you.

861
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,400
She insisted on coming.

862
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,040
Sit there.

863
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,000
Really!

864
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,280
You're so handsome.

865
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,960
You made Ruuo so sad.

866
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,040
You're still thinking about it.

867
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,920
