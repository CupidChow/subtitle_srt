1
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,680
What are you pressing?

2
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm buying coffee for you.

3
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,120
You fool.

4
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,360
You didn't check your phone?

5
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,160
Now the whole world

6
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,200
Are all rumors about you and Star.

7
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,120
Are you happy now?

8
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,880
what

9
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,560
I'm gossiping with Star.

10
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes

11
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,360
That's right.

12
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,440
Will it affect him?

13
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,000
You still care about him.

14
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,560
Worry about yourself first.

15
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,960
let it be

16
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,440
Tell me where you are.

17
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,120
I'll pick you up.

18
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,720
You're so stupid.

19
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,560
You know, right?

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,520
I can't explain it.

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,040
You're killing me.

22
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,160
Is he a brain circuit?

23
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,200
Is abnormal.

24
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,480
feed

25
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,240
sister

26
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,600
to be sorry

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
I've caused you trouble again.

28
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,680
You didn't do anything wrong.

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,680
Tong Tong did this.

30
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,000
You don't have to apologize to me.

31
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,600
I didn't think it through.

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,840
I should have thought of it.

33
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,760
Besides,

34
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,360
Qian Sha loves you.

35
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
And her identity

36
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
It was special.

37
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,600
If you can't handle it well,

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,520
Will cause her trouble.

39
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
You're still thinking about her.

40
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,040
I thought you always

41
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,240
I hate her.

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
I don't like her.

43
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,200
Impulsive and childish.

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,200
but

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,840
I don't hate her.

46
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,200
What's more,

47
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,960
She's also a victim.

48
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,240
How about this?

49
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,920
I'll send you back.

50
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,400
Don't go to the crew today.

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,240
We'll talk about it when it's settled.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,640
Oh

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,880
Alright

54
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,920
That's it then.

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,000
It's all my fault.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,760
Take me to the crew.

57
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,840
I'm going to find Star.

58
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,920
Has become like this.

59
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,400
You're going to find Star.

60
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,160
Why can't I go to him?

61
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,959
Stop the car.

62
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,800
I'm going to find Star.

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,400
Thousand yarn.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,680
To fall in love with someone?

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,640
first

66
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
You have to try to make yourself

67
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,840
As an adult,

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,400
To face the problem.

69
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,120
Or think about a problem.

70
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,720
You always said you liked Star.

71
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,520
But have you ever done something

72
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,280
Is it good for Star?

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,960
Why haven't I done it before?

74
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,640
For him,

75
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,560
As an assistant.

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,680
To help others.

77
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,560
Am I good enough for him?

78
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,680
But when you do this,

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,760
Did you ask Sida about it?

80
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,120
Or have you considered

81
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,240
How Star feels.

82
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,240
Or else,

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,040
Is it possible for you to do this?

84
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,680
Will cause trouble to Star.

85
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,440
Of course

86
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,640
I'm not Sida.

87
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,440
I'm not sure.

88
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,000
But there's one thing.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,880
I'm sure.

90
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,280
The problem of Star.

91
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,480
It will definitely affect Ruuo.

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
But if a man is the one I care about the most,

93
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,400
So I don't want you

94
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,760
If you keep fooling around,

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,760
Also

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,720
How to explain to your father?

97
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,880
Think about it.

98
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,040
What you're talking about,

99
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
I know everything.

100
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,240
All of you are talking about

101
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,880
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,920
But I just can't help it.

103
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,600
I just can't not like him.

104
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,440
I can't do that.

105
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,680
To make Star like me.

106
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,240
What can I do?

107
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,600
What's wrong?

108
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
In bad mood

109
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,600
Sida is gossiping with Qiansha.

110
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
I've been

111
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,520
Are dealing with this.

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,880
You know,

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
I'm looking for a chance.

114
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,760
To clarify and explain.

115
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,160
You should simply make a statement.

116
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,360
Just deny it.

117
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,120
Stop looking.

118
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,400
Don't take it.

119
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,200
I'll handle things.

120
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,960
take

121
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Sit down.

122
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,880
Sit down

123
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,920
Sit down

124
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,880
good

125
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,840
Okay, put it away.

126
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,600
Now,

127
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,160
The cerebral cortex is tense.

128
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,840
The cell activity is not high.

129
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,080
Take it easy.

130
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,080
Maybe I can figure out

131
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,280
A better solution?

132
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,520
is or isn't

133
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,400
So you helped a lot of women

134
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,200
Press the on.

135
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,720
Why are you laughing?

136
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,960
Take a guess.

137
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,040
I guess

138
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,080
So you really helped a lot of women.

139
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,880
Press the on.

140
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,240
Under what circumstances,

141
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,720
Just the two of you?

142
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,760
How many times?

143
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Press where?

144
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,160
I pressed it.

145
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,520
therefore

146
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,880
So you really helped a lot of girls.

147
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,520
Press the on.

148
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,920
How could it be?

149
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,800
I just pressed it for you.

150
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,880
and

151
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,600
I have more.

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,640
New massage methods.

153
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,600
Do you want to...

154
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,320
Do not

155
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,680
I'm going to take a shower.

156
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,560
Don't you want to feel it?

157
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,640
Don't look at me like this.

158
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,040
My face is like a red apple.

159
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,600
Who's looking at you?

160
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,680
Smugness

161
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,520
Dugu is like a man.

162
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,880
Wake up.

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,520
Don't be fooled by him.

164
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,960
Good girl.

165
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,400
I just saw

166
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,440
The news about Star.

167
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,880
How are you going to solve it?

168
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,920
I'm going to let Qiansha go.

169
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,000
What do you think

170
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
I think

171
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,000
To leave Qiansha.

172
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,160
why

173
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,360
As a public figure,

174
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,840
He has a hidden function.

175
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,520
Is to satisfy people's selfish desires.

176
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,560
And curiosity.

177
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,480
to speak frankly

178
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,920
The public doesn't care.

179
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,960
The truth of the matter.

180
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
What they care about

181
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,760
But what they think is the truth.

182
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,120
therefore

183
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,640
Let Qian Sha go now.

184
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,840
Instead, he tried to cover it up.

185
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,680
Do I have to admit that

186
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,840
Their rumors?

187
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,480
This is confusing black and white.

188
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,560
Not everything

189
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,840
Are black and white.

190
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
Between black and white,

191
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,640
There's a middle ground.

192
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm not asking you to admit your relationship.

193
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,600
I'm asking you to admit that

194
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,680
The existence of Qiansha.

195
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,480
You have to give her

196
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,560
To set an identity.

197
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,200
To satisfy all the public.

198
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,280
Their psychological expectation

199
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,080
and

200
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,000
You didn't stand

201
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,840
Their opposite.

202
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,000
That's more convincing.

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,640
And convincing.

204
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,840
It's easier to accept.

205
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,080
To reestablish an identity.

206
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,120
If you really care,

207
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,160
If Qian Sha

208
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,720
Tell Tong Tong to stay away from her.

209
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,240
Don't let her use

210
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,200
Dirty tricks.

211
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,000
To take advantage of

212
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,080
A simple girl.

213
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,040
Are you looking for me?

214
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,680
Is this...

215
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,720
What are you doing?

216
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm asking you something.

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,520
Did you do it or not?

218
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,280
yes

219
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,240
I made it.

220
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,120
What's up

221
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,360
Why are you doing this?

222
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,960
Do you know what you did?

223
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,600
She's going to

224
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,800
How much damage will it cause?

225
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,480
Have you ever thought about

226
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,520
Her situation

227
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,680
Are you serious?

228
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,960
You are doing this for Shen Qiansha.

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,280
Why are you yelling at me?

230
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,960
Such a scandal can hit

231
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,360
Dugu Ruuo Man and Si Da

232
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Shouldn't you be happy?

233
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
Is that right?

234
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,080
Our goal has been achieved.

235
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,680
Don't use us to describe us.

236
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,560
You and I

237
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,880
Are not the same people.

238
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,920
I was really blind.

239
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,160
I want you to be my manager.

240
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,720
I really envy Star.

241
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
He chose the right agent.

242
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
At least, you're alone and male.

243
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,000
I won't be as despicable as you.

244
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,880
Why did you ask me here?

245
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,960
Is the crew settled?

246
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,480
Did Star go back to filming?

247
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,760
I'm calling you out.

248
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,480
I want to tell you something.

249
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,920
what?

250
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,360
Shen Qiansha.

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,040
You're dismissed.

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
why

253
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,640
Why did you fire me?

254
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,200
You've caused so much trouble.

255
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,400
No one can protect you

256
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,520
I'm a popular star.

257
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,440
You can't be the only one

258
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,480
I'm involved.

259
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,080
Even you started to hate me.

260
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,000
You don't want to.

261
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,920
As my assistant?

262
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,800
Now you're completely free.

263
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,800
I will never order you again.

264
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,120
You don't have to be depressed.

265
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,480
For Star.

266
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,800
I used to think we could be

267
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,080
A very good friend.

268
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,680
Now,

269
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,840
It's unnecessary.

270
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,040
Because you have no taste.

271
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,600
You can't understand it at all.

272
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
My kindness to you

273
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,320
You are not qualified to be my assistant.

274
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,440
That's it.

275
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,600
It will be 520 in a few days.

276
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,880
Even if

277
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,320
My holiday gift to you.

278
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,040
Are you really going to fire me?

279
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,120
Don't regret it.

280
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,560
You hate me so much?

281
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,080
I don't know about Sida.

282
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,400
How is it now?

283
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
What are we waiting for?

284
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,480
Why are you still here?

285
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,240
Miss

286
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,280
Waiting for your luggage.

287
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,720
Mr. Shen said to take you to the airport.

288
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,960
Open the door!

289
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,240
I'm not going back.

290
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,920
I'm not going back to Dali.

291
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,320
Let me down.

292
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,760
Miss

293
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,040
Let me down.

294
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,200
Miss, I'm not going back.

295
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
I'm not going back.

296
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,280
I don't even know about Star.

297
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,120
What is the situation?

298
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,640
I'm not going back.

299
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,640
Let me down, miss.

300
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,280
Miss

301
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,760
President Shen's attitude

302
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,880
Very determined.

303
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,240
You should go back.

304
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,440
Alright

305
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
but

306
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,880
Before that, I have another one.

307
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,240
A little wish.

308
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,400
you

309
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,440
Can you take me somewhere?

310
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,520
I swear,

311
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,040
I won't go anywhere this time.

312
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,600
Miss

313
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,560
It's almost time.

314
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,200
We are leaving for the airport.

315
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,640
Give me a little more time.

316
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,360
please!

317
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,880
Star Wars.

318
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
If you can feel me,

319
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,760
You must come and save me.

320
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,640
Please, please.

321
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,680
You must come and save me.

322
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,800
Star Wars.

323
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,560
Come down.

324
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,680
Star, come down.

325
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,360
Sida

326
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,280
Shen Qiansha.

327
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,800
Why are you here?

328
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,720
Sida

329
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,240
Do you remember when we were in Yunnan?

330
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,320
When we first met,

331
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,920
You helped me escape from the wedding.

332
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,040
Help me again.

333
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,240
For the last time.

334
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,080
I promise.

335
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,200
If you help me this time,

336
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,760
I'll never bother you again.

337
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,800
please!

338
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,040
go

339
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,240
Miss

340
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Get in the car.

341
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,880
Why are you being chased again?

342
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,480
You were forced to marry again.

343
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
My dad

344
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,840
And ask them to take me back to Dali.

345
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,840
I want to

346
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,960
Before we leave,

347
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,320
I'll see you again.

348
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,960
After the incident,

349
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,840
I haven't been able to contact you.

350
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,160
But don't worry.

351
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,160
I just...

352
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,280
I just want to

353
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,280
Just so you know,

354
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
sorry

355
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,600
It's okay.

356
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,320
It wasn't your fault.

357
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,000
What's your plan in the future?

358
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,760
I'm going back.

359
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,840
Well

360
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,560
Alright then.

361
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,520
I wish you

362
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,720
Everything went well.

363
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,800
sorry

364
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,920
Nothing

365
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,840
Don't worry.

366
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,280
On the day I left,

367
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,160
I will definitely tell the outside world

368
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,000
You always warned me.

369
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,680
To stay away from you.

370
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,920
But I didn't listen to it.

371
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,160
That's why they appeared.

372
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,880
Such a photo.

373
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,720
Why are you doing this?

374
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,640
You're only going to

375
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,880
To scold more people.

376
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,160
it doesn't matter

377
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
This is the truth.

378
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
It's me.

379
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,920
To love you unilaterally.

380
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,840
I used to think

381
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,360
If you love someone,

382
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,440
Is my own business.

383
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,280
But I didn't expect that I like others.

384
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,240
Will cause trouble to others.

385
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,280
But don't worry.

386
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll never bother you again.

387
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,800
Really

388
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,320
I want to...

389
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,240
I think I can

390
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,880
Looking at you,

391
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,680
So far away,

392
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,160
Looking at you from afar.

393
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,440
sorry

394
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,640
Please forgive me.

395
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,560
I'm selfish and childish.

396
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,160
And forgive you.

397
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
I'm so...

398
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,720
Likeyou

399
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,400
You don't have to leave.

400
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,560
if

401
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,800
I asked you to stay.

402
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,400
and

403
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,600
To make you

404
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,720
The assistant of Star.

405
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Will you

406
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,280
this

407
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,560
That's impossible.

408
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,160
You always hate me so much.

409
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,600
That's right.

410
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,320
So I'm going to take you

411
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,160
Stay with me.

412
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,440
Torture you every day.

413
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,120
Have you thought about it?

414
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,640
Listen to me from now on.

415
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,400
Also

416
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,800
You can't do anything to Si Da.

417
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,160
Besides being an assistant,

418
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,480
Can you do that?

419
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,800
I can.

420
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,680
Well

421
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,240
If you're a male,

422
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,280
This time, Sida

423
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,840
The attention.

424
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,640
All the brands

425
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,920
Want to cooperate with Star.

426
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,760
If you're a male,

427
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,880
You're really a gold broker.

428
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,560
This wave operation

429
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,880
You don't have to work during working hours.

430
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,600
Really?

431
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,040
There's so much time for gossiping.

432
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,040
If you really have the means,

433
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,200
Black can be white.

434
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,880
And went to the media to act.

435
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,960
And sympathy.

436
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,320
But also intentionally connote me.

437
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,640
Now the outside world thinks

438
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,880
I sent the message.

439
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,960
Is it revenge?

440
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Why are you so scared?

441
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,280
I'll take revenge on you.

442
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,040
Did you do too much?

443
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,480
I'm sorry for what happened to me.

444
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,200
But don't worry.

445
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't care about

446
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,520
The next three indiscriminate techniques are not interested.

447
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,360
I don't like to fight.

448
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,000
Besides, the grade is different.

449
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,480
Correct!

450
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,960
I advise you to be more thoughtful.

451
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,200
On the artists,

452
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,400
Be professional.

453
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,680
Don't make troubles.

454
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,760
It's so disgusting.

455
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,520
That's right.

456
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,400
After all, she's also a male sister.

457
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,120
Brought it out, right?

458
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,160
That's right.

459
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
So ungrateful.

460
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,360
You've been acting like this behind my back.

461
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,400
And framed Ruo's boyfriend.

462
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,720
That's right.

463
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,520
People and animals seem to be harmless.

464
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,280
Who knows

465
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,840
So dark and vicious.

466
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,440
Really

467
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,800
No wonder Song Zihao has been

468
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,840
The popularity has dropped so much.

469
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,480
Namely

470
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,640
In my opinion,

471
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,200
She's the manager.

472
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,920
Sooner or later,

473
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,560
Right?

474
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,440
I'm sure.

475
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,040
Dugu is like a man.

476
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,440
I will definitely let you

477
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,840
It's hard to lose.

478
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,400
Mr. Zhao.

479
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,120
I have investigated

480
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,040
Wing Fashion wants to sign the contract.

481
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,080
A new designer.

482
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,480
This is her file.

483
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,160
Look.

484
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,640
Should we steal

485
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,200
Before,

486
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,560
To poach this designer.

487
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,360
Don't bother.

488
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,640
This matter

489
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,800
Don't interfere for the moment.

490
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,840
good

491
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,960
Are you busy

492
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,920
Yeah, what's wrong?

493
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:12,920
Nothing?

494
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,760
I just want to tell you.

495
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,880
The trick you taught me.

496
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,160
Psychology PR is so effective.

497
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,840
The crisis of Star has been solved.

498
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,560
It's all because of you.

499
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,680
My military adviser.

500
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,440
At your service.

501
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,560
My lady.

502
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,200
Are you free tonight?

503
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,240
My treat

504
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,520
good

505
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
I'll be off soon.

506
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,080
I'll pick you up at the office later.

507
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,960
This bed is too hard.

508
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,960
I'm so tired of sleeping.

509
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,920
It's over.

510
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You'll be late for work.

511
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,840
car

512
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,040
car

513
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,320
Master worker

514
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,920
Master worker

515
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,960
Wait for me.

516
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,520
Master worker

517
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,720
If you're young,

518
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,680
If you're a boy,

519
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,440
If you're young,

520
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
Where is Shen Qiansha?

521
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,320
It's not here yet.

522
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,600
Yes

523
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,560
Call her.

524
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,320
Tell her to arrive within half an hour.

525
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,760
Otherwise, she wouldn't have come.

526
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,120
what

527
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,440
If what you said

528
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,840
Okay, I'll be there soon.

529
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,760
My shoes.

530
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,160
Excuse me.

531
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,400
Where are my shoes?

532
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,680
Sorry, my shoes.

533
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,440
Where are my shoes?

534
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
Where are my shoes?

535
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,120
It's too late.

536
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,840
Sorry

537
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,480
Why haven't you arrived yet?

538
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,840
I'm getting angry.

539
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,800
sorry

540
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,160
Why are you on your first day?

541
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,920
I'm late.

542
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,760
I didn't mean to.

543
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,480
I missed the bus.

544
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,880
I can't take the subway.

545
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,520
I was almost lost.

546
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,480
My shoes are also

547
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,840
No matter what your situation is,

548
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,160
You didn't arrive on time.

549
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,080
You don't even have the basic idea of punctuality

550
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,960
Nothing.

551
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,080
What else can you do?

552
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,160
sorry

553
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,880
I'll never be late again.

554
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,800
If you make another mistake,

555
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,760
Just go away.

556
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,800
I won't stay here.

557
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,520
And pampered.

558
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,440
Just now,

559
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,480
Are you too hard on Qiansha?

560
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,400
I think, of course,

561
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,920
It must be wrong for her to be late.

562
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,120
But I heard that

563
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,600
She seems to want to

564
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,000
And broke up with the family.

565
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,080
Cut off all economic income.

566
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,960
And moved to the suburbs.

567
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,120
To live for a while.

568
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,400
Such a big change.

569
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,800
Must be a little uncomfortable.

570
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,000
Or

571
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,040
Please give her more time.

572
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
To get used to the new lifestyle.

573
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,800
I just want her to get used to it.

574
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,040
That's why you are so strict.

575
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,880
Only when you have requirements can you make progress.

576
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,800
It's the same to you and her.

577
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,400
This is a battlefield.

578
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,160
You must show the fighting attitude.

579
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,360
Otherwise, the opponent will

580
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,520
Step on the bottom of your feet.

581
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,760
Tong Tong is a warning.

582
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,240
I see.

583
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,880
It's for Qiansha's own good.

584
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,280
I hope she can

585
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,440
Hurry up, understand?

586
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,440
Finally, I made it.

587
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,480
The assistant of Star.

588
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,000
Are you beautiful?

589
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,360
Congratulations.

590
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,320
You're back.

591
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,280
The weasel paid a visit to the chicken.

592
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,720
I don't want your congratulations.

593
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,240
She was alone just now.

594
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,320
When you scold me,

595
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,800
I didn't see you have such backbone.

596
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,200
To be with Star.

597
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,720
You don't even have dignity.

598
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,600
Is it worth it?

599
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,600
I was wrong.

600
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,560
Dugu Ruo is right to scold me.

601
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,920
and

602
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,640
When I was most helpless,

603
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,360
She helped me stay here.

604
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,760
Just because of this,

605
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm supposed to

606
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,720
Appreciate her.

607
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,240
She can scold me at will.

608
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,600
When are you going to

609
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,040
You've become so sensible.

610
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,880
I'm standing here now.

611
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
I made up my mind

612
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,080
To change yourself.

613
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,280
I'm not the one

614
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,160
Provide for oneself and live comfortably

615
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,880
Who caused trouble everywhere.

616
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
And become

617
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,840
And rented a house in the suburbs.

618
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,800
Commuting to work by bus every day.

619
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,840
With a monthly salary of 3,000 yuan,

620
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,560
A normal girl who can live.

621
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,800
Wait a second.

622
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,920
What are you doing?

623
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,640
Put it on.

624
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,040
Why should I wear your shoes?

625
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,320
I suddenly look at this pair of shoes.

626
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,720
I don't want to wear it anymore.

627
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:44,880
You've come down to

628
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,000
You even lost your shoes.

629
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,920
You don't care about picking up what I threw away.

630
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,800
Why are you so mean?

631
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,160
You're back.

632
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,920
I'm a little drunk.

633
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,080
Your acting is getting worse.

634
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,640
You pretend to be sleepwalking.

635
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,760
I'm not allowed to pretend to be drunk.

636
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,520
It's really incomprehensible.

637
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,400
Go ahead.

638
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,640
Why are you asking me to help?

639
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,280
Am I in your eyes?

640
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,880
Is just a

641
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,400
Are you a mercenary?

642
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,880
Aren't you?

643
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,760
good

644
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,120
I'm

645
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,640
Move out of my way

646
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,600
What's wrong? This is your aunt.

647
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,120
I don't want to talk to you now.

648
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,520
I don't want to see you.

649
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,360
Leave.

650
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,160
It's weird.

651
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,920
If I ask you to leave, I will.

652
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,840
I've never seen you so obedient.

653
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,920
wood

654
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,520
unromantic

655
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,080
Women need to be coaxed.

656
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,240
You won't be coaxed.

657
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,840
silly

658
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,480
Why?

659
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,160
Don't you like

660
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,360
When I wear glasses?

661
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,640
Don't be narcissistic.

662
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,960
I hate it when you wear glasses.

663
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,800
It's so ugly.

664
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
You're lying.

665
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,040
I only wear it for you.

666
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,120
I want to ask you a question.

667
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,920
And ask her frankly.

668
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,199
Do you want to live with me?

669
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:29,960
520

670
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,560
520

671
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,120
good

672
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,679
you

673
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,719
There are so many things.

674
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,520
Let me take it for you.

675
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
No, no.

676
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,280
That's what an assistant should do.

677
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,600
Do you want to drink the script?

678
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,680
I'm not drinking.

679
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,640
Sit down.

680
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,760
Nothing

681
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,080
Read the script.

682
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,720
Seventy-first

683
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,520
Put the cup here.

684
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,720
good

685
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,520
You're sweating a lot.

686
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,080
Let me fix your makeup.

687
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,880
In the past,

688
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,640
I've invited

689
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,680
A famous makeup artist.

690
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,720
You can only be wronged now.

691
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,000
With my three-legged skills.

692
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,520
There are crew makeup artists.

693
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,840
They are all surrounding Song Zihao.

694
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,640
Who cares about us?

695
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,920
Nothing

696
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,360
It's okay to ignore it.

697
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,600
There used to be so many people around me.

698
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,840
I don't think so.

699
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,920
and

700
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,560
I just want to be an actor.

701
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,720
The current life

702
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,120
Is actually what I want most.

703
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,880
And you helped me in the crew.

704
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,080
I've been thinking

705
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,280
It's easy.

706
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,440
Really?

707
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,920
Do you really think I'm useful?

708
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,200
Not only useful,

709
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,600
I really admire you.

710
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
It's amazing that

711
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,680
You can get used to it in time.

712
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,960
Sida

713
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,720
Are you ready?

714
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,280
That's it.

715
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,080
You're next.

716
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,880
Yes, right away.

717
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,800
The director and actors are here.

718
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,400
I'll go first.

719
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,000
He's here.

720
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,720
Come on

721
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,720
This job is so happy.

722
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,720
You can see Star every day.

723
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,760
Shen Qiansha.

724
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
You can't do this anymore.

725
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,560
And fell in love with Sida.

726
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,480
You're his assistant now.

727
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,880
You must do it.

728
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,680
To help him.

729
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,840
Come on

730
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,280
Thousand yarn.

731
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,480
There's a package for you outside.

732
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,520
good

733
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
cinema ticket

734
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,080
I haven't booked it.

735
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,480
Is it a mistake?

736
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,880
Thousand yarn.

737
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
Ask for a leave for me.

738
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,880
The tickets have arrived.

739
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,800
Just right

740
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
You ordered it?

741
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,200
Correct!

742
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,160
520,

743
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,280
Don't arrange work.

744
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
I want to celebrate.

745
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,480
Why are you so romantic?

746
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,200
You also know that

747
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,240
To watch a movie.

748
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,640
I really want to

749
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,600
At 520,

750
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,240
To watch a movie with your sister.

751
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,360
She already has Zhao Yucheng.

752
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,280
With Qi Mo?

753
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,080
When are you free to watch a movie with me?

754
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,280
That was before.

755
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,800
Things are different now.

756
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
I heard that

757
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,800
I got rid of them.

758
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,560
You've been waiting for so long.

759
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,760
I can finally show up.

760
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,320
Don't forget that

761
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,360
Ask for a leave for me.

762
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,400
I'm going back to shooting.

763
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,120
Shen Qiansha.

764
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,080
Don't be sad.

765
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,240
You're his assistant now.

766
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,240
He should have his own life.

767
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,840
Don't bother him again.

768
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,720
Did you hear that?

769
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,720
As long as I can

770
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,320
Stay with him.

771
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,720
That's it.

772
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,400
Running around with a bad cold.

773
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,440
You look preoccupied.

774
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,280
You came to me suddenly.

775
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,880
What's wrong?

776
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,600
sister

777
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,240
Actually, I'm here today.

778
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,880
Yes, I want to ask you.

779
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,320
520,

780
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,560
Do you have a plan?

781
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,520
gosh!

782
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,920
I forgot to confirm the date.

783
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,000
Have you got any work arrangement?

784
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:25,880
If that day

785
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,960
If Star wants to act,

786
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,800
It's inappropriate for me to go to the festival.

787
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,360
But if I stay with Star,

788
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,000
In the filming,

789
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,400
My date with Zimmer

790
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,280
It will be ruined.

791
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,160
That day, I put all my work

792
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,920
It's all gone.

793
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,680
I didn't shoot that day.

794
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,320
So I thought it would be good if I didn't act.

795
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
You should combine work with rest.

796
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,200
What's more, 520

797
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,440
Only once a year.

798
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,200
is or isn't

799
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,440
That's right.

800
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,640
That's what I think.

801
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,760
Take a leave, go home and have a good rest.

802
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,960
And healthy.

803
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,200
So that I can be more happy.

804
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,400
Get into work.

805
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,840
right or wrong?

806
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,880
That's right.

807
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,560
That's what I think.

808
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,440
So that day,

809
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,600
Actually, I have arranged a date.

810
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,480
If you don't act,

811
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,080
It's a deal then.

812
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Take a rest.

813
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,160
I'm dating.

814
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,160
I'm taking a rest.

815
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,960
I'm back

816
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
Didn't I keep you waiting?

817
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,720
Calm down. Someone else is here.

818
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,040
Brother

819
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,440
Star, you're here.

820
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,320
Why are you here?

821
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,120
Didn't he tell you?

822
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,080
I moved back.

823
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,320
Moved back.

824
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,480
But can you stay here?

825
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,560
I haven't figured it out yet.

826
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,160
No matter what happens,

827
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,600
I will definitely stay here.

828
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,520
Don't worry.

829
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,520
therefore

830
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,640
The date you mentioned just now

831
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,040
Brother?

832
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,080
Yeah, who else is there?

833
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,360
that

834
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,200
I'm leaving now.

835
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,800
You two have fun.

836
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,080
What's wrong with his nose?

837
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,160
to have a runny nose

838
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,080
Caught a cold.

839
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,800
such

840
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,840
Why is it weird?

841
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,640
No.

842
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,840
Then why are you wearing

843
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,320
I'm always like this.

844
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:36,840
It's cold.

845
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,520
It's not cold.

846
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,600
It's not cold. What are you wearing?

847
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,600
It's cold. I'm going to add some clothes.

848
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,160
I don't understand.

849
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:26,920
early

850
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,800
early
