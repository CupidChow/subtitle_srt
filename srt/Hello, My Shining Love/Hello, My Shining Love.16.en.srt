1
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
There was so much wine left yesterday.

2
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,280
You drank it all.

3
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,720
Well

4
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,120
I

5
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,160
I can't sleep.

6
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,040
I thought I could sleep if I drank too much.

7
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,000
The more I drank, the more annoying I was.

8
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,200
You're too calm.

9
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,200
How long did you play hard to get?

10
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
You should at least disappear.

11
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,080
A couple of days.

12
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,440
I'm leaving.

13
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,920
Si Da, where are you going?

14
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,640
I don't want to use your words.

15
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,680
Those methods

16
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,080
I can't bear to see her sad.

17
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,400
Even if she doesn't like me,

18
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,280
So what?

19
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,320
As long as I can look at her,

20
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,960
That's it.

21
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,640
Where have you been?

22
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,880
You didn't come back for one night.

23
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,680
No, no. Not like this.

24
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,600
Where are you going?

25
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,280
I'll go to Si Da's room.

26
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,520
See if he's back.

27
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,960
I went to the front desk just now.

28
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,400
She said she didn't come back for a night.

29
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,160
What can we do

30
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,920
I can't wait for nothing.

31
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,600
I have to find him.

32
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,200
Dali is so big.

33
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,120
Where are you going?

34
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,000
We must look for her.

35
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,440
We have to find a way.

36
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,840
What else can we do?

37
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,880
Now he's gone.

38
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,840
I'll go with you.

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,560
No need.

40
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,600
I've always treated him like a brother.

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,360
Let's go.

42
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,360
Sida

43
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,160
sister

44
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,440
Where have you been?

45
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,760
You scared me.

46
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,800
He didn't come back for a night.

47
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,520
I

48
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,280
Where have you been?

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,000
I

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,600
I'm so worried. Do you know?

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
Your wings are hard.

52
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,440
Don't answer the phone.

53
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,000
I was wrong.

54
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,120
All right.

55
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,200
Just come back.

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,720
How is it? Are you hurt?

57
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,240
Nothing

58
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,000
Are you all right?

59
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,160
Have you eaten?

60
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,880
no

61
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
You haven't eaten yet.

62
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,160
Are you stupid?

63
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,760
Let's go.

64
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,000
You scared me to death.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,920
If you don't listen to me,

66
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,120
over there

67
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,080
I caught you laughing.

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,760
No,

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
Sit down.

70
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,280
I didn't scold you.

71
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,240
Why are you standing there?

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,200
Sit down.

73
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,600
Oh

74
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,480
He didn't come back last night.

75
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,360
Where are you sleeping?

76
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,720
I

77
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,880
I went for a walk nearby.

78
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,840
Result

79
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,520
You lost your phone and got lost.

80
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,120
Alright

81
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,680
You're so grown up.

82
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,040
It won't be lost.

83
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,240
Nothing will happen.

84
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,720
Well

85
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,680
I'll let it go this time.

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,520
Okay?

87
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,680
Don't do it again.

88
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,760
Not to be taken as a precedent

89
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,040
I'm not unenlightened.

90
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,360
That kind of agent.

91
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,920
but

92
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,240
Since you're in the entertainment circle,

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,760
You have some thoughts in your mind.

94
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,600
You have to solve it yourself.

95
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Is that clear?

96
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,840
Well

97
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,360
Don't worry, sister.

98
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
I figured it out.

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,320
Recently,

100
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,360
A lot of things happened.

101
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,800
I want to have a little time.

102
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,760
I can accept it.

103
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,520
Well

104
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,160
Remember that.

105
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,560
Not next time.

106
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,080
If I can't reach you,

107
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,960
Do you know

108
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,560
I know, remember.

109
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,200
ensure

110
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,440
Guarantee, absolute guarantee.

111
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,120
That girl.

112
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,560
I saw you with my brother just now.

113
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,800
Are you two

114
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,840
Nothing

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,040
You disappeared.

116
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,240
He helped me find you.

117
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,760
Now you have found it.

118
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,360
He should be leaving.

119
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,520
I just told Wishing Tree

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,640
If I see you again,

121
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,520
I must be brave.

122
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,040
I'm here to work.

123
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,960
I didn't know you were here.

124
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,320
I always wanted to stay away from you.

125
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,000
I won't disturb your life.

126
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,480
This is my last...

127
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,200
I can do for you.

128
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,040
If I knew you were here,

129
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I will never come.

130
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,080
therefore

131
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,920
I flattered myself.

132
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,240
I shouldn't have treated you

133
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,120
You still have

134
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,640
An unrealistic fantasy.

135
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,840
The weather is so nice.

136
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,280
It's so beautiful.

137
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,920
That's right.

138
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,720
Just relax today.

139
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,960
Behave yourself.

140
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,320
Enjoy it.

141
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,800
Okay?

142
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,320
Certain

143
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,160
It's okay. Yeah.

144
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,040
That's enough.

145
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,360
Stop it.

146
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,880
Take a rest.

147
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,480
Si Da did well today.

148
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,320
Thank you, director.

149
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,400
Oh, my God.

150
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,440
Sida

151
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,560
to run fast

152
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,880
My dad's men came to catch me.

153
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,720
You were caught by them.

154
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,600
His legs will be broken.

155
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,000
Not Qian Sha.

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,400
I haven't finished the music video yet.

157
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,920
You can't shoot it here.

158
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Let's distract them first.

159
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,600
Then you can come back. Go.

160
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,760
sister

161
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,920
Wait me back

162
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,080
how could that be?

163
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,240
Who is this?

164
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,400
No

165
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,680
What's going on?

166
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,400
Where are you going?

167
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,840
Sida

168
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,280
What are you waiting for?

169
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,360
Let's go together.

170
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,520
Hurry up.

171
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,200
good

172
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,720
to do sth more quickly

173
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,440
Don't run away.

174
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,840
Hurry up.

175
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,160
what are you doing?

176
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,200
We can't leave.

177
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,800
to step aside

178
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,520
Sida

179
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,880
What happened

180
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,960
Star Wars.

181
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,120
Sida

182
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,720
You can't leave.

183
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,480
Sida

184
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,040
Don't do anything.

185
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,520
Follow me to the police station.

186
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,240
You've gone too far.

187
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,680
Follow me to the police station.

188
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,600
Take a look.

189
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:46,960
good

190
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,680
Are you going to vomit?

191
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Don't hate me so much.

192
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,280
I

193
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,280
I have heterosexual disorder.

194
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,960
The girl is too close to me.

195
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,480
I will feel uncomfortable.

196
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,200
Heterosexual communication disorder

197
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,080
What is that?

198
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,960
on

199
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,440
You can't be with a girl.

200
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,240
Too close.

201
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,440
You're really a rare species.

202
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,880
You must be twenty years old.

203
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,040
I've never been in a relationship since I was 20.

204
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,280
Blushing at the sight of a girl.

205
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,080
And so handsome.

206
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,800
I'm curious.

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,240
The woman you like

208
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,480
Why don't you like me?

209
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,640
because

210
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,360
She always takes me as her brother.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
In her eyes,

212
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,720
I'm not a man at all.

213
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,240
She's so weird.

214
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,560
She's not strange.

215
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,360
In my eyes,

216
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,600
Is unique.

217
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
You are the only one.

218
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,680
Don't you know?

219
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,800
Your own lethal power.

220
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,240
For a man like you,

221
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,800
It's the easiest to

222
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,160
A girl's love and protection.

223
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,200
It matches me.

224
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,520
The ideal boyfriend.

225
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,240
I

226
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,280
I'm going back.

227
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,680
I think I found mine.

228
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,040
The one.

229
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,080
We know the situation.

230
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,040
Please go to the waiting room.

231
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,800
Take a rest.

232
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,640
Sorry.

233
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,320
You are involved again.

234
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,520
Nothing

235
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,800
I'm used to it.

236
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,080
As long as I have you,

237
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,560
Everything is unknown.

238
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,680
You're still worrying about Star.

239
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't know about him.

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,440
Where did you go?

241
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,760
And I don't know who are chasing him.

242
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,680
Who is it?

243
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,080
Who is that girl?

244
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,280
If something really goes wrong,

245
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,800
Where can I find someone?

246
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,560
Maybe

247
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,360
He has gone back to the hotel.

248
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,680
Right?

249
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,200
I hope so.

250
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,440
Why are you there?

251
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,440
What?

252
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,480
Get your luggage from the hotel.

253
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
I bumped into you.

254
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,280
What can we do

255
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
I missed my flight.

256
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,200
Change the contract.

257
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,760
Sorry.

258
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,200
Don't apologize.

259
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,640
Haven't you always been like this?

260
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,680
Oh dear

261
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,880
You didn't make trouble for me.

262
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,080
When we were in Shanghai,

263
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,320
To the police station.

264
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,520
And now we're together.

265
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,960
In the police station,

266
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,240
It seems that the two of us

267
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,880
And the Public Security Bureau.

268
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,080
You have a good attitude.

269
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,280
I just want to

270
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,720
Things are going around.

271
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,400
Finally, I came back to the original point.

272
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,200
You know,

273
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,480
If we are not enemies,

274
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,680
Or we can just

275
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,080
As a normal friend,

276
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,040
Maybe not.

277
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,360
There are so many accidents.

278
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,760
And the story.

279
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,400
Whether it's an accident or a story,

280
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,000
Nice to meet you.

281
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,520
Actually, I think

282
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,840
It's good.

283
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,400
At least I can be with you.

284
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,560
Stay longer.

285
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,240
Director, director.

286
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,560
Sida

287
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,120
I just came back from the shooting site.

288
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,440
Have you seen Mrs. Ruo?

289
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,000
Your sister.

290
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,120
say no more

291
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,360
In order to pursue you,

292
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
I was caught fighting with someone.

293
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,400
I was going to pick her up.

294
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,280
Police Station

295
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,160
I'll go with you.

296
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,960
Get in the car.

297
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,160
Si Da, I'll go too.

298
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,880
Director, wait two minutes.

299
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,640
good

300
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,120
I beg you.

301
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,680
Go back.

302
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,840
Stop following me, okay?

303
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
What are you saying?

304
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,160
To go back to the hotel by myself?

305
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,080
Not to go back to the hotel.

306
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,120
To let you go home.

307
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,680
The two of us

308
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
We met by chance.

309
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,079
I have no obligation to take care of you anymore.

310
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
I don't want to go back.

311
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,680
You don't want the trouble.

312
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,440
Not enough?

313
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,480
I'll pass.

314
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,560
Now, because of you,

315
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,640
And went to the police station.

316
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,640
I shouldn't have helped you.

317
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,839
It's a big trouble.

318
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,240
You said I was trouble.

319
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,200
Did you forget that when you broke up,

320
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,440
Who drank with you?

321
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,240
Now, for the person you like,

322
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,440
You don't care about me.

323
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,599
You don't want me.

324
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,480
If a male sister is important to me,

325
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,520
You don't know

326
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,000
For her.

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
I can abandon anyone.

328
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,160
What's so great about her?

329
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,440
You like her so much.

330
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,480
In this environment,

331
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,800
You can still sleep.

332
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,200
Then what should we do?

333
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,440
What's the situation now?

334
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,600
What's the situation?

335
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,280
I already know.

336
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,480
You have no responsibility.

337
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,080
You can leave now.

338
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,000
You can go now.

339
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,840
So fast?

340
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,400
Stay here.

341
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,520
I don't want to...

342
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,560
Thank you.

343
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,480
sister

344
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,560
You can talk first.

345
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,600
I'm going back to the hotel.

346
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,720
Sister, I was wrong.

347
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,040
Let me ask you something.

348
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,760
What happened to that woman?

349
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,880
What about those people?

350
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,720
Hello, Aaron.

351
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,560
Something happened to me.

352
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,480
The plane will be late tonight.

353
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,680
Change it.

354
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,800
Come on.

355
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,160
Everyone, follow me.

356
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,560
The Three Pagodas of Chongsheng Temple are ahead.

357
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,560
It's said that couples are together in front of the tower.

358
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,320
To make a wish,

359
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,080
You will gain

360
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,840
A love that never changes.

361
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,880
Let's go together.

362
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,000
Looking for love.

363
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,400
Hurry up. Hurry. Go.

364
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,280
What's the rush? There's more time.

365
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,600
But we don't have time.

366
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,880
So yesterday, you were with

367
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,120
With Shen Qiansha.

368
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
I have no choice.

369
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,960
She said she didn't have a place to live.

370
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,160
Believe what she says.

371
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,800
Are you close to her?

372
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,480
How long have you known her?

373
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,160
Do you know her well?

374
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,080
What if she has any intention?

375
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,400
How to do it?

376
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,200
But I don't want to get into trouble

377
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,240
Came to you for help.

378
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,960
I want to solve it myself.

379
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,440
Alright.

380
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,360
Take care of it.

381
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,040
See, you've solved it.

382
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,800
What's going on?

383
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,520
Did you see that?

384
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,640
Did you solve it well?

385
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,800
To solve this problem.

386
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,040
And solve it for you.

387
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,080
If you can solve it,

388
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,080
Why do you need me?

389
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,680
I was wrong, sister.

390
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,720
Fortunately, I was caught today.

391
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,680
It's me.

392
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,560
If you get caught,

393
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,240
Will be the most important

394
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,160
A stain.

395
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,280
How are you going to work?

396
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,560
Are you giving up your dream?

397
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,200
Do not want to

398
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,360
Because this will ruin our future.

399
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,400
It's not worth it.

400
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,520
To succeed,

401
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,600
Forget it. Forget about it.

402
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,960
I swear, sister.

403
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,240
I will never...

404
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,680
Such a problem.

405
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Are you really

406
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,240
Are you really

407
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,560
You asked me to save some snacks.

408
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,640
Alright?

409
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,920
How old are you? Are you really...

410
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,760
We should seize the chance

411
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,960
This chance

412
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:47,720
Well

413
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,680
Work hard

414
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,840
Behave yourself.

415
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,880
Being an artist is about

416
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,080
Speak and act cautiously

417
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,160
Do you know

418
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,280
know

419
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,240
You really know?

420
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,840
Really

421
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,040
Alright then.

422
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm hungry. What should I eat?

423
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,600
Both

424
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
Okay, your room card.

425
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,800
Thank you

426
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,240
Sida

427
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,680
Go up first.

428
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,840
I have something to do.

429
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,920
I need to handle it.

430
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,520
Bye

431
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
Why are you here?

432
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,760
I guess you will be here.

433
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,200
Or to say,

434
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,000
I hope you will be here.

435
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,120
Give it back.

436
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,320
Is it possible that

437
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,840
For the last time.

438
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
If you want to say goodbye,

439
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,160
I hope this farewell

440
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,360
More sense of ceremony.

441
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,320
Ritualistic sense

442
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Just like this wishing tree.

443
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,000
People come here to make wishes.

444
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,200
Because of the sense of ceremony,

445
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,680
Including the courage to look forward to.

446
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,240
There is hope.

447
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,480
I've gone through

448
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,200
Blind for love.

449
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,840
But when I met you,

450
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,160
You'll still be impressed.

451
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,440
So I want to

452
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,680
Be brave again.

453
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
And I'm not willing to

454
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,320
This is the end.

455
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,280
Can we...

456
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,320
And leave all your concerns behind.

457
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,320
Get along with each other like lovers.

458
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,440
Before sunset,

459
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,600
After sunset,

460
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,280
Everything will be restored.

461
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,520
Let us take the memory

462
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,880
Can you stay here?

463
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
What are they doing?

464
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,080
They...

465
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,520
Waiting for the sunset.

466
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,360
Wait for the sunset here.

467
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,000
I can pray for a new day.

468
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,200
Really?

469
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,240
That's right.

470
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,760
I want to pray too.

471
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,080
You know what?

472
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,320
Sometimes,

473
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,480
You look like a child.

474
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,480
Where is it?

475
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,000
When you are unreasonable,

476
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,120
When you eat spicy hot pot and cry,

477
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,880
When you drink and act rashly,

478
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,200
Also

479
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,880
The way you pray now,

480
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,720
Are you sober now?

481
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,560
What about you?

482
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,560
Have you been drinking?

483
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,080
I drank two bottles just now.

484
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,440
I'm kidding.

485
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,440
In fact, many times in life,

486
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,840
As long as you have a sense of ceremony,

487
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Everything will become happy.

488
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,560
Just like now.

489
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,480
Before sunset,

490
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,000
We gave it a sense of ceremony.

491
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,560
It's like saying goodbye.

492
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,120
I'm not that sad.

493
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,960
The sun is going down.

494
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,640
I know.

495
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,720
Who is it?

496
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,960
How much do you drink?

497
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,480
You drank too much.

498
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,960
So I dared to come to you.

499
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,000
Actually, I hate myself too.

500
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,440
Why is it that every time you drink too much,

501
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
I came to look for you.

502
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,240
Actually, I hate myself too.

503
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,600
Every time I say I don't care,

504
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,440
And then came to you.

505
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,000
But I just want to...

506
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,000
I want to fight for it again.

507
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,920
Because you must be

508
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,160
You like me, right?

509
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,880
Which string is wrong?

510
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,400
You must

511
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,640
Give me a word.

512
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,720
Tell me.

513
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,800
Do you like me?

514
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,200
Say it.

515
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,360
We're adults, Zimmer.

516
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,400
Don't run away, okay?

517
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,000
You know I will be sad too.

518
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,320
Today,

519
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,920
I've already

520
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,320
Why are you here?

521
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,680
What else do you want me to do?

522
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,320
Just admit that you like me.

523
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,680
Is it that hard?

524
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,600
Just one sentence.

525
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,200
Say it.

526
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,760
Say it.

527
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,240
Do you like me?

528
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,280
That's right.

529
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,760
I really like you.

530
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,680
I really like you.

531
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,920
But I can't let go of the past.

532
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
I've been telling myself

533
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,440
To restrain myself.

534
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,000
But I can't

535
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,120
I'm really hard to control.

536
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,120
I'm attracted to you, you know?

537
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,680
Understood

538
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,920
We are the kind of people

539
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,600
Who is too restrained.

540
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,160
And restrained his emotions.

541
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
So I always miss it.

542
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,160
But I don't want to miss it with you.

543
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,920
I don't want to

544
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,520
We become strangers.

545
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,880
How about we

546
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,520
Let's start over.

547
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,400
all right?

548
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,320
Let's go back to the beginning.

549
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,720
We start as friends.

550
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,320
It's so bright.

551
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,560
Hello, Room Service.

552
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,040
I didn't order a room service.

553
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,800
Was ordered by a gentleman.

554
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,320
He said you were drunk last night.

555
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,120
Let's send some

556
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,560
Congee and hangover tea.

557
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:21,760
Correct!

558
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,480
And this card.

559
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,800
He asked us to give it to you.

560
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,080
friend

561
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,320
See you in Shanghai.

562
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,199
Yes, I just got on the plane.

563
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:48,960
Hello, Madam.

564
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:49,920
Would you like something to drink?

565
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,600
What drink?

566
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,199
We have prepared

567
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,960
Oolong tea, green tea.

568
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,719
I'm in the water now. Thank you.

569
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,480
On the plane back to Shanghai.

570
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,720
good

571
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,080
Let's talk about it when we meet.

572
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
I'm telling you,

573
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,160
A boy.

574
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,360
Seems to be Japanese.

575
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,960
Is quite handsome.

576
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,240
If you're a few years younger,

577
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,200
It should be a debut.

578
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,440
To make money by signing him?

579
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,840
Thank you. You're welcome.

580
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,600
Okay, I got it.

581
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm waiting for someone's text. Hello.

582
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,320
Your water. Thank you.

583
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,600
The plane is about to take off.

584
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,560
Please turn off your phone.

585
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,920
Okay, thank you.

586
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,120
Okay, I'm done talking to you.

587
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,480
I need to send a message.

588
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,760
I'm turning off my phone. Bye.

589
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,640
Sorry

590
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,840
It's all right.

591
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,880
You're Chinese?

592
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,400
That's right.

593
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:43,800
Sorry

594
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,920
I'll give you a dress.

595
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,680
It's okay.

596
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
I have a change.

597
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,800
Give me a glass of red wine.

598
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,400
Hello, sir.

599
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,120
Clean it up for you.

600
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,920
It's okay. Thank you.

601
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,360
Here is some paper.

602
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,200
You all right? Are you wet?

603
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,800
It's okay.

604
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,680
Give it to me. Thank you.

605
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,440
I need more.

606
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,160
You can call me anytime.

607
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,080
Thank you. It's okay.

608
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,880
Give me the tissues.

609
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,200
Thank you.

610
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,840
I thought you were Japanese.

611
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,360
I was just giving

612
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,720
A call from a client in Japan.

613
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,520
good

614
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,480
Thank you for coming today.

615
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,280
Come on.

616
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,040
Let me introduce her to you.

617
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,480
This is Rui Qi Group's

618
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,680
Shareholder and CEO

619
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,080
Mr. Zhao Yusheng.

620
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,240
This is our company.

621
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,120
The current manager, Tong Tong.

622
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,840
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

623
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,480
This is

624
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,240
Dugu is like a man.

625
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,560
We know each other.

626
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

627
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,280
You invited Mr. Zhao here today?

628
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,080
To talk about

629
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,280
We are Yuxing Entertainment.

630
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,200
To cooperate with Rui Qi Group.

631
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,960
I really hope that

632
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,120
Who can be the chairman

633
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,160
Spokesman

634
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,760
To cooperate with such a big group,

635
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,360
It's our pleasure.

636
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah, what about Song Zihao?

637
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,960
Is now in the entertainment circle.

638
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,880
Is the most famous.

639
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,800
And the most exposed artist

640
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,160
His image is very

641
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,400
What about Song Zihao?

642
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,800
Our group has always had

643
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,880
Pay attention to and understand

644
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,360
But today,

645
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,320
To your company.

646
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,240
The other artist is more interested.

647
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,120
Si Da is the artist you brought.

648
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,760
Yes

649
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,840
I've heard his songs.

650
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,720
And affectionate.

651
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,040
And sincere.

652
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,360
I heard that

653
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,800
And became a model.

654
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,960
Participated in the wing fashion show.

655
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,240
I think

656
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,840
This experience is quite special.

657
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,880
To me?

658
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,000
The future of Star.

659
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,320
Can become

660
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,800
The all-round development of the artist.

661
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,960
I really like him.

662
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,800
and

663
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,800
With a good manager like you,

664
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,160
Thank you, President Zhao.

665
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,920
So you're

666
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,440
Mr. Zhao of Ruiqi Group.

667
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,320
I've been thinking about

668
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,120
Thank you in person.

669
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,360
Thank you for helping Star.

670
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,560
To give him a chance.

671
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,400
Don't be so courteous.

672
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,480
I really admire Star.

673
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,360
And admire you.

674
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,960
And I think

675
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,400
We are fated to be together.

676
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
We will definitely meet again.

677
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,000
Definitely.

678
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,560
I have to go up first.

679
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,960
I won't escort you out.

680
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,600
good

681
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,640
I'll treat you to dinner.

682
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
Okay, thank you.

683
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,000
no wonder

684
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,960
Sida was rejected.

685
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,400
And a new album.

686
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,480
You're relying on the ability of a man

687
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,480
That's amazing.

688
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Previously, with the wing fashion,

689
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,880
And successfully sent Star

690
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,960
To the runway.

691
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,720
How long has it been?

692
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,480
And you're on it.

693
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,840
Zhao Yucheng of Rui Qi

694
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,240
If you're a male sister,

695
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,600
I really admire you.

696
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,440
You're very clever.

697
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,680
Go on.

698
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,520
It's a pity that

699
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,560
You took advantage of me.

700
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,680
And throw it away.

701
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,080
You and Zhao Yusheng

702
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,160
They're flirting with each other.

703
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,800
Does he still not know?

704
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,400
Last time,

705
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,840
It's not enough to hit you.

706
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm upset today.

707
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:07,800
I

708
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,840
I haven't done anything yet.

709
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,400
Why did you fall down?

710
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,040
You want to win the throne?

711
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,400
President Ji.

712
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,800
Central Asia Film Festival is about to open.

713
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,280
The new sponsorship project will be launched soon.

714
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,400
Our wing fashion

715
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,240
For three consecutive years.

716
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,600
The largest sponsor of Huanya.

717
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,440
Are we going to

718
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,240
The bidding sponsor.

719
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,120
Of course

720
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,040
Central Asia International Film Festival

721
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,320
Is very important to us.

722
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,320
Has high commercial value.

723
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,720
If we let the film celebrities

724
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,600
Put on our wing fashion.

725
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,040
On the red carpet.

726
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,400
It will definitely improve.

727
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:51,920
We Wing Fashion

728
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,640
International influence

729
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,600
And popularity.

730
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,840
The effect is no less than

731
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,040
The star's hard extension.

732
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,480
therefore

733
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,320
The sponsorship fee

734
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,800
It's absolutely worth it.

735
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,360
Sorry, Mr. Ji.

736
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,480
There's something on the way, Director Hu.

737
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,200
It was delayed.

738
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,280
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

739
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,960
it doesn't matter

740
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,120
This shop has a good environment.

741
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,080
I like it so much

742
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,000
Wait here.

743
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,160
Is also a kind of enjoyment.

744
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,080
sit

745
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,320
Take a look at your plan.

746
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,440
good

747
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,920
Do you have any concerns?

748
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,480
If it's because

749
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,520
With the money,

750
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
If our company

751
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,640
Or a film festival?

752
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,920
The biggest sponsor.

753
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,280
We are willing to add

754
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,680
Five percent of the sponsorship fee.

755
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,200
President Ji.

756
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,960
this

757
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,240
It's not about the money.

758
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,200
We received

759
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,360
A lot of planning cases.

760
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,080
To make some improvements.

761
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,280
I will study it carefully.

762
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,680
The plan of Wing Fashion.

763
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,600
Let the team do an evaluation.

764
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,520
then

765
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,040
I'll contact you later.

766
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,200
I know you are always cautious.

767
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,720
You have your own principles.

768
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,080
that

769
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,520
I'll be waiting for your good news.

770
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,160
If a man

771
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,920
Mr. Zhao.

772
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,040
Why are you still here?

773
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,400
I want to wait for you to get off work.

774
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,160
I'll treat you a meal.

775
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,200
Let's eat.

776
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,360
Because today,

777
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,600
The company is very busy.

778
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,400
So I'm very tired.

779
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,920
I want to go back and rest.

780
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,800
Next time.

781
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,080
I was thinking

782
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,720
During the meal,

783
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,360
To talk to you.

784
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,240
About the spokesman.

785
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
Spokesman

786
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,280
That's great.

787
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,520
Where to eat?

788
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,160
You said you were tired.

789
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,400
Talking about work,

790
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,720
I'll be fine.

791
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,960
What are you eating?

792
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,680
Mr. Zhao.

793
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,120
You are a big group.

794
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,600
There's no need to use celebrity endorsements.

795
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,240
To raise your popularity.

796
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,720
So the celebrity of the endorser

797
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,760
Is not important.

798
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,160
What matters is that

799
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,400
Is this spokesman

800
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,520
Is consistent with your brand image.

801
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,920
We're Sida.

802
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,280
Although he's a newbie,

803
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,720
But he's in a relationship with a man.

804
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,840
We've only met for the third time.

805
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
We just started to build

806
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,360
Working relationship

807
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,280
therefore

808
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,160
I don't want you to worry too much.

809
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,080
Actually, sometimes,

810
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,760
Work is the same as love.

811
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,080
You need to take it easy, right?

812
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,520
Sorry

813
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,440
I was too anxious.

814
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,240
it doesn't matter
