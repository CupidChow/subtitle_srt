1
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,200
If I don't have feelings for Dugu Ruonan,

2
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,400
I won't like her.

3
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,080
You know, liking someone

4
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,480
is like

5
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,800
having allergies,

6
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,200
You can't hide it.

7
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,880
You care about her,

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,400
care about her, be nervous about her,

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,480
Be soft on her,

10
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,240
Ji Mo Think about it carefully,

11
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,880
You really don't have feelings for her?

12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,240
Those snobs,

13
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,640
when you're popular,

14
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,000
Count them back one by one.

15
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,920
Sis,

16
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
forget it. You're tired too.

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,760
Why don't you go home and rest first.

18
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,040
I'm going home. Where are you going?

19
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,600
You can't go back to the hotel.

20
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,800
If you are recognized,

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
there will be paparazzi.

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,160
Right,

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,400
I don't know where to go.

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,680
Just stay at my house.

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
Let me see where Chen Fei'er is.

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,640
I can go find her.

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,960
Okay,

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,480
Hello? Are you home?

29
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,640
How are you doing

30
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,520
in the hospital?

31
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,600
Are you all right?

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,840
Is there anything else wrong?

33
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,960
I'm fine. Don't be nervous.

34
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,120
Didn't I tell you

35
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,040
on the phone,

36
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,360
I feel much better now.

37
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,320
Why did you come all the way here?

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,200
I heard from Xiaoxiao,

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,120
you're allergic because of Ji Mo.

40
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,240
He put you in the hospital?

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,240
I told him to leave first.

42
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,520
I'm leaving.

43
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,040
Why don't you let him stay with you?

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,560
What's the use of keeping someone

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,320
but not keeping my heart?

46
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,200
Silly girl.

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,840
Find a way to keep him first.

48
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,600
Then win your heart.

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,640
Take him down first.

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,080
Who am I?

51
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Chen Fei'er,

52
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,680
I did it for a man

53
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,320
who doesn't like me at all.

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,600
I'm going to

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,160
grovel to him.

56
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,360
It's boring.

57
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,640
So I decided to give up.

58
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,800
I gave up.

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Didn't you say

60
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,120
you liked him a few days ago?

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,000
But the person he likes is you.

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,480
It's impossible.

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,839
I knew it a long time ago.

64
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
The way

65
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,160
he looks at you is different.

66
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,720
Trust my judgment on men,

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,480
that's right,

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,480
Don't be ridiculous.

69
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,880
It's impossible for me to be with him.

70
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,080
Why?

71
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,640
Because of me? Yes.

72
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,200
It's impossible for me to like

73
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
the man my bestie once liked,

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,080
Dugu Ruonan,

75
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,520
what time is it now,

76
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
Can you not be

77
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,040
so old-fashioned? Don't be so old-fashioned.

78
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,720
I like him. That's my business.

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,040
What does it have to do with you?

80
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,720
Besides,

81
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm not in a relationship with him.

82
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,600
You're not

83
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,640
a third party involved,

84
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,520
Just a man.

85
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,760
Is it comparable to

86
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,800
our best friend's relationship

87
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,960
for so many years?

88
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,640
Am I right?

89
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,280
Don't hang in there.

90
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,240
I can tell you're upset.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,280
I … I do. Yes, I do feel

92
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,840
bad.

93
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,400
But losing to you

94
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,440
will make me feel

95
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,760
a little less sad,

96
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,840
If it were someone else,

97
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,040
I wouldn't be convinced.

98
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,840
Let me tell you,

99
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,720
in my heart,

100
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,200
you're not the only one who cares about me,

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,440
Besides me,

102
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,960
what about the best woman in the world?

103
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,480
You and Ji Mo?

104
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,080
Actually, they are quite suitable for each other.

105
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,640
Two happy enemies.

106
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,720
Since I abdicated,

107
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,400
you have to make up for it successfully.

108
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,840
If Ji Mo dares to bully you,

109
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
you must tell me,

110
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,880
As it happens, I'll avenge my old

111
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,000
and new enmity together.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,200
Miss,

113
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
mind your own business.

114
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,160
Take good care of yourself.

115
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
Don't make random matches for me.

116
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,720
I really have

117
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,200
a lot of things to do recently.

118
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,360
Sida still has a lot of things

119
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,320
to deal with,

120
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,240
I didn't even dream about it.

121
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,480
Some or not,

122
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,600
You're right.

123
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,960
Work matters.

124
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,400
I really think,

125
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,480
Ji Mo is a really

126
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,440
good man.

127
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,800
Hold on to it.

128
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,400
Again

129
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,480
Think about it.

130
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,040
Think about it.

131
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,120
Sis,

132
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,560
How are you? Are you okay?

133
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,400
It's okay.

134
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,920
I chatted with her for a while.

135
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,680
I came out after seeing her sleeping.

136
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,040
Let's go.

137
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,040
Where are you going?

138
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,960
You're so busy with Chen Fei'er

139
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,480
that you forget your business.

140
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,200
Welcome.

141
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,320
Welcome home.

142
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Why did you change your attitude again?

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,400
Don't smile like that. It's scary.

144
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
What are you talking about?

145
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,520
I just want to

146
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
express my feelings for you

147
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,280
as a roommate

148
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,480
before you move out,

149
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,200
I have no feelings for you.

150
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,680
A sloppy,

151
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,880
overbearing and snobbish woman like you,

152
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,640
How could I have feelings for you?

153
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,240
And I can't move out.

154
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,160
It's okay. I want something from you.

155
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,880
I can bear it.

156
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,800
Why are you here?

157
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Hello,

158
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,600
Sida has been under a lot of pressure lately,

159
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
I want to enlighten him more.

160
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,640
After all, I'm a senior.

161
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,360
So I decided,

162
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,840
until the problem is solved,

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,120
He lives with us.

164
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,080
He wants to live here.

165
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,320
There are only two rooms.

166
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,240
Where does he sleep?

167
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,320
I'll sleep

168
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,000
with you. You've both slept together.

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,440
Once born and twice cooked.

170
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Let's take a step back.

171
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,000
You don't have to move out.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,280
How about letting him move in?

173
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,280
Dugu Ruonan,

174
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,120
are you mistaken?

175
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,000
For the sake of your

176
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,280
homelessness,

177
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,560
That's why I asked you to move in.

178
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,280
It's fine now.

179
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,840
I led the wolf into the house.

180
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
You occupied the nest of magpies,

181
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,320
without even saying a word.

182
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,040
So I brought him in.

183
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,960
Do you think this is a dormitory?

184
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,400
Sis, why don't I go home first?

185
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,480
Don't interrupt when adults are talking.

186
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,080
No.

187
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,960
What if it's dangerous?

188
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,960
Mr. Ji,

189
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,039
I'm really pitiful today.

190
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,480
Being bullied everywhere, I … I'm so

191
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,480
tired.

192
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,880
I'm begging you. Please, brother.

193
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,320
I'm begging you.

194
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,159
Please,

195
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,960
look at him,

196
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,799
With such a young child,

197
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,880
where can he go?

198
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,840
It's dangerous.

199
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,320
Please, brother! Please!

200
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,720
Please, brother,

201
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,120
it's okay to live here,

202
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,560
But sleep on the sofa.

203
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,120
What's wrong with me today?

204
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,960
I can't believe she's acting.

205
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,600
You care about her.

206
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,520
Nervous

207
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,880
and soft-hearted towards her,

208
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,560
No way.

209
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,320
I have to move out today.

210
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,240
It's useless for you to cry.

211
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,200
I won't be soft-hearted if it doesn't work.

212
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,240
That's good.

213
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
He sleeps in my room,

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,720
Sis,

215
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,280
It's not good. I'll sleep with you.

216
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Who's sleeping with you?

217
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,320
What are you thinking?

218
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,880
Can you sleep in my room

219
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,520
and I sleep on the sofa?

220
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,760
You sleep on the sofa

221
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,200
alone. Forget it.

222
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,000
Sleep with me.

223
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,640
Mr. Ji, Mr. Ji is so nice.

224
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,600
Mr. Ji,

225
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
thank you, Mr. Ji.

226
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,680
You're so nice.

227
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,080
-Thank you. -That's great.

228
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,240
So fierce.

229
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
Forget it. Never mind.

230
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,480
Success

231
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,360
We did it.

232
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,680
Brother,

233
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,040
Are you going to the toilet?

234
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,880
Brother,

235
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,320
the toilet is over there.

236
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,040
Brother,

237
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,120
Are you sleepwalking?

238
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,520
Dugu Ruonan,

239
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,440
sleepwalkers are like this.

240
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,560
Brother,

241
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,280
this is Ruonan's room,

242
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,560
Our room is over there.

243
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,640
I like Dugu Ruonan,

244
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,720
why do you

245
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,840
like Ruonan?

246
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
It's not impossible.

247
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,120
I don't like Dugu Ruonan.

248
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,640
That's right,

249
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,920
Do I like her or not?

250
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,280
It doesn't matter anymore.

251
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,240
Let's go back to sleep.

252
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,280
Thank you.

253
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,240
For what?

254
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
Thank you for accepting Sida.

255
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,640
I know what to do,

256
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,200
It might cause you trouble.

257
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,760
But he still had the cheek

258
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
to bring him here.

259
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,760
Because for me,

260
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,160
this is the safest place.

261
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,160
How are you going

262
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,040
to solve Sida's problem?

263
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,480
On the contrary, it was this incident

264
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,640
that made me realize,

265
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,640
The most important thing to do right now,

266
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,160
is not to knock anyone down,

267
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,200
It's about strengthening yourself.

268
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,840
I'm relieved

269
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
that you're so aggressive.

270
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,000
When you think about it,

271
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,160
actually,

272
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,120
You've helped me a lot,

273
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,640
you,

274
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,200
Although it seems unreliable,

275
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,440
it's actually quite reliable.

276
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,120
Sis,

277
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,280
I've changed it.

278
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,120
Sida, let's go.

279
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,320
Sis,

280
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,720
Where are we going today?

281
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,120
Do you want to see a reporter?

282
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,640
Back to the company,

283
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,760
I'm going to hire some teachers for you

284
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,160
to give you some professional training.

285
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,000
Like singing, dancing,

286
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,520
saying lines or something,

287
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,080
About the fight,

288
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,640
Sida?

289
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,760
I know you're upset.

290
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,880
I also thought that

291
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,520
I could just post the recording online,

292
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,480
But to do so,

293
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,680
it's just a short-lived act,

294
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,840
You're an artist

295
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,920
trained by the company now.

296
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,360
If the company

297
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,280
wants to suppress you,

298
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,800
It won't do you any good.

299
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,200
Man,

300
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,680
you have to succeed.

301
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
You have to learn to be patient.

302
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,840
We have to face the reality,

303
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,040
because we are not strong enough.

304
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,760
Instead of wasting your energy

305
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,440
dealing with your opponent.

306
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,080
It's better

307
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,360
to make yourself better.

308
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,520
Remember,

309
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,560
man's greatest rival.

310
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,760
Always yourself.

311
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,880
Not someone else.

312
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,400
Sis,

313
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,640
Actually, I don't care

314
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,200
if I'm wronged, do I?

315
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,320
I'm just afraid that

316
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,040
I might get you into trouble.

317
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,880
I'm afraid you've been wronged.

318
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,760
You've done too much for me.

319
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,000
You hired a teacher and got demoted.

320
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah,

321
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,880
I'm a great kid,

322
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,360
Remember,

323
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,280
I'm not the kind of person

324
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,560
who gives for nothing.

325
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,160
When you become popular in the future,

326
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,880
make a lot of money for me,

327
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
And let me be

328
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,080
my managing director again.

329
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,160
I will try my best.

330
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
How about I do it myself?

331
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,320
Don't move.

332
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,960
It hurts.

333
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,800
As long as it hurts.

334
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,240
Are you stupid?

335
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,200
Scratching your car and pushing you?

336
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,120
You didn't even fight back.

337
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,480
How can I fight back?

338
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,640
If I fight back,

339
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,400
the other party will definitely add fuel to it,

340
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,680
He said Sida's agent hit someone,

341
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,599
how can he do that?

342
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:13,920
Sis,

343
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,079
Sis, are you okay?

344
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,800
Why did you ask him to come to me?

345
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,319
If you let him laugh at me, I … Are you still a

346
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,200
man?

347
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,599
You're not responsible at all.

348
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,960
You didn't say anything when you saw her being bullied.

349
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,359
No,

350
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,920
A woman was beaten for you.

351
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,120
Don't you feel embarrassed?

352
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,360
Don't blame him.

353
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,800
I told him to stay out of it.

354
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,440
Also,

355
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,120
when will it be your turn

356
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,320
to teach my artistes a lesson.

357
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,560
Okay,

358
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,200
It's not his fault,

359
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,640
it's my fault,

360
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
It's my fault to meddle.

361
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,680
Don't take his words to heart.

362
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
Ignore him. I'm fine.

363
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,480
It hurts, right? It doesn't hurt.

364
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,520
It's just a small injury.

365
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,840
It'll be fine tomorrow.

366
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,520
Brother,

367
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
Am I useless?

368
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,560
When that senior

369
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,240
pushed Ruonan,

370
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,400
I wanted to stop him.

371
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,440
But he's a senior member of the company.

372
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,600
I'm afraid I'll offend him.

373
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,080
He'll get back at us in the future.

374
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,960
I blame myself. I regret it.

375
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,120
I regret why I was

376
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,080
so cowardly back then,

377
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,800
You're right.

378
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,040
I'm not a man.

379
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,560
You can't even protect

380
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,640
the woman you like.

381
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,760
Sida?

382
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,920
Women need

383
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,120
men to protect them.

384
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,560
Just because she doesn't cry pain

385
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,280
doesn't mean she doesn't.

386
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,960
If you don't help her

387
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
relieve the pain in time,

388
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,840
It will cause secondary damage to her.

389
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,360
Don't wait until one day,

390
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,320
she leaves you.

391
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,000
If you regret it again.

392
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,680
I know what to do.

393
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,080
What are you going to do?

394
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,960
I have to face it alone.

395
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,440
You're right.

396
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,080
I'm a man.

397
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,040
You shouldn't just hide behind women.

398
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,600
There are many ways to solve the problem,

399
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,960
so we should treat it rationally.

400
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't be impulsive.

401
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,000
Do you hear me?

402
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Don't worry, brother.

403
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,120
I won't cause Ruonan

404
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,960
any more trouble.

405
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,280
Why did he get up so early?

406
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,000
Although yesterday,

407
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,080
you were rude to me,

408
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,480
But considering that

409
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,520
you care about me and do what's best for me,

410
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,440
Then I forgive you.

411
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,480
From now on,

412
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,800
just don't cause me any trouble.

413
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,560
Brother and sister,

414
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,960
I've prepared breakfast for you.

415
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,040
Thank you. You're so sensible.

416
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,520
Aren't you going to eat?

417
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,560
I'll take a walk downstairs later.

418
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,600
I'll be back in a minute. It's good

419
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,200
that this happens,

420
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm going to relax.

421
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,600
Adjust your mood,

422
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,480
but if you put on your mask,

423
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,800
In times of emergency,

424
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,920
don't be recognized by others.

425
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,600
Take good care of yourself.

426
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,360
I've caused you

427
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,680
a lot of trouble recently.

428
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,480
I'm sorry.

429
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,960
Why did you say that again?

430
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,040
This is my job.

431
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,840
It's what I should do.

432
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,080
There's nothing to be sorry about.

433
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,040
Come back early.

434
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,120
Yes.

435
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,440
Why don't you eat?

436
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,360
Sida's expression is wrong.

437
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,880
He's been covering it up.

438
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,120
Suppress your emotions,

439
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
you'll be sad

440
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,480
if something like this happens.

441
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,600
Just relax.

442
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,360
Don't think too much.

443
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,400
I'm still worried.

444
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,360
I'll go check it out.

445
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,480
You eat first.

446
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,840
No problem.

447
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,400
Sida?

448
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,200
Brother,

449
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,880
Where are you going?

450
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,720
Let me walk around.

451
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,040
Don't lie, kid.

452
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,080
Brother, I'm in a mess right now.

453
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,520
Leave me

454
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,440
alone.

455
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,120
I just hope,

456
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,000
before you do anything,

457
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,840
You have to think about it carefully.

458
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,920
Don't do things you regret

459
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,720
on impulse.

460
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,480
Don't worry, brother.

461
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,760
I know what to do.

462
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,360
Also,

463
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,640
yesterday was just

464
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,480
a bit heavy-tongued,

465
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,880
It's too much to say.

466
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,320
If you're impatient,

467
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,760
I don't mean to dislike you.

468
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,080
I don't mean to dislike you.

469
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,120
I just hope,

470
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,800
when something like this

471
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,720
happens to you in the future,

472
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,600
I'll do better.

473
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,200
Don't let it happen again.

474
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,320
It won't happen again.

475
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,000
I promise you,

476
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,160
it won't happen again

477
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,080
in the future.

478
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm going for a walk.

479
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,920
This kid is really worrying.

480
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,640
I hope he can recover.

481
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:25,960
I'm here.

482
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,880
Who is it?

483
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:37,840
What do you

484
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,840
want to do?

485
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,040
What do you want?

486
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,640
I'm telling you,

487
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,760
you're trespassing.

488
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,760
I can call the police.

489
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,480
What do you want me to do?

490
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,040
So that you can spare Ruonan and me.

491
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,480
So you're here to make peace.

492
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,040
What's wrong? Are you scared now?

493
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm here to admit my mistake.

494
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,640
I'm sorry.

495
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,280
I shouldn't have done it last time.

496
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,720
Pretending,

497
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,040
Sure,

498
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,880
If you kneel down,

499
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,920
I'll forgive you.

500
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,640
You really knelt down.

501
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,120
I'm telling you,

502
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,080
don't do this to me.

503
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,240
If a man has gold under his knee,

504
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,680
get up if he's a man.

505
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
I was wrong, brother.

506
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,200
Get up! Zihao,

507
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,760
get up!

508
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,120
If you don't kneel enough,

509
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,760
I'll kowtow to you,

510
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,200
Please forgive me.

511
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,120
Please forgive me.

512
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,960
I was really wrong.

513
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,440
Zihao, please come forward to clarify,

514
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,960
and forgive Ruonan and me.

515
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,360
Dugu Ruonan, you're really capable

516
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Si Da, listen to me,

517
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,640
She's brainwashing you now.

518
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,120
I told you to be obedient to her,

519
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,120
but after a few years,

520
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,520
When you have your own ideas,

521
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,320
and you don't want to be exploited

522
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,000
by her anymore,

523
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,480
She'll kick you away.

524
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,120
Then she'll find someone else

525
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,320
to replace you.

526
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,520
Just like now. No.

527
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,880
No, it's not like that.

528
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,960
I asked for it myself.

529
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,200
Ruonan didn't ask me to come.

530
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Please forgive us.

531
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,640
I just need to clarify anything.

532
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,720
Okay,

533
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,680
I can clarify it.

534
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,520
Get up first, okay?

535
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,240
Come on, get up.

536
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,840
Really?

537
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,120
I can go.

538
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,160
Are you really willing to clarify?

539
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,800
Sida,

540
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,920
I'm not here for you.

541
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,400
I can clarify it for you.

542
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,800
But it's impossible for Dugu Ruonan.

543
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,320
I will never forgive her.

544
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,280
Why?

545
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,000
She's no longer your agent.

546
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,880
It has nothing to do with you.

547
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,360
Why are you still pestering her?

548
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
What can I do

549
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,680
to make you forgive Ruonan,

550
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,640
What do you want me to do?

551
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,680
Tell me.

552
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,480
Tell me,

553
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,080
what do you want me to do?

554
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,160
You're right.

555
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,800
I have nothing

556
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,680
to do with her anymore.

557
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,200
Why should I give her a hard time?

558
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,920
Does that mean as long as

559
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,120
I don't target Dugu Ruonan anymore,

560
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,800
You can do whatever I ask you to do.

561
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,400
Yes.

562
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,040
Okay,

563
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,920
You said it.

564
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,520
Kid,

565
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
why are you the only one at home?

566
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,080
Where's Sida?

567
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,160
I was just about to ask you.

568
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,920
Isn't he with you?

569
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,960
He couldn't find anyone,

570
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,360
and he didn't answer the phone. What's wrong?

571
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,640
In the morning, I felt like,

572
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,440
he's not looking right,

573
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,760
He even specifically told him

574
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,960
if anything bad would happen to him?

575
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,080
Calm down.

576
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,040
Let's analyze it calmly,

577
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,520
Sit down

578
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,160
Sida must have subconsciously

579
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,320
thought it was him.

580
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,680
That caused you to be besieged by fans.

581
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,960
So he must have been

582
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,280
looking for a solution.

583
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,520
I can't solve it.

584
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,920
How to deal with that kid?

585
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,960
Or to put it another way,

586
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,640
among the people he comes into contact with,

587
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,320
No one can

588
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,320
help him solve the problem.

589
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,520
Song Zihao,

590
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,160
Zihao is very hostile

591
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,200
to Sida.

592
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,000
If he goes to see him,

593
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,440
he'll die.

594
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,000
The priority now

595
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,200
is to find Sida.

596
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
I remember now.

597
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,560
I was secretly

598
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,240
on Sida's phone,

599
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
Have you installed

600
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,520
positioning software? Are you a pervert?

601
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,840
It's a top priority.

602
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
What are you doing

603
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,800
in the night club?

604
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,000
Each of you, make a toast to my junior brother.

605
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,720
You must

606
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,800
make my junior brother drink well today.

607
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,960
Sure. Handsome guy,

608
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,040
come on. I don't drink.

609
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,280
I don't drink.

610
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,440
Have a drink. Have a drink.

611
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,400
I won't drink it.

612
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,720
Brother, I don't drink.

613
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,480
Sida?

614
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,200
You don't have to

615
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,400
drink it. From today on,

616
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,720
It has nothing to do with you.

617
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,840
Let's go.

618
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,760
Handsome guy, you're a good drinker.

619
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,880
You're amazing.

620
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,080
Don't pretend to be reserved

621
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,040
just now. Yes. Drink more.

622
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,800
Drink a little more and keep drinking

623
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,440
Okay,

624
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,400
Handsome, let's have a drink together.

625
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,880
Let's drink together.

626
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,400
You're a good drinker.

627
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,560
Zihao,

628
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,040
I've finished four drinks.

629
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,840
That's a lot.

630
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,000
That's too much.

631
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,240
After drinking this pot of wine,

632
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,120
I'll clarify it to the reporters tomorrow.

633
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,360
For Dugu Ruonan,

634
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,520
are you worth it?

635
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,000
After I finish this wine,

636
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,280
don't forget what you promised me.

637
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:46,520
Drink it.

638
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,480
This is your choice.

639
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,120
Don't blame me,

640
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,160
handsome boy. I can't do this.

641
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,840
Get up, handsome boy.

642
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,760
Come on.

643
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,160
Up ahead.

644
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,120
Sida?

645
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,400
Sida?

646
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,640
Sida

647
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,560
He was drunk a lot.

648
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,760
What do you think? Pale face,

649
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,760
hypothermia,

650
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,160
It could be alcohol poisoning.

651
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,600
Send him to the hospital.

652
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,560
Come on,

653
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,640
be careful. Be careful,

654
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,440
okay? Let's go.

655
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,560
Luckily, you came in time.

656
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,800
If you were a little late,

657
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,360
The patient's life will be in danger.

658
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,960
Now that the patient's signs are stable,

659
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,080
just take a break.

660
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,120
If anything happens,

661
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,960
you can call me anytime.

662
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,080
Okay. Thank you, nurse.

663
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,240
Are you okay?

664
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,000
It's okay.

665
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,960
I just heard what the nurse said,

666
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,040
I think it's scary.

667
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,920
If you hadn't found out that

668
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
he was poisoned by alcohol,

669
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,040
He might be dead.

670
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,560
Don't worry. He's fine now.

671
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,320
Stay with me all day.

672
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,200
You're tired too.

673
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,160
Go back and rest.

674
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,320
I can stay with him.

675
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,680
I'll stay with you for a while.

676
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,680
Multiple people,

677
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,320
multiple partners.

678
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,640
Thank you.

679
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,560
Why is he

680
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,160
so silly?

681
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,800
Hello, boss. What is it?

682
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Dugu Ruonan, what are you doing?

683
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,760
What do you mean?

684
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,880
Look at what Sida has done.

685
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,240
How do you discipline

686
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,040
your own artistes.

687
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,800
Read it online.

688
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,400
It's already on the hot searches.

689
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,160
I'm calling to tell you,

690
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
this kind of misdeeds

691
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,560
won't be taken by the artist company.

692
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,680
Hello.

693
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,880
Brother,

694
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,200
Brother,

695
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,800
You're awake.

696
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,760
Why am I in the hospital?

697
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,880
You were drunk yesterday,

698
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,720
and Ruonan and I

699
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,480
sent you here.

700
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,000
What happened yesterday?

701
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,800
Yesterday,

702
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,560
no need to ask.

703
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,880
What he did yesterday

704
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,840
has been on the hot searches.

705
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,040
Sister.

706
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,640
No,

707
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,880
that's not true, sister.

708
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,640
What did you do yesterday?

709
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,720
Why are you

710
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
with Song Zihao.

711
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,160
I want to solve this problem.

712
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,120
So I went to him.

713
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,400
He asked me to drink the wine,

714
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,320
so I could clarify it.

715
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,040
He said he would clarify it to the media.

716
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,640
I didn't expect you

717
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,480
to believe Song Zihao's words,

718
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,640
What is he capable of?

719
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,680
To manipulate the media.

720
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,360
What should we do, sister?

721
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,440
How many times have I told you?

722
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,960
Don't be impulsive.

723
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,640
Don't get emotional.

724
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,200
Learn to be patient.

725
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,080
What is it?

726
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,360
You have to be the first to tell me.

727
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,600
But now you're hiding it from me.

728
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,760
Go find Song Zihao.

729
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,120
Now that you're in such a big trouble,

730
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,480
how can I help you deal with it?

731
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,200
He wants to protect you too.

732
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,120
He won't cause me any trouble.

733
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,160
It's good enough.

734
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,680
I'm also responsible for this.

735
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,400
I could have stopped Sida.

736
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Blame me if you want to blame me.

737
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,200
Can blaming you

738
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,400
solve the problem now?

739
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,160
What's the use of worrying?

740
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,160
If something goes wrong,

741
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,280
you have to find a solution.

742
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,080
All right, stop arguing about this.

743
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,000
It's my own responsibility.

744
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,120
I'll do things by myself and be responsible by myself.

745
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,360
I quit the entertainment industry.

746
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,800
Sida?

747
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,040
You can't leave the hospital now.

748
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,080
Stop right there!

749
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,400
You quit the entertainment industry

750
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,000
so easily.

751
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,520
Do you think it's that easy?

752
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,880
What about the sufferings you've suffered?

753
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,320
Have you forgotten your dream of being an actress?

754
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,560
Forget it.

755
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
It doesn't matter anyway.

756
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,600
It doesn't matter.

757
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Then what's important?

758
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,920
It doesn't matter if you say it's not important.

759
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,680
I'm your agent.

760
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,280
You respected me for quitting

761
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,320
without telling me,

762
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,680
Recite the artist's rule.

763
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,160
I don't need any rules anymore.

764
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,600
I don't need an agent.

765
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,920
Too tired in the entertainment industry?

766
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
I don't want to stay any longer.

767
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,520
After he calms down,

768
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,680
I'll talk to him.

769
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,680
No need to talk.

770
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,240
I don't need an artist

771
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,120
who gives up so easily.

772
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,800
Look, that's Sida

773
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,720
who was on the hot searches before, right?

774
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,600
You know him too?

775
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,560
Do you want another identity?

776
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,880
What identity?

777
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,960
My artist.

778
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,400
You have to believe in yourself.

779
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,200
Even if you don't believe in yourself,

780
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,680
you have to believe in me.

781
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,240
I can

782
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,000
make you

783
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,040
a top star,

784
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,360
From now on, no one will dare

785
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,680
to call you rubbish again,

786
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,400
Carry me first.

787
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,600
It's my turn to carry you

788
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,880
later. No need. Let me carry you

789
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,680
when you're drunk. No.

790
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,720
Why do you

791
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,240
have to be loyal when you come out to mix?

792
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,720
I'll carry you later.

793
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,600
I'll carry you.

794
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,880
I'll carry you on the podium.

795
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,720
Good actor,

796
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,160
We have a lot of feelings.

797
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,640
You have to love and feel pain.

798
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,800
I've been hurt before.

799
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,160
Only in this way can you

800
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,320
understand happiness, sadness and happiness,

801
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,280
So that you can bring your true feelings

802
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,640
into the play,

803
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,000
Use real emotions

804
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,840
to interpret other people's lives.

805
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,960
From now on, you just need to

806
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,960
listen to me,

807
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,280
What should I ask you to do?

808
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
What are you going to do?

809
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,720
I won't let you do anything.

810
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,240
Don't even think about it.

811
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,600
You can't lie to me or hide from me.

812
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,680
If you don't contact me,

813
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,800
your phone must be turned on 24 hours a day

814
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,480
and you must reply

815
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
to

816
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,160
text messages within two minutes.

817
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,160
You told me to go east, but I won't go west.

818
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,240
Sister, it's not that I don't want to recite it.

819
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,320
It's not that I don't want to carry it. I don't want to

820
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,360
Me,

821
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,280
I don't want to wait for you to abandon me.

822
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,080
It's not that I don't recite it.
