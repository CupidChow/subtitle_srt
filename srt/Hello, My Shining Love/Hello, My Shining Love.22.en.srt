1
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,400
Are these all scripts?

2
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,440
That's right.

3
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,720
This is Song Zihao's new play.

4
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,400
Song Zihao asked me to

5
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,800
Everything is marked.

6
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,200
There are so many scripts.

7
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Let me read it in a week.

8
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,960
It was meant to mess with me.

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Let me help you clean up.

10
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,600
I want to see the script.

11
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,800
Si Da, you're so kind.

12
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,320
He said he would read the script.

13
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,880
What's so great about the script?

14
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,200
You said you wanted to see me.

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,880
That's it.

16
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,240
Are you really reading the script?

17
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,760
When I was doing group acting,

18
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,720
I often peep at the script of the star.

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,080
And secretly recite their lines.

20
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,840
I imagined that one day,

21
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,640
To be a real actor.

22
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,200
Actually, I envy Song Zihao.

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,560
Yeah, I remember the time

24
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,920
You also said that

25
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,720
You really want to be an actor.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,720
I think you can...

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
And told Dugu Ruuo that

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,360
She's your manager.

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,720
She will definitely support you.

30
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,440
I'm a singer now.

31
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,920
I don't want to be an actress.

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,480
Why?

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
You love acting so much.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,280
You want to be an actor so much.

35
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,760
Why didn't you tell her?

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,920
If you don't tell her,

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,800
I'll talk to her.

38
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,000
Thousand yarn.

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
If it's not easy for you

40
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,560
To train me to be a singer.

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,360
I don't want to let her down.

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,720
Don't tell her.

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,760
Otherwise, she will be in a dilemma.

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,200
You don't want her to be hard on you.

45
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Make it difficult for yourself.

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,480
And let myself down.

47
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,720
You really want to act.

48
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,640
Why should I suppress it?

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,560
Your own idea.

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,200
I think you should tell her.

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,320
What's there to say?

52
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,040
I don't want to act.

53
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,800
Old Zhao.

54
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,640
The contract has been received.

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,560
Thank you for giving Star the chance.

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,640
The contract will be signed tomorrow.

57
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,320
In about an hour,

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,120
Leave work

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,200
Okay, no problem.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,800
See you later.

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
What's the matter

62
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,200
Yes

63
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,760
Something very important.

64
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,760
If you have something important,

65
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,040
Do you know?

66
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,720
Star wants to be an actress.

67
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,440
I know.

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,280
You know,

69
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,960
You still want him to be a singer?

70
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm his manager.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,800
What should he do?

72
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,160
You don't have to worry about it.

73
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,760
You're killing his dream.

74
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,040
You're not a

75
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,000
A good manager.

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,520
I call it incompetent.

77
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,600
It's not up to you.

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,080
It's not up to me.

79
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,440
The market has the final say.

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,480
What do I do?

81
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,640
For his own good.

82
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,120
I don't care about the market.

83
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,840
I only know that Star wants to act.

84
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,720
He wants to be an actor.

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,840
This is his dream.

86
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,440
What about you?

87
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,760
You only think about your own feelings.

88
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,880
You never thought about Star.

89
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,160
You're selfish.

90
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,840
Is there anything else?

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm busy.

92
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,200
If you really want the best for Star,

93
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,680
You should respect his idea.

94
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,640
Thousand yarn.

95
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,440
What's up

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,720
Who made you angry?

97
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,120
Why are you so angry?

98
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,360
It ticks me off

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,880
Tell me.

100
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,560
Maybe I can help you.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,480
Star wants to be an actress.

102
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,480
I won't let you be alone.

103
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
I think Star is pitiful.

104
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,760
I came to argue with her.

105
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,200
But she wouldn't listen to me.

106
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,320
no wonder

107
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,360
At this critical moment,

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,880
How could you agree to it?

109
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,480
To make Star become an actor.

110
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,680
What critical moment?

111
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,920
It seems you don't know.

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
Ruiqi is going to

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,520
The contract is signed.

114
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,240
And let Star be their spokesman.

115
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,280
Sida should not be the spokesman.

116
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
To be an actor or not.

117
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,360
What does it matter?

118
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,640
Of course it's related.

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,520
Why did Rui Qi hire Sida?

120
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,720
To be their spokesman.

121
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,920
She must have fallen in love with

122
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,040
The popularity of Star.

123
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,800
Once the contract is successful,

124
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,640
I'm afraid Star will fly around.

125
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,240
Go around to the platform for Rui Qi.

126
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,680
But actors are different.

127
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,600
There are so many actors.

128
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,560
Free time.

129
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,680
They want to stay in the crew for a long time.

130
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,200
You can't fly around.

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,120
This contract

132
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,240
Has been secured.

133
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
If you're so smart,

134
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,440
You wouldn't understand it.

135
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,480
What's at stake?

136
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,760
In her eyes,

137
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,760
Only benefits.

138
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,880
It's impossible for Star Wars

139
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,120
To take the risk.

140
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,960
What should we do?

141
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
Star can't be an actress.

142
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,040
I think it's hard.

143
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,360
However

144
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,600
let it be

145
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,800
What? Forget it. Just say it.

146
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
I think

147
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,600
It's not that I have no choice.

148
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,120
Your father is not Rui Qi.

149
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,040
Chairman?

150
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,200
You can give it to your father.

151
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Make a call.

152
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,560
And ask him to cancel the meeting

153
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Endorsement contract

154
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,800
In this case,

155
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,560
It's impossible if you're a male sister.

156
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,840
Any excuse.

157
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
To stop Star from becoming an actor.

158
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,440
Don't think I didn't know.

159
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,560
You're Song Zihao's manager.

160
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,240
Song Zihao and Si Da

161
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,360
It's a competition.

162
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,720
Star can't be the spokesman.

163
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,960
Then Song Zihao has a chance.

164
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,680
You can think I'm selfish.

165
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560
But my selfishness

166
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
It doesn't conflict with yours.

167
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,880
You can get what you want.

168
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,400
You can choose to be indifferent.

169
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,760
And watch Star become

170
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,920
The spokesman of Rui Qi.

171
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,080
And watched him

172
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,320
And was held down by Ruo.

173
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,440
To be his singer.

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,840
Of course.

175
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,520
You can also choose to help Star.

176
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,960
To get rid of those who stand in his way.

177
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,360
To become an actor.

178
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,400
To make it easy for him.

179
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
To fulfill his dream of being an actor.

180
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,920
This is your choice.

181
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,840
I believe

182
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,720
You won't.

183
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,920
To disappoint Star.

184
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,160
But it's not easy.

185
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,320
After all, you're still a little girl.

186
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,480
Your father wouldn't have

187
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,360
Whatever you want.

188
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,000
Right?

189
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,040
Then forget I said anything.

190
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,640
I'll get back to work.

191
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,560
Sida

192
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
I'll tell you something.

193
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,120
Rui Qi has sent the contract

194
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,000
Sent it to me.

195
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,040
You are about to become

196
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,080
The spokesman of Rui Qi.

197
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,120
Are you happy?

198
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,000
Be happy.

199
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,800
It's good.

200
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,040
Really?

201
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,360
What? I think you

202
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,480
I've been in a bad mood recently.

203
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,560
No,

204
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,280
It's great.

205
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,080
Are you telling me

206
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,440
You want to be an actress.

207
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
I rejected you.

208
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
No, no.

209
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,520
Actually, I know.

210
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,880
You've been repressing yourself.

211
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,920
The thoughts in my heart.

212
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,640
I know how you feel.

213
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,600
It's just that what you're doing now

214
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,480
Is patience.

215
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,640
This could be a tough time.

216
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
But sometimes the reality

217
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,040
There's nothing

218
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,480
There will be a gap.

219
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,640
Everyone is more or less

220
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,560
You need to compromise.

221
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
I just...

222
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,240
I chose one for you.

223
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,160
Relatively speaking

224
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,280
The easier way for you.

225
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,880
But I want you to be happy.

226
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,120
Do you understand

227
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,560
I understand.

228
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,520
Are you blaming me?

229
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,200
It's not weird.

230
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,360
Sister, I've figured it out.

231
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,840
It's too impractical to be an actor.

232
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
That's

233
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,920
At that time,

234
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,160
If you say something impulsive,

235
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,320
I've calmed down and thought about it.

236
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,760
The singer suits me.

237
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,280
I will play the guitar well.

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,680
Really

239
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,480
Really

240
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,880
Alright then.

241
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,760
sister

242
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,160
I will play the guitar well.

243
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,360
I won't let you down.

244
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,560
Your condition is different from what I expected.

245
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,160
It's not the same.

246
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,440
I thought after you got the contract,

247
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,920
Will be very happy.

248
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,200
Old Zhao.

249
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,480
I have a question for you.

250
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,080
But you have to answer me honestly.

251
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,040
You know,

252
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,400
If Si Da

253
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,760
I want to be an actress.

254
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,000
That means

255
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,080
He is going to work in the team.

256
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,440
In this case,

257
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,400
Will you still sign with us?

258
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,560
why

259
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
There will be such an assumption.

260
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,600
Answer my question first.

261
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,400
Frankly,

262
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,320
Now, Si Da

263
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,800
Is still on the rise.

264
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,160
At this stage,

265
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,680
To become an actor,

266
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
Then his business value

267
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,520
Including exposure.

268
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,560
May fall sharply.

269
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,800
And the hypothesis

270
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,480
What if it's only temporary?

271
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,600
I can assure you,

272
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,160
I will definitely train him

273
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,480
The top actors in China.

274
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,120
But if a man

275
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm a businessman.

276
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,280
What about the businessman?

277
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,760
It's all for the benefit.

278
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,600
Besides, I can't sacrifice

279
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,680
The interests of the group.

280
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,200
To bet on an uncertain future.

281
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,880
Don't you think so?

282
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,160
Can you tell me?

283
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,080
Why did you ask Star

284
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,120
And become an actor?

285
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,200
He wants to be an actor.

286
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,480
This is his dream.

287
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,560
So I'm contradictory.

288
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,360
To run the show.

289
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,960
Is also a business.

290
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,400
Since it's business,

291
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,240
Everything

292
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,000
We must proceed from the interests.

293
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,000
Of course.

294
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,400
Star is still young.

295
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,880
Your thoughts are changing.

296
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,560
Is really normal.

297
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,240
But you can't be led by him.

298
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,240
You're his manager.

299
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
You have to pay for

300
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,280
To take charge of it.

301
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,800
otherwise

302
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,480
Can't be a qualified agent.

303
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,680
Sorry, I...

304
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,720
Is that too direct?

305
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,840
But I want to do it for your own good.

306
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,320
Each of us

307
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
For the sake of each other.

308
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,560
But sometimes what you say

309
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,600
But not in the other's heart.

310
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,320
I want to hear.

311
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,640
Let's not talk about work.

312
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,960
By the way, I've booked

313
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,880
A French restaurant.

314
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,040
Their French food.

315
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,360
I won't eat today.

316
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,400
I want to do sports.

317
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,800
Please take me to the boxing gym.

318
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,880
good

319
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Why are you here?

320
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Don't misunderstand me.

321
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
I'm not here for you.

322
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,640
I've been in a bad mood recently.

323
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,880
I want to exercise.

324
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,840
What a coincidence.

325
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,320
I want to vent.

326
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,560
not as good as

327
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,560
You can be my human sandbag.

328
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,720
Why are you so angry?

329
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,440
last time

330
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,440
Last time, I asked you

331
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,520
I won't let you do that this time.

332
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,360
Alright.

333
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,120
It hurts.

334
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,600
Dugu is like a man.

335
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,640
You won't be convinced.

336
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,440
It hurts.

337
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,000
pain

338
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,760
pain

339
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,840
Are you all right?

340
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,560
pain

341
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,720
My hand.

342
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,880
It hurts.

343
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,640
I think I twisted it.

344
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,720
Dugu is like a man.

345
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,440
You cheat.

346
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,160
It's called deception.

347
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,240
You took it seriously.

348
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,520
I'm tired.

349
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,480
I'm leaving.

350
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,560
Do you want to eat?

351
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm not hungry.

352
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,640
I don't want to eat.

353
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Go ahead.

354
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,640
What's wrong?

355
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,120
And you hit me.

356
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,880
Recently,

357
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,720
There's something wrong.

358
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Hasn't Star developed recently?

359
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,280
Is it good?

360
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,960
You should be happy.

361
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,320
It's good that you're here.

362
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,880
I also want to ask your opinion.

363
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,480
Do you think

364
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,000
Is suitable for being a singer.

365
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,000
Or an actor?

366
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,160
Aren't you his manager?

367
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,080
This kind of thing,

368
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,440
You should know

369
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,400
Why are you asking me?

370
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,760
Yes?

371
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,280
Something happened to Star.

372
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,480
No, everything went well.

373
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,840
And Star is good.

374
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,600
But,

375
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,560
The more well-behaved he is, the more guilty I will be.

376
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Star wants to be an actor.

377
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,000
He mentioned it to me once.

378
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,520
But I persuaded him to give up.

379
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,440
I'm doing it for his own good.

380
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,640
Now?

381
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,119
Is the most critical period for Star.

382
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,680
Rui Qi will invite him.

383
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,599
As a spokesman.

384
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,640
A first-tier brand like Rui Qi.

385
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,960
As long as we sign the contract,

386
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,440
Sida has already stepped into

387
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,800
The field of A-list idols.

388
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,640
So,

389
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,760
In terms of long-term plan,

390
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,400
I think being a singer

391
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,680
Is more beneficial to him.

392
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,160
I remember you once said

393
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,360
The agent is a dream maker.

394
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,120
Every artist

395
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,400
Are all your works.

396
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,200
But every work

397
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,040
You need a soul.

398
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,320
If you're a singer,

399
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,880
It's not Sida's dream.

400
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,600
Then he has lost his soul.

401
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,320
Are you a dream maker?

402
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,160
Besides,

403
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,440
To do anything.

404
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,200
You need to keep doing what you want to do.

405
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,240
In order to complete it successfully.

406
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
It's like I'm a designer.

407
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,120
Are you an agent?

408
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,640
Aren't we all because of love?

409
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,840
To finish the work?

410
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
You don't know.

411
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,680
If Star stays on the set,

412
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,160
A lot less exposure.

413
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,400
There are so many new people.

414
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,520
If he doesn't come out for a day,

415
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,040
Someone might replace him.

416
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,000
Seize the chance.

417
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,560
If you miss it, you won't have it.

418
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,520
can't

419
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,680
Because of him and you.

420
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,160
You have such confidence in me.

421
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,280
Without you in the world,

422
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,760
Dugu Ruoruo can't accomplish anything.

423
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,280
Look.

424
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,800
Star is a blank sheet of paper.

425
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Was trained by you.

426
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,000
Such a successful singer.

427
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,480
If you're alone,

428
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,240
Try harder.

429
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,240
You're a gold broker.

430
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
I've overcome many difficulties.

431
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,600
Then I will train

432
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,640
actor

433
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,200
It's a piece of cake.

434
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,760
Let me dip it.

435
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
Thank you.

436
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,280
You're welcome.

437
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,120
Actually, in my heart,

438
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,280
Has already decided.

439
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,040
But I just need

440
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,920
Someone pushed me.

441
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,440
To encourage me.

442
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,240
I didn't expect that the last one

443
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,000
Or you?

444
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,720
Why does it sound like

445
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,920
It's like scolding me.

446
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,080
Hurry up and eat.

447
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,480
The vegetables are shriveled.

448
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,960
You were talking about my problem.

449
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,880
What about you?

450
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,560
Have you had any problem recently?

451
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,080
To share with me.

452
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,520
Can I help solve it?

453
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,320
Why are you so clear with me?

454
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,520
No

455
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,560
To share the worries.

456
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,240
It's what men do for women.

457
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,400
Although you're better than many men,

458
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,000
Both of them are strong.

459
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,240
But you are still a woman.

460
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,440
So something went wrong.

461
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,360
Don't always carry it.

462
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,400
I don't need it here.

463
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,160
You don't have to.

464
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,440
What kind of man?

465
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,040
You're being sexist.

466
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,240
Why am I being sexist?

467
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,400
You're so outstanding.

468
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,800
I care about you.

469
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,320
In the future,

470
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,400
If there's any problem,

471
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,800
Come to me anytime.

472
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,160
I will never

473
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,600
Is your listener.

474
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,800
Yes, you are my listener.

475
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,560
Is my spiritual mentor.

476
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,920
Is also my human sandbag.

477
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,960
But in my eyes,

478
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,400
But never.

479
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,760
That can't be solved.

480
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,480
With your words,

481
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,760
I will definitely go for it.

482
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,000
The oil is full now.

483
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,720
President Ji.

484
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,360
Venus series.

485
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,040
The market feedback has come out.

486
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,880
The industry is very high.

487
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,600
The number of bookings by major stores

488
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,640
Has been increasing.

489
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,360
Based on the current situation,

490
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,600
In the future,

491
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,560
Will keep rising.

492
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,640
The new series of Ruiqi.

493
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,560
President Ji.

494
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,120
Your judgment of the market

495
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,240
Is so strong.

496
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,080
What's the reaction from Rui Qi?

497
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,360
The sales at Rui Qi are generally good.

498
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,400
And the industry has

499
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,440
The voices of doubt.

500
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
And said that the way they cut

501
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
And the way you cut it.

502
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,920
Very similar.

503
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,160
I think it's fast.

504
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,080
This matter of plagiarism,

505
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,840
I can't hold it anymore.

506
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,520
good

507
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,640
Get the legal department ready.

508
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,480
Prosecution documents

509
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,920
It's time to start fighting back.

510
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,880
I'm on my way.

511
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
There's no problem with the contract.

512
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,720
Let's sign and seal it.

513
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,760
to wait a moment

514
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,480
There's something I need.

515
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,720
Please explain it in advance.

516
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,800
From now on,

517
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,920
And become an actor.

518
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,000
Mr. Zhao might reconsider.

519
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,680
Whether to sign with us.

520
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,160
President Zhao, about this,

521
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,640
I've never heard of it.

522
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,440
The company's plan for STAR

523
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
I've always been a singer.

524
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,680
If a man

525
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,080
Don't talk casually.

526
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
I didn't say anything casually.

527
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,040
I'm Star's agent.

528
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,440
I'm responsible for my artist.

529
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,880
He always wanted to act.

530
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,280
Being an actor is his dream.

531
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,880
dream

532
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,960
Who has no dream?

533
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,880
My dream.

534
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,520
To sign this contract.

535
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,000
Star is the company's entertainer.

536
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,760
He has to follow the company's decision.

537
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,440
President Yang.

538
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
Don't be so excited.

539
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
This matter

540
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,160
If he told me before,

541
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,360
It's my fault.

542
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,480
I didn't take it seriously.

543
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
So I can't blame her.

544
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,320
But,

545
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,680
Given the situation,

546
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,680
I have to discuss with the group first.

547
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,880
I'll reply to you later.

548
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
Since President Zhao said so,

549
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
I'll wait for your reply.

550
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,840
What about the company?

551
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,720
I will also

552
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,280
To communicate with each other.

553
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,240
See you next time.

554
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,520
Sorry for today.

555
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,560
Please come here.

556
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,360
it doesn't matter

557
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,160
I'm so sorry.

558
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,840
Nothing

559
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,840
you

560
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,680
Come to my office.

561
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,640
Dugu is like a man.

562
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,400
Do you know the contract of Rui Qi?

563
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,440
How hard it is.

564
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,160
Do you know?

565
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,520
For a high-end brand.

566
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,200
How important it is to the artist.

567
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,800
What's the weight of Star?

568
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,240
What's the weight of Rui Qi?

569
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,440
If he can get the contract,

570
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,760
How lucky he is.

571
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,000
Do you know?

572
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,880
The contract is about to be signed.

573
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,800
You did this to me.

574
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,640
What do you mean?

575
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,000
Are you trying to get in my way?

576
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
Are you crazy?

577
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,360
Yes, I'm crazy.

578
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,600
I really want to get it.

579
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,560
This endorsement

580
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,360
Over the past few months,

581
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,240
I've been working hard.

582
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,800
I haven't given up until now.

583
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,600
Boss

584
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,240
To enhance the image of the artist.

585
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,160
Is important.

586
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,560
But his interests and dreams

587
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,840
Is more important than these.

588
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,720
I just follow my heart.

589
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,480
heart

590
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,800
To survive in this industry,

591
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,560
A few of them can follow their hearts.

592
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,360
How competitive the industry is.

593
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,480
Don't you know?

594
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,880
It's your first day.

595
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,720
Because it's hard.

596
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,920
So it's worth cherishing.

597
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,400
No matter how many benefits,

598
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,360
No matter how big the halo is,

599
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,600
Compared to the artist's original intention,

600
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,160
It's not worth mentioning.

601
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,680
a row

602
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,920
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

603
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,000
You're thinking for the artist.

604
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,280
When he's popular one day,

605
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,560
Will remember you today.

606
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,600
What you did?

607
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,560
Think about Song Zihao.

608
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,160
He is the best example.

609
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,520
If a man

610
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,960
Don't bet easily.

611
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,120
This society is very realistic.

612
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,440
The bet was wrong.

613
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,200
Your sacrifice is too great.

614
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,920
Please let me be capricious again.

615
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,160
You pissed me off.

616
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,320
Boss

617
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,720
Don't worry.

618
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,880
Even if Rui Qi gives up the contract,

619
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,800
I promise.

620
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,880
I will definitely make it up to you.

621
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,240
The company's loss this time.

622
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,360
I will train Si Da to be

623
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,640
Is an excellent actor.

624
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,400
He will make you a lot of money.

625
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,440
Alright, alright.

626
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,600
I'll give you another chance.

627
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,040
Yes

628
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,160
For the last time,

629
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,880
For the last time,

630
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,720
This is the only time.

631
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,000
Yes, there's no next time.

632
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,480
You really pissed me off.

633
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,040
My waist

634
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,360
Where does it hurt?

635
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
It hurts everywhere.

636
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,320
Thank you for your hard work.

637
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,840
Alright, alright.

638
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,400
sister

639
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,080
sorry

640
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,920
Thank you for your hard work.

641
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,600
I heard it.

642
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,880
I heard it.

643
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,000
Am I a man?

644
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,200
Why are you doing this?

645
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,880
Because I'm your manager.

646
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,640
Your dream is to be an actor.

647
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,080
I have to help you realize it.

648
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,040
Your dream.

649
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,720
You don't have to do that.

650
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,280
I want to be an actor.

651
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
But I can wait.

652
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,880
I can bear it.

653
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,600
Sida

654
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,680
Do you remember the first day I saw you,

655
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,800
You told me you wanted to be an actor.

656
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,560
I am in your eyes.

657
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,720
And saw the stars.

658
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,120
I don't want that star.

659
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,800
Was erased by reality.

660
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,560
It's no big deal.

661
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,320
It's just a fresh start.

662
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,160
You still have me.

663
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,880
Don't be afraid.

664
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,040
sister

665
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,200
You're so nice to me.

666
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,400
I don't even know how to repay you.

667
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,320
This is good.

668
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
All right.

669
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,920
Are you crying, little man?

670
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,880
No,

671
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,240
trivial matter

672
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
I'm telling you,

673
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,760
I've told you

674
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,360
Let them out.

675
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,480
Don't hit my face.

676
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,800
good

677
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,120
From now on,

678
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,600
You will be tired.

679
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,840
Because you have to start

680
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,360
To be a good actor.

681
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,000
You chose the road.

682
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,600
to press on

683
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,240
no problem

684
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,640
As long as you are with me,

685
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,560
As long as you support me,

686
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,280
It doesn't matter whether it's hard or tired.

687
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,120
sister

688
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,080
You're so nice to me.

689
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
You want red?

690
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,360
Don't forget your sister.

691
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,280
good

692
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,520
OK

693
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,600
I know.

694
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,840
Mr. Zhao.

695
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,720
I just received the news from the legal department.

696
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,240
Wing Fashion has sent the court

697
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,360
Submitted materials.

698
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,920
To sue our new series.

699
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,960
You are suspected of plagiarism.

700
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,800
It's a good thing.

701
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,400
We're finally starting to fight back.

702
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,880
What should we do now?

703
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,120
The new series received a flat response.

704
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,520
And there are indeed some

705
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,320
Industry insiders

706
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,640
Are questioning our originality.

707
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,920
If you really sit down,

708
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,880
Plagiarism rumors.

709
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,480
I'm afraid it's very important

710
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,240
Has a great influence.

711
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,880
Who brought the drawings back?

712
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,720
It's Zhang Le.

713
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,280
He is now assigned to the Design Department.

714
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,960
A public relations article.

715
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,320
Just say,

716
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,200
Zhang Le stole it.

717
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,440
Wing Fashion Drawings

718
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,200
The whole plagiarism incident

719
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,640
It's all his personal behavior.

720
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,160
Rui Qi Group will deal with it seriously.

721
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
I won't tolerate it.

722
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,000
Mr. Zhao.

723
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,720
Are you sure you want to do this?

724
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,040
It's like a ruin.

725
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,440
The future of a designer.

726
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,000
In order to benefit him,

727
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,680
And betrayed the wing fashion.

728
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,080
In the future,

729
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,960
But also because of the benefits,

730
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,360
And betrayed us.

731
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,440
This kind of person

732
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,640
Can't stay.

733
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,680
They are suing for plagiarism.

734
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,200
It seems that he really wants to.

735
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,760
With Rui Qi.

736
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,960
we

737
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,640
Should we make some preparations?

738
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,000
No need.

739
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,520
I've already prepared it.

740
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,360
The news on the Internet

741
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,440
It's so fast.

742
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,640
You just said you don't want to be a singer.

743
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,000
The network will explode.

744
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,720
What about

745
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,800
Regret it?

746
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,960
Sister, what do you think?

747
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,840
Is my decision wrong or right?

748
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,240
It's up to you.

749
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,840
Since you chose to be an actor,

750
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,280
There will be a lot of time

751
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,960
Stay on the crew.

752
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,520
The relative exposure rate

753
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,480
Will be reduced.

754
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,960
The fans outside

755
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,000
The flowers and gifts are gone.

756
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,080
Can you accept it?

757
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,120
can

758
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,840
Actually,

759
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,440
Before making this decision,

760
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,760
I was scared.

761
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,040
But after that,

762
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,680
I found that

763
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,080
It's the sureness I've never had.

764
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,000
And satisfaction.

765
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,120
No matter what,

766
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,440
What kind of frustration?

767
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,280
I won't give up.

768
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,800
That's good.

769
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,760
From now on,

770
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,880
To be an actor.

771
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,160
We are still

772
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
You should play well.

773
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,160
Certain

774
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,160
Certain

775
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,920
To leave the music scene temporarily.

776
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,800
To complete the task

777
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,680
Since I was little.

778
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,720
To be an actor.

779
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,960
Dugu Ruuo and Si Da

780
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,800
Are you crazy?

781
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,600
Just after a bit of improvement,

782
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,840
Do you want to go back to acting?

783
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,920
Do you think Rui Qi is crazy?

784
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,520
To sign him as the spokesman.

785
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,200
That's because of Dugu Ruuo Man.

786
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,640
And betrayed her?

787
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,960
Who doesn't know?

788
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,520
She and Zhao Yucheng

789
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,040
Don't care about their relationship.

790
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,160
At least, Si Da,

791
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,200
I'm about to get the endorsement.

792
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,560
This is her lonely man.

793
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,400
The ability of

794
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,800
Si Da won't be popular for a few days.

795
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,880
He will soon be

796
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,000
Back to the original shape.

797
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,440
until this moment

798
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,920
He's no match for you.

799
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,520
What opponent?

800
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,920
I never sent him

801
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,680
As an opponent.

802
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,000
I don't know about Shen Qiansha.

803
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,280
What do you like about him?

804
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,920
What's good about him?

805
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,520
The contract of Rui Qi.

806
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,560
As long as you don't sign it,

807
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,640
We all have a chance.

808
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,320
Six cakes.

809
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,720
You always talk without practicing.

810
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,920
How can I trust you?

811
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,200
Don't worry.

812
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,320
This is different.

813
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,400
I still have a trump card.

814
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,880
We have contacted several dramas.

815
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,840
And got the drama book.

816
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,280
There are two male lead actors.

817
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,960
There's a vacancy.

818
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,800
And he's very interested in Star.

819
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,720
If you're a male,

820
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,680
Which one should we choose?

821
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,200
The role of this drama is male,

822
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Why don't the men act?

823
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,720
To play the second male.

824
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,000
For actors,

825
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,280
The rank is not important.

826
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,960
What matters is the character.

827
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
The script of this play

828
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,160
The male number two is very handsome.

829
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,320
Is more suitable for Sida.

830
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,960
remember

831
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,400
Actors can't just eat their youth.

832
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,720
To become a real actress,

833
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,520
You should be more far-sighted.

834
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,080
If Mr. Zhao is here,

835
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,640
Okay, it's over.

836
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,600
Hurry up and carry it out.

837
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,120
I've been busy recently.

838
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,680
There's a drama that needs to be decided.

839
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,240
So I quickly put it into practice.

840
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,480
So I've been so busy recently.

841
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,160
I need to be busy.

842
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,280
So Star has a chance.

843
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,000
What is this?

844
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,760
The spokesman contract of Star.

845
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,080
As an actor,

846
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,200
Don't you want a chance?

847
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,360
This is

848
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,600
Actually, this time,

849
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,800
I want to apologize to you.

850
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,400
You don't have to apologize to me.

851
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,280
I'm not professional enough.

852
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,120
I shouldn't have suddenly

853
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,960
Make a decision.

854
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,440
I should have told you.

855
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,680
You told me in advance.

856
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,040
and

857
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,600
You discussed with me in advance.

858
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,000
Because you trusted me.

859
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:19,960
but

860
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,720
I only care about benefits.

861
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,080
I didn't think for you.

862
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,600
So it's my fault.

863
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,760
I apologize to you.

864
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,360
You're doing it for the sake of the group.

865
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,720
I totally understand.

866
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,240
Thank you

867
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
Actually,

868
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,880
His parents divorced when he was young.

869
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,200
Spend very little time with your family.

870
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,880
So, the four words of the world

871
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,800
I only know the ways of the world.

872
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,520
I don't know much about human relations.

873
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,200
There are many people around.

874
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,800
He would say I'm unreasonable.

875
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,120
Or even indifferent.

876
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,280
But please believe me.

877
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,800
I don't want to

878
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,960
Any misunderstanding.

879
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,120
Or a grudge.

880
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,440
You told me that

881
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,520
I was surprised.

882
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,320
I think I know what you mean.

883
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,480
Those feelings

884
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,400
I know what you mean.

885
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,960
That might be the secret

886
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,239
A protective color.

887
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,120
In fact, facing this relationship,

888
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,679
I've always been cautious.

889
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,280
Very carefully

890
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,480
Because I was so worried.

891
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,120
I was wrong in front of you.

892
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,360
No matter what,

893
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,719
Or do anything wrong,

894
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,880
Will lead to

895
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,280
I will reduce the score in your mind.

896
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,159
thus

897
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,840
thus

898
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,960
And lose the right to stay with you.

899
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,040
Of course, I admit that

900
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,199
I'll sign this contract.

901
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,800
For you.

902
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,600
You don't have to compromise anything for me.

903
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,199
Since I decided to let Star

904
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,320
Since the day I went back to acting,

905
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,360
I've done it.

906
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,840
To lose the endorsement.

907
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,960
Work is work.

908
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,240
I don't want you to

909
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,280
For personal reasons.

910
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,160
To affect your decision.

911
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,480
I'm a businessman.

912
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,520
Actually, I'm used to it.

913
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,440
With numbers and benefits,

914
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,600
To measure everything.

915
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,840
But when I met you,

916
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,040
I want to be a warm person.

917
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,920
I want to lose control for you.

918
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,800
I want to abandon them for you.

919
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,960
The so-called principles

920
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,920
So don't reject me, okay?

921
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,280
Give me more.

922
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,320
Let me see this.

923
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
The texture of the clothes

924
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,280
good

925
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,480
Pretty good

926
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,360
Hello, hello.

927
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,960
No, Phil's working.

928
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,920
Can't be interviewed.

929
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,520
what

930
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,280
Hold on a second.

931
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:40,880
President Ji.

932
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,840
I'm applying.

933
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,200
Phil, stop shooting now.

934
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,240
What's going on?

935
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,040
Look.

936
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,000
What's up

937
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,440
here

938
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,840
AiLi

939
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,240
Phil, are you all right?

940
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
I've heard about it.

941
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,520
Take her first.

942
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,440
I'll handle it.

943
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,560
good

944
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,160
Come on. Let's go.

945
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,360
Phil, we're here.

946
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,560
Let me send you up.

947
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
I can't get out of the car.

948
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,200
Someone will see me.

949
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,520
When I entered the community,

950
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,600
I've checked it for you.

951
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,280
There are no reporters around.

952
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,120
They won't let me off easily.

953
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,440
I'm a joke now.

954
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,240
Everyone is laughing at me.

955
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,040
No one will like me anymore.

956
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,000
Chen Fei.

957
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,120
The person who really likes you

958
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
It's not because of a few photos.

959
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,320
I don't like you.

960
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,040
Stop lying to me

961
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,080
No one will like

962
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,440
Who used to be ugly and fat.

963
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,560
No one will like me anymore.

964
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,520
How could there not be?

965
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,200
I like you.

966
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,760
Phil, I... I really...

967
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,520
I really, really like you.

968
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,080
All your news.

969
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,440
I liked it and forwarded it.

970
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,040
Your medical records are always

971
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,320
The top of my drawer

972
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,320
All the videos of your show.

973
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,200
I've seen them all.

974
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,280
I applaud you through the screen.

975
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,720
giggle

976
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,960
Phil, I think you're great.

977
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,960
You have to trust me.

978
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,080
No matter what the problem is,

979
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,480
You can handle it, okay?

980
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,520
Phil!

981
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,200
I also want to let you know

982
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,120
I don't care about your past.

983
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,440
I love you

984
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,440
I will love your past.

985
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,720
I will always be there for you.

986
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,640
Even if all the people

987
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,720
I don't even like you.

988
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,960
I will still like you.

989
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,280
It's all right.

990
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,400
Chapter III Article 7

991
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,760
As the spokesman of Rui Qi,

992
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,000
During this period, we will cooperate with the commercial performance.

993
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,920
I want to talk to you

994
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,840
To discuss it.

995
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,720
You know,

996
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,760
Because when Star came into the team,

997
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,000
We don't have so much time for commercial performance.

998
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,520
So I want to compress

999
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,560
The number of commercial performances

1000
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,000
Sure.

1001
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,320
Next, Star must attend.

1002
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,120
All Rui Qi's new store activities

1003
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,080
Can I see Star's schedule?

1004
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,000
And settle down.

1005
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,840
no problem

1006
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,080
Also

1007
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,240
Star must be in public.

1008
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:53,960
If a man

1009
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,480
Do you have any idea

1010
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,840
The part that needs to be modified.

1011
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,080
Just change it.

1012
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,040
Don't go through me.

1013
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,840
You're the boss.

1014
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,560
I'm the boss.

1015
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,280
It's up to you.

1016
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,920
Because I know

1017
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,560
You're not one to push your luck.

1018
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,440
I can rest assured of you.

1019
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,160
feed

1020
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,400
The photos of Phyl.

1021
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:14,920
Was exposed.

1022
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,960
I've asked Ellie

1023
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
And sent her home.

1024
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,920
Go and see her.

1025
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,480
I don't think she's in a good condition.

1026
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,560
Okay, I'll be right there.

1027
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
Is something wrong?

1028
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,280
I

1029
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,880
I have to go out for an emergency.

1030
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,120
I can give you a lift.

1031
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,640
Okay, please.

1032
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,680
Chen Fei.

1033
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,320
Chen Fei, open the door.

1034
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,240
If you don't open the door,

1035
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,120
Can you answer me?

1036
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,320
I was worried about you.

1037
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,520
If you come at the right time,

1038
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,160
Where's Phil?

1039
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,760
When you enter the room,

1040
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,720
So I locked myself inside.

1041
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
You can't even shout.

1042
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,840
If not, I'll open the door.

1043
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,680
Open it.

1044
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,680
Phil!

1045
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,360
How to do it?

1046
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,600
I know where the key is.

1047
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,880
fast

1048
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,400
Phil!

1049
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,600
It's okay.

1050
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,160
Don't be afraid.

1051
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,160
If a man

1052
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,840
It's all right.

1053
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,480
Phil, Phil.

1054
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,560
Phil, are you all right?

1055
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,280
Hurry up.

1056
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,360
Come on.

1057
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:50,960
What about

1058
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,720
It's okay.

1059
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,000
Look.

1060
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,480
I used to meet

1061
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,440
A lot of setbacks.

1062
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,040
Many people scolded me.

1063
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,560
Hate me. How is it?

1064
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,480
Now,

1065
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,080
Everything is fine.

1066
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,360
Everything will pass.

1067
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,800
Then you want to

1068
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,440
Anyway, the thing you're most afraid of

1069
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,320
Has happened.

1070
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,800
Don't be afraid from now on.

1071
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,360
right or wrong?

1072
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,800
I know.

1073
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,800
There will never be

1074
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,480
And asked me to be a model.
