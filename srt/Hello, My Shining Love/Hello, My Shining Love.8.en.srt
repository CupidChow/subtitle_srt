1
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,480
Sis,

2
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,080
What are you talking about?

3
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,240
If it hadn't been for you,

4
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,080
I would still be acting like a dragon in the crew,

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,560
If it wasn't for you,

6
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
how could I have made it

7
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,920
to such a big show?

8
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,200
If it weren't for you,

9
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,520
I wouldn't even have the right to dream.

10
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,440
You know what?

11
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,480
Don't say that

12
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
again.

13
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,320
Kid,

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
you're good at comforting people.

15
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
I'm not comforting you.

16
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,880
I'm telling the truth.

17
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,840
It feels good to cry.

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,160
All right,

19
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,360
keep eating.

20
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,000
Today is your first catwalk show.

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,640
Yes. It's worth celebrating.

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,240
Waiter,

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,640
Waiter,

24
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,960
A dozen beers,

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,800
Okay,

26
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,200
Thank you.

27
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,560
beer

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,440
Can you drink?

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,880
I can.

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,480
I said you can drink it.

31
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,240
Okay.

32
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,320
Dugu Ruonan.

33
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,000
What time is it

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,560
that this woman hasn't come back yet?

35
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,280
Hey,

36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,480
Look at the time now.

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,360
He hasn't come back yet.

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,640
Where is it?

39
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Who are you?

40
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,640
I like to go home at a certain time.

41
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,840
When will you go home?

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,960
What do you care?

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,160
Did you drink again?

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,880
Yes,

45
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,920
eating hot pot and drinking wine,

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,840
I don't know how happy I am.

47
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,920
Don't move.

48
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,960
I'm going to see you now.

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,840
Which hot pot restaurant?

50
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,920
Be careful, sis.

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,040
Sida

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,800
I'm not drunk at all, okay?

53
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,720
Over there! Over there!

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,480
Go back and continue drinking.

55
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
I don't want to drink anymore.

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,400
Okay,

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,080
it's almost done.

58
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,640
Okay,

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,080
sister,

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,440
let's go.

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,520
Brother,

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,680
Why are you here?

63
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,320
Why are you here again?

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,640
Get off.

65
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,520
As her artist,

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,160
don't you care about your agent?

67
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,600
How much did you drink?

68
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,320
I'm in a bad mood today.

69
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,440
I can't stop him at all.

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you okay, sis?

71
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,960
All right, you can go back now.

72
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's go home.

73
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,360
Brother,

74
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,950
Do you know where my sister's house is?

75
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,000
I forgot to tell you.

76
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,000
She lives with me now.

77
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,880
Let's go home.

78
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
Take the right path. If you don't go home,

79
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,040
you can continue drinking.

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,960
Take the right path,

81
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,760
do you dare?

82
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,400
I dare

83
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,200
not. I dare.

84
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,960
No problem.

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,640
They live together.

86
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm exhausted.

87
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,440
What feed did you eat to grow up?

88
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,360
It's so heavy.

89
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm exhausted.

90
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,240
Don't sleep here.

91
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,160
Go back to your room and sleep.

92
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,560
Why are you here again?

93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,680
Why do I dream about you

94
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,200
all the time?

95
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,560
Am I a pervert?

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,520
I'll go. The evil spirits

97
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
are gone. I hate it.

98
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,240
Go, go.

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,440
Am I that annoying?

100
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,960
You even scolded me after drinking.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,680
Yes.

102
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,000
I hate you so much.

103
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,120
I thought,

104
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,160
I thought I knew me

105
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,760
very well.

106
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,560
Self-righteous?

107
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,920
What do you think?

108
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Do you believe I'll throw it down

109
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,600
if you go crazy again?

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,080
What are you

111
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,000
doing? Let go,

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,800
You're not going to throw me down to watch.

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,400
Throw it away.

114
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,160
Throw it away.

115
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,520
Delicious.

116
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,800
How did you come back yesterday?

117
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,600
Oh, my god. Did you drink the fragment?

118
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,240
Did you wake up from work

119
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,760
so early?

120
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,800
Have a cup of honey water to dissolve the bar.

121
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,560
There's porridge on the table.

122
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,440
If you're hungry,

123
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,640
Heat it in the microwave,

124
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,680
then you can drink it directly.

125
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,480
Don't get drunk again.

126
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,160
I don't want to.

127
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,600
Always taking care of an alcoholic roommate. Oh,

128
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,080
my God,

129
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,800
My head is blown off.

130
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,520
I'm going to quit drinking.

131
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,600
I will never drink again in my life.

132
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,360
You didn't do anything

133
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
embarrassing yesterday, did you?

134
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,680
Mr. Ji,

135
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,520
yesterday's big show,

136
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,640
How is the response from the outside world?

137
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,080
Yesterday's big show received a good response

138
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,200
from the outside world.

139
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,880
That's it.

140
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,360
What is it?

141
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,120
You'd better read the comments on the internet.

142
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,910
See?

143
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,520
There are all kinds of voices

144
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,320
on the internet.

145
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,920
They all attacked Ruonan.

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,280
Why is the focus

147
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,680
on Dugu Ruonan?

148
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,880
I don't know either.

149
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,240
Isn't it strange?

150
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
All right. You may leave now.

151
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,320
Invincible Huanhuan's comments

152
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,040
are so vicious.

153
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,480
It's fake.

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,320
It's all fake.

155
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,760
I was there.

156
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,440
Dugu Ruonan is innocent

157
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,560
and invincible Huanhuan,

158
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,920
Your comments are so malicious.

159
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,480
What am I doing?

160
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,480
Why are you so childish?

161
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,840
Are you possessed?

162
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,400
Sida?

163
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,920
What's wrong with him?

164
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,720
What's wrong with you?

165
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,440
Why didn't you reply

166
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
when I said hello to you?

167
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,840
I'm in a bad mood,

168
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,200
I don't want to talk,

169
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,680
I'm not feeling well.

170
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,960
Or was I drunk yesterday?

171
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,040
What did he do to you?

172
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,520
It's too much.

173
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,960
Say something.

174
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,600
About you and Mr. Ji,

175
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I know everything.

176
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,360
What do you know?

177
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,080
Why didn't you tell me

178
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,200
you were living with him?

179
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,480
So you mean this?

180
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,960
I'm not hiding it from you.

181
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,600
I just don't think it's important.

182
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,600
It doesn't matter.

183
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,040
It doesn't matter.

184
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,760
If I had known earlier,

185
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,640
you two were dating?

186
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,600
I won't... I won't

187
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,280
tell him yesterday.

188
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,480
I didn't tell you that

189
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,080
we were in love.

190
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440
He and I

191
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,400
are just sharing a room

192
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,920
for the time being.

193
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,080
It's just sharing.

194
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm not in a relationship.

195
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,600
You just said,

196
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
What did you tell him yesterday?

197
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,560
Nothing.

198
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,840
What? I feel like

199
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,160
you're hiding something from me right now,

200
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,760
No.

201
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,560
You.

202
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,200
Hey,

203
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,200
Where are you?

204
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,640
I'm in the company.

205
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,720
Where else can I be?

206
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,880
That's good.

207
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,520
I'm on my way to your company. I'll meet you

208
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,920
at the cafe downstairs in ten minutes.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,280
Why are you looking for me in such a hurry?

210
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,880
What happened?

211
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,120
Who pissed you off?

212
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,640
A man,

213
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,600
an unpredictable man.

214
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,520
And you,

215
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,800
a man you can't even figure out,

216
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,840
It seems that you have a lot of skills,

217
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,800
which male demon is it?

218
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,520
He is.

219
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,240
Anyway, there is such a person,

220
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,840
I gave him a clear hint,

221
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,760
Many times,

222
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,880
but he just didn't do anything.

223
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,160
Could it be

224
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,920
He's playing hard to get with me.

225
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,800
Or does he really have no feelings for me?

226
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
Look at you.

227
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,360
Look at you.

228
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
For a man?

229
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,400
If he plays hard to get with you,

230
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,640
you can hang him up too.

231
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,200
To hang him out for ten days and a half months,

232
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,400
maybe,

233
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,720
So I came back obediently.

234
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Ten days and a half months,

235
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,560
Yes.

236
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,840
If other women

237
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,880
take advantage of my absence,

238
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,560
I hooked him up.

239
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,280
What should I do?

240
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,440
Is there another woman with him?

241
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,040
Yes.

242
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,040
I've already told you,

243
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,560
don't look for such a man

244
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,200
with a lot of feelings.

245
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,760
It's like guarding against thieves every day.

246
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,800
Are you tired?

247
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,680
You.

248
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,280
Really

249
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,480
Don't you want to fall in love?

250
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,200
No,

251
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm really

252
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,640
not in the mood right now,

253
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,840
Sida's business is enough for me to be busy.

254
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm going to strike while the iron is hot,

255
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,360
to help him get

256
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,920
more fashion resources,

257
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,400
You have to help me with this.

258
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,840
After all, I used to

259
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,400
bring actors.

260
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,280
I've never brought a model before.

261
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,120
Are you stupid?

262
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,920
Don't you have a

263
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,520
ready-made resource library by your side?

264
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,200
Yi Fashion is very important

265
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,960
in the fashion industry.

266
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,040
All you need to do now

267
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,360
is to hold Ji Mo's thighs tight,

268
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,320
And ask him

269
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,040
to introduce you,

270
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,720
Are you still afraid that you don't have resources?

271
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,480
That's right.

272
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,200
Right?

273
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,280
Wait a minute,

274
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,960
You.

275
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,600
Stop hugging your thighs.

276
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,400
Why?

277
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,320
You and Ji Mo

278
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,400
have been living together

279
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,440
for the first time and the second time,

280
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,560
Now that work is still involved,

281
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,600
aren't you afraid

282
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,720
to cultivate feelings?

283
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,360
Mr. Ji and I

284
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,800
won't do it.

285
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,440
He and I are enemies.

286
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,680
Inconsistent personalities,

287
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,680
temper

288
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,480
It's even worse.

289
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,320
He wanted to avoid me.

290
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,040
Of course,

291
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,080
if I hadn't asked for something from him,

292
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,040
I'm too lazy to talk to him.

293
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,960
I'll listen to your relationship some other day.

294
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,000
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

295
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,120
Where are you going?

296
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Without further ado,

297
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,120
I'm going to hug my thighs.

298
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,120
Why does it still feel weird?

299
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,560
Welcome home.

300
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,320
What are you up to now?

301
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,960
Didn't Sida just

302
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,320
finish the big show?

303
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,040
So I want to say,

304
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,760
he's a model now.

305
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,600
But he's new.

306
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
We don't have enough resources. Mr. Ji,

307
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,800
can you introduce some resources

308
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,960
to us?

309
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,800
I'm busy. I don't have time.

310
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,240
Mr. Ji,

311
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,480
please help me.

312
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,600
-Let go! -Let go!

313
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,640
Mr. Ji,

314
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,560
please help me.

315
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,200
If you don't agree,

316
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,080
I won't let go.

317
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,120
Dugu Ruonan,

318
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,240
I've never seen

319
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,360
such a cheeky person like you,

320
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,000
Are you that hard to deal with?

321
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,600
If I need resources now,

322
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,760
why do I need a face?

323
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,560
Anyway,

324
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,240
I'll hold this thigh.

325
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,360
Okay, I promise you

326
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,680
to introduce Sida to the shooting opportunity,

327
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,480
But for the subsequent development,

328
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,440
you can only rely on yourself.

329
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,720
Really?

330
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,560
Mr. Ji,

331
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,840
as a senior in the fashion circle,

332
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,920
Is there anything you can suggest to me?

333
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,520
As an agent, don't you understand?

334
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,560
Don't push your luck.

335
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,840
Fashion is not my strong suit.

336
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,920
Take the play.

337
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,120
Not to mention

338
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,600
hugging your thigh,

339
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,200
I can take fewer detours.

340
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,840
Sida will have a better development.

341
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,200
Okay. Sit over there.

342
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,880
Get up.

343
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,960
Hurry up

344
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Do you want some coffee?

345
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,680
Tea,

346
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,800
Sure,

347
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,960
I'll be right there.

348
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,800
Hello.

349
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,440
Hello, please have a seat.

350
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,880
Did you wait long?

351
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,600
No.

352
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,600
I'm Si Da's agent,

353
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,480
Dugu Ruonan,

354
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,440
Hello,

355
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,120
I'm the editor

356
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,000
of Chunren Fashion,

357
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,520
We talked on the phone

358
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,280
earlier. Yeah,

359
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm Sida.

360
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,200
Hello,

361
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,480
Let's get started.

362
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,160
Okay,

363
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
I heard that

364
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,840
Sida didn't have

365
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,880
professional training,

366
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,440
But on the new catwalk,

367
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,720
he performed very well,

368
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,880
It's appreciated by Ji Mo,

369
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
the president of

370
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,280
Wing Fashion Star?

371
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,160
How did you

372
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,240
transform from an actress to a model,

373
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,830
In fact, thanks to Ruonan,

374
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,160
at the beginning,

375
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,680
I don't even know how to walk.

376
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,400
I also failed in my first interview.

377
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,520
But if you

378
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,110
keep encouraging me and supporting me,

379
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
That's why I have

380
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,400
confidence and courage,

381
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,640
Standing on the stage,

382
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,480
it seems that you have a good relationship

383
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,350
with your agent.

384
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,280
Of course,

385
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,440
she's just like my sister,

386
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,480
Take good care of me.

387
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,760
This answer surprised me a bit.

388
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
With all due respect,

389
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,240
it's been widely rumored,

390
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,480
Miss Ruonan said that

391
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,480
I don't have a good relationship

392
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,720
with my artist, right?

393
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
In fact, I don't care about

394
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,120
the rumors outside,

395
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,480
They pay attention to me,

396
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,120
the artists who represent me are popular,

397
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
It's good

398
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,200
to be popular.

399
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,000
You're in a good state of mind.

400
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,840
I think this shop only sells juice.

401
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
I want to drink coffee.

402
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,760
Sida?

403
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,320
Can you buy me two cups of coffee?

404
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,280
What... What would you like to drink?

405
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes Coffee,

406
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,320
two Americano,

407
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay,

408
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,760
Thank you.

409
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,520
Can you pause

410
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,960
the radio?

411
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,920
Okay.

412
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,640
About what Sida interviewed just now,

413
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,120
I want to modify it a little bit,

414
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,520
Yes.

415
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,560
Just get rid of all the words

416
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,480
he thanked me just now.

417
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,240
It says that I'm very strict

418
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,280
with him.

419
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,400
His training under the stage is very hard

420
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,520
and stressful.

421
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,040
He had a breakdown.

422
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,200
But he gritted his teeth and persisted.

423
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,920
You have to highlight

424
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,160
my inhumanity,

425
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,720
And then he was in a pitiful situation.

426
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,720
But in this case,

427
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,000
the public opinion is against you.

428
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,000
It doesn't matter,

429
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,560
as long as it's good

430
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,320
for my artist.

431
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,440
Brokers serve artists.

432
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,320
Without the approval and understanding

433
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,560
of the outside world,

434
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,080
Yes.

435
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,440
Okay,

436
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,160
Thank you.

437
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,720
Look.

438
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,600
That's too much. How could this happen?

439
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,640
What rubbish?

440
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,760
Thank you.

441
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,280
Thank you.

442
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,560
Okay, see you later.

443
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,080
Sis,

444
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,800
Sis, Sis, Sis,

445
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,520
When I was at the bus stop,

446
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,240
I saw the cover of Star magazine,

447
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,120
So handsome.

448
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,880
My sister has been crazy about

449
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,120
Star lately. That's great.

450
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,360
I really like this

451
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,400
long-lost flattery,

452
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,440
Don't stop.

453
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,680
With your praise,

454
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,760
drown me out.

455
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,240
I came first.

456
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,560
Why are you arguing so early in the morning?

457
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,000
Market? This is

458
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,600
Star. Although it's very popular now,

459
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,680
But your negative news

460
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,320
is all over the sky.

461
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,440
Are you feeling a little uncomfortable?

462
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,800
How could it be?

463
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,480
My artist quickly became popular.

464
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,360
He hit someone in the face.

465
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,720
As an agent,

466
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,160
I'm quite proud of myself.

467
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,800
I really admire you.

468
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,000
Can you coax Ji Mo?

469
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,960
I'd rather give up a famous model of the company

470
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,400
and not use it,

471
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,040
Why do you only use Sida?

472
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,280
I can still pass him.

473
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,240
Yeah, with so many

474
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,960
fashion resources,

475
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
You went to see Ji Mo?

476
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,240
Yes,

477
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,240
I went to see him.

478
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,920
And he rejected the company I recommended,

479
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,040
all the

480
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,760
famous models.

481
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,600
Ruonan,

482
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
when I was with you,

483
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,800
I knew you were good at it.

484
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,520
But relying on a man

485
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,320
to take the upper position,

486
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,880
Why did I ignore it?

487
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,440
Tong Tong,

488
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,440
never beat someone

489
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,640
with your mouth,

490
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,280
You have to use your brain and strength,

491
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,520
no matter whether I use means or not,

492
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,000
As a result,

493
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,640
Sida is on the stage of Yi Fashion.

494
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,360
And it quickly became popular.

495
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,720
You can only do it

496
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,280
on the gossip website,

497
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,920
Say a few jealous words,

498
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,840
that's the difference between us.

499
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,760
Mr. Ji,

500
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,320
what about half an hour later?

501
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,880
The promotional film is about to start shooting.

502
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,920
The photography team would like to invite you

503
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,640
to have a look.

504
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,600
In case you are not satisfied with

505
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,680
the effect after the film is made?

506
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,480
Who is the model for this shoot?

507
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,280
Sida?

508
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Recently, he's been gaining momentum

509
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
in the fashion circle,

510
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,240
So I invited him here to take a photo.

511
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,320
I got it.

512
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,120
Will his agent follow us?

513
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
I think so.

514
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,640
The ghost is haunting me.

515
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,160
I really like to make trouble

516
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,000
for myself,

517
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,360
Let's go.

518
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,440
Sida?

519
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,040
Your eyes are too blurry.

520
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,920
This group of photos shows sweetness,

521
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,920
and you need to show deep love

522
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,320
in your eyes.

523
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,160
Love, understand?

524
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,800
He has a slow personality,

525
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,720
maybe a little nervous,

526
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,960
Give him some time.

527
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,680
Hurry up.

528
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,880
I have a heavy task today,

529
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,040
and I still have a lot of photos to take.

530
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,440
Okay, I'll talk to him.

531
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,200
Excuse me,

532
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,800
okay? No need. Let me

533
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,040
have a look.

534
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,120
Sida

535
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,880
What do you think? Are you nervous?

536
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,600
Relax, relax, relax.

537
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,480
You need to relax.

538
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,560
If you don't relax,

539
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,640
We can't finish it.

540
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,080
Yes.

541
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,960
If he wants to say love,

542
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,640
just think about it,

543
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,000
Do you have a girl you like?

544
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,200
Even though I know that

545
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,280
you have that obstacle?

546
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,760
But it doesn't matter.

547
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,280
You're an actor. If you want to imagine,

548
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,360
you can use that camera,

549
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,000
And think of it

550
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,280
as the girl you like,

551
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,200
And when you look at it,

552
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,560
you smile sweetly.

553
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,440
Is that okay?

554
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,080
Can you imagine it?

555
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,800
Yes, that's it.

556
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,040
Good, good, good.

557
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,080
That's right.

558
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,880
That's what it feels like.

559
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,320
Excuse me, agent.

560
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,160
Let's do it again.

561
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,040
Two more.

562
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,520
Nice.

563
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,640
-Smile. -That's the look in

564
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,480
your eyes.

565
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,120
Hold on.

566
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,880
By the way,

567
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,880
Let's have two more.

568
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,080
Okay.

569
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,960
That's great.

570
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
A little more over here.

571
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,040
Give me a little more light,

572
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,680
Okay,

573
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,840
You can do it.

574
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,080
Happy,

575
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,200
Okay.

576
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,720
Okay. Hold on.

577
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,600
Okay.

578
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,160
This way.

579
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,240
Why are you here?

580
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,120
As the president of Wing Fashion,

581
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,800
I'm here to watch artists shoot promotional videos,

582
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,280
Is there anything you can't do?

583
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,880
Why is Mr. Ji here in person?

584
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,960
I'm so sorry.

585
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,040
You are so busy,

586
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,880
yet you still come to see Sida take photos,

587
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,600
It's really hard.

588
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,400
Thank you.

589
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,880
It can be seen that Mr. Ji attaches great importance to it.

590
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,280
As an artist,

591
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,400
thank you.

592
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,800
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

593
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,080
What are you doing now?

594
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,080
You are the boss of Yi Fashion,

595
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,120
so the people next to you

596
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,680
misunderstand that we are close.

597
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,240
It's good for my artist.

598
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,160
In the future, in the fashion circle,

599
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,520
can Sida be like a duck to water?

600
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
It seems that Mr. Ji

601
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,920
is really so close

602
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,440
to that woman.

603
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,080
Then they must be in love.

604
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
Sida, why are you in such a daze?

605
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,920
Get ready to take the next group,

606
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,920
the theme is anger,

607
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,360
No way.

608
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,400
I don't think I'm in a good state again.

609
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,280
I'll go over there.

610
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,240
If you really want to help him,

611
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,280
just stay here.

612
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,360
What do you mean?

613
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,120
That's right. That's the look.

614
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,600
You don't need to do anything.

615
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Just cooperate with me.

616
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,440
That's great.

617
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,800
It's perfect.

618
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,560
-Hold on. -Good.

619
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
Hand.

620
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,080
That's right.

621
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,600
That's right.

622
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,240
It's perfect.

623
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,360
Yeah, that's it. Okay,

624
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
hold on. Good.

625
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,600
Okay.

626
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,920
Okay,

627
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,480
Very good.

628
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,200
One more time.

629
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,320
Keep it up.

630
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Okay, great.

631
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Okay, for the next topic,

632
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,560
we can just bear with each other

633
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,160
a little longer.

634
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,600
Okay. The next theme is sadness. You need to

635
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,360
… Yes, yes, yes. That's

636
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,680
it.

637
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,600
keep

638
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,840
-Give me an

639
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,360
angle. -Okay.

640
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,680
He's in good condition.

641
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,720
Very good, very good.

642
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,160
Don't stick it so close.

643
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,080
Stay away from me.

644
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,680
Very good.

645
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,880
Two more.

646
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,360
Okay. Keep it up.

647
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,800
Very good.

648
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,520
-Yeah, a little more sideways. -Okay, let's

649
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,080
call it a day.

650
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,680
The effect has been achieved.

651
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,520
Let's call it a day.

652
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,840
So soon?

653
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,840
He has a strong understanding

654
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,760
of your artist

655
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,800
and is very expressive.

656
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,600
I think highly of him.

657
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,480
You have a bright future ahead of you.

658
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,480
Thank you.

659
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,720
Sida, come here.

660
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,320
Mr. Andy,

661
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,920
He's a big shot in the photography industry.

662
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,840
He rarely praises people,

663
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,880
Thank you, mentor.

664
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,600
-Thank you. -You're welcome. Come

665
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,640
on!

666
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,640
Thank you for your hard work today.

667
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,440
-Thank you. -Thank you, Mr.

668
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,840
Ji.

669
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,800
Your love

670
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,520
is too blatant.

671
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,040
I just don't want him

672
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,560
to delay the construction period.

673
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,080
What should we do then?

674
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,160
Have you ever heard of it,

675
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,280
be jealous of

676
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,080
Is it the best catalyst?

677
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,760
What's wrong?

678
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,920
I'm tired.

679
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,840
I'm not tired

680
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,840
It's just that

681
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,720
you don't have your shoot today,

682
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,600
Why are you here?

683
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm here to see you, aren't I?

684
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,920
Look at you.

685
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
-Call me sister. -Hello,

686
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,040
sister.

687
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,760
Mr. Ji,

688
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,680
you're here too.

689
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,120
That's right.

690
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,800
If he says he wants to treat us to dinner,

691
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,600
you should come with him.

692
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,240
I never said

693
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,440
I would treat you to dinner.

694
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,280
Didn't you say

695
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,560
you wanted to hug your thighs?

696
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,400
Sida will depend on him from now on.

697
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,160
Don't forget.

698
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,160
Yes.

699
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,680
I forgot about it.

700
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,960
Mr. Ji,

701
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,440
thank you for taking good care

702
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,160
of Sida all the time?

703
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,920
How about this?

704
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,200
I'll treat you to a meal,

705
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,560
Take it as a thank-you banquet.

706
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,800
Do me a favor.

707
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,600
No need to thank me.

708
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,360
I don't like to owe people

709
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,480
favors the most.

710
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,240
Okay.

711
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,480
I'll choose

712
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,640
the restaurant. That's good.

713
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Anyway, Sida has a lot of work now,

714
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,240
and I'm rich,

715
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,920
It's up to you.

716
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,680
You did it on purpose.

717
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,040
Is it expensive to choose

718
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,040
such an expensive restaurant?

719
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,480
I think it's okay.

720
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,720
I used to come here a lot.

721
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,840
Besides,

722
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,560
didn't anyone say,

723
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,600
Are you rich?

724
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,800
Order,

725
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,680
Okay,

726
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,520
I want a vegetable salad.

727
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,440
I don't want any sauce.

728
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,240
Another bottle of

729
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,040
Paris Flower. Salad only?

730
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,440
Won't you be hungry tonight?

731
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,600
Would you like some meat

732
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,560
or staple food?

733
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,680
I usually eat very lightly,

734
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,120
and I don't eat much meat,

735
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,000
And starch,

736
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,200
in fact, I've always disapproved

737
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,320
of you models,

738
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,280
by dieting to

739
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,400
stay in shape,

740
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,680
It's not healthy.

741
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,920
Besides, you are already very thin.

742
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,240
There's no need to be so hard on yourself.

743
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,680
Excessive dieting

744
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,560
is morbid.

745
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,440
I don't usually

746
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,240
go on a diet.

747
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,800
And my usual eating habits

748
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,520
Pretty good

749
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,560
It's healthy.

750
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,560
But unlike some people,

751
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,400
it's late at night,

752
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,640
And some supper.

753
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,200
The fat on the belly

754
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,320
is almost like a swimming ring.

755
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,360
What's wrong with not controlling

756
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,480
the fat on your stomach?

757
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,320
Did you eat your rice?

758
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,800
This man is

759
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,040
really nosy,

760
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,280
Then drink less.

761
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,320
I can't hold it.

762
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,000
I want a German pig's foot,

763
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,920
as fat as you want.

764
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,680
Thank you.

765
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,480
Okay,

766
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,320
I'll have one, too.

767
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,600
It's as fat as you want.

768
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,200
I like meat very much.

769
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,960
Order

770
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Cattle thymus,

771
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,240
French snail,

772
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,120
With a bottle

773
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,240
of Romanikandi,

774
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,840
Okay, please wait a moment.

775
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,400
President Ji

776
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,640
You're welcome.

777
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,280
If you see that I'm going to treat you,

778
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,720
you should pay as much as you want,

779
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,760
I won't lower my food requirements

780
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,920
because of you.

781
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,680
All right, all right. That's great.

782
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
Didn't you say

783
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,960
you don't eat meat?

784
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,960
Let's indulge ourselves once in a while.

785
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,200
Actually, I'm a foodie.

786
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,360
Don't eat so much

787
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,560
if you have a bad stomach. It's okay.

788
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,240
I need to go to the washroom.

789
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm going to the bathroom, too.

790
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,640
Are you okay?

791
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,840
Why did you suddenly vomit?

792
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,920
After years of dieting and losing weight,

793
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,280
I've fallen into trouble.

794
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,400
I can't hold anything greasy

795
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,480
in my stomach,

796
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,880
I used to induce vomiting,

797
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,960
but now,

798
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,720
The digestive system becomes inertia and vomits

799
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,600
after eating it.

800
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,960
I called you just now.

801
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Don't eat indiscriminately.

802
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,840
Don't force yourself if you can't eat it.

803
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,600
I just want to eat it all of a sudden.

804
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,680
Why are you so fierce?

805
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,560
I'll feel better if I vomit clean.

806
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,040
It's okay.

807
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,360
Really?

808
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,560
Let's go.

809
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,000
It's okay.

810
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,920
Let's go.

811
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,080
You don't need to help me.

812
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,880
I'm not drunk. I … I'm going back to

813
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,760
sleep.

814
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,480
You can leave now.

815
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,920
I'm not that drunk.

816
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,720
Okay, okay. You can walk by yourself.

817
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,120
Sida, help me. No,

818
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,440
I'm not drunk.

819
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,840
I'm exhausted. I can still walk.

820
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,960
You can do it.

821
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,880
Be careful.

822
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,080
Don't be so nervous about me,

823
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,680
okay?

824
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,120
I'm not drunk at all.

825
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,520
I'm fine.

826
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,720
Is it comfortable?

827
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,960
It's comfortable.

828
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,400
Fei Fei'er, don't get me wrong.

829
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,800
She didn't misunderstand just now.

830
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,520
No misunderstanding.

831
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,880
You're so drunk.

832
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,760
Will anything happen tonight?

833
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,000
Well,

834
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,000
Tonight,

835
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,320
I'll stay with Ruonan.

836
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,320
You can go first.

837
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,120
Okay.

838
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,880
No way.

839
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,840
I'm so drunk,

840
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,120
I have to stay and take care of her.

841
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,400
Brother,

842
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
Brother, are you asleep?

843
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,160
I'm not drunk.

844
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,360
Now that you're popular,

845
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,200
you're playing the big game,

846
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
When I get into trouble everywhere,

847
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,280
when am I not the one to solve it?

848
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,400
I'm telling you,

849
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,080
I'm your agent.

850
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm not your nanny.

851
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,520
In your eyes, you only care about work,

852
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,560
and gain and loss of benefits.

853
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
So you are destined to be unloved.

854
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,200
That's why Lin Huan left you.

855
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,480
Wash them all off

856
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
after you change them, you hear me?

857
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,840
Did you hear that?

858
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,440
Brother,

859
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,640
Your sleepwalking disease is so serious,

860
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,920
will you do anything too much

861
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,480
to Ruonan?

862
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,560
Don't worry,

863
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,240
even if I have sleepwalking,

864
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,160
I also have moral integrity.

865
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,400
A person with good taste,

866
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,720
good taste,

867
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,640
You should give this house

868
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,000
to Ruonan.

869
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,280
Just move out.

870
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,520
Why?

871
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,600
I rented this house.

872
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,000
The lease hasn't arrived yet.

873
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,320
Who said I wouldn't move?

874
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,440
How about this?

875
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,720
Let's rent one.

876
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,640
I didn't spend a penny of

877
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,600
the money I usually earn.

878
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,640
Pay the rent.

879
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,680
It should be fine.

880
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,200
Why should I live with you?

881
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,640
It's not about the money.

882
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,600
If you don't leave, I won't leave either.

883
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,000
I'll stay in this bed.

884
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,520
I … I'll just stay here.

885
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,440
My goal

886
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,120
is not to be alone,

887
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,320
It's this house.

888
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,920
What's so good about this house?

889
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,920
Why?

890
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,320
That's because

891
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,800
there are

892
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,760
memories of me and my ex-girlfriend here.

893
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,160
This is extraordinary to me.

894
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,720
That's why

895
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,080
I have to protect this house.

896
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,000
Keep our memories.

897
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,280
Do you understand?

898
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,360
So,

899
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,080
I thought

900
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,840
you all have someone

901
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,000
you can't forget.

902
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,080
Me too.

903
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,680
No one can take her place

904
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,520
in my heart,

905
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,880
So don't worry.

906
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,960
I can't fall in love with Dugu Ruonan,

907
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,320
let alone

908
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,560
any woman,

909
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,480
Okay.

910
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,080
Ji Mo and I

911
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,040
are definitely from the Chu River and Han Realm.

912
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,440
They're clearly divided,

913
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,400
and they won't cross the line by half a step.

914
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,560
What's so dangerous about that?

915
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,200
I'm not afraid that you'll be in danger.

916
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,040
I was afraid that Ji Mo would be in danger.

917
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,520
Fei'er, don't worry.

918
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,800
Ji Mo is very safe.

919
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
It won't be dangerous.

920
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,720
Why do kids eavesdrop when adults are talking?

921
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,920
Come on.

922
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,320
How do you know it's safe?

923
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,880
Yeah. How do you know?

924
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,600
Ji Mo

925
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,320
might not like girls,

926
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,840
Does he like men?

927
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,480
What did he do

928
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,600
to you last night?

929
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,080
No,

930
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,520
it's not what you think.

931
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,920
That's right,

932
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,160
that's right,

933
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,240
He's safe on that side.

934
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,560
But,

935
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,920
His

936
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
On the other hand,

937
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,800
there is a problem. What is it?

938
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,920
Make it clear.

939
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,600
I can't.

940
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,720
He said it was a secret,

941
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,120
It's better than my communication disorder.

942
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,520
There are more serious problems.

943
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,600
Anyway, he just

944
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,280
won't have any feelings

945
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,200
for me,

946
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,240
I don't have any feelings for you either.

947
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,000
So what's the problem

948
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,320
with you?

949
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,240
I'm so pissed off.

950
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,840
What exactly did Ji Mo tell you?

951
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,760
You can fool Chen Fei'er,

952
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,080
but you can't fool me.

953
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,560
You promised me.

954
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,320
You can't hide anything from me.

955
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,840
Sis,

956
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,040
Why do you care so much about me?

957
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,440
Because he's my roommate,

958
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,160
of course I have to care about him.

959
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,800
If there's something

960
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,880
serious wrong with him,

961
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,320
Like psychopaths or something,

962
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,720
wouldn't I be in danger?

963
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,880
Of course I need to take precautions.

964
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,000
Hurry up.

965
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:26,880
Hurry up.

966
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,320
He's just

967
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,320
an ex-girlfriend who used to live here.

968
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,760
He stayed,

969
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,640
just because

970
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,200
his ex-girlfriend used to live here.

971
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,160
I think I still love her deeply.

972
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,040
He said,

973
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,520
from now on, he won't fall in love

974
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,240
with any other girl.

975
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
I think,

976
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,600
in the last relationship,

977
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,320
It's quite traumatic for him.

978
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,200
That's it.

979
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,560
Yes.

980
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,040
Zihao.

981
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,560
You're awake.

982
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,640
I didn't expect that

983
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,040
the first person I saw was you,

984
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,160
Dugu Ruonan asked you to come, right?

985
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,760
If Shengnan asked me to come here,

986
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,480
I'm no longer

987
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,680
her assistant.

988
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,000
She fired you?

989
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,760
No, it's not that I was fired by her.

990
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,600
The company demoted her.

991
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,960
About you,

992
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,520
the company is very angry,

993
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,960
I won't let her be

994
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,320
the former Director of Brokerage anymore.

995
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,840
Now I'm taking over her position.

996
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,720
She took over all her

997
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,760
business and entertainers,

998
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,760
Actually, she's not to blame for the car accident.

999
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,080
If I had listened to her earlier,

1000
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,640
I wouldn't have

1001
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,760
ended up like this,

1002
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,160
When I'm discharged from the hospital,

1003
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,200
I'll explain everything

1004
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,400
to the company myself,

1005
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,320
I didn't expect that

1006
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,920
you would speak for her.

1007
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,720
Although I'm in a coma,

1008
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,200
I'm conscious.

1009
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,200
During this period of time,

1010
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,640
I can always hear Dugu Ruonan

1011
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,800
nagging in my ear,

1012
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,800
It's all your illusion.

1013
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,760
How could she come to see you?
