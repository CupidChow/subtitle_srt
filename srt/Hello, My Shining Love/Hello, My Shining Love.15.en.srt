1
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,360
Tell me honestly.

2
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
Have you ever had feelings for me?

3
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,880
Have you ever liked me?

4
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,840
If not,

5
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,200
please don't

6
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,120
come to me again.

7
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,080
Don't give me any more hope.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
Stop being nice to me.

9
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,880
Especially at a time like this,

10
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,880
when I'm very vulnerable.

11
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,000
If you haven't made up your mind,

12
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,160
please don't follow me anymore.

13
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,680
Hello, boss.

14
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,520
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

15
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,560
At two o'clock in the afternoon,

16
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,960
I'll talk to you in my office.

17
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,760
Okay, see you this afternoon.

18
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,440
Hello.

19
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,360
Have a seat early.

20
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,280
I brought you here today,

21
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,280
mainly to talk about

22
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,680
the singer competition,

23
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm sorry,

24
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,920
boss. It's all my fault.

25
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,600
It's my decision to quit.

26
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,040
It has nothing to do

27
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,200
with Ruonan.

28
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,320
I'm willing to take all the responsibility.

29
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,560
You take the responsibility.

30
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,040
How will you bear it?

31
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,200
For all the losses of the company,

32
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,120
I will compensate for them.

33
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,480
Although I don't have any money yet,

34
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,320
I will try my best to make money,

35
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,280
Give it back to the company,

36
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,840
please don't make things difficult for Ruonan,

37
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,360
Ruonan,

38
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,520
what do you think?

39
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,440
I will fulfill my promise,

40
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,880
take the blame and resign.

41
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,880
That's right.

42
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,440
Star dropped out,

43
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm not an artist.

44
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,760
That's what I should do,

45
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,920
but from the beginning,

46
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,280
I have no hope.

47
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,000
That's why I'm not disappointed.

48
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
The company has sent a message regarding

49
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Star's withdrawal from the competition,

50
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,400
Let's just say that Star temporarily

51
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,840
withdrew from the competition

52
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,440
because of damaged vocal cords.

53
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,760
That's it.

54
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,040
Don't mention it again.

55
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
The company won't

56
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,640
hold you accountable.

57
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,880
Thank you, boss.

58
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,840
You don't need to thank me.

59
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,960
You should thank

60
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,440
the sponsors of this competition,

61
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,320
The person in charge of Ruiqi Group

62
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,600
watched the video of your preliminary match,

63
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,640
I'm very optimistic

64
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,520
about the decision,

65
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,160
Sponsored your single album,

66
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
invited you and Ruonan

67
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,880
to Yunnan to shoot music videos.

68
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,360
Really?

69
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,240
I don't understand either.

70
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,440
With so many young artists,

71
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,560
why do they take a fancy

72
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,880
to a newcomer like you who has no background?

73
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,280
But it's all true.

74
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,160
Silly boy.

75
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,960
You're such a fool.

76
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,440
Ruo Nan

77
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,040
Why don't you say anything?

78
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,320
Boss,

79
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,080
about the trip to Yunnan,

80
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,040
I need time to think about it.

81
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,760
Besides,

82
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,400
I also need to think about it.

83
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,160
Will you continue

84
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,120
to act as Sida's agent

85
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,800
Sis,

86
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,080
Sis,

87
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,160
Don't call me sister.

88
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,600
You don't want me anymore, do you?

89
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,560
I told you I'd reconsider.

90
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,520
Sis, don't do this, okay?

91
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,840
I know I was wrong.

92
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,240
I really know I was wrong, sister.

93
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,000
Let go!

94
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,520
Sister, I know I was wrong.

95
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Can you not leave?

96
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,240
As long as you don't leave,

97
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,360
I can change anything.

98
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,880
Didn't you say

99
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,160
you wouldn't abandon me?

100
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,240
I won't abandon my artist.

101
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,440
But with your current behavior

102
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,400
and mentality,

103
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,520
I'm no longer fit

104
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,440
to be an artist.

105
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,160
Why don't you act like an artist,

106
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,240
Sis,

107
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,320
Sis,

108
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,560
Sis, can you get out of the car

109
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,320
and let me explain?

110
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,240
Sis,

111
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,760
Sis,

112
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,400
Sis, let me explain. Sis,

113
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,440
I won't be wrong again.

114
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,360
Sis,

115
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,240
Sis,

116
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,840
Sister, let me explain.

117
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,400
Why are you chasing the car?

118
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,840
I... I don't want you to leave.

119
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,000
Who are you now?

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,120
Are you saying that

121
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,640
you're an artist?

122
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,040
Yes.

123
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,320
As an artist,

124
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,600
you can only be my artist

125
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,960
in the future.

126
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,440
Don't you have any more thoughts?

127
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,040
Yes,

128
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,240
as long as you can stay,

129
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,440
You can get in the car

130
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,720
with anything.

131
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,080
Where are you going?

132
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,120
Pack your luggage and go to Yunnan,

133
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,080
go out and work hard,

134
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,880
Focus on your work.

135
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,040
I won't think about anything else.

136
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,680
Why did you bring

137
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,480
so much instant noodles?

138
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,200
I have a bad stomach.

139
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,040
If I can't get used to the food over there,

140
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,360
I'll go crazy.

141
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,840
Are you silly?

142
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,520
There are a lot of restaurants over there.

143
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,240
Okay?

144
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,360
You're the one, aren't you?

145
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,680
Don't you need to spend money at the restaurant over there?

146
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,960
Before Sida has no fire,

147
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,640
can I afford it?

148
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm going to live frugally.

149
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,440
The card I gave you before,

150
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,760
Don't you still have a lot of money?

151
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,520
Use it.

152
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,400
If you give me that card,

153
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,680
it won't be a last resort,

154
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,960
I won't move.

155
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,040
Take it as

156
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,320
my talisman now.

157
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,560
At least you have some confidence.

158
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,360
Then someone's thoughts

159
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,720
will be in vain.

160
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,440
What? Didn't you

161
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,400
tell me that the card

162
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,880
was your ex-boyfriend's break-up fee?

163
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
I wasn't going to

164
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
tell you,

165
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,320
But Ali told me,

166
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,960
he thinks Ji Mo

167
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,000
is sincere to you.

168
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,400
You know me too.

169
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,080
The standard definition of love

170
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,680
is that two people like each other,

171
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,120
Right?

172
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,960
As long as you like it, there are no principles.

173
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
I don't have a position.

174
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,880
So that card belongs to Ji Mo,

175
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,280
Yes.

176
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,280
He's afraid that if he gives it to you,

177
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,960
will you not want it?

178
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,040
So he asked me to give it to you.

179
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,280
At first, I was worried, too,

180
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,800
that I didn't come for your house.

181
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,920
But then I thought about it,

182
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,520
he could have waited

183
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,480
until you went bankrupt,

184
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,960
Then I'll buy the house back.

185
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,760
So in his heart,

186
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,040
you are more important than the house?

187
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,600
Men,

188
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,400
Right?

189
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,680
They were supposed to

190
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,880
get to know each other later than women.

191
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,000
She's not as careful and sensitive

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,200
as a woman,

193
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,400
Men

194
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,760
are male chromosomes,

195
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,400
Women

196
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,120
are female chromosomes.

197
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,640
X has thousands of genes,

198
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,320
while Y has thousands of genes?

199
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,120
There are only a few dozen.

200
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,000
So it's understandable that

201
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,400
men are slow to respond.

202
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,680
Why are you so serious with them?

203
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

204
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,400
Are you talking about genetic differences,

205
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,680
or the fact that Ji Mo gave you the card?

206
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
About the card,

207
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,360
what difference does it make

208
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,600
if I told you earlier and later?

209
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,680
If you like him,

210
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,920
you should go to him, right?

211
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,760
Right? Find him.

212
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,520
Or,

213
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,880
before you go out,

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll ask him out for you.

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,120
No, thank you.

216
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,920
What are you doing?

217
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,480
Why?

218
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,720
Don't you like him?

219
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,160
I do like him,

220
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,400
but I can't accept

221
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,920
this kind of unprincipled love,

222
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,840
When a woman

223
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,040
turns 25,

224
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,360
Love will gradually become rational.

225
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,400
When I was young,

226
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,840
as long as I was worried about whether I liked it or not,

227
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,280
Now that you're old,

228
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,960
you have to worry,

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,400
In the process of liking,

230
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
whether it's equal or not.

231
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,160
I can't let myself

232
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,120
fall into that kind of situation,

233
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,440
We have to wait for the other party to respond.

234
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
In a relationship,

235
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,800
I can't stand the process

236
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,840
of waiting,

237
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,360
If he didn't come to me,

238
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,160
it only means that

239
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,040
he doesn't like me enough,

240
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,920
As rational people like you,

241
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,880
when you fall in love,

242
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,240
I'm so tired.

243
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
You keep your mouth shut,

244
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,320
and you keep mumbling when you do things,

245
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,800
Really?

246
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,720
Boring,

247
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,960
no matter how much you like someone,

248
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,040
The one you love the most,

249
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,040
will always be yourself.

250
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,840
seem

251
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
It makes sense.

252
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,360
Let's go, sister.

253
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,000
Mr. Ji,

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,040
this is the design

255
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,840
of Xingaoding series,

256
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,920
Based on the content of the previous meeting,

257
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,880
we will invite a few

258
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,120
international fashion designers,

259
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,240
Designed by them personally,

260
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,920
the joint cooperation model of the new series,

261
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,440
This is their information and list.

262
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,400
Please have a look.

263
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,600
The fabrics and cutting methods

264
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,680
used by these designers,

265
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,280
They all lack originality.

266
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,120
You haven't been innovative for a long time.

267
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
But these clothing masters

268
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,960
all have high status in the industry.

269
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,480
Besides,

270
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,720
they are very enthusiastic

271
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,840
about this joint cooperation.

272
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,400
Design is the soul of a brand,

273
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,840
the high-quality products we make,

274
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,960
Not only does it have to be eye-catching,

275
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,600
but more importantly,

276
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,120
To improve its design concept,

277
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,600
to ignite the public's

278
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,160
yearning for beauty and fashion,

279
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,280
This is what Yi Fashion

280
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,960
should do. Good

281
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,120
Mr. Ji.

282
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,200
We'll redraw up

283
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
the list of designers.

284
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,680
Mr. Ji,

285
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,320
aren't you just a designer?

286
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,480
Is it necessary

287
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
to go to Yunnan in person?

288
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,280
According to my investigation,

289
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,080
Wei Censhu

290
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,320
values his work very much.

291
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,840
To avoid over-commercialization,

292
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,360
keep the design pure.

293
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,280
He was able to turn down invitations

294
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,440
from a number of business titans,

295
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,320
So I invited him out of the mountain.

296
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,520
It's not easy.

297
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,520
So to show my sincerity

298
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,280
and respect.

299
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,840
I need to go there myself.

300
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
You've been working all this time,

301
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,160
so you should rest for a few days.

302
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,040
I'm satisfied with my current condition.

303
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,280
I'm too tired

304
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,120
to think about anything else.

305
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,320
Book a flight

306
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,240
to Dali for me,

307
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,800
I want

308
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,080
the nearest one.

309
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,240
Sir, your room card and ID card.

310
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Have a nice stay.

311
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,040
Okay. Thank you

312
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,080
Sis,

313
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,000
What do you think of

314
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,040
my music video this morning?

315
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,160
It's good.

316
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,400
Very good.

317
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,160
Come on!

318
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,319
Thank you, mentor.

319
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,280
Come on,

320
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,800
Everyone, please have a seat.

321
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,040
-Sit down. -Tie-dye

322
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
technique,

323
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,560
It inherits the most traditional sewing method,

324
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,080
stitch by stitch.

325
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,960
And what you see here,

326
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,320
the colored finished product,

327
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,760
This dyeing technique

328
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,720
also uses

329
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,600
the most traditional plant dyeing method

330
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,120
of Bai nationality,

331
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,280
So from sewing and dyeing,

332
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,160
to rinsing and drying.

333
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,760
It can be said that every craft

334
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,280
is very exquisite.

335
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,600
What about the tie-dyeing process of Bai clan?

336
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,280
It was founded in Han Dynasty

337
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,960
and passed down from generation to generation.

338
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,200
It continues to this day.

339
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,280
So it can be said that

340
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,840
it is a real national

341
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,040
intangible cultural heritage,

342
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,200
You can have a try.

343
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,000
Mr. Wei.

344
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,920
I've heard a lot about you.

345
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,120
Mr. Ji, you're welcome.

346
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,640
To meet the leading figures

347
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,520
in today's fashion industry,

348
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,600
It's my pleasure.

349
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,600
Your previous dress series,

350
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,760
at that time,

351
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,800
left a very deep impression on me.

352
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,400
Now, with such

353
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,320
excellent works,

354
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,040
It's rare now.

355
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,720
You flatter me.

356
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,360
I'm sure

357
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,560
you've received my email,

358
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,120
I'll cut to the chase.

359
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,120
Where's Yi Fashion?

360
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,360
Recently, a new season of

361
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
designer co-branded models will be launched,

362
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
And what about your work?

363
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,400
It combines the tie-dyeing skills of the Bai nationality,

364
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,200
elegant and comfortable,

365
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,360
It coincides with

366
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,200
Yi Fashion's temperament.

367
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,640
So this time,

368
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,480
I want to invite you

369
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,600
to participate in the design,

370
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,360
Mr. Ji may not know,

371
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,040
but I've been out of the fashion industry

372
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,720
for a long time.

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,040
As you can see,

374
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,120
what about me now,

375
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,440
They only focus on

376
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,960
the promotion and inheritance

377
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,920
of the Bai tie-dye culture.

378
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
Although the previous design of Yi Fashion,

379
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,280
I once admired it

380
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,000
very much.

381
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,160
But I'm sorry,

382
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,440
it can't be the reason

383
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,040
for me to return,

384
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,080
What about your retirement?

385
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,320
I've heard about it, too.

386
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,200
But I believe,

387
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,640
as long as you have enough motivation,

388
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,080
You won't give up your job

389
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,360
as a designer,

390
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,640
Maybe our work

391
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,560
is not attractive.

392
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,960
Or do you have

393
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,760
any other requirements?

394
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,120
Don't get me wrong.

395
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,800
I'm not making

396
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,240
any demands or demands,

397
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,120
I just.

398
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,480
I just

399
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,680
don't want to draw.

400
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,360
Mr. Wei.

401
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,360
Do you have something to hide?

402
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,040
Well,

403
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,400
then I might as well get straight to the point,

404
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,600
A friend did

405
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,360
come to me before,

406
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,400
He asked me not to agree

407
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,720
to cooperate with Yi Fashion,

408
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,240
Your friend,

409
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,400
may I ask you,

410
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,280
Are you a competitor of Yi Fashion?

411
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,080
This friend helped me

412
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,520
when I was in the most difficult time.

413
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,560
So I'm sorry.

414
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,480
I can't tell you

415
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,280
his name,

416
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,960
If that's the case,

417
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,360
I won't give you a hard time.

418
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,200
This cooperation didn't work out.

419
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
We look forward to the success of our cooperation next time.

420
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,720
Hope.

421
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,600
Tell me,

422
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,560
To target him,

423
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,720
so that he can pay his debts.

424
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,160
That's all for now.

425
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,600
Calm down.

426
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,080
Okay?

427
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,920
Shut up!

428
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,440
It's you.

429
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,840
Last time you said I had anxiety disorder,

430
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,120
after my wife saw my case,

431
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,080
You have to divorce me.

432
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,400
He said I was useless.

433
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,120
And he's sick.

434
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,840
Psycho.

435
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,640
I can't live a better life now.

436
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,600
You,

437
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,560
You have to

438
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,120
give me an explanation today.

439
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,760
Calm down.

440
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,440
Mr. Zhang,

441
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,800
what about your previous case?

442
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,000
It's based on

443
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,600
your psychological test,

444
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
That's in line with science.

445
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,520
It can't be wrong. I don't care

446
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,680
if you're scientific or not.

447
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,760
You have to change my case

448
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,640
today. Otherwise,

449
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,240
Otherwise, you'll compensate me for a wife.

450
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,680
It's impossible to change the case.

451
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,480
That's against my

452
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,600
professional ethics, okay?

453
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
But let me tell you,

454
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,760
your anxiety disorder

455
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,720
can be treated.

456
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,320
Really?

457
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,880
Let me tell you,

458
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
if you mention anxiety again,

459
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
Try these three words.

460
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,680
Try it.

461
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,880
-Mr. Zhang. -Mr. Zhang, calm down. Really?

462
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,680
I'm telling you,

463
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,320
Your condition is very serious,

464
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,720
and it's pathological anxiety,

465
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,440
But you can also treat it.

466
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,080
Shut up!

467
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,640
Are you okay?

468
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,360
Are you okay?

469
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,040
-Are you okay? -Are you okay?

470
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,000
It's okay.

471
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,600
He's mine.

472
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,920
Come at me if you need anything.

473
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,800
Watch your position!

474
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,360
Come at me!

475
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,160
Go for her.

476
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,440
This way.

477
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,600
These people,

478
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,800
how dare they

479
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,000
attack you in front of me,

480
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,960
Do you think Chen Fei'er is easy to mess with?

481
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,720
Unexpectedly,

482
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,320
you care so much about me.

483
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,080
Of course.

484
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
If anything happens to you,

485
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,480
the money I hired you

486
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,640
will be wasted, won't it?

487
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,120
What are you

488
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,200
muttering about?

489
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,040
Nothing.

490
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,200
But you suddenly

491
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
came to see me today.

492
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,880
It's boring for me to be alone.

493
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,320
Ruonan went to Yunnan,

494
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
so the people I can find,

495
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,280
You're the only one.

496
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,320
Where did Ruonan go?

497
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,440
Dali, Yunnan,

498
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,040
right?

499
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,320
Ji Mo is also in Dali.

500
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,320
Really?

501
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,960
That's right.

502
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,800
Ji Mo, for the designer

503
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,440
of the new series,

504
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,840
I want to fly to Dali.

505
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,320
I think it's

506
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,760
at the Indig Hotel.

507
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,080
Ruonan is also in that hotel,

508
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,960
is that true?

509
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,200
Gosh,

510
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,800
they are destined to be together.

511
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,960
No, I have to tell Ji Mo

512
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,760
about this,

513
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,200
No way.

514
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,160
Not yet.

515
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,840
Why?

516
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,880
If they meet,

517
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,880
it means they are destined to be together.

518
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,960
If they don't have fate,

519
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,280
then fate won't let them

520
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,440
meet each other,

521
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,120
Got it.

522
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,160
Okay.

523
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,880
Sis,

524
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,080
You gave me a day off

525
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,120
all of a sudden.

526
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,360
Since I came to Yunnan,

527
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,480
I've been working.

528
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,360
I'll give you a day off today.

529
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,560
Combining work with rest,

530
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,320
in case your cash cow

531
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
is worn out.

532
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,680
What should I do?

533
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,320
Are you kidding me?

534
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,600
Where do you want to go?

535
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,440
You can go anywhere.

536
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
As long as I'm with you,

537
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,920
my mouth is so sweet.

538
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,760
Be careful

539
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,480
Are you not allowed to do it, sister?

540
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
My biggest wish,

541
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,120
is that you can become

542
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,160
a big hit soon.

543
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,840
So that I can count money

544
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,160
at home every day,

545
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,240
Can you do that?

546
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,440
I'll try my best.

547
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,600
Come on!

548
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,160
Don't you have any other

549
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,920
wishes?

550
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,600
There's nothing else but greed for money.

551
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,000
If I can meet him again,

552
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,840
I hope I can be brave.

553
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,880
Sis,

554
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,760
what wish did you make?

555
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,600
It's a wish that won't come true.

556
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,640
Sis,

557
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,640
There's a water seller over there.

558
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,600
I'm going to buy two bottles.

559
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,000
Don't run around.

560
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,720
I see.

561
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,520
It's so efficacious.

562
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,960
Ruo Nan

563
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,320
So efficacious.

564
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,240
I just told the wishing tree,

565
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,320
if I see you again,

566
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,480
I must be brave.

567
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,840
If I say this is a coincidence,

568
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,840
will you believe me?

569
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,280
Coincidentally,

570
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,080
I'm here to work.

571
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,600
I didn't know you were here.

572
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,640
I came to Yunnan to avoid you.

573
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,880
I didn't expect you

574
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,320
to appear in front of me

575
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,600
like an idol drama.

576
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,360
And now you're telling me,

577
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,360
it's a coincidence,

578
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,720
Even if you want to find an excuse,

579
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,320
could you please

580
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,520
find a better one?

581
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,960
I've always wanted to stay away from you.

582
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,560
I won't disturb your life.

583
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,160
This is the last thing

584
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,840
I can do for you,

585
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,160
If I knew you were here,

586
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,200
I wouldn't have come.

587
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,040
So,

588
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,840
I'm the one who thinks too much.

589
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,880
I shouldn't have treated you at all.

590
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,800
And you still have this

591
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,560
unrealistic fantasy.

592
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,720
Forget what I said

593
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
just now.

594
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,920
I will never say it again.

595
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,480
Such stupid words.

596
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,400
I'm sorry.

597
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,760
I'm the one who should be sorry.

598
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,080
I shouldn't have made a wish with the wishing tree,

599
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,280
it can only let us meet,

600
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,200
But it can't control our fate.

601
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,760
Maybe we should just

602
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,920
go our separate ways,

603
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,160
Don't ever see each other again.

604
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,480
I told him to leave but he really left.

605
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,040
You're usually not so obedient,

606
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,680
and you don't look back?

607
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Sida?

608
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,240
How could I forget him?

609
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,800
Stop chasing him!

610
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,880
I can't run anymore.

611
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,680
Oh my god!

612
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,760
Help me! Help me!

613
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,680
Help me!

614
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,120
My phone. Bad guys

615
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,280
are chasing me,

616
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,200
Help me!

617
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,120
There are bad guys after me.

618
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,320
Leave it alone,

619
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,400
Stop!

620
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,120
Hurry up!

621
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,000
Stop running!

622
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,800
Why didn't you answer the phone?

623
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,320
Excuse me,

624
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,200
have you seen

625
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
this boy,

626
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,520
No.

627
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,680
No, I haven't.

628
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,560
No, I haven't.

629
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,840
-Let's go. -Yes.

630
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,800
Excuse me,

631
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
have you seen

632
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,000
this boy before.

633
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,600
No.

634
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,840
No, I haven't.

635
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,520
Excuse me, have you

636
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,880
seen this boy before.

637
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,920
No.

638
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,880
Thank you.

639
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,480
Have you seen

640
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,280
this boy,

641
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,200
No,

642
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,080
thank you.

643
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,760
Sida,

644
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,920
where have you been?

645
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,440
I'm not Sida.

646
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,480
Well,

647
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,320
Isn't this my friend

648
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,400
Sida's phone?

649
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,320
I found this on the road.

650
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,320
I'm on my way.

651
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,280
Which way are you on,

652
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,360
I'm going to see you now.

653
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,880
I'm at No. 1 Street

654
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,560
and No. 2 Street in Gucheng.

655
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,040
Can you send me the location?

656
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,840
Hello.

657
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,600
Mr. He?

658
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,120
That's right.

659
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,760
This is his phone. Yes,

660
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,360
when you found it,

661
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,600
Did you see this boy?

662
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,920
I didn't see it.

663
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,800
Okay,

664
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,640
Thank you.

665
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,320
You're welcome.

666
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,080
Thank you.

667
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,880
What's wrong?

668
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,320
What happened?

669
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,680
Sida is missing.

670
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,280
If someone finds your phone,

671
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,480
will something happen to you?

672
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,640
Don't worry.

673
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,120
Maybe he has gone back.

674
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,920
Let me send you back first.

675
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,600
All right.

676
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,600
Where did they go?

677
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,640
Look around. Look around.

678
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,360
You guys,

679
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,360
Look over there.

680
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:15,960
Let's go.

681
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,360
I'm fine.

682
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,880
Are you okay, too?

683
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,240
Are you okay?

684
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,600
Don't pull me! Don't touch me!

685
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,120
I haven't introduced myself yet.

686
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,040
My name is Shen Qiansha.

687
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:11,840
What about you?

688
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,719
Tell me.

689
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,000
It's embarrassing for me.

690
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,920
My name is Sida,

691
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:22,960
Sida

692
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,639
Are you embarrassed?

693
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,600
What does it have to do with me?

694
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:25,920
Why did you

695
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,719
drag me away just now.

696
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,719
I was in an emergency,

697
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,199
and my mind was in a mess,

698
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,760
I just want someone to help me.

699
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,239
You just showed up.

700
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,320
Do you think it's a coincidence?

701
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,239
This is fate.

702
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,320
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

703
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,719
Why did you run away from the wedding?

704
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,719
My dad arranged a family marriage,

705
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,719
and asked me to marry

706
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,880
the son of a group boss

707
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,080
who I haven't even met a few times.

708
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,600
You said if you want to meet

709
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,360
someone you don't like,

710
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,440
If I have to marry you,

711
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,080
if you don't run away,

712
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,240
Let's not talk about this.

713
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,760
What about you?

714
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,680
What are you doing here?

715
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,440
Are you here to travel?

716
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,120
Why are you strolling here by yourself?

717
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,560
I came with my sister.

718
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,360
Later,

719
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,520
she met someone she likes.

720
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,160
So he abandoned me.

721
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,560
You mean your sister?

722
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,400
For the sake of the man I like,

723
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,480
I don't want you anymore.

724
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,800
Your family's condition,

725
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,400
isn't it much better than mine?

726
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,960
That's not my sister.

727
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,720
She's just

728
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,360
a few years older than me,

729
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,960
She always treats me as her brother.

730
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,760
Do you like your sister?

731
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,480
Yes.

732
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,600
It's just wishful

733
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,360
unrequited love.

734
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,120
Isn't it funny?

735
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,320
It's not funny.

736
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,720
Wishful unrequited love

737
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,880
is also called love.

738
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,160
Besides,

739
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,280
she doesn't like you now.

740
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,040
It doesn't mean

741
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,120
she won't like you in the future.

742
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,520
That's what love is all about.

743
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,760
One after the other.

744
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,600
There's no one who likes each other

745
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,560
in the first place.

746
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,000
Right?

747
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,480
I think you're right.

748
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,920
I have to go back to find her.

749
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,880
Sida?

750
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,040
Sida?

751
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,640
Do you want to hear

752
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,000
mature advice from a mature woman,

753
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,120
You,

754
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,760
Yes.

755
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,520
What you just said

756
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,760
makes sense.

757
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,640
Tell me,

758
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,680
do you know how to chase girls?

759
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,360
Don't you know

760
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,160
how to play hard to get?

761
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,480
There's a degree of relaxation,

762
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
and you've been

763
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,640
clinging to it. It's called stalking.

764
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
It's called harassment.

765
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,920
No,

766
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
It's called sexual harassment.

767
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,000
So serious?

768
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,840
Don't rush back.

769
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,160
Leave her alone for a few days.

770
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
Let her know

771
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,680
what it's like to lose you.

772
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,760
So that she can

773
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,800
cherish you more,

774
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,920
But,

775
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,080
where do I live?

776
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,680
We're strangers here.

777
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,920
Let me buy you a drink.

778
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,240
You can't drink it.

779
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,560
My sister doesn't allow me to drink.

780
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,480
Look at you.

781
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,040
Do you know why your sister

782
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
treats you as her brother?

783
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Just because you're too obedient,

784
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,320
have you ever heard of such a saying?

785
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,560
Men are not bad and women don't love you.

786
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,440
You're too good to be a good girl.

787
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,800
Yes, I have,

788
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
but you've said so much,

789
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,560
Isn't it because you want to drink?

790
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,680
Didn't you fall out of love?

791
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,800
People who are lovelorn must drink.

792
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Drinking is a necessary procedure for brokenhearted,

793
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,200
so you won't suffer when you're drunk.

794
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,640
Love

795
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,800
is like life,

796
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,520
Drinking is a grand funeral

797
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,400
for a lovelorn person.

798
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,360
To mourn the love

799
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,120
that has passed away,

800
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,560
This is the mature experience

801
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,680
of a mature woman,

802
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,320
What do you think?

803
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,720
This... This is too heavy.

804
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,880
Brokenhearted is not heavy,

805
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,680
brokenhearted is the most important in the world.

806
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,000
The most important thing is,

807
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,480
tell me. Do you want to drink?

808
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,960
Drink,

809
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,360
That's great.

810
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,120
Sida

811
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,720
Sida, wait for me.

812
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,880
This place is so beautiful.

813
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,480
Happy divorce.

814
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,880
Happy breakup,

815
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,800
after drinking too much,

816
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,440
Then you can forget everything.

817
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,440
Hey,

818
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,480
What are you doing?

819
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,480
You're lying.

820
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,120
What did I lie to you about?

821
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,280
After I drank the wine,

822
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,960
I didn't forget her.

823
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,400
Why do you miss her more?

824
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,720
Why are you

825
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,280
holding it?

826
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,520
I'll show you a show.

827
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,160
Watch it.

828
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,240
Don't blink,

829
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,920
Okay,

830
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,400
Three,

831
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,320
Two.

832
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,400
I … There are idiots.

833
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,360
Well,

834
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,760
It's really ugly.

835
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,040
I have uglier ones.

836
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,240
One,

837
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,160
Two,

838
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,640
Any more?

839
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,920
And …

840
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,040
And … You … Slow down. Slow down.

841
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,760
Be careful.

842
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,440
Feel it.

843
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:15,960
-Feel it. -Okay. Okay.

844
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,320
Come on.

845
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,080
Three,

846
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,600
Two.

847
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,680
Sida

848
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,080
Are you crazy?

849
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,160
You scared the hell out of me.

850
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,680
I thought you fell.

851
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,480
Haven't you seen it?

852
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,200
Resident Evil,

853
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,880
Zombies,

854
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,680
I haven't seen it.

855
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,160
I used to practice all kinds of training

856
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
many times,

857
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
Then have another one.

858
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,360
One more for you and one more for me.

859
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,800
Let me have another one.

860
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,560
Play another one for me.

861
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,880
Don't let me scare you down.

862
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,680
No, I won't.

863
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,960
You're so ugly.

864
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,240
You scared me.

865
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
Not as ugly as you were just now.

866
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,280
Yours is the ugliest,

867
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,920
but mine is fine.

868
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,440
Mine is very cute, okay?

869
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,560
Mine is much cuter than yours.

870
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,480
I can do this too.

871
00:39:59,480 --> 00:39:59,880
You do it.

872
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,240
I'm here.

873
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,200
By the way,

874
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,520
thank you for sending me back today.

875
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,520
You live here?

876
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,800
Actually, I was right.

877
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,440
I hope I won't meet you again.

878
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,080
I don't like coincidences.

879
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,880
Good night.

880
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,680
Hello,

881
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,480
Hello.

882
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,120
Why are you here?

883
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,920
Are you stalking me?

884
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,760
What are you thinking?

885
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,720
Who is this kind of person? Stop!

886
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,320
Mr. Ji,

887
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,480
I'm busy.

888
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,360
Okay?

889
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,680
What happened to Sida

890
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,120
is enough to give me a headache.

891
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,000
Please stop following me.

892
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,640
Please don't have

893
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,960
any delusions about me.

894
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,560
Because I don't have the time

895
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,880
and energy to guess

896
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
what's on your mind anymore?

897
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,320
No matter what you think,

898
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,640
it's just a coincidence.

899
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,520
I'm staying at this hotel too.

900
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,360
You don't believe me?

901
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,800
What a coincidence.

902
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,680
Ask the receptionist.

903
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,160
You don't believe me?

904
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,440
Ask the receptionist.

905
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,880
110?

906
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,120
I want to file a record.

907
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,240
My friend is missing.

908
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,960
Today,

909
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,200
What?

910
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,720
We can't file a case

911
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,680
in less than 24 hours.

912
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,600
What if he's in danger?

913
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,280
Okay,

914
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,320
thank you. Thank you.
