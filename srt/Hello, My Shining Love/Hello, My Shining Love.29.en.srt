1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,320
Because he is my opponent.

2
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,880
So I want to compete with him fairly.

3
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,080
I can't let Qiansha look down on me.

4
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,440
This time,

5
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,760
I want to win Star openly.

6
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,880
Shen Qian Yarn. She's fine.

7
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,800
Are you out of your mind?

8
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,960
Shen Qiansha is important.

9
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,240
Your career is more important.

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,440
My career

11
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,440
What you care about

12
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,520
Your own business.

13
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,800
You made me

14
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,480
To suppress Sindhi.

15
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,000
Is to

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,280
To deal with Dugu Ruuo Man?

17
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,800
Did you win?

18
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,280
I'm telling you,

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,720
People like you

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,800
I will never be able to defeat Dugu Ruuo.

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
Aren't you busy at work?

22
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,480
Why did you send me a video all of a sudden?

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,280
I've just finished some work.

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,600
And found something missing.

25
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,960
Think about it carefully.

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,960
Without you,

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,840
If you miss me, just say it.

28
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,080
Yes, I miss you.

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,840
I miss you too.

30
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,000
Alright

31
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,000
Then I'm done charging.

32
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,080
I'll get back to work.

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,040
Okay, I'll get back to work.

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,360
See you tonight.

35
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,400
hallucination

36
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,160
Are you hallucinating again?

37
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,880
I saw Su Xiao.

38
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,880
Don't scare me.

39
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,560
I'm a coward.

40
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,200
Isn't Su Xiao dead?

41
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,320
I think I see her.

42
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,160
I dreamed about her the other day.

43
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,520
I said goodbye to her in the dream.

44
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
I have really moved on.

45
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,320
But I don't know why.

46
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,560
Will happen again.

47
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
Are you and Ruonan happy now?

48
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,880
happiness

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,200
Very happy.

50
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,440
It's been a long time.

51
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,200
You're so happy.

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,560
I thought I had recovered.

53
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,240
But I don't know why.

54
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,960
Or will I?

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
And had hallucinations.

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,120
The illusion is lack of corresponding.

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,000
The perception of objective stimulation.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,040
It's often subjective.

59
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,760
Caused by

60
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,200
Maybe.

61
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
In your subconscious,

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,760
You're still upset.

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,200
What happened to Su Xiao back then

64
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,040
Then your new relationship

65
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,480
To stimulate your subjective experience.

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,760
So I had hallucinations.

67
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,800
I don't want to get hurt

68
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,720
And hurt Ruo Man.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,040
It's not fair to her.

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,000
And the two of us

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,680
Is in love.

72
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,760
I should be responsible for her.

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,920
I have to keep

74
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,320
To love her with a healthy heart.

75
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,280
Give me the medicine.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,440
I've told you so many times.

77
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,480
The medicine is just to alleviate your symptoms.

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,120
If you want to be cured,

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,680
You still have to open your heart.

80
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,320
It takes time and process.

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,840
Although I don't know,

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,000
The reason for your hallucination

83
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,440
Maybe that's because

84
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,280
In your heart,

85
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,680
To regret the past.

86
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
You can't find a way to put it down.

87
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,840
If you can't let go,

88
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,920
How about you...

89
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,600
A happy state.

90
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,680
It will continue to stimulate

91
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,400
Your subconscious guilt

92
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,840
You'll keep hallucinating.

93
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,240
Ji Mo, I'm telling you,

94
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,680
Don't contact with Ruuo Man recently.

95
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,640
Adjust yourself.

96
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,680
For the sake of your relationship.

97
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,280
I'm home

98
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,080
What about you?

99
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,120
When do you come back

100
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,280
I have to work overtime tonight.

101
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,400
I'll be home late.

102
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
You can go to bed without me.

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
So busy?

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,280
Well

105
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,760
Recently,

106
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,000
May be busy.

107
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,600
to be sorry

108
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,240
When everything is done,

109
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,120
I will make it up to you.

110
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,440
it doesn't matter

111
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,320
Work matters.

112
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,280
Go back to work.

113
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,760
I won't bother you.

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,320
Take care

115
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Don't be too tired.

116
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,440
I will feel sorry if I'm exhausted.

117
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,840
When you miss me,

118
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,880
At any time.

119
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Call me.

120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,920
You are back

121
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,680
Why did you fall asleep on the sofa?

122
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,960
You'll catch a cold.

123
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,400
Because I want to wait for you to come back.

124
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,240
And then I fell asleep.

125
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,120
I told you not to wait.

126
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
I just want to see you.

127
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,840
You're so busy with your work.

128
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,520
I'll charge you.

129
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,760
sorry

130
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
Why did you suddenly say sorry to me?

131
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,840
You're busy.

132
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,000
There's no other way.

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,360
I can understand that.

134
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Suddenly,

135
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,440
I want to say sorry.

136
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,559
Let's go and sleep.

137
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,440
What time is it now?

138
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,400
He's not here.

139
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,000
How did it happen?

140
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,080
I can't find him recently.

141
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,000
It smells good.

142
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,800
Help me ask Ali.

143
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,920
What kind of medicine is this?

144
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,200
Why are you here?

145
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,560
Yes?

146
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,920
Can't I come?

147
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,440
No, no. You can come.

148
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,640
What's wrong with you?

149
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,840
Surprise attack

150
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,320
What's the matter

151
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,120
What is this?

152
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,680
This is medicine.

153
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,720
What kind of medicine?

154
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,760
tonic

155
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,520
tonic

156
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,720
Where is it?

157
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,800
repair

158
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,880
A very important place.

159
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,000
Important place.

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,800
My brain should be

161
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,120
Is very important.

162
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,840
I know.

163
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,200
What do you know?

164
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,360
A couple in love.

165
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,440
What else can I do?

166
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,040
I know.

167
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,760
Are you eating too?

168
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,440
No, no.

169
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,240
I don't need it.

170
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
I'm strong.

171
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,720
Don't you need it?

172
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,760
Do I need it?

173
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,560
I'm strong, okay?

174
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,760
Really?

175
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,280
I can't tell.

176
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,760
Can you tell this?

177
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,680
Bibi,

178
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,000
This is comparable.

179
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,040
Than fitness.

180
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,600
Is the power good?

181
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,640
Bodybuilding

182
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,440
What? You don't have time.

183
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,600
There's time.

184
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,320
But is this a date?

185
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
It's an appointment.

186
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,480
Will it?

187
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,440
Let's talk about it.

188
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,120
We have an appointment.

189
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,320
feed

190
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,640
I've asked Ellie.

191
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,560
Ali said it was a tonic.

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,920
tonic

193
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,840
Are you sick?

194
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,880
Don't be nervous.

195
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,880
To keep fit.

196
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,960
The ordinary tonic.

197
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,520
it seems

198
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,320
Zimmer is doing her homework in advance.

199
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,160
Seize what belongs to you.

200
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,880
It's a passionate night.

201
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,280
Keep fit and healthy.

202
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,160
Fiery passion.

203
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,840
So he meant compensation.

204
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,840
What are you laughing at?

205
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,600
Nothing

206
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm not laughing.

207
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,920
Okay, I'm hanging up.

208
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,560
Okay, bye.

209
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,120
Morning, President Ji.

210
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,880
Morning, President Ji.

211
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,800
Phil came to see me just now.

212
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,520
Ask me what kind of medicine you're taking.

213
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,200
I guess Ruuo found out.

214
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,200
I lied and said it was a common tonic.

215
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,200
Watch yourself.

216
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,360
Don't spill the beans.

217
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,280
President Ji.

218
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,880
Samantha has arrived.

219
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,280
Waiting for you in the conference room.

220
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,440
Okay, I'll be there.

221
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,360
Thermansa

222
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,560
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

223
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,720
Marry me

224
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's break up

225
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Long time no see

226
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,520
Who are you

227
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,840
I'm Su Xiao.

228
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,360
Zimmer

229
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,440
impossible

230
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,840
Su Xiao is dead.

231
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,440
Zimmer

232
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,120
I know you can't accept it.

233
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,680
But I can explain.

234
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
I left three years ago.

235
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,320
I didn't want you to get hurt.

236
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,040
I didn't want you to get hurt.

237
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,960
Su Xiao is dead.

238
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,000
She's dead, Zimmer.

239
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,240
Brother

240
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,120
I saw him.

241
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,000
What did he say?

242
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,080
Mr. Ji, you have no appointment.

243
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,880
You can't go in.

244
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,240
President Ji.

245
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,080
President Ji.

246
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,920
I'll tell him myself, Mr. Ji.

247
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,600
Is Su Xiao still alive?

248
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,600
yes

249
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,120
You fooled me for so long.

250
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,360
And watch me suffer.

251
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,480
You're very happy, aren't you?

252
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,119
yes

253
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,319
Do you want her

254
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,119
Are you really dead?

255
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,480
Su Xiao's pain is real.

256
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
He almost died.

257
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,040
It's true.

258
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,000
I signed countless

259
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,319
The death notice is real.

260
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,520
She was on the verge of death countless times.

261
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,400
The struggle is real.

262
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,560
Your pain

263
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,960
Compared to her,

264
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,680
What is it?

265
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,200
Then why are you

266
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,960
You didn't tell me earlier.

267
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,800
She went abroad for surgery.

268
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,720
The success rate of the operation is extremely low.

269
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,200
She's done it.

270
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,080
To prepare for death.

271
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,920
But she couldn't bear to see you upset.

272
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,840
I can't see your pain.

273
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't want you to be weak.

274
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,080
I don't want you to fall.

275
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,680
That's why he begged me.

276
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,960
Let me tell you something.

277
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,640
She's dead.

278
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,680
Got it.

279
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,840
But she's back now.

280
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,960
Su Xiao and Ruuo Nan

281
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,280
You can only choose one.

282
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,760
I'm warning you.

283
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,720
My past has nothing to do

284
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,760
Has nothing to do with it.

285
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,640
If you use this thing

286
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,360
And hurt Ruo Man.

287
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,120
I won't forgive you.

288
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm warning you.

289
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,240
You have hurt

290
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,080
Su Xiao once.

291
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,480
If you hurt her again,

292
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,240
New and old.

293
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,960
I'll count it together.

294
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,440
Are you crazy?

295
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,720
Do you know?

296
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,920
That car almost hit you.

297
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,760
I shouldn't have left.

298
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,680
I shouldn't have left you alone.

299
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,960
To hurt you.

300
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
I was wrong.

301
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,240
Don't do that, okay?

302
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,280
I beg you, don't do this.

303
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

304
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,800
If you can live,

305
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,640
That's great.

306
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,760
Mr. Zhao, are you all right?

307
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,200
Nothing

308
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
Get ready.

309
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,960
Go to the crew with me.

310
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,880
good

311
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,680
Call first.

312
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,320
I used to go there.

313
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,680
The Cantonese restaurant.

314
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,520
Get them ready.

315
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,640
100 business packages.

316
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,680
To the crew.

317
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,360
OK!

318
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,320
Take a rest.

319
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,520
Thank you.

320
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,960
So generous.

321
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,480
This box is expensive, right?

322
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,800
OMG

323
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,000
Thank you, Ruo.

324
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,800
Your boyfriend

325
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,920
Is so generous.

326
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,320
The crew of more than 100 people

327
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,520
And eat high quality Cantonese cuisine.

328
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,400
That's right.

329
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,240
Thank you.

330
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,040
you're welcome

331
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,720
boyfriend

332
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,440
Is Zimmer here?

333
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,600
If a man

334
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Mr. Zhao.

335
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,800
Why are you here?

336
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,800
Let me talk to you.

337
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,640
The business show.

338
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,120
And help you find a class.

339
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,920
Actually, in the crew,

340
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,800
There's a lunch box.

341
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,960
You don't have to spend so much.

342
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,160
Of course I know.

343
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,320
But I came to visit the class.

344
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,800
You can't come here empty-handed.

345
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,760
Thank you, President Zhao.

346
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,880
Call me Zhao.

347
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,720
Old Zhao.

348
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,480
Actually, I have...

349
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,840
With Zimmer.

350
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,320
I don't want to.

351
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,880
When you do these things,

352
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
People will misunderstand.

353
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,600
I don't want Zimmer to misunderstand.

354
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,040
You care so much about Zimmer.

355
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,160
That's right.

356
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,480
Even if one day,

357
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,120
He might hurt you.

358
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,200
What do you mean?

359
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Nothing.

360
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,040
I just want to tell you that

361
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,520
If you get hurt one day,

362
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,680
You can always come to me.

363
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
I have been here all the time

364
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,000
You might be disappointed.

365
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,080
Because there won't be such a day.

366
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
But in the future,

367
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,000
Who can be sure?

368
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,360
I won't bother you with your work.

369
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,160
Sida

370
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,040
I've got the last meal.

371
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,440
I didn't expect that Zhao Yucheng

372
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,560
You really paid a lot of money.

373
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,960
This is a fancy restaurant.

374
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,320
Business lunch box.

375
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
The crew has more than 100 people.

376
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,280
How much does it cost?

377
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,320
Back then, I was...

378
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,440
Who doesn't blink?

379
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,880
I really miss it.

380
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,080
To be a rich man.

381
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,400
Eat it.

382
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,280
Help yourself.

383
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,640
What did I say wrong again?

384
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,520
No, right?

385
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,080
Mr. Zhao.

386
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,680
What's the matter

387
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,200
I want to...

388
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,600
From now on, don't...

389
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,080
To bother Mrs. Ruo again.

390
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,400
why

391
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,360
She has a boyfriend.

392
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,360
Give up.

393
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,400
So what?

394
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,160
You didn't give up.

395
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,800
I

396
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,040
At least I won't be the same as you.

397
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,240
She knows she has a boyfriend.

398
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,280
And still haunts her.

399
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,160
Then why are you

400
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,000
Around her every day.

401
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,720
At least,

402
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm expressing

403
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,000
My true feelings

404
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,320
Unlike you,

405
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,680
You don't even have the courage to say it.

406
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,960
Just because of this,

407
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
You will lose.

408
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,520
Can I go now?

409
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,000
Thank you

410
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,040
Do you want to go inside?

411
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,760
No

412
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,600
I have an appointment with my girlfriend.

413
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,400
You can't be late.

414
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,320
I heard from my brother.

415
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,920
What kind of person is she?

416
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
I think

417
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,240
We don't fit in.

418
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,360
To talk about this topic.

419
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,760
Suxiao

420
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,720
During your time away,

421
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,280
I've moved on.

422
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,120
Of course

423
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,600
When I see you,

424
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,400
I'm also very happy.

425
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,120
But the past is the past.

426
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,760
People have to look forward?

427
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,320
Suxiao

428
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,000
Whether in the past or now,

429
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,480
I hope you can be well.

430
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,680
I'm anxious to say goodbye to you.

431
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,040
We must have many chances.

432
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,000
To meet you.

433
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,240
Some words.

434
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,880
Save it for next time.

435
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,080
Bye

436
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,000
Are you at home?

437
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,360
I thought you weren't back yet.

438
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,480
If a man

439
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,600
Today, Si Da

440
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,080
It's so disturbing.

441
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,320
The director told me

442
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,880
When he was shooting recently,

443
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
I was so distracted.

444
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,000
Is extremely poor.

445
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:50,880
I'm planning to

446
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,240
Talk to him.

447
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,680
To see how he is.

448
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,120
It's not often that

449
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,080
To talk to you?

450
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,640
Did he tell you anything?

451
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,400
Well

452
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,240
What's wrong?

453
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,120
What happened

454
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,840
Is there any trouble?

455
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,200
His troubles

456
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,640
Started when we were in love.

457
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,880
If you have something to say,

458
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,760
It will affect

459
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,440
The relationship between two people

460
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
I'd rather not know.

461
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,920
Some secrets.

462
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,840
Let it be a secret forever.

463
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,200
Don't you have something to tell me?

464
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,480
Was interrupted by me.

465
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,600
It's okay.

466
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,720
I think you're acting weird today.

467
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,840
Maybe he's too tired.

468
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,880
And encountered some problems.

469
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,920
I've been thinking about

470
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,840
The right answer.

471
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,240
Do you have the answer now?

472
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,240
Well

473
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,760
Well, that's good.

474
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,440
We met.

475
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,200
Well

476
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,760
Three years ago,

477
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,600
Has changed a lot?

478
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,080
Has changed a bit.

479
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,040
Regret it?

480
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,320
It's been three years.

481
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,320
No one will stay the same.

482
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But I think

483
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,200
He still has me in his heart.

484
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,440
I just need time to repair it.

485
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,800
But he's in love.

486
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,520
I know.

487
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
He told me

488
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,320
to speak the truth

489
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,920
When I first heard it,

490
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,520
I really had a pain in my heart.

491
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,000
But I didn't expect that.

492
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,120
because

493
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,360
I was the one who abandoned him.

494
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,920
But I'm back now.

495
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,440
I will get his heart back.

496
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,520
good

497
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,600
I'm relieved.

498
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,120
You can do whatever you want.

499
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,720
Anyway, I'm here.

500
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,320
Brother

501
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,400
Haven't you always opposed

502
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,720
Am I with him?

503
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,000
That's right.

504
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,120
But I opposed it for so many years.

505
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,720
What's the use?

506
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,120
So now,

507
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,000
It's better

508
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,360
What you want,

509
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,280
I'll help you get him.

510
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,520
Moreover,

511
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,400
I also hope

512
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,800
The two of them can separate early.

513
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,120
Brother

514
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,920
Aren't you with Jimo?

515
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,360
Are you in love with the same woman?

516
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,720
yes

517
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,520
Is this

518
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,680
What kind of woman?

519
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
I actually care.

520
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,760
Two men.

521
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,720
I've fallen in love with her.

522
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,920
I really

523
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,320
More and more curious.

524
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,320
Give me a hug.

525
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,440
to make a telephone call

526
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,920
Well

527
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,120
Oh, my God.

528
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,400
How did you drive? I'm sorry.

529
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,040
sorry

530
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Suddenly,

531
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
So I hit it.

532
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,040
Are you all right?

533
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,040
Nothing

534
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,400
Is my car.

535
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
How about this?

536
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,520
I'll take you to the hospital.

537
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,680
And have a full body check.

538
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,200
If you're alright,

539
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,640
We'll fix the damage of the car.

540
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,320
It's my responsibility. I'll pay for it.

541
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,320
You don't need a full body check.

542
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,240
But if it's fixed,

543
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,040
I can't today.

544
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,160
I have to work.

545
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,360
that

546
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,800
Let's leave a contact number.

547
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,480
How about this?

548
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,880
Contact me when you have time.

549
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,480
Alright.

550
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,640
I'll send you the name.

551
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,160
Well

552
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,320
Dugu is like a man.

553
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,920
Well

554
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,440
This name

555
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,080
It's so familiar.

556
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,160
Really?

557
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,640
Well

558
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,480
What's your name?

559
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,680
You can call me Samantha.

560
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,840
Thermansa

561
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,560
good

562
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,880
I have...

563
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,360
I haven't been here for a long time.

564
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,840
It's still the same here.

565
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,880
You're so familiar with him.

566
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,320
You've been here before.

567
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:57,720
Well

568
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,200
I used to live here.

569
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,400
And my ex.

570
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,640
And wanted to come here today.

571
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,520
Take a look at him.

572
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,560
So I came here.

573
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,160
I remember a lot of things.

574
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,080
But I ran into him again.

575
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,800
A flash of magic.

576
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,320
I ran into you again.

577
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,639
I didn't miss it.

578
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,560
You can meet each other.

579
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,000
can't

580
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,600
I've been with him for a long time.

581
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,400
It can be seen.

582
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,400
That's good.

583
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,080
I'm leaving now.

584
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,320
Bye

585
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,480
Sorry.

586
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,280
Nothing

587
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,320
Dugu is like a man.

588
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,920
The theme of this design

589
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,520
To show the strength of women.

590
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,280
And power.

591
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,520
So in color,

592
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,560
We use

593
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,200
Bright red and yellow tones.

594
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,840
And a little design element.

595
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,360
For example,

596
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,480
This one is on my shoulders.

597
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,880
To design a wing.

598
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,440
It represents the soft armor of women.

599
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,640
Turn the cocoon into a erfly.

600
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,480
Of course, this pair of wings

601
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,080
It has another meaning.

602
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,760
The wings represent

603
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,360
The wing fashion itself.

604
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,280
It's really good.

605
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,760
actually

606
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,040
Long ago,

607
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,880
I want to open one.

608
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,600
A clothing company called Wing.

609
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,160
Because I think it means

610
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,760
My love for fashion design

611
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,320
And it symbolizes

612
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,760
My old lover and I

613
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,200
A promise I failed to fulfill.

614
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,360
President Ji.

615
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,720
President Ji.

616
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,600
President Ji.

617
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,200
President Ji.

618
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,200
This is interesting.

619
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,080
When Mr. Ji came here,

620
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,960
So I sent our new comer

621
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,920
The designer was taken away.

622
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,800
What are you doing?

623
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,080
It means that

624
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,040
There's a story.

625
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,400
I didn't say that.

626
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,760
Don't gossip.

627
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,000
What kind of story can it be?

628
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,160
Don't gossip.

629
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,320
Why are you asking?

630
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,760
You're hurting me.

631
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,080
What do you want to do?

632
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,280
I'm presenting my

633
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,240
The design concept.

634
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,880
I won't let you work.

635
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,080
You will be seriously

636
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,160
Affect my life.

637
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,280
Will affect your life.

638
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,000
You and her life.

639
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,720
I guessed right.

640
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,880
Since you chose to leave,

641
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,200
Why are you coming back now?

642
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,240
Don't you know that

643
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,720
Why should I come back?

644
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,200
The meaning of wing fashion.

645
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Was given by me.

646
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,480
I came back to pursue my dream.

647
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,640
Is there any problem?

648
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,920
and

649
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,280
I have a dream.

650
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,040
Don't you remember?

651
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,880
I forgot.

652
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,920
You didn't forget it.

653
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
You lied.

654
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,200
Don't you hate lying?

655
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,360
that's right

656
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,200
I hate when people lie.

657
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,920
You and Zhao Yusheng

658
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,120
When you lied to me together,

659
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,360
I will never forget it.

660
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,040
Whether it's in good faith,

661
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,640
Or malicious?

662
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,240
Lies are always lies.

663
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,720
I think you should figure out

664
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,440
I'm not back.

665
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,720
I beg you to forgive me.

666
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,920
I came back to continue

667
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,640
My dream.

668
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,480
And it was you who approached me.

669
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,960
I didn't go to find you.

670
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,240
I think you misunderstood.

671
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,480
I'm looking for a design.

672
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,320
It's not you.

673
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,000
You asked me to design it.

674
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Is looking for me.

675
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,840
You've changed.

676
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,960
That's right.

677
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,280
I thought I wouldn't change.

678
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,520
But I've been through a lot.

679
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,560
Will change.

680
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,040
Haven't you changed too?

681
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,720
Suxiao

682
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,280
We have changed.

683
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,400
I've moved on.

684
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,400
It's time to move on.

685
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,640
You're right.

686
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,200
We should let go of the past.

687
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,040
Look ahead.

688
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,880
I'm not

689
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,040
Three years ago, Su Xiao.

690
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,960
I'm a designer now.

691
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,840
Thermansa

692
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,560
Wing fashion used to be my dream.

693
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,240
Now it's our common dream.

694
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,480
I won't bother you.

695
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,560
Your life now

696
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,480
I just want to continue my dream.

697
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,920
OK?

698
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,640
I always had a dream.

699
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,680
I want to open

700
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,360
A clothing company called Wing.

701
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,560
Namely

702
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,040
Letter w

703
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,880
Look, here's the thing.

704
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,760
Does it look like

705
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,080
Can fly.

706
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,880
good

707
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,840
I'll be your wing.

708
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,480
Protect you forever.

709
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,600
To support you.

710
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,560
actually

711
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,000
I have a dream.

712
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:41,920
Guess what it is.

713
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,880
what

714
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,160
Namely

715
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,920
you

716
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,000
I want to be with you forever.

717
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,240
good

718
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,000
President Ji.

719
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
Is President Ji OK?

720
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,960
The designer

721
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,960
Use it or not?

722
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,800
No need

723
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,560
I won't deny it.

724
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,280
My original intention of establishing Wing Fashion

725
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,760
But I think you got it wrong.

726
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,080
Wing fashion is Su Xiao's dream.

727
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,920
It's not Samantha's.

728
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,320
feed

729
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,560
Brother

730
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,440
Xiao Wu.

731
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,000
To contact them.

732
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,720
The designer of Wing Fashion.

733
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,280
It shows that Ruiqi Group

734
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,800
If you want to hire them with high salary,

735
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,920
The salary will be raised by them.

736
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
penalty

737
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,520
Go directly to my personal account.

738
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,400
Okay, I'll do it right away.

739
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,640
Last season,

740
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,520
Send me the promo samples.

741
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,720
OK

742
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,240
As for the new season,

743
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,080
What is the design?

744
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,280
Why did you repeat it?

745
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,560
Previous concepts and elements

746
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,920
I want something new.

747
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,640
It's not like this.

748
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,560
To deal with me.

749
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,640
Redesigned

750
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,080
President Ji.

751
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,240
Don't you mean

752
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,160
It's Sermantha.

753
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,360
Nirvana?

754
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,600
I told you I wouldn't use her.

755
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,440
But the general draft of the induction,

756
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,640
Haven't you already sent it?

757
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,160
Entry Press Release.

758
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,840
Mr. Ji, look.
