1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,720
I'm sorry. Actually, I...

2
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,560
You're not writing it

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,840
to the person you secretly love.

4
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,000
You told me that

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,800
you like her?

6
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,040
She doesn't like you.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,280
She's older than you.

8
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,600
After a long time,

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,400
this is a confession song.

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,440
Then it shouldn't be included

11
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,240
in a singing program.

12
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,960
Why?

13
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,960
If you become popular in the future,

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,280
people will find you out.

15
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Have you thought about it.

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,440
Sit down.

17
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,080
I'm not that

18
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,920
unreasonable, am I?

19
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,080
I can show this song to her

20
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
in private.

21
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,280
I've never seen it before.

22
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,880
She has seen it.

23
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,480
That's right.

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,160
What do you think?

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,880
Does she like it?

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,080
Are you touched?

27
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,840
Not so good.

28
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,160
I don't like it and I'm not moved.

29
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,120
You even scolded me.

30
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,440
So unkind?

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,480
Yeah.

32
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,960
You have a heart of stone,

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
too hard of heart.

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,520
Forget it.

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,240
You have no taste, no taste,

36
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,360
and no sense,

37
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,400
Why does an old woman

38
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,280
who doesn't appreciate you

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,880
come here?

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Please don't do this for me.

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,480
Some don't have any, okay?

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,240
Work hard, okay?

43
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,160
You …

44
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,200
You … Think about it carefully.

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,720
I'm leaving.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,960
It's good.

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,040
A little ambiguous,

48
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,320
but afraid of fouls.

49
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
You know you don't deserve it,

50
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,480
but you don't want to retreat.

51
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,000
Is this the taste of love?

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,400
People say you're childish.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,120
No.

54
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,200
On the contrary, I think

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,160
it's quite good.

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,200
Then why are you laughing?

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,520
What I'm laughing at is,

58
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,040
you're being too direct.

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,920
Although the lyrics

60
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,960
have a good feeling,

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,480
But it's too obvious.

62
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,360
If I were Dugu Ruonan,

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,560
I would definitely be able to tell.

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,480
But the problem is,

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
if Shengnan

66
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,000
doesn't know it at all,

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,280
I wrote it for her.

68
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,160
In her heart,

69
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,320
she treats you as her brother.

70
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,400
That's why I'm depressed.

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm just a little brother to her,

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,440
judging from her attitude

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,480
towards the lyrics,

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,880
It's impossible for her to accept it.

75
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,640
Sister-in-law love,

76
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,560
then I don't have

77
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,080
a chance at all, do I?

78
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,960
Also,

79
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,960
when she criticized the lyrics today,

80
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,320
I feel like,

81
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,440
I feel like I've fallen out of love.

82
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,160
Why?

83
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,520
How can you judge a man?

84
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,960
It depends on age.

85
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,040
It's not like I don't have a chance at all.

86
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,520
What do you mean?

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,600
At least you are brave and straightforward,

88
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,680
although you have little experience in life,

89
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,640
But your feelings are pure,

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,840
at least for that,

91
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,400
I envy you.

92
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
Brother, please help me.

93
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,840
Help me persuade Ruonan.

94
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,480
I really want to.

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,280
On this show,

96
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
sing this song to her,

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
Really?

98
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,240
Help me.

99
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,160
I'm afraid

100
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,440
I can't help you with this.

101
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,120
I've moved out of her house.

102
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,560
Moving out of Ruonan's house,

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,280
why?

104
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,480
I won't tell you the reason.

105
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,720
I moved out of her house.

106
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,280
Isn't it a good thing for you?

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,840
That's true.

108
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,840
You're so honest and frank.

109
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,840
You're still young.

110
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,160
You've been rejected once or twice.

111
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,400
It's not a big deal.

112
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,080
This song is very good.

113
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,640
If a man doesn't like it,

114
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,160
It doesn't mean others don't like it.

115
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,920
Unfortunately,

116
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,120
this song is for Ruo Nan,

117
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,360
Ruonan didn't get a chance to hear it.

118
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,280
By the way,

119
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,360
the day after tomorrow is the first round of the contest.

120
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,840
I hope you can come, okay?

121
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,040
When I was in Shanghai,

122
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,240
I didn't have many friends.

123
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,680
I won't go.

124
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,520
In case Ruonan sees me.

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I'm in a bad mood.

126
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,520
All right.

127
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,320
Come on, kid.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,880
Did you see that?

129
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,800
This is the stage

130
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,160
where you're going to compete later,

131
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
That's where the instructor is,

132
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,240
so I'll let you get used to it.

133
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,600
Don't be nervous,

134
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
and

135
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,800
This time, it's a point system,

136
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
like Mr. Wu,

137
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,640
I'm also a mentor.

138
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,080
But he's the only one,

139
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,440
so it's useless to give you a high score.

140
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,400
You need all four mentors

141
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,280
to give you high marks.

142
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,040
So wait a minute.

143
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,240
I'll take you to the back.

144
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,960
Say hello to those mentors.

145
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,240
Make a good impression on them.

146
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,200
What are you thinking about?

147
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Nothing.

148
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,600
The competition is coming.

149
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,480
Don't be distracted.

150
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,040
Focus on your mind,

151
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,920
and stop floating around.

152
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,800
Let's go.

153
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,760
Come on, come on. Come on

154
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,440
Let's go.

155
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,600
Judge's mentor,

156
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,720
Ruonan,

157
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,840
What a coincidence.

158
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,960
You're also a mentor.

159
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,640
Why didn't anyone tell me?

160
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,560
Zihao is an all-around artist

161
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,200
who has made records before,

162
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,760
In a singing contest,

163
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,440
is it strange to be a mentor?

164
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,560
You did it on purpose.

165
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,640
How could it be intentional?

166
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,400
Sida is a newcomer,

167
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,960
it's normal for her to show her face,

168
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,520
But Zihao is different.

169
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,600
The program asked us

170
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,640
to come here.

171
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,240
Judging from Ruonan's tone,

172
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,720
she seems to be a mentor to Zihao,

173
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,760
I'm not happy.

174
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,600
Well,

175
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,240
the show hasn't started yet.

176
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,240
It's not too late to quit now.

177
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,920
Don't worry,

178
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,560
Sida won't quit.

179
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,360
We'll make it to the end.

180
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,920
But some people,

181
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,000
please don't play dirty tricks like that.

182
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,120
After all, it's not just his fans

183
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,040
who watch the show,

184
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,960
There are still a lot of

185
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,160
reasonable people,

186
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Are you afraid that I'll play dirty tricks?

187
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,720
Then I'm really surprised.

188
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,080
Why are you more scared?

189
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,120
The more excited I am.

190
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,560
Sis,

191
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,040
Let's go. Ignore them,

192
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,240
boy,

193
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
I suggest you take your sister

194
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
with you.

195
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,400
Don't make a fool of yourself.

196
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,679
I won't

197
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,799
let you advance.

198
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,159
What's wrong?

199
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,480
You want to do it again?

200
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,000
Come on,

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,320
I won't do it.

202
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,440
You're dirty.

203
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,440
Remember,

204
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,320
as long as I'm here,

205
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,920
You'll never have a chance to turn over.

206
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,280
I'm so scared.

207
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,040
Sida?

208
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,360
Don't be afraid.

209
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,880
You're new,

210
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,840
so you can't

211
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,080
choose a job,

212
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,880
You have to do both good and bad.

213
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,480
But in fact, in every job,

214
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,080
you may meet your rivals.

215
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,920
So you can't give up.

216
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,760
If you give up,

217
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
you will let those opponents

218
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,080
achieve their goal.

219
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,720
Sister, don't worry.

220
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,920
I won't give up.

221
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,960
It doesn't matter even if I'm eliminated.

222
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,400
I will take this stage seriously.

223
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Do your best.

224
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,520
That's good.

225
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,680
But it still matters

226
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,840
if you're eliminated.

227
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,800
Hello, everyone. Welcome back.

228
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,280
Welcome to continue watching.

229
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,840
The Star of Tomorrow Dream Show,

230
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,880
which is exclusively named by Ruiqi Group,

231
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,120
Singer contest,

232
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,040
next up is,

233
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,600
The last contestant today,

234
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,360
Sida?

235
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,480
What he will bring to you

236
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,000
is his original song.

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,960
Big lady,

238
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,040
let's welcome Sida to the stage,

239
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,120
Is there a mistake?

240
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
Why did you change it to this song?

241
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,320
Sida, Sida, Sida.

242
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,080
Excuse me, sir.

243
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,840
What's wrong?

244
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,440
I want to change

245
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,760
my performance song,

246
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,520
Change the song temporarily.

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,560
Are you sure?

248
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,280
The most taboo thing in this kind of competition

249
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,640
is to change the song temporarily.

250
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,920
You didn't play well.

251
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm sure.

252
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,680
In the past,

253
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,800
you were left alone.

254
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
It's different now.

255
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,720
Now you're my artist.

256
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,480
So I'm in charge of you

257
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,520
from beginning to end.

258
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,240
Sida

259
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,240
Do you know what signing a contract with you means?

260
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,400
It represents a promise

261
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,120
that

262
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I will always support you.

263
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,440
To protect you.

264
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,280
Okay. Thank you, Sida,

265
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,120
for your affectionate singing.

266
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,320
It's very touching.

267
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,520
Now let's invite

268
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
our four mentors,

269
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,600
To comment on Star's singing just now

270
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,720
and score it.

271
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,240
Do you know that?

272
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,160
You chose an original song,

273
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,560
which is very risky.

274
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,080
However,

275
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,520
you succeeded in conquering me.

276
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,040
It also conquered

277
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,960
all the audience,

278
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,000
Music needs an adventurous singer

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,160
like you.

280
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,640
So I'll give you

281
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,920
ten points.

282
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,280
Your song is very simple,

283
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,720
even a little immature,

284
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,320
But the simple ones

285
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,960
are the most touching ones.

286
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,840
I'll give you ten points, too.

287
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,880
Everyone has their own preferences.

288
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,040
I don't think that song

289
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,160
touched me.

290
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,040
And with your skills and aura,

291
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,240
there are obvious deficiencies.

292
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,920
Compared to the other competitors,

293
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,120
he's not outstanding.

294
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,960
So,

295
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll give you five points.

296
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,080
I heard an emotion

297
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,520
in your singing,

298
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,080
Although you still have some flaws

299
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,400
in your skills.

300
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,840
But you have

301
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,160
a moving singing voice,

302
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,440
I'll give it to you, too.

303
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,000
Ten points.

304
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,360
Star ranked third

305
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,160
among all

306
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,360
the preliminary competitors.

307
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,240
Congratulations to Sida

308
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,320
for advancing to Sida?

309
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,400
Sis,

310
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Sis, I made it.

311
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,960
I made it.

312
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,640
Put me down.

313
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,680
Put me down.

314
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,560
I made it.

315
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,440
Sis, did you see that?

316
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,480
I was so nervous

317
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,600
on the stage just now,

318
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,520
But all I can think about

319
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,240
is you.

320
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,560
You're in my eyes, you're in the microphone,

321
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,160
and you're in the shelf.

322
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,000
It's all your fault.

323
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,960
All the audience I watched,

324
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,720
it was you.

325
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,160
Sida?

326
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,360
I'm an agent and you're an artist.

327
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,200
Sometimes you have to be careful.

328
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,280
A lot of people are watching,

329
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,120
they are watching,

330
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm sorry, sister.

331
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,080
I'm so happy.

332
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,200
I got carried away.

333
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,840
It's only the semi-final

334
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,200
and you're already getting carried away.

335
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,920
There's still a long way to go.

336
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,880
It's already in the semi-final.

337
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,160
We're finally in the semi-final.

338
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,280
I need to go to the washroom.

339
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,680
By the time I get back,

340
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,400
I hope you've

341
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
calmed down,

342
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,560
Sis,

343
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,120
I'm not eliminated.

344
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,280
I want you to be my woman.

345
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,560
Mr. Ji,

346
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,240
the design draft hasn't been decided yet.

347
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,400
This table is too dirty.

348
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,520
Is this dirty?

349
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,000
I can't concentrate anymore.

350
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,079
I just cleaned it today.

351
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,640
You don't have to worry about it. Just draw yours.

352
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,599
I'll take care of it later.

353
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,320
This pen doesn't work well.

354
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,680
I can't concentrate on revising the draft.

355
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,840
You've found out the problem

356
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,360
that affects my creative thinking,

357
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,760
Mr. Ji.

358
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,440
Come on,

359
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,160
I've prepared everything for you.

360
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,120
Pick and use whatever you want.

361
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,440
It's so well prepared.

362
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,160
Mr. Ji,

363
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
please stop making excuses.

364
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,640
Okay?

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,640
The design draft has been handed in.

366
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,040
Look, you're not satisfied with any of them.

367
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,320
But you didn't change it.

368
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,760
You didn't think the workload was enough,

369
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,200
so in order to cooperate with you,

370
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,360
The production cycle

371
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,800
has been reduced to one month

372
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,160
and the last batch of design drafts

373
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,560
have been put into production.

374
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,000
But this batch of design drafts,

375
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,200
has been here for half a month.

376
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,360
No result yet.

377
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,360
Mr. Ji,

378
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,000
you're just looking for a reason.

379
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,960
I admit that I was looking for an excuse.

380
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,320
I'm out of inspiration.

381
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,280
What?

382
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,160
Mr. Ji, what did you say?

383
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,280
You don't have any inspiration.

384
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,520
How... How can I do that?

385
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,480
You are the soul of Yi Fashion.

386
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,320
You don't have any inspiration.

387
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,200
It means that the hen won't lay any eggs.

388
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,480
Cows don't produce milk anymore.

389
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,920
Can you be quiet?

390
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,640
Mr. Ji,

391
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,400
I think you,

392
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,880
Don't hold it here.

393
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,720
How about

394
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,320
I go out for a walk with you.

395
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,120
Get some fresh air.

396
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,480
Okay,

397
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,400
You can go somewhere with me,

398
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
anywhere.

399
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,920
Mr. Ji,

400
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,280
it's late at night for spicy hot pot,

401
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,480
Your taste is too strong, isn't it?

402
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,400
Shut up and eat yours.

403
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,920
This is too spicy.

404
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,640
You can stand it?

405
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,520
I don't want to eat too much.

406
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,040
But some people

407
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,400
still eat supper at night.

408
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,480
It's even more unhealthy.

409
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,240
The fat on the belly

410
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,520
is almost like a swimming ring.

411
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,680
You're still on a diet.

412
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,560
What's wrong with the fat on your stomach?

413
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,480
Did you eat your rice?

414
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,680
I want a German pig's foot,

415
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,320
as fat as you want. Thank you.

416
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,680
Okay,

417
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm also very thoughtful.

418
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,560
This table of dishes

419
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,720
is specially prepared for you.

420
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,800
-It's delicious. -Which one ordered it? That

421
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,320
old man at the alley.

422
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,920
Mr. Ji,

423
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,440
can you stop

424
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,760
smiling so affectionately at me?

425
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,880
It makes me panic.

426
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,520
Let's go.

427
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,160
Why are you coming back to the hotel

428
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,720
with me?

429
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,920
You haven't finished eating, have you?

430
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,720
I have an idea.

431
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,000
Done.

432
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,440
Arran,

433
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,240
Alan.

434
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,320
Mr. Ji,

435
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,800
you've changed it all at once.

436
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,400
This is amazing.

437
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,200
I can't. I'm so sleepy.

438
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,160
Why don't you stay

439
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,760
and sleep here tonight.

440
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,480
It's such a big apartment,

441
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,280
I'm acting

442
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,680
weird alone

443
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,760
Weird.

444
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,120
Mr. Ji,

445
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,680
have you been

446
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,440
out of space lately.

447
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,800
It's so lonely.

448
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,760
Kind of.

449
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,320
Although I'm your subordinate,

450
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,480
I admire you, too.

451
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,640
But I have my principles.

452
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,200
It's a hidden rule in the workplace.

453
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,080
I … I'm really not prepared for

454
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,880
it.

455
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Hidden rules?

456
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,720
What are you talking about?

457
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,800
You're not

458
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,760
interested in women anymore.

459
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
For men

460
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,840
… Are you crazy?

461
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,520
I mean, there are two beds in the suite.

462
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,200
I think you're tired,

463
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,240
That's why I asked you to stay.

464
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,760
I don't want to leave.

465
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,120
Mr. Ji,

466
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,600
I found a problem,

467
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,480
I found out that after you moved out

468
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,200
from Ruonan's house,

469
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,800
I can't draw the design anymore.

470
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,920
Are you

471
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,240
not used to living alone,

472
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,720
I miss Ruonan.

473
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,560
Zhang,

474
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,000
during the rounds later,

475
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,680
What about these items?

476
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,720
Write it clearly,

477
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,920
okay? Okay.

478
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,360
Take a look.

479
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,800
Why are you here again?

480
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,240
Can't I sign up

481
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,440
to see a doctor?

482
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,920
You're a big star.

483
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,360
It's not good that

484
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,320
you keep showing up in mental hospitals.

485
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,040
I'm here to inform you.

486
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,440
In the semi-final of Star tomorrow,

487
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,240
Ruonan gave me two tickets,

488
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,920
You.

489
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,680
If you want to go with me,

490
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,360
isn't tomorrow the weekend?

491
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,680
I don't even have

492
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,480
private time now.

493
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
What? Don't you want to see me?

494
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,000
Don't forget,

495
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,120
I support you.

496
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,880
Dr. Ai,

497
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,080
you two talk first.

498
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,600
I'll check the ward.

499
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,640
Can you stop talking nonsense?

500
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
What do you mean by raising me?

501
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,280
Isn't my image...

502
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Why am I talking nonsense?

503
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,320
Didn't I tell you before

504
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,240
that I wanted to hire you?

505
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,400
Why did you hire me?

506
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,080
I'm telling you,

507
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,200
we're in a partnership,

508
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,440
That's the relationship between the doctor and the patient.

509
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,600
Are you going or not?

510
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,320
If you don't go,

511
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:17,960
I can spend the whole day here

512
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,120
with you,

513
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,560
Let me tell you,

514
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,400
Ali,

515
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,360
This is an order from the owner.

516
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,880
Don't call me Ali.

517
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Call me coolie.

518
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,240
I won't fight anymore.

519
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,040
You didn't score a single goal.

520
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,840
Congratulations recently.

521
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,440
I saw your news.

522
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,040
Talking about you

523
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,560
It's getting more and more popular.

524
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,480
Many people in our company

525
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,440
are your fans.

526
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,120
Really?

527
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,600
Thank you, brother.

528
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,880
If it hadn't been for your encouragement,

529
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,520
I wouldn't have dared

530
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,480
to sing "Big Woman".

531
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,560
Even the male sister won't hear it.

532
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,480
Ruo Nan

533
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,040
How have you been?

534
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,440
Isn't she happy to see you

535
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,640
being so successful?

536
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,360
She seems to be quite busy recently.

537
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,080
You haven't supervised my training for a long time.

538
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,600
She used to come to the practice room.

539
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,520
By the way,

540
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,000
The semi-final is coming.

541
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,280
I hope you can come.

542
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,600
Tomorrow is the most important day

543
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,800
in my life,

544
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,600
I want you to witness it.

545
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,200
If you come,

546
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,200
I think Ruonan

547
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,160
will be very happy, too.

548
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,640
How about this?

549
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,280
I'll break through your defense.

550
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,640
If I score a goal,

551
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,680
promise me,

552
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,680
You want to break through my defense?

553
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,200
It's not that easy.

554
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,760
How do you know if you don't try?

555
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,640
I'm in. I'm really in.

556
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,840
You're coming to the semi-final tomorrow,

557
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,440
Brother.

558
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,960
You wanted to come.

559
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,640
When the time comes, where will the light be?

560
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,360
It will hit the center of the stage.

561
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:06,840
What about here?

562
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,160
It's the area where you perform.

563
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,320
It's already the second time. Don't be nervous.

564
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,560
Thank you, director.

565
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,160
Director, did I do this

566
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,040
according to the procedure?

567
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,520
Thank you, director. Thank you. Okay,

568
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,440
Tell me.

569
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,160
That's where the contestants

570
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,040
will come from, right?

571
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,560
Don't be nervous,

572
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,880
relax,

573
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,320
Just take it as normal training.

574
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,400
That's enough.

575
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,000
Just show your usual

576
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
training skills.

577
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,480
This way, please.

578
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,120
Brother,

579
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,080
I'm here.

580
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,920
Why is he here?

581
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,840
I invited him here.

582
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,280
I'm in Shanghai.

583
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,640
I don't have any family or friends,

584
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,240
So I invited him here.

585
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,120
Besides, my roommate Po

586
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,960
is not here.

587
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,880
What kind of person is not nice?

588
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,800
Why did you invite him here?

589
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,400
He also helped me a lot.

590
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
So I wanted to invite him

591
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,840
to watch it with me.

592
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,800
Sis, do you want to say hello?

593
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,760
I'll hit you in the head.

594
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,840
Who wants to say hello to him?

595
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,720
Who are you looking at? You're so focused.

596
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,000
You didn't look at anyone.

597
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,360
duplicity.

598
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,120
I'm going up to the director's room.

599
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Practice hard.

600
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,440
The microphone still needs

601
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,040
to be debugged,

602
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,120
Okay,

603
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,760
wait a minute. Go up. Go up a little bit.

604
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,360
Is that okay?

605
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Okay, okay, that's it.

606
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,600
Sida

607
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Are you nervous?

608
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,880
I'm not nervous.

609
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,680
What a coincidence.

610
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
I'll come with Fei'er.

611
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,720
And I met you.

612
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,280
Look at Dugu Ruonan.

613
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,680
No.

614
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,600
I promised Sida that

615
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,520
I would come to the field to watch him lose

616
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,320
when he lost,

617
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,360
If I remember correctly,

618
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,240
aren't you the point guard of the university team?

619
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,120
Your water is good enough.

620
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,720
I haven't practiced for a long time.

621
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,080
Ruonan, why are you here?

622
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,560
I thought you were interviewing Sida

623
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
during the break.

624
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,560
interview

625
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,240
I didn't get the notice.

626
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,360
No way.

627
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,480
Tong Tong said it was specially

628
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,320
arranged by your company.

629
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,400
Don't you know?

630
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
Have you arranged everything?

631
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,800
Don't worry.

632
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,200
As for the show team,

633
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,320
we've already made a deal.

634
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,160
Do they think the company

635
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,280
is pushing Sida?

636
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,680
Promise me to broadcast the video clip.

637
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,400
Even if you find

638
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,640
something wrong later?

639
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,320
It's impossible to refuse.

640
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,640
It's such a good topic,

641
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,040
and all the questions

642
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,480
have been arranged by me.

643
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,120
will reveal all Sida's true words

644
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,880
without showing any trace,

645
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,080
Get them all out.

646
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,880
I knew it.

647
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,240
You two bitches are up to something.

648
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,360
The interview is already in progress.

649
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
And the program agreed

650
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,680
to let us do this.

651
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,280
Don't blame me for not persuading you.

652
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,080
If you break in now

653
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,360
and offend the TV station,

654
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,360
Sida will have a hard time

655
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,400
in the future.

656
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,600
Get out of the way!

657
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,760
You're the one who forced me

658
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,840
to sing "Big Woman",

659
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,680
Are you the one

660
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,840
who wrote the lyrics and composed the music?

661
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,360
Yes, I did it all by myself

662
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,760
from lyrics to composition.

663
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,720
In my opinion, the lyrics of this song,

664
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,600
are like a love letter

665
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,360
from brother to sister,

666
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,120
Excuse me,

667
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,600
do you have such personal experience,

668
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,000
That's why you wrote such lyrics?

669
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,960
Me,

670
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,800
I guess so.

671
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,480
Do you have a prototype?

672
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Who is the prototype?

673
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,800
Yuan,

674
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,080
prototype

675
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,400
I can't talk. I'm sorry.

676
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,280
Don't worry,

677
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,120
This question

678
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,680
is purely my personal gossip.

679
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,640
It won't be broadcast.

680
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,800
Sorry,

681
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,360
I have to get ready.

682
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,760
It won't be your agent.

683
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,840
Dugu Ruonan, right?

684
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,440
How dare you mess with me?

685
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,760
Stop picking. Stop picking.

686
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,920
I didn't promise them to pick it.

687
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,120
They arranged it.

688
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,200
Give me the camera.

689
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
I can't take it from you. What are you doing?

690
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,320
Take out the memory card.

691
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Don't let them mess around!

692
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,520
Sida poked him

693
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,160
in the eyes.

694
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
You're so mean.

695
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,840
Don't let her grab it

696
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,640
and give it to me.

697
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,520
My camera,

698
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,920
I can't let her have it.

699
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,600
Mine

700
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,320
How despicable!

701
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,240
Stop it!

702
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,640
Artists are fighting,

703
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,160
agents are in a mess.

704
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Do you want to record it?

705
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,800
They're the director who started it.

706
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,520
Shut up!

707
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,040
Be honest with me.

708
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,240
Is the prototype of the song "Big Woman"

709
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,280
really me?

710
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,440
You knew it.

711
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,120
It doesn't matter whether you know it or not.

712
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,680
You shouldn't have

713
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,520
written this song at all,

714
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,680
Look,

715
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,880
they've got something on you.

716
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,440
Do you know what would happen

717
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,960
if the video just got out?

718
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,960
I don't care what happens,

719
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,520
I don't care

720
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,920
what they think, do I?

721
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,680
I only care about what you think, sister.

722
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,200
You don't care?

723
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,920
So now you want me

724
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,200
to accept you?

725
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,320
You're too young.

726
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,560
Don't treat gratitude

727
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,880
as love.

728
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,800
Yes.

729
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,720
At first, I thought

730
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,880
it was gratitude or worship,

731
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,560
But then I found out,

732
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,000
no,

733
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
I really like your sister.

734
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,120
I really like it.

735
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,840
As long as you're willing,

736
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,440
I'll always be there for you.

737
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,680
Listen carefully.

738
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,640
I don't need you by my side.

739
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,760
You're so young,

740
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,120
do you know what love is?

741
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,440
You're my artist.

742
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,960
I'm your agent.

743
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,280
In my whole life,

744
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,160
I will never fall in love

745
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,960
with an artist again.

746
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,840
There are only two ways for you to go.

747
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,760
Either you can work hard,

748
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,680
or you can terminate the contract immediately.

749
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,720
I'm telling the truth.

750
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,120
Hello.

751
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

752
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,760
the audience in front of the TV,

753
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,200
Good evening, everyone.

754
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,800
Welcome to the Star of Tomorrow Dream Show,

755
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,280
which is exclusively named

756
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,680
by Ruiqi Group.

757
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,640
In the singer contest,

758
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,800
after a fierce competition,

759
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,440
Today on our stage,

760
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,080
there will be the last eight contestants

761
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,720
to take the final qualification.

762
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,880
First of all, let me introduce to you,

763
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,280
the four mentors of this year,

764
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,560
They are famous musicians.

765
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,640
Mr. Wu Yun.

766
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,640
An evergreen tree in the music world,

767
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,680
Mr. Li Li.

768
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,280
The famous American producer,

769
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,520
Mr. Tony,

770
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,600
And the film and television song "The Little King of Sanqi",

771
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,080
Song Zihao.

772
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,199
Okay,

773
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,120
now I'll announce our competition.

774
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,080
It's officially started.

775
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,239
It's already started.

776
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,199
Where did Ruonan go

777
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,159
and he didn't see Ji Mo,

778
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,560
The next

779
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,199
contestant,

780
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,400
His popularity on the Internet

781
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,560
can't be underestimated.

782
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,520
One of his original songs,

783
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,159
Big Woman got the most downloads,

784
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,520
Next, let's welcome

785
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,800
Sida to the stage. Sida,

786
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,719
I love you.

787
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,720
So now you want me

788
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,960
to accept you?

789
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,000
You're too young.

790
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,360
Don't treat gratitude

791
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,480
as love.

792
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,400
I don't need you by my side.

793
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,800
You're my artist.

794
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,320
I'm your agent.

795
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,400
I will never fall in love

796
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,680
with an artist again.

797
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,280
What's going on?

798
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,680
Mentors, I'm sorry,

799
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,160
but I announce my retirement.

800
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,880
-Why? -Why are you quitting? -Sida, don't

801
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,120
leave.

802
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,600
What are you doing?

803
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
Sit down and have a look.

804
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,000
Let's talk about it later.

805
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,840
What should Ruonan do?

806
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,200
Director,

807
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,120
what on earth

808
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,840
is this Star up to?

809
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,880
He even proposed to retire on the spot,

810
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,040
so many reporters

811
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,040
are

812
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,160
putting our show's face on the spot?

813
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,680
It's the director.

814
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,560
Don't be angry.

815
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,440
Sida is a newcomer.

816
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
He's not sensible.

817
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,880
Don't be angry with him.

818
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,280
If you are a newcomer,

819
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,080
you should know more about etiquette and general knowledge.

820
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,080
He's not popular yet.

821
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,240
You dare to go against our program group.

822
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,360
I thought I'd see who would dare

823
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,280
to work with him,

824
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,800
Yes.

825
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,480
It's all my fault.

826
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,480
In fact, I didn't like him at the beginning,

827
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,200
and the company abandoned him long ago.

828
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,160
But if you insist on

829
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,880
using him,

830
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,520
It's hard for me to say anything else.

831
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,440
I should have insisted.

832
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,000
If we had insisted on not using him,

833
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,560
we wouldn't have had the trouble today.

834
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,520
Dugu Ruonan also claims to be

835
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,840
a gold medal broker,

836
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,440
Why did she bring out

837
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,920
such an unprofessional artist?

838
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,880
I wanted to give her a hand.

839
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,200
Look at her artistes,

840
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,120
who made such a big mess

841
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,080
for me,

842
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,480
I don't want to work with her anymore.

843
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,000
Yes,

844
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,520
yes. I'm so disappointed.

845
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,880
Yes.

846
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,880
I understand.

847
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,120
How dare you come here?

848
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,520
Director,

849
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,040
I'm sorry,

850
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,440
I didn't handle it well,

851
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,240
that's why you and the crew

852
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,880
caused such a big loss.

853
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,760
I know it's useless

854
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,600
to say anything now.

855
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,840
But I still

856
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,440
have to apologize to you.

857
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,280
I'm sorry,

858
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,120
is this a problem

859
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,400
that can be solved by saying sorry?

860
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,200
First you fight in groups,

861
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,440
then you quit,

862
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,360
This is the semi-final,

863
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,440
poster photo artist special,

864
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
These materials

865
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,040
have been prepared.

866
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,800
Yes,

867
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,160
our entire program

868
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,840
has spent so much time.

869
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,800
Manpower, material resources and financial resources,

870
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,680
you really can't make up for it.

871
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,480
That's right.

872
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,800
Who will be responsible for

873
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,840
such a big mistake on site?

874
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:50,960
Yes.

875
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,560
What the director said makes sense,

876
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,960
if the male sister

877
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,200
is not what I said,

878
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,560
You can't even

879
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
control an entertainer.

880
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,640
What do you do as an agent?

881
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,640
This matter,

882
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,320
the company will surely be held accountable.

883
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,560
How do you want me,

884
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
the Director of Brokerage Department,

885
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,800
to explain to you?

886
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,560
Do you know that?

887
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,520
Everyone is looking for you.

888
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,960
Why did you suddenly announce your retirement?

889
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,440
Are you worthy of Ruonan?

890
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,960
It's meaningless.

891
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,880
She won't see me again.

892
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,560
What do you mean?

893
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,800
Did you do something to her?

894
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,600
I confessed my love to her.

895
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,240
She rejected me.

896
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,200
Are you crazy?

897
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,640
You don't know

898
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,760
about Lin Huan, do you?

899
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,560
It was a scar in Ruonan's heart,

900
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,280
she swore that she would never

901
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,720
have feelings for her artist again,

902
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,800
And at this time,

903
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,680
you confessed your love to her.

904
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,040
Even if she rejects you,

905
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,120
you should finish

906
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,000
recording this show,

907
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,520
You're so irresponsible.

908
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,160
Sida?

909
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,760
Without her, I don't know who I should

910
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,560
sing this song to?

911
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,320
It's meaningless

912
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,000
if she's not here.

913
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,560
You,

914
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,040
You brat.

915
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,120
You brat Fei'er.

916
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,080
Can we talk nicely?

917
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,360
I really don't know

918
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,560
what to say about you,

919
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,120
Sida?

920
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,920
Loving someone is not impulsive.

921
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,000
But after careful consideration,

922
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
if you still want to

923
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,120
stay with Ruonan,

924
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,080
You just hide your feelings in your heart

925
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,960
and rot them in your stomach.

926
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,000
Let's go.

927
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,880
Tell me honestly.

928
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,720
Have you ever had feelings for me?

929
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,400
Have you ever liked me?
