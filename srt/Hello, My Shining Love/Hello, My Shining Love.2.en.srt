1
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,960
I hate your face.

2
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,720
It seems that people all over the world

3
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,040
It's impossible to leave you.

4
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,800
Do you know why?

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,600
Are all the people avoiding you?

6
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,000
That's because

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,320
You're too arrogant.

8
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,080
You don't care.

9
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,000
The feelings of others.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,360
In your eyes, only work

11
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Only gains and losses,

12
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,520
So you are doomed to be unloved.

13
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,200
That's why Lin Huan left you.

14
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,560
Go back to the crew.

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
We can talk tomorrow.

16
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,360
Is that necessary?

17
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,800
Zihao

18
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,840
Songzihao

19
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,560
You ungrateful woman.

20
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,280
I'm kind enough to help you.

21
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,080
Leave me there.

22
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
And came out.

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,920
The situation I just had

24
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,600
I can only push you out.

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,800
What do you want me to do?

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,360
If it weren't for you,

27
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,480
I can be so embarrassed.

28
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,680
Sir

29
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,440
Your car key.

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,680
The car has been parked for you.

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
What are you doing?

32
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,400
Get off the car

33
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
The car?

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,640
What are you doing?

35
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,560
Don't you want to rent my house?

36
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,320
I'll let you borrow the car.

37
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,280
He's been unstable recently.

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,280
Zihao, don't do anything stupid.

39
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
She was injured in the car accident and suffered a lot of bleeding.

40
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,080
Heart rate is unstable.

41
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,160
25 breaths per minute.

42
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,680
Arterial pressure is 60, 40.

43
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,360
The brain could be severely hit.

44
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,640
Has been in shock.

45
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,360
To the operating room.

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,240
Immediately.

47
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,920
good

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,880
The patient is temporarily out of danger.

49
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,440
She needs to be sent to the ICU.

50
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,320
Continue to observe.

51
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,920
Due to the head injury,

52
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,200
He's still in a coma.

53
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,760
We need further observation.

54
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,040
When will he wake up?

55
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,400
It's hard to say.

56
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,640
He may wake up at any moment.

57
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,520
But it's possible that

58
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,600
And passed out like this.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,720
Depends on his next step.

60
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,680
Hello, President Ji.

61
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,360
good

62
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,880
Good morning, Mr. Ji.

63
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,440
good

64
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,080
Hello, President Ji.

65
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,960
Hello, President Ji.

66
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,040
Hello, President Ji.

67
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,040
Dugu is like a man.

68
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,560
Don't go.

69
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,680
Isn't it great to have a boyfriend?

70
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,240
Really?

71
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,400
You came here to torture the dog?

72
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,880
Dugu is like a man.

73
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,600
Don't go.

74
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,120
Bullying me, not having a boyfriend.

75
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,680
Right?

76
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,520
No, no.

77
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,480
You must give me an explanation.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
I suggest you don't wear it in the future.

79
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,920
This style and material

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,520
Doesn't fit your body shape.

81
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,880
What? Who are you mocking?

82
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,440
Nothing.

83
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,520
Who are you mocking?

84
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,280
Really?

85
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,080
Allen, inform the design department.

86
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,760
The meeting will be held in ten minutes.

87
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,400
President Ji.

88
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,200
For the new season.

89
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,560
We still need to figure out

90
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,000
It might take some time.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,960
Don't think about it.

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,600
I've thought it through for you.

93
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
I want to make a plus-size dress.

94
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,200
A plus-size dress.

95
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,720
A plus-size dress.

96
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,560
that's right

97
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,680
It's for a lady with a big body.

98
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,600
Tailor-made high-end clothing.

99
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,760
Why are you wearing a tight dress?

100
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,200
Can only be designed for thin people.

101
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,920
Everyone enjoys beauty.

102
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,440
And comfortable beauty.

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,440
People tend to be thin.

104
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,520
And appreciate being thin.

105
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,000
Even the clothes

106
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,880
Are designed

107
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,480
Only thin people look good in it.

108
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,440
This kind of aesthetic is sick.

109
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,840
Is twisted.

110
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,040
Wing Fashion wants to be innovative.

111
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,800
To guide you.

112
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,320
To expand the consumption base.

113
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,000
First of all,

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,400
The advanced aesthetic concept.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,360
What's our attitude?

116
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,800
Our attitude is

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,680
To satisfy everyone.

118
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,160
The psychology of female consumers

119
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,520
I want to make a plus-size dress.

120
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,720
Not only the big dress,

121
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,120
The models for the next season.

122
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,680
I also want to use fat models.

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,080
but

124
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,040
Fatty is not fashionable.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,120
Don't laugh at fat people.

126
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,600
Maybe one day,

127
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,440
Would you cry for the fat man?

128
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,160
All right, meeting dismissed.

129
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,960
Male sister.

130
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,520
What should we do next?

131
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,960
To block the news.

132
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,760
As long as possible.

133
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,400
The media knows about it.

134
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,760
Inform the public relations department.

135
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,520
Ask them to make a schedule.

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,760
Before the media knows about it.

137
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,240
And make a response.

138
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,920
good

139
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm going to handle it.

140
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,160
The follow-up situation.

141
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,520
Stay here.

142
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,400
Let me know if you need anything.

143
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,679
If you're a male,

144
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,520
Coffee, please.

145
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,680
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,800
About Zihao's car accident and hospitalization,

147
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,840
Was exposed.

148
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,560
I didn't ask the hospital

149
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,760
To block the news?

150
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,560
How could it get out?

151
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
Not only the hospital,

152
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,880
The picture of the bar last night.

153
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,040
Was also posted on Weibo.

154
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,120
Now the Internet is exploding.

155
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,040
So many reporters.

156
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,120
Give us a call.

157
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,200
gosh!

158
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,880
Call the relevant department meeting.

159
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,040
Male sister.

160
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,240
You haven't slept all night.

161
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,080
How about I help you with the meeting?

162
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,240
Take a rest.

163
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,560
It's okay. Get used to it.

164
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,000
Since the worst scenario

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He's already here.

166
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,200
Let's face it.

167
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,280
It's so cool.

168
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,640
Is this Mr. Ji?

169
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,080
President Ji.

170
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,320
President Ji.

171
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,880
You know that?

172
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,000
What do you know?

173
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,480
Didn't you read the entertainment headlines today?

174
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,960
Song Zihao was in a car accident.

175
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,960
Really?

176
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,840
You don't know

177
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,160
Should I know?

178
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,800
Of course.

179
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,280
Before his car accident,

180
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,400
I was fighting with you.

181
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,680
I fought with him.

182
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,200
That's right.

183
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,720
Look, there are you on the Internet.

184
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,880
Where are the photos of the fight?

185
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,720
The landlord and Song Zihao

186
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,760
There was a conflict.

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,800
You stood up for the landlady.

188
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
I fought with him at the bar.

189
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
President Ji.

190
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,480
feed

191
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,200
Hello

192
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm Dugu Ruuo Man.

193
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,880
I'm looking for you.

194
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,640
I asked Tong Tong for your phone number.

195
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,200
I want to thank you.

196
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,000
Last night

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,520
It happened so suddenly.

198
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,240
How dare you mention last night?

199
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,960
I'm now

200
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,000
The whole company.

201
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,440
I'm kind enough to help you.

202
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,640
And got into a lot of trouble.

203
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,720
sorry

204
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,760
I know.

205
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,360
The photos and rumors on the Internet

206
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,200
Brought you trouble.

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,280
You have a bad reputation.

208
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,480
Don't drag me down.

209
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,160
I don't want to be with you.

210
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,480
With you.

211
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,240
Why did I get a bad reputation?

212
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,160
Even if I have a bad reputation,

213
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,120
I'm in your way.

214
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,760
Anyway, when I met you,

215
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,720
Nothing good.

216
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,560
I don't want to be with your circle.

217
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,880
In any way.

218
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,040
You think I want it to happen?

219
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,200
This kind of thing?

220
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,160
I just want to say thank you.

221
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
Could you please speak better?

222
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,640
Don't thank me.

223
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,480
If it wasn't for the house,

224
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,360
I won't be with you at all.

225
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,200
Together.

226
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,080
I found that knowing you,

227
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,680
It's been eight lifetimes.

228
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,120
you

229
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,680
Hang up.

230
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
bastard

231
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,200
The police have issued a notice.

232
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,040
Even if I didn't name him,

233
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,760
There are so many people at the scene.

234
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,600
Song Zihao and President Ji were fighting.

235
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,120
It's embarrassing.

236
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,040
In a bar fight.

237
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,440
And had a traffic accident.

238
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,840
What will the company do to him?

239
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,040
Male sister, female sister.

240
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,920
Male sister.

241
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,120
This is our public relations department.

242
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,480
And the publicity department

243
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,560
A response plan.

244
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,480
Please have a look.

245
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,400
You can't do this.

246
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
To cancel it.

247
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Since the police have issued a notice,

248
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
How to explain it?

249
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,120
You are trying to cover it up.

250
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,880
Zimmer

251
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,240
You don't want to

252
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,200
Is it related?

253
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,560
I won't.

254
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm coming.

255
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,400
Hello, Miss Dugu.

256
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm a reporter for the Orange Dispatch.

257
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,480
Please tell Song Zihao

258
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,520
How is the injury now?

259
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,680
It will affect his body.

260
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,560
What follow-up?

261
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Song Zihao is stable.

262
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,600
I just need to rest and rest.

263
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,160
I believe that after a period of time,

264
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,240
He will be in a better state.

265
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,120
To face everyone.

266
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,360
Sorry

267
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
I didn't take care of Zihao.

268
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,640
I'm in love with the president of Wing Fashion.

269
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,840
But he's an outsider.

270
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,600
So I don't want

271
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,680
There's too much public opinion.

272
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
To affect him.

273
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,960
President Ji.

274
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,640
This is the new design.

275
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,400
Here, give it to me.

276
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,400
The tone is too dark.

277
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,480
Lack of novelty

278
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,280
I want a visual conflict.

279
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,680
This conflict

280
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,760
More intense.

281
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,240
The more impact it has, the better it is.

282
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,960
Do you know

283
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,000
Why are you pointing at me?

284
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,720
President Ji.

285
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,600
I know you.

286
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,520
It must be strong.

287
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
It has to be powerful.

288
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,120
President Ji.

289
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,320
I didn't expect you

290
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,840
The taste is strong.

291
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,440
What is it?

292
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,760
Isn't this a design?

293
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,520
I know you.

294
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,720
This woman is not bad.

295
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,720
Men don't love you.

296
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
You don't have to think about the world.

297
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,840
What are we doing?

298
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,760
We are artistic.

299
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,960
People who engage in art,

300
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,800
What's wrong with the taste?

301
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,600
is or isn't

302
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,960
Get rid of the characters.

303
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,320
I'm an artist.

304
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,480
You and I don't know much about art.

305
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,440
Don't worry about that.

306
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,560
What are you doing anyway?

307
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,800
I support you.

308
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,000
No

309
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,600
You don't have a fever. You took the wrong medicine.

310
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,200
President Ji.

311
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,480
Stop hiding it from me.

312
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,920
You and the landlady

313
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,800
Sister-in-law

314
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,360
About you and your sister-in-law,

315
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,840
The whole company knows about it.

316
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,000
Your love story.

317
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,360
Has been on the news.

318
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,200
What did you say

319
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,440
Your love story.

320
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,600
It's on the news.

321
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,680
How can you pretend?

322
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,160
Wait a second.

323
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,360
Let me show you something.

324
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,480
I don't believe it.

325
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,520
I'm in love with the president of Wing Fashion.

326
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,800
But he's an outsider.

327
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,040
So I don't want

328
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,720
There's too much public opinion.

329
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,640
To affect him.

330
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,680
No,

331
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,720
I really didn't.

332
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,680
President Ji.

333
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,640
Why are you pretending?

334
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,920
Look, sister-in-law,

335
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,960
How brave you are.

336
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
In front of the media,

337
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,480
To announce your relationship.

338
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,960
You disappointed me.

339
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,240
Brother Lun.

340
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
What should I do now, Brother Lun?

341
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,720
What? What to do?

342
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,800
Accept her.

343
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,360
What a nice girl.

344
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,440
By the way, there's one more thing.

345
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,720
It's all spreading on the Internet.

346
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,000
Songzihao

347
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,640
Because after you two beat me up,

348
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,880
A car accident because of losing control.

349
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,720
I caused the car accident.

350
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,640
play

351
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,120
Go on.

352
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,920
to step aside

353
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Sorry

354
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,480
play

355
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Go on.

356
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,640
I'm not finished with you.

357
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,360
Who is it?

358
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,840
I

359
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,040
Why are you silent?

360
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,520
Guilty, right?

361
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,840
I'm telling you,

362
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,120
I'll count to three.

363
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
If you don't open the door,

364
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Don't come to me for help.

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,960
Wait a second.

366
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,920
Let me change my clothes.

367
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,720
Stop making excuses for me.

368
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,840
I'll count to three.

369
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,800
One or two

370
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,840
three

371
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,120
What's going on?

372
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,360
You really need to change your clothes.

373
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,480
You can change first.

374
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,480
If there's anything, tell me.

375
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,120
To protect their artists,

376
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,520
You sold me, didn't you?

377
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,600
Are you saying that

378
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,160
I told you about the scandal.

379
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,840
I'm also a victim.

380
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,640
I'm a good woman.

381
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,120
It's not impossible.

382
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,800
fart

383
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,280
Has seriously affected

384
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,640
My work and life.

385
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,520
Do you know

386
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,920
It's going to be so messy.

387
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,280
I didn't expect that.

388
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,200
Now?

389
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,080
Not a word or two.

390
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,280
Can be solved.

391
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,040
Anyway, it's already taken.

392
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Why don't you go to the capital city

393
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,480
Last time,

394
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,080
you

395
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,280
I'm telling you,

396
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,920
Don't be too utilitarian.

397
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,200
Be careful.

398
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,560
Do you think I want to

399
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,119
To hang your boyfriend title.

400
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,800
Is the disgrace of my life.

401
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,680
I don't want to talk nonsense to you.

402
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,599
Get changed and explain to me.

403
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
No.

404
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,200
If you want to go, go yourself.

405
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,359
This kind of thing,

406
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,480
I can't make it.

407
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,119
Where are you going?

408
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,800
You rascal.

409
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
metamorphosis

410
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,960
Sex wolf

411
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,200
You run fast.

412
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,080
Open the door and solve it first.

413
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,720
If you don't solve it today,

414
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,760
I'm not leaving.

415
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,800
Then you stay here.

416
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,160
Just stay here.

417
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,760
My legs are soft.

418
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,520
Why are you here so early?

419
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
I told you I'm not leaving.

420
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,600
and

421
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,520
I can't let you

422
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,440
And sneak away.

423
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,320
And sneak away.

424
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,760
Am I such a low-end person?

425
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,920
This is my home.

426
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,400
I went to work openly.

427
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,600
Before you go to work,

428
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,320
To clarify with me.

429
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,400
I told you.

430
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,440
I'm not going.

431
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,400
Save it.

432
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,640
No soft ones, hard ones.

433
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,360
is or isn't

434
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,000
Why?

435
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,280
No, no.

436
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,000
No way

437
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,640
Why did I call you?

438
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,760
what are you doing?

439
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,760
Put me down.

440
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,480
Put me down.

441
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,080
Let me go.

442
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,000
Are you all right?

443
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,320
Is it not hard enough?

444
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,640
My chest hurts.

445
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,960
I can't breathe.

446
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,520
to do sth more quickly

447
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,000
to do sth more quickly

448
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,040
The hospital?

449
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,000
No

450
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,160
Call an ambulance.

451
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,400
Call an ambulance.

452
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,040
Remember to call an ambulance.

453
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,800
Go through the back door.

454
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,800
There's a reporter at the front door.

455
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,760
such

456
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,040
I'll take you to my home.

457
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,560
Let's wait for the ambulance, okay?

458
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,200
can

459
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,920
Alright.

460
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,960
Who passed out.

461
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,880
And worried about reporters.

462
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,080
I was almost fooled by her again.

463
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,480
To play tricks with me.

464
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,240
I want to see

465
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,440
How long can you last?

466
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,400
That's right.

467
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,720
When the ambulance comes,

468
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,280
I'll find a way to escape.

469
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,200
Everything goes according to

470
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,720
My plan will proceed.

471
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,120
I'm a genius.

472
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,080
The doctor is here.

473
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,120
What's wrong? Who is sick?

474
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
She's not sick.

475
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,560
You're not sick.

476
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,760
Why did you call me here?

477
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,920
She has been giving me trouble.

478
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,760
Besides,

479
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,640
And loves acting.

480
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,400
Since she wants to act,

481
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,560
Let's play with her.

482
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,320
You are so happy now.

483
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,400
Come on, let's have a look.

484
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,280
Who is sick?

485
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,240
It's so serious.

486
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,480
doctor

487
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,640
This patient

488
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,160
Is very ill.

489
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,640
It's very difficult to cure.

490
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,880
I tried many ways.

491
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,840
She can't wake up.

492
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,600
This time,

493
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,640
To increase the dose.

494
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,640
How many shots?

495
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Don't worry.

496
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,400
This is the ultimate enhancement.

497
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,280
Make sure she wakes up.

498
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,080
He won't really

499
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,040
Call a doctor.

500
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,360
A few more shots.

501
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,120
it doesn't matter

502
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,840
If she doesn't wake up,

503
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,240
This bottle is all hers.

504
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,480
Zimmer

505
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,400
This dose should be enough.

506
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,120
That's enough. Fill it up.

507
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,680
And fill it up.

508
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,800
That's right.

509
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,360
Where am I

510
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
My head.

511
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,680
Where am I?

512
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,320
Why am I here?

513
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,080
What happened?

514
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,000
My head hurts.

515
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,640
I seem to have fainted.

516
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,600
OMG

517
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,480
I'm fine now.

518
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,160
Then I'm leaving.

519
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,120
What disease can recover so quickly?

520
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,240
Could it be that

521
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,880
What's wrong with you?

522
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,720
Well

523
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,440
I think her spirit

524
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,360
There might be a problem.

525
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,480
That's right.

526
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,400
I am.

527
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
Hypoglycemia

528
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,680
I often lose weight with low blood sugar.

529
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,120
As a woman,

530
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,160
I was hungry and then I fainted.

531
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,080
On TV,

532
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,360
That's how it's done.

533
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,200
It's easy.

534
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,160
All my patients say they are not sick.

535
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,080
to feel relieved

536
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,160
But I'll give you a shot.

537
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,360
You will feel better.

538
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,240
No, no.

539
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,400
Give me a shot. No, no.

540
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Really?

541
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,160
Don't.

542
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,120
Don't shoot. I'm really not sick.

543
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,760
You'll feel better after a shot.

544
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,600
Listen to me.

545
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,120
Give me a shot.

546
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
No, don't touch me.

547
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,760
Don't hit me.

548
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,240
Did you pass out?

549
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,440
The performance is too exaggerated.

550
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,000
This girl

551
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,320
Probably learned acting.

552
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,680
Stanislavsky

553
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,600
Brechts

554
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,760
I'm familiar with it.

555
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,520
Is a good prospect.

556
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,080
Wake

557
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,120
Go on.

558
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,640
All right, young master.

559
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,400
If you don't wake up,

560
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,440
I've given you an injection.

561
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,240
Miss

562
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,880
I'll give you an injection.

563
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,960
You will wake up after a shot.

564
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,240
It's real.

565
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,640
If you don't wake up,

566
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,400
The needle will hit you.

567
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,600
Something is wrong.

568
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,680
She really passed out.

569
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,640
How could it be?

570
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,040
This is saline.

571
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,120
And he didn't even fight.

572
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Come and have a look.

573
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,320
You're really dizzy.

574
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,640
To the hospital.

575
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,200
Hurry up.

576
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
Doctor, what's her condition?

577
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,480
Why did you pass out suddenly?

578
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:08,920
Don't worry.

579
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,080
Nothing serious.

580
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,880
Maybe.

581
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,480
Lack of rest for a long time.

582
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,240
Then I was too stressed.

583
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,240
Which caused her heart rhythm to be irregular.

584
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,400
Decreased immunity.

585
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,800
When I was frightened,

586
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,080
She passed out temporarily.

587
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,440
And rest here for two days.

588
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,320
You'll be fine.

589
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,160
What about

590
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,840
What did the doctor say?

591
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,720
For a few days.

592
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,920
You'll be fine after a rest.

593
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,200
Thank you.

594
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,320
And made a special trip.

595
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,920
Why are you being so courteous to me?

596
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
Back then,

597
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,560
If you don't help,

598
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,160
I can't even hold my diploma.

599
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,080
But then again,

600
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,200
You're the only one

601
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,480
Such a famous student.

602
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
You can change your career.

603
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,280
Our professor still sends emails.

604
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,360
Ask me about you.

605
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
You suddenly changed your job.

606
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,240
Is it because of Su Xiao?

607
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,520
Let's not mention the past.

608
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,720
I'm fine now.

609
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,200
You're doing well.

610
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,200
Is it because of this room?

611
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,160
This woman

612
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,560
What does it have to do with her?

613
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,120
I think it's very important.

614
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,800
For so many years,

615
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,800
I haven't seen you.

616
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,520
Who are you so obsessed with?

617
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,320
You called me all the way here.

618
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,440
Acting with you.

619
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,520
I think she can

620
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,880
To affect your mood.

621
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,920
Is really capable.

622
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,200
Affect my mood.

623
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,720
And angry.

624
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,720
Angry emotions.

625
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,680
It's good.

626
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,560
Really

627
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,160
After you and Su Xiao,

628
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,920
I think you're numb.

629
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:40,960
No one

630
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,920
There's nothing else.

631
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,440
Can affect your mood.

632
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,240
We both studied psychology.

633
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,280
You know very well that

634
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,000
If a person

635
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,880
Without emotion,

636
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
What a terrible thing.

637
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,520
Right?

638
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,600
If she can piss you off,

639
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,120
I really have to thank her.

640
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,000
Don't compare her to Su Xiao.

641
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,840
Alright.

642
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,680
You don't want to hear it. I won't say it.

643
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,400
Okay?

644
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,360
I have something to do in the hospital.

645
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,160
I'm leaving now.

646
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,400
See you later!

647
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,560
Mr. Zhang really said that.

648
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,880
That's right.

649
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,480
He said he would cancel the contract with us.

650
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,160
He said that

651
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,880
I won't contact Ruo anymore.

652
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,960
Let's change.

653
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,240
It seems that this time,

654
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,720
You really made her anxious.

655
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,840
This is the place

656
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,280
Something happened at the junction of bones and eyes.

657
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,240
If the man can't get through,

658
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,960
In that case, we have to replace him.

659
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,840
To contact the advertisers.

660
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
I'll leave it to you.

661
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,600
Boss

662
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,960
I have no problem working.

663
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
But this matter

664
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,920
If she knows about it,

665
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,000
I'll be scolded by her.

666
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,640
How dare she scold you?

667
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,040
She's the boss, I'm the boss

668
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,360
I didn't mean that.

669
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,680
Okay, that's it.

670
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,160
Her job

671
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,440
You'll be in charge for now.

672
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,800
His own artist.

673
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,960
Such a serious thing happened.

674
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,160
And absent without reason.

675
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,440
I really love her for nothing.

676
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,600
What is she doing?

677
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,080
You're awake.

678
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,040
Why am I in the hospital?

679
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,720
I remember.

680
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,600
Is your crazy doctor.

681
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,960
To give me an injection.

682
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,760
I was too nervous to pass out.

683
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,480
He's my senior brother.

684
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,920
And a psychiatrist.

685
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,720
What happened today?

686
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,840
Fortunately, we're here.

687
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,640
Otherwise, he might die at home.

688
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,280
You just died at home.

689
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,800
I'm not kidding you.

690
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,400
A professional woman like you,

691
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,520
Life is stressful.

692
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,360
Working under pressure.

693
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,480
In the body.

694
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,600
The hidden danger of many diseases.

695
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,400
Don't make money by then.

696
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,760
I'm telling you.

697
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,240
I'm fine now.

698
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,360
That's great.

699
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,800
You can go now. Thank you.

700
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,560
That's impossible.

701
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,920
I have to wait for your discharge.

702
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,360
To clear my name?

703
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,800
Don't worry.

704
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,720
You're a patient.

705
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,200
A gentleman like me,

706
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,360
I won't force you.

707
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
I'll take care of you.

708
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,040
You haven't...

709
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,960
Completely devoid of humanity.

710
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Yours is there.

711
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
Eat more fruit.

712
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Supplement your vitamins.

713
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,680
when the moment comes

714
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,600
You wouldn't be in front of reporters.

715
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,480
She fainted.

716
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,160
For a long time.

717
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,600
You have ulterior motives.

718
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,120
To deal with

719
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,400
And unscrupulous woman.

720
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,720
You must use the way of others.

721
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,920
And treat him.

722
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,080
What are you doing?

723
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,360
Can't you leave the hospital?

724
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,640
You've come to the hospital.

725
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,160
I have to meet someone.

726
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,560
I know you care about him.

727
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,720
That's why I brought you here.

728
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,000
To the hospital where he is.

729
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,760
I can't tell.

730
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,040
You're a bad person.

731
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,520
But I still care about

732
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,280
Your artist

733
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,400
I took him for three years.

734
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,400
I watched him go from nobody

735
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,640
Step by step,

736
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,080
And climb to where we are today.

737
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,600
Watch him little by little.

738
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,080
It's shining.

739
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,600
Actually, our agent

740
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,000
Is the artist's designer.

741
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,280
Dreammaker

742
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,480
In my eyes,

743
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,760
Song Zihao is my work.

744
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,000
Like my own child.

745
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,640
Actually, I'm contradictory now.

746
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,000
I regret it.

747
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,200
When he's sober,

748
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,320
Be nice to him.

749
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,720
I was thinking

750
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,280
If I were tougher on him,

751
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,720
Wouldn't he have developed

752
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
Today,

753
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,480
You are arrogant and self-willed.

754
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,000
If I had no choice,

755
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,240
As his manager.

756
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,960
He may still be the one

757
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
Nobody

758
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,000
At least it can be healthy.

759
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,680
You don't have to lie here.

760
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,240
I'm going to rest.

761
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,160
Go back first.

762
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,440
I'm exhausted.

763
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,680
President Ji, you're finally here.

764
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,080
There's an entertainment reporter inside.

765
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,800
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

766
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,640
You can't drive them away.

767
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,760
What have you been doing these days?

768
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,640
Why didn't you come to work?

769
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,280
Taking care of patients in the hospital.

770
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,080
Who's sick?

771
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,360
Hello, President Ji.

772
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,440
We're entertainment reporters.

773
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,000
You want to take Song Zi's car accident

774
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,760
To interview you.

775
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,360
OK?

776
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,920
All the details about this matter.

777
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,640
According to the police report,

778
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,600
I hope the client can recover as soon as possible.

779
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,160
I hope that

780
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,520
Don't give her too much pressure.

781
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,080
President Ji.

782
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,800
That was so cool.

783
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,960
perfect

784
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,640
No, President Ji, I think

785
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,680
You're not interested in this relationship.

786
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,800
It's not the same.

787
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,360
I haven't seen you before.

788
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,840
Other girls are like this.

789
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,640
Even in this world,

790
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,080
There's no woman left.

791
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,040
And I won't fall in love with Dugu Ruuo.

792
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,160
Go to work

793
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,920
What do advertisers say?

794
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,840
I made an appointment yesterday.

795
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,640
You didn't come all of a sudden.

796
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,960
They're very angry.

797
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,160
He said he wanted to cancel the contract.

798
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,480
When we signed the contract,

799
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,920
All kinds of requests.

800
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,160
Now something has happened,

801
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,120
You're looking for barbs.

802
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,440
So snobbish.

803
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,880
But that's right.

804
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,680
People are like this.

805
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,400
Everyone is the icing on the cake.

806
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,840
Who would give timely help?

807
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
At this moment,

808
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,400
No one will jump out.

809
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,680
To speak for me.

810
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,680
The artist, Song Zihao.

811
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,840
Speeding incidents

812
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,800
Has aroused wide public concern.

813
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,640
Hello, President Ji.

814
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,640
If you want, Song Zihao.

815
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,280
The car accident

816
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,800
Can I do an interview with you?

817
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,880
to wait a moment

818
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,680
All the details about this matter.

819
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,400
According to the police report,

820
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,360
I hope the client can recover as soon as possible.

821
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,960
I hope that

822
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,080
Don't give her too much pressure.

823
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,880
Male sister.

824
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,040
You two have made a deal.

825
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,240
Why didn't you tell me?

826
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,680
You scared me.

827
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,120
I didn't agree with him.

828
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,040
I didn't tell you.

829
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,120
Why is he so cooperative?

830
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,400
Why is he?

831
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Why else?

832
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,000
But it's because

833
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,520
My personal charm

834
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,360
Yes, he must be infatuated with you.

835
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,960
although

836
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,760
His love for me

837
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,480
Is doomed to be unrewarded.

838
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,120
But he helped me, right?

839
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,920
He's busy

840
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,320
I still want to thank him.

841
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,400
When it's important,

842
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,040
Is quite manly.

843
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,719
Strangled me.

844
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
I can't breathe.

845
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,400
It's all your fault.

846
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,360
Before getting on the plane,

847
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,280
What do you want me to eat?

848
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,520
Don't you know that starch and meat

849
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Will it produce fat?

850
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,680
You just had a little bite.

851
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,080
And then threw up on the plane.

852
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,320
I'm a model.

853
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,280
I can't have it on me.

854
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,320
A bit of fatty meat.

855
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,720
I can only wear the smallest size.

856
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,680
Are you imitating me?

857
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,400
No.

858
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,560
Do you think I'll be fat

859
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,200
Will the audience still like me?

860
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,640
Do you think the photographers

861
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,240
Will you still film me?

862
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,920
I was wrong.

863
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
I won't be there again.

864
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,320
How about eating in front of you?

865
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,800
I'm already hungry.

866
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,760
You don't even have the strength.

867
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,520
I have to

868
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,680
You're smiling.

869
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,000
I really...

870
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,520
Alright.

871
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,440
I know you're tired.

872
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,480
Master, take Phil home.

873
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,560
No, I'm not going home.

874
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,960
I'm going to a place.

875
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,640
Because I want to meet

876
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,480
Special people.

877
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,760
So hungry.

878
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,200
I heard that

879
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,320
In front of the reporters,

880
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,640
Put on a good show.

881
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,880
You're good at acting.

882
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,720
Thanks.

883
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,960
Seems a little too cold.

884
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,520
today

885
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,640
I'm here to thank you.

886
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Thank you.

887
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,560
In front of reporters,

888
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,480
To expose me.

889
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,680
Thank you

890
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,520
Thank you.

891
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,080
Thank you.

892
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,960
It's too unimposing.

893
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,120
No, no.

894
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,240
Less cold.

895
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,600
More of my own.

896
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,440
style

897
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,640
You know,

898
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,320
In our industry,

899
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,360
Recurrent

900
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,760
Dealing with reporters.

901
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,600
But thank you for today.

902
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,480
Thank you for helping me.

903
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,200
A good prospect.

904
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,800
I turned around for you.

905
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,800
Doing acting exercises.

906
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,160
I'm here to see you.

907
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,640
If it's because

908
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,920
About the reporter today,

909
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,880
You're welcome.

910
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,720
Who said I wanted to thank you?

911
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,680
Then why are you here?

912
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,920
Peeping at me.

913
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,960
I'm here to ask you.

914
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,920
Why today?

915
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,400
Suddenly changed his mind.

916
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,480
Is it because of me?

917
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,640
Don't be narcissistic.

918
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,320
I'm just too lazy to talk to those reporters.

919
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Just talking.

920
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,520
Next time you come to my house,

921
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,720
Remember to change your shoes.

922
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,280
Don't dirty my floor.

923
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,200
What are you talking about?

924
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,760
And this is my home.

925
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,720
To rent to you temporarily.

926
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,160
Turn around for you.

927
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,760
I will turn around.

928
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Is there any surprise?

929
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,040
Who are you?

930
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,720
I should ask you that.

931
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
I'm Ruo's boyfriend's friend.

932
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,440
I'm here to see Ruonan.

933
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,680
Is she there?

934
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,960
Wait

935
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,000
Are you her?

936
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,720
Your boyfriend?

937
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,840
Don't get me wrong.

938
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,440
She rented this house to me.

939
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,040
I'm looking at you.

940
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,480
Why are you so familiar?

941
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
From where?

942
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,680
You look familiar. It's normal.

943
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,120
After all, many people know me.

944
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,240
But we

945
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,520
You must have never seen it before.

946
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,800
If you're a man,

947
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,960
I rented the house to you.

948
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,840
Where is she?

949
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,960
It's 4 & 1 upstairs.

950
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,040
understand

951
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,120
Thanks, handsome.

952
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,240
You have to be an actor again.

953
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,240
Pleasantly surprised

954
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,600
How could it be you?

955
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,440
Come in.

956
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,040
I wanted to give you a surprise.

957
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,840
I didn't expect that

958
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,800
Who knew you moved?

959
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,600
The handsome guy downstairs

960
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,520
He said you live upstairs.

961
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,360
But I'm curious.

962
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,560
Why did you move?

963
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,560
It's a long story. Change your shoes.

964
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,080
Come in, I'm telling you.

965
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,520
Did you miss me?

966
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,240
It's great to have you back.

967
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,680
Then I will have a partner.

968
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,600
Tell me the truth.

969
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,360
Have you got a boyfriend?

970
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,560
Love is the most important thing

971
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,160
Is not a necessity.

972
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,800
Is likely to become

973
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
consumables

974
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,400
Why should I bother?

975
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,320
You have to

976
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,880
Learn from me, you know?

977
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,760
To have more relationships.

978
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,200
Haven't you heard of it?

979
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,320
Love is the best for women.

980
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,160
Skincare products.

981
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,120
I've gone through

982
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,080
When I was young.

983
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,920
When you're with someone,

984
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,080
It's hard to find the strengths of each other.

985
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,960
Instead, you should think about

986
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,040
Each other's shortcomings.

987
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,200
I'm thinking that when it's over,

988
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,360
How could I?

989
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,360
Without being hurt.

990
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,480
Stop talking about me. Let's talk about you.

991
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,920
How many new boyfriends?

992
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,840
Let me have a drink first.

993
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,800
I'll talk to you later.

994
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,720
Go ahead.

995
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,360
Alright.

996
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,200
Slow down.

997
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,560
Go straight ahead.

998
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,120
What? It's so mysterious.

999
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,840
We're almost there.

1000
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,080
Okay, one more step forward.

1001
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,760
one

1002
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,120
to be ready

1003
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,080
I let go.

1004
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,960
What about

1005
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,280
Where is this?

1006
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,160
This is our home.

1007
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,600
Didn't you say that

1008
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,760
Get married if you have a house?

1009
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,960
You have a house now.

1010
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,880
Marry me

1011
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,560
Stop it.

1012
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,800
I just came back.

1013
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,560
After two years,

1014
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,160
But I can't wait.

1015
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,160
What do you mean?

1016
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,800
Don't you see that?

1017
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,680
I'm proposing to you.

1018
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,280
I'm a girl.

1019
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,560
I don't need to be reserved.

1020
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,480
You're a boy.

1021
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,760
What principles do you insist on?

1022
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,720
Zimmer, marry me.

1023
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,960
Marry me. Let's get married.

1024
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,680
Xiao, why don't you understand?

1025
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,120
What do I mean?

1026
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,480
Don't listen to me.

1027
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,640
Zimmer

1028
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,960
We're here.

1029
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,880
Let's put one here.

1030
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,440
It's a big sofa.

1031
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,280
Then what?

1032
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,640
If we have a fight,

1033
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,480
I will punish you for sleeping on the couch.

1034
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Then this way.

1035
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,480
here

1036
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,080
Let's put a desk.

1037
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,360
And put an easel.

1038
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,520
Then you read the psychology book.

1039
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,080
What time is it?

1040
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,960
I can draw the design.

1041
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,320
This way.

1042
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,120
Look. Look this way.

1043
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,280
Suxiao

1044
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,160
Xiao

1045
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,120
Where are you, Xiao?

1046
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,040
Suxiao

1047
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,920
Su Xiao, where are you?

1048
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,000
Suxiao

1049
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,080
sorry

1050
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,360
sorry

1051
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,480
sorry
