1
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,720
What did you do to Sida?

2
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,600
Why did he faint?

3
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,440
I really,

4
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,520
I didn't do anything just now.

5
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,760
But it's

6
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,520
what I did before,

7
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,760
It doesn't count.

8
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,680
What did you do to him?

9
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,840
Nothing.

10
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,600
Nothing What is it?

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,120
I...

12
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,160
I just kissed him,

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,120
What?

14
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,080
You,

15
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Kiss him.

16
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,840
Yes, I like him.

17
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,160
-I kissed him. -What's wrong? I... I kissed

18
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,640
him under the bus.

19
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,760
You're fired.

20
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,000
Boss,

21
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,040
are you looking for me?

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,040
Hold on.

23
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,600
Hello, boss,

24
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,120
Sis Nan,

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,000
I asked you to come here today.

26
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,960
Mainly to talk about

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,200
the recent situation of artists,

28
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
The launch of Star's new song

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
was a great success.

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,720
It's all Ruonan's credit.

31
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,160
Unexpectedly,

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,880
you really brought Sida's career

33
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,080
back to life.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,360
I'm convinced.

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,080
What needs does Sida have in the future?

36
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,920
As for all the resources in the company,

37
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,800
you can allocate them at will.

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,360
What about me?

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,480
I will fully support you.

40
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,400
Thank you, boss.

41
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,560
What's wrong with you?

42
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,840
Do you know

43
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
Song Zihao came to me,

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,680
He said he wanted to replace you as his agent.

45
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,840
When Ruonan

46
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,760
took Song Zihao,

47
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,040
No matter what their relationship

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,640
is like?

49
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,240
At the very least, he is obedient.

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,520
How did you get it?

51
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,520
It's going to be a little trouble

52
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,240
in a few days,

53
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,800
How did you become an agent?

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,120
As you know,

55
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,080
Zihao has a childish temper,

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,360
Actually, we are

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,320
quite close

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
in private,

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,200
I'll take care of this.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,840
I won't bother you anymore.

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,280
It's best if it can be solved.

62
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
If it can't be solved,

63
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,480
Why don't you

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,160
just step down from

65
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,600
the position of Director of Brokerage,

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,800
Back then, I asked you to take over

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,000
Ruonan's job temporarily,

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,240
It doesn't mean you can

69
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,000
keep working.

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,560
I'm a businessman.

71
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,840
I only care about the pros and cons.

72
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't care about the relationship.

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,520
There's no need for me to say more about

74
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,200
the fact that the capable are superior to the weak.

75
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,480
Yes

76
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,800
Dugu Ruonan.

77
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,080
You must be the boss.

78
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,440
Dugu Ruonan wants to fire me

79
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,720
for no reason?

80
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,640
A personal vendetta.

81
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,880
It's none of your business.

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,480
Ruonan,

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,160
what's going on?

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,200
Report to the boss

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,520
that she ignored the traffic rules,

86
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,240
No professional ethics.

87
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
He has been fired by me.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,960
Are you leaving or not?

89
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,360
I'll call security if you don't leave.

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,160
My dad is the chairman of Ruiqi,

91
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,480
unless you want to give up

92
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,600
Ruiqi's endorsement,

93
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,360
Otherwise, I'll see who dares to fire me.

94
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,480
Are you Mr. Shen's daughter?

95
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,320
You're working for Sida

96
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,160
as an assistant.

97
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,480
Does Mr. Shen know about this?

98
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,120
My... My dad doesn't know.

99
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,640
But I just

100
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
want to work here?

101
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,840
I just want to be

102
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Sida's assistant.

103
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,240
Okay. Ruonan,

104
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,520
let's keep her.

105
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,560
If you don't understand,

106
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,480
you can teach her.

107
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,320
I don't agree.

108
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,720
I don't care who she is.

109
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,640
I have to be responsible for my artistes.

110
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,320
This is an agency,

111
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,640
not a shelter.

112
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,160
I don't have time to fool around with her,

113
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
Dugu Ruonan,

114
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,200
You've gone too far. Come on,

115
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,280
come on,

116
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,120
I told her,

117
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,680
if a man comes to talk to me,

118
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,520
Look.

119
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,480
What are you doing?

120
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,080
You can't just stand on your own side.

121
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,640
You have to stand in the company's shoes.

122
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,560
After all, the cooperation between the two companies

123
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,040
is too stiff and not good-looking.

124
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
Boss,

125
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
I think it's better to do this,

126
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Ask Miss Shen

127
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,640
to come to my team,

128
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,200
I happen to be short of people too.

129
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,360
Tong Tong is so thoughtful.

130
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,680
Are you sure

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,160
you can control her?

132
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,240
If the male sister is usually too busy,

133
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,520
and she doesn't have much patience to bring new people,

134
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,680
But I do.

135
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,360
Why did you hear that I wanted someone?

136
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,640
I don't want to let it go.

137
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,520
No, no,

138
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,560
I've never wanted to

139
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,480
take this thunder.

140
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,880
Take it if you like it.

141
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,200
Enjoy your meal.

142
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,960
I'm still here.

143
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,440
You don't know what to do.

144
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,240
I just want to stay by Sida's side.

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,120
It's okay,

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,800
We're all in the same company,

147
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,240
so we don't look up at each other.

148
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,720
Besides, when I bring new people,

149
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm much more tolerant than Ruonan.

150
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,480
Okay,

151
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,640
It's settled.

152
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,120
Just follow Tong Tong,

153
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,160
who is the Director of Brokerage,

154
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,640
I can rest assured that you'll follow her.

155
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,320
Yes,

156
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,600
All right.

157
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,800
Good luck.

158
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
You like Sida, right?

159
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,360
How do you know?

160
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,840
You are so obvious,

161
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,480
the discerning person can see it at a glance.

162
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,960
But what about Ruonan?

163
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,040
She has always been very strict

164
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,960
with her artists,

165
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,200
With her in the middle,

166
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,920
you want to get close to Sida?

167
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,440
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

168
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,600
It's

169
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
because of her.

170
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,560
Sida doesn't even talk to me now,

171
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,440
and I did it under Ruonan.

172
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,120
I understand how you feel,

173
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,520
so I'm not trying my best

174
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,760
to get you to me.

175
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,840
However,

176
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,480
I may have to let you down in the future.

177
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,400
Be my assistant.

178
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,120
Don't feel aggrieved.

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,280
Thanks to you.

180
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,280
If it weren't for you,

181
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
I would have been driven away

182
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,120
by Dugu Ruonan.

183
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,640
But don't worry,

184
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,000
if you need it in the future,

185
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,040
Just tell me.

186
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,680
I will work hard.

187
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,920
Let Dugu Ruonan regret it.

188
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,840
She will regret it.

189
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,720
Exactly

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,560
Qiansha, in my opinion,

191
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,640
you should go back first today,

192
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,160
Come back to the company tomorrow.

193
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,680
I'll arrange the rest

194
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,560
for you then.

195
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,120
Okay?

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll get going then.

197
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:42,840
Thank you.

198
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,360
Go ahead.

199
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Isn't he Sida's assistant?

200
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Why am I with you?

201
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,680
She will be my assistant from now on.

202
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,920
The boss should have told you, right?

203
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,080
I want to replace you.

204
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,480
Zihao,

205
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
I know that between us,

206
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,160
There might be some misunderstandings.

207
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,240
But these things,

208
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,640
we can settle them in private.

209
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,920
Don't always

210
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,800
mess with the boss.

211
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,560
No misunderstanding.

212
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,880
Your ability

213
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,680
is already there.

214
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,640
You don't deserve

215
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,400
to be my agent,

216
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,920
also

217
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,960
I've given you the chance.

218
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,360
But you always lose to

219
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,160
Dugu Ruonan,

220
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,520
I don't want to play the role

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,280
of loser with you all the time.

222
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,320
Then let Sida be your first brother.

223
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,680
The boss has just decided

224
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,080
to activate all the resources of the company,

225
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
To help Sida,

226
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,480
your first brother's position,

227
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,559
I'm afraid it'll be dangerous.

228
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,760
What if I were you?

229
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,600
I'll think about it now.

230
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,360
How can you join hands with me

231
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,039
to deal with Dugu Ruonan and Sida?

232
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,679
Instead of standing here.

233
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,600
Fighting with me,

234
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,480
I'm now the Director of Brokerage

235
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
of this company,

236
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,200
If I don't help you,

237
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm afraid your situation

238
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,280
will be even worse.

239
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,680
Also,

240
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,080
don't always compare me

241
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,800
with Dugu Ruonan,

242
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,080
Even if you think

243
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,120
I'm not as good as her.

244
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,640
But please don't forget,

245
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,320
how did you get into my hands?

246
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,680
It's because she didn't want you back then.

247
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,760
Say it again,

248
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,760
Zihao,

249
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
I'm telling you this,

250
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,720
actually, to tell you,

251
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,280
I'm not your obstacle.

252
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,280
We are teammates

253
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,360
on the same side,

254
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,560
And now I have

255
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,400
an extra helper,

256
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,520
We will defeat

257
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,400
Dugu Ruonan,

258
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,840
Who is it?

259
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,160
Shen Qiansha,

260
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,600
you probably don't know

261
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,320
who she is, do you?

262
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
As the daughter of Mr. Shen of Ruiqi Group,

263
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,560
I'll keep her by my side.

264
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,120
She's my bargaining chip.

265
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,880
With her,

266
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,640
the spokesperson of Ruiqi Group,

267
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,600
Only you.

268
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,280
What do you think?

269
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,760
Do you want me to be your substitute?

270
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,320
Let Sida be my first brother

271
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,680
and tell me,

272
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,680
You actually like me, don't you?

273
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,360
I've been here

274
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,080
today.

275
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,800
What else

276
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,200
do you want me to do?

277
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,760
Just admit that you like me.

278
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,960
Is it that hard?

279
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,720
So you're rejecting me?

280
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,720
Have you thought it through?

281
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,280
For someone like me,

282
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,280
I won't repeat

283
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,200
what I just said.

284
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,200
Do you know what an agent is?

285
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,040
An agent is the other side

286
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,000
of an artist.

287
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,720
Every time I wanted to cry,

288
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,040
I would come to eat spicy pot.

289
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,000
Order the spiciest pot bottom,

290
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,600
then make yourself so hot

291
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,800
that you cry,

292
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,120
This way, when I want to cry,

293
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,320
no one will find out that

294
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm actually crying.

295
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,000
Hello, sir.

296
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,160
Are you waiting for someone?

297
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,040
I can see that your pot

298
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,160
has been cooked for a long time.

299
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,360
Do you want me to help you?

300
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,400
Turn off the fire first.

301
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,840
No need.

302
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
I'm the only one eating.

303
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,080
Boss,

304
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,040
can you do me a favor?

305
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,840
Go ahead.

306
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,680
This person

307
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,440
is my friend.

308
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,760
Every time she comes to your place,

309
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,520
she always orders spicy pot.

310
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,720
Besides, there are a lot of chilies,

311
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,240
and when she comes next time,

312
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,320
Can you put less chilies in it?

313
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,600
She can't eat spicy food.

314
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,120
She has a bad stomach,

315
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,560
You're still trying to be brave.

316
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,640
My stomach doesn't feel well after eating spicy food every time.

317
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,520
Is she your girlfriend?

318
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,120
Since you don't want her to eat spicy food,

319
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,120
why don't you come together

320
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,920
next time?

321
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:25,960
Okay,

322
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,160
I remember.

323
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
-Okay. -Enjoy your meal. -Sida

324
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,800
Fire.

325
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,640
Now we can

326
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
have a good sleep.

327
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,440
Congratulations,

328
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,040
Ruonan. It's too early to be happy.

329
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,480
Although the broadcast broke the record,

330
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,120
we still need to promote it more.

331
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
I need to contact the producers.

332
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,720
It's best to get a chance

333
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,600
to sing the theme song or episode

334
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,400
of a popular TV series.

335
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,280
Only in this way can we

336
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,680
consolidate our popularity and popularity.

337
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,120
All right,

338
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,120
write down

339
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,040
what I just said.

340
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,680
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

341
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,360
Okay,

342
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,440
Sida?

343
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,520
Come with me.

344
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Gosh, that's great!

345
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,360
That's great,

346
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,080
Sida! That's great!

347
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
That's great.

348
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,560
How can you be so great?

349
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,160
Sis, you … You

350
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,640
… You … We created a miracle … Sida,

351
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,120
That's great.

352
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,680
Sis,

353
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,840
Your phone is ringing.

354
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,480
The phone is ringing.

355
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,160
Who is it?

356
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
What a bummer.

357
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,520
Hello,

358
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,440
Mr. Zhao,

359
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,520
Ruonan,

360
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,920
I heard that Star's new album

361
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,440
was very popular as soon as it was released.

362
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,280
So I want to celebrate with you.

363
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,680
Are you free tonight?

364
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,280
By the way,

365
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,440
let's talk about the next cooperation,

366
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,960
I have a bottle of good wine

367
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,600
that has been treasured for many years,

368
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,320
I want to drink it with you.

369
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,400
Okay,

370
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,400
I'll pick you up from work later.

371
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,000
Okay, see you later.

372
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,240
Xiao Wu,

373
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,760
go take out my bottle of Moutongbao wine

374
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,560
that I've been collecting for years,

375
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,040
Mr. Zhao,

376
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,600
didn't you take that bottle

377
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,480
at the auction in London

378
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,240
a few years ago?

379
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,000
This wine is out of print now,

380
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,520
and it's very collectible.

381
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,880
I just drank it.

382
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,080
Isn't it a pity?

383
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,600
It's not a pity.

384
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,720
It's wine.

385
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,640
It's for drinking.

386
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,640
It would be great

387
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,160
if I could drink

388
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
with the woman I love.

389
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,800
Have you heard about it?

390
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,240
Star's album sales

391
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,880
are in the third place.

392
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,440
Really?

393
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,240
I didn't pay much attention to him.

394
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,720
The music market

395
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,920
doesn't make much money now.

396
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,520
You don't have to care too much.

397
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,800
No matter how hard he tried,

398
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,560
he couldn't catch up with you.

399
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,120
You're popular,

400
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,200
and you earn more money than him.

401
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,080
Of all the plays I picked up for you,

402
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,000
he made ten albums

403
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,960
out of one.

404
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,360
Okay,

405
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,720
I won't compete with him.

406
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll compete with myself.

407
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,520
The TV series you picked up for me

408
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,280
is to make more money,

409
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,440
But I want to ask you,

410
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,040
when you answered it for me,

411
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,080
Have you read the script

412
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,840
carefully or not,

413
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,960
This script is so bad

414
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,360
that I can't even read it myself.

415
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,240
Dugu Ruonan took a lot of plays

416
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,320
for me before.

417
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,080
But she also pays a lot of attention

418
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,920
to the quality of the script,

419
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,880
Have you figured it out or not?

420
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,680
I'm a professional actress.

421
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,200
What I need is a good work,

422
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,520
but now it's good,

423
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,320
Ever since you became

424
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,400
my agent,

425
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,240
The scenes he took for me

426
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,280
were worse and worse.

427
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,640
So what?

428
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,400
Are you going to put a slogan

429
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,280
on my head,

430
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,440
You're a bad drama specialist, right?

431
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,440
Can we not be so low-level?

432
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,400
A little pursuit, okay?

433
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,720
Zihao,

434
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
your position is idol.

435
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,200
Idol actors eat

436
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,960
youth meals,

437
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,240
Sometimes,

438
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,599
you have to learn to be content.

439
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,640
How could this matter

440
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,599
be so complicated,

441
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,079
You're talking about

442
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,160
something. Am I disturbing you?

443
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,319
It's okay.

444
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,960
We just finished talking.

445
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,560
Come on,

446
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,640
Come in.

447
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,480
Let me introduce you,

448
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,080
this is Song Zihao,

449
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,000
The biggest artist in our company,

450
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,880
I know.

451
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,760
A celebrity?

452
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,720
Who says I'm a celebrity?

453
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,760
I'm an actress.

454
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,120
Last time in the elevator,

455
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,040
you told me,

456
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,680
Why did you come to see me?

457
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,520
I just want to tell you,

458
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,320
it's my

459
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,160
first day at work,

460
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,120
But there's no job

461
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,040
assigned to me at all.

462
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,000
Why don't you

463
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,880
arrange some work for me.

464
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,400
Don't worry,

465
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,560
I won't do it, okay?

466
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,480
I can learn anything.

467
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,680
I'm smart.

468
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,280
You don't have to rush.

469
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,960
Get familiar with the working environment

470
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,720
first,

471
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,600
Do you also think my dad

472
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,640
is the chairman of Ruiqi,

473
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,480
That's why I'm here.

474
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,400
You don't want me to work at all,

475
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,480
do you also think

476
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,360
I'm a vase,

477
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,280
No.

478
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,160
I don't think so.

479
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,720
Follow me.

480
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,760
Be my assistant.

481
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,240
Let me arrange work for you.

482
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,760
That's right.

483
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,800
Zihao just needs an assistant recently,

484
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
so you should follow him.

485
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,920
You.

486
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,440
What's wrong?

487
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,240
What are you waiting for?

488
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,040
Let's go.

489
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,320
Keep up!

490
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,320
Shen Qiansha,

491
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Sida?

492
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,600
Why are you here?

493
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
What a coincidence.

494
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Shen Qiansha,

495
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,880
how many times do you want me to say this?

496
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,200
Stop following me.

497
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,120
It's really annoying for you

498
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,200
to follow me like this,

499
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,360
Who followed you?

500
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,120
I'm taking the bus here.

501
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,200
Think about it,

502
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,040
-You're here. -I'm coming.

503
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,960
What is this?

504
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,440
This is fate.

505
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,400
Cut it out.

506
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,480
You have a car and a driver,

507
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,960
why are you taking a bus with me?

508
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,280
I have a car,

509
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,680
but,

510
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,560
But my car

511
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,640
is not as big as a bus,

512
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,640
I told you,

513
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,400
from today on,

514
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,080
So I took the bus.

515
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,960
Then please, in the future,

516
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
when you take the bus,

517
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,720
Are you at the wrong time with me?

518
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,640
I really don't want to see you anymore.

519
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,280
Why?

520
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,960
From now on, you'll be able to see me

521
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
even after I let you go to work and work.

522
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,280
I didn't like to

523
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,240
take the bus before,

524
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,400
But when I sit down,

525
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,520
I like it.

526
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,880
You don't like me now,

527
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,400
but if you look at me,

528
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,120
Then you like it.

529
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,000
Have a seat yourself.

530
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,440
Where are you going?

531
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:12,920
You're not going home?

532
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,760
Shen Qiansha,

533
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,120
do you understand that I don't like you.

534
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,360
I didn't like it before,

535
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,200
I don't like it now,

536
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,520
I won't like it in the future.

537
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,240
Got it?

538
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,040
Qianqiansha,

539
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,680
Qiansha,

540
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,320
Qiansha,

541
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,280
are you crying?

542
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,880
I'm sorry.

543
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,760
I was too loud just now,

544
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,960
so I just wanted to tell you,

545
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,720
No, I won't.

546
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,400
Shen Qiansha,

547
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,680
why can't you understand

548
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,040
what I'm telling you?

549
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,000
Sida?

550
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,440
Don't think I'm cheeky.

551
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,400
Shameless.

552
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,280
If I treat you like this,

553
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,040
I'll be so proud when I'm out there.

554
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,760
I won't give up easily.

555
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,200
It's not easy for me

556
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
to fall in love with someone,

557
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,280
I can't let you scare me away

558
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
with just a few words.

559
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,920
As long as you're not with

560
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,520
Dugu Ruonan,

561
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,760
I have a chance.

562
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,200
What's a rival in love?

563
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,480
What is rejection?

564
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
In front of the feeling that my heart is beating,

565
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,760
it's worthless.

566
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,120
Love that you can give up.

567
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,320
It's not called love.

568
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:29,880
Yes.

569
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,400
You're right.

570
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,880
You think I'm right,

571
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,120
too.

572
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,000
I finally

573
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,600
fell in love with someone,

574
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,960
How can you give up so easily?

575
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,800
Love that gives up easily.

576
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,560
That's not love.

577
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,760
What do you mean by refusing?

578
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,040
What is a rival in love?

579
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,800
As long as Zhao Yucheng

580
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,000
doesn't catch up with Ruonan,

581
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,240
I'll have a chance

582
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,760
to talk for a long time. You didn't talk about us.

583
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,080
What about Ruonan?

584
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,800
Listen,

585
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,440
you and Dugu Ruonan,

586
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,600
That's not love at all.

587
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
Just give up.

588
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,720
Why can't we call it love?

589
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,680
I won't

590
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
call you. If I say no,

591
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,200
I won't call a taxi.

592
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,520
Get in the car.

593
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,480
I'm leaving.

594
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,480
Eat up.

595
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,720
The food is rotten.

596
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,720
Why are you still eating spicy food?

597
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,800
If I don't eat them all,

598
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,080
you'll have to eat them.

599
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,320
It's so spicy that it hurts your stomach.

600
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,920
What are you thinking?

601
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,440
Nothing.

602
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,240
It occurred to me that

603
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,400
I once went to

604
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,840
that hot pot restaurant for dinner.

605
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,680
I'm really old.

606
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:11,840
When I first

607
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,080
came to this city,

608
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,560
I always want to leave

609
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,480
some memories behind,

610
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,880
Prove that you existed.

611
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,000
But now

612
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,520
I want to forget those memories,

613
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,120
Forget the traces

614
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
that you once existed.

615
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,840
Actually, there's no way

616
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,040
to delete a memory.

617
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,440
However,

618
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,560
we can use new memories,

619
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,400
Cover it.

620
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,280
Don't worry,

621
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
that bad

622
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,160
memory of yours,

623
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,600
Leave it to me.

624
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,200
This wine with hot pot,

625
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,640
isn't it too extravagant?

626
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,640
I won't

627
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,360
I'll enjoy it with you.

628
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,520
It won't be a luxury.

629
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,080
I hope this wine

630
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,120
can be a good memory for you.

631
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,560
Eat something.

632
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,120
Mr. Zhao,

633
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,320
regarding the proposal of Star

634
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,920
endorsing Ruiqi,

635
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,520
Ruonan,

636
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,680
what do I think?

637
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,880
We should create memories first.

638
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,480
Then we'll talk about work.

639
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,040
And don't call me

640
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,560
Mr. Zhao again.

641
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,440
Call me Zhao.

642
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,840
Zhao, Zhao,

643
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,840
though,

644
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,960
We're a little slow.

645
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,680
It's a little late.

646
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,280
But every time we meet,

647
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,600
there's always progress.

648
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:17,960
Right?

649
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,320
Come on, let's go.

650
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
For the contract.

651
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,240
Me,

652
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,800
I need to go to the washroom.

653
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,120
Boss,

654
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,520
check out Block A4,

655
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,520
Okay

656
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,760
Miss, you can't eat spicy food anymore.

657
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,640
Otherwise, your boyfriend

658
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,040
will worry about you.

659
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,680
Boss, you got it wrong.

660
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,480
I don't have a boyfriend.

661
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,800
It can't be wrong.

662
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,800
A lot of customers come to our restaurant

663
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,480
to eat hot pot,

664
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,640
But to you two,

665
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,920
I'm the most impressed.

666
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,720
You see,

667
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,680
when one comes,

668
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,920
Try your best to order spicy hot pot,

669
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,640
and cry

670
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,000
while eating.

671
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,960
You came to our hot pot restaurant

672
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,600
in a hurry and told me,

673
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,160
If his girlfriend has a bad stomach,

674
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,640
she won't be allowed to eat spicy pot.

675
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,720
You two are a perfect match.

676
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,800
Don't blame me for talking too much.

677
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,000
Cherish it.

678
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,640
Next time you two

679
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,760
come together,

680
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,880
I'll give you a 50% discount.

681
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,240
Okay.

682
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,760
It seems that

683
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,760
you like this wine very much.

684
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,240
Yeah, you like it a lot, don't you?

685
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,120
I don't know how confused you are now,

686
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,080
but you should slowly

687
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,600
try out

688
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,880
new memories and old memories,

689
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,640
In the end,

690
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,640
it's all about

691
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,040
that person's memory.

692
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,560
Ruo Nan

693
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,160
Ruo Nan

694
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,480
Are you okay?

695
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,080
Okay,

696
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,480
Did you

697
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,960
drink too much?

698
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,240
Eat something.

699
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,360
You drank too much just now.

700
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
It's not good for your stomach.

701
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,080
I'm not eating.

702
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,280
He said I can't eat spicy food,

703
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,160
He,

704
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,760
I want to go.

705
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,120
Okay, I'll walk you out.

706
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,800
Ruo Nan

707
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,720
Ruonan,

708
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,040
when did you pay the bill?

709
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,880
There's no reason for a girl

710
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,840
to pay the bill.

711
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,200
It's okay.

712
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,080
It's my treat,

713
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,160
Are you okay?

714
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,040
I'm fine. Let me

715
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,920
give you a ride.

716
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,840
The car is right next to you.

717
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,440
No, thanks.

718
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,600
You're too dangerous.

719
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
I'm in danger.

720
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,520
Can you do it or not?

721
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,560
Mr. Zhao,

722
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,400
Mr. Zhao,

723
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,800
You don't know me at all.

724
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,400
I don't need a man to protect me.

725
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,920
I wasn't chosen.

726
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,240
I'm the one who wants to choose.

727
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,960
I can walk on my own.

728
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,160
Goodbye.

729
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,120
How do you call him Zhao?

730
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,320
It sounds so nice.

731
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,360
Why are you driving here again?

732
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,720
How much

733
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,480
did I drink?

734
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,200
Am I hallucinating

735
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,400
after drinking?

736
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,040
What?

737
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,880
Why does he look so much like Ji Mo?

738
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,080
It feels... It feels

739
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,520
real,

740
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,480
I really

741
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,400
drank a lot

742
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,240
but I didn't drink much.

743
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,120
A little bit.

744
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,920
I'm

745
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,360
a good drinker,

746
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,120
Are you hallucinating?

747
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,600
-How can you

748
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,160
talk? -Gosh.

749
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,320
No,

750
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,800
come on. Get up. One, two, three.

751
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,360
I can walk on my own.

752
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,760
Just because you look like Ji Mo,

753
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,880
you can take advantage of me.

754
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,240
Me,

755
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Which room in my house?

756
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,440
Who did you drink so much

757
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,280
with? You drank so much.

758
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,240
You're worried about me.

759
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,280
You like me so much, don't you?

760
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,040
You're not awake right now.

761
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,000
I don't want to talk to you.

762
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,960
I'm not unconscious.

763
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,880
I'm sober.

764
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,960
I'm who

765
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,720
you are now,

766
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,320
That's how you are.

767
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,720
That's what it is.

768
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,560
What kind of person am I?

769
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,880
You clearly

770
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,800
like someone,

771
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,960
And pretend that you don't like someone,

772
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,080
that you care about someone,

773
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,960
You have to pretend that you don't care.

774
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,440
And then I … I … I … I

775
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,680
… I … I … I …,

776
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,840
I'm different.

777
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,760
I'm just

778
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,360
very angry,

779
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,240
But I can't help

780
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,240
but wait for you a little longer.

781
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,480
I hate you very much.

782
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,000
But I like you a lot.

783
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
I like it so much.

784
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,640
I'm so weird.

785
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,360
I like you.

786
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,520
I like it so much.

787
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,840
How could I be like this?

788
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,800
Go to bed when you're drunk.

789
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,480
I'm not drunk.

790
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,560
I just want to drink it.

791
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,360
You don't allow me to eat hot pot,

792
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,320
so I insist on eating hot pot.

793
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:39,960
Because.

794
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,800
You're so real.

795
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,600
Sleep.

796
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,960
I didn't drink much.

797
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,600
Yes, I am.

798
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,199
Without me,

799
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,239
I don't have any ability to live.

800
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,880
You even messed up your family after drinking,

801
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,920
how can I be at ease?

802
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,719
Morning, Mr. Ji,

803
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,440
Morning

804
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,640
A good woman like you,

805
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,200
is like

806
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,520
a house in the CBD,

807
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,480
Although he's older,

808
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,840
he has a good location and a high price,

809
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,240
Many people can't get it in line.

810
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:19,920
And a brainless young girl

811
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,360
like you.

812
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,000
It's like a new building in the suburbs,

813
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,520
with a low age and a low price,

814
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,720
Even if there are advertisements all over the street,

815
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,360
no one wants them.

816
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,120
Do you think it's comparable?

817
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,000
You,

818
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,640
He's my man now.

819
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,800
Whether you're jealous

820
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,680
or envious,

821
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,320
This is the charm of an old woman.

822
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,920
I … I'm just very

823
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,200
angry,

824
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,760
But I can't help

825
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,120
but wait for you a little longer.

826
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,520
I hate you very much.

827
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,200
But I like you a lot.

828
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,280
I like it so much.

829
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,920
I won't drink anymore. Really.

830
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,480
I want to quit drinking.

831
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,320
I really want to quit drinking.

832
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,560
I won't drink anymore.

833
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,800
Why is my house so clean?

834
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,600
It's unrealistic.

835
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,920
Who sent me back yesterday?

836
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,800
Yesterday,

837
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,360
who is it?

838
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,920
Is it Ji Mo?

839
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,240
Really?

840
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,320
Send her back.

841
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,120
Clean up her house.

842
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,440
This kind of thing can only be done

843
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,320
by that pervert mysophobia.

844
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,040
I really am,

845
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,640
I really am,

846
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,600
I really don't want to drink anymore.

847
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,680
I really

848
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,600
… I won't kiss him yesterday, right? Let me ask him. How is

849
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,240
he?

850
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,480
So embarrassing.

851
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,160
I was so embarrassed

852
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
that I left it at home,

853
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,960
Mr. Ji.

854
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,960
Mr. Ji.

855
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,400
Mr. Ji.

856
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,840
What's wrong?

857
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,320
I didn't sleep well

858
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,400
last night. Last night,

859
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,040
Tidy up the room and take care of people.

860
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,200
I even drew

861
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,680
a design drawing. Where

862
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,840
is the design drawing?

863
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,760
Can I have a look?

864
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,000
You came to my house last night.

865
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
What did you

866
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,240
forget?

867
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,120
I forgot it when I just drew it.

868
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,560
Did anything happen last night?

869
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,840
I'm drunk.

870
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,560
I don't remember it at all.

871
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,040
What woman

872
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,360
did she forget?

873
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Where is a woman?

874
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,320
This woman is such a pain in the ass.

875
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,040
Dugu Ruonan,

876
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,560
please behave yourself in the future.

877
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,240
Get rid of the disorder after drinking.

878
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,600
It's embarrassing.

879
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,600
Me,

880
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,680
I'm so embarrassed.

881
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,080
I need to calm down.

882
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,520
Why are you standing so far away?

883
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,200
Well,

884
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,840
you've been quite angry lately.

885
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,160
Come and get

886
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,520
the design drawing.

887
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,160
This is a stroke of genius.

888
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,640
Look at this line, this style,

889
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,280
this color,

890
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,720
It's perfect.

891
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,880
Don't flatter me.

892
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,640
No, no, no Boss,

893
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,240
I'm really not sucking up to you.

894
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,920
I really like it.

895
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,200
Perfect.

896
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,440
Really?

897
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,840
If you don't take it, let me take it.

898
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,920
If you don't take it, let me take it.

899
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,160
Do you want me to take it

900
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,880
if you don't want to?

901
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
Only to find out,

902
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,320
why are you so short?

903
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,600
What's wrong with you?

904
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,880
Your legs are so short,

905
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,320
you can't even kick a person,

906
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Try it.

907
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,040
I'll kick,

908
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,840
Kick,

909
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,000
I'll kick,

910
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,040
Kick,

911
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,960
All right, all right.

912
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,480
Shen Qiansha,

913
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,520
I found out,

914
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,360
So bullying you

915
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,520
is so interesting.

916
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,640
For Sida's sake,

917
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,800
I'll bear it.

918
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,800
Hey,

919
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,680
Did you get off work?

920
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,560
Not yet. I'm still busy.

921
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,720
Get off work early.

922
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,800
The weather forecast says

923
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,920
it will rain tonight.

924
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,960
It's not raining here.

925
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,360
It seems that the weather forecast is inaccurate.

926
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,280
I'll go back after I finish my work.

927
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,840
Okay, I won't bother you then.

928
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,600
Goodbye

929
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,480
Okay, bye.

930
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,720
It's raining so hard.

931
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,080
I should have brought an umbrella.

932
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,760
Mr. Zhao,

933
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,680
why are you here?

934
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,080
I didn't expect it to rain so heavily,

935
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,920
because I guessed,

936
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,000
You can't bring an umbrella.

937
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,640
What a coincidence.

938
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,440
I'll take you home.

939
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,520
Then.

940
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,960
-Okay. -Thank you.

941
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,520
Thank you.

942
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,560
-Be careful. -It's okay.
