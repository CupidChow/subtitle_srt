1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,920
Mr. Zhao,

2
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,760
you are tied to me.

3
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,440
It's all your shares

4
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,320
in Wing Fashion,

5
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,440
To you,

6
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,080
this is just like a single hair from nine oxen.

7
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,640
However,

8
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,360
I was tied together by Lao Wang

9
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,720
over the past decades,

10
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,000
All the money,

11
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,960
Zhao. You know me.

12
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,960
As for me,

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm a rough person,

14
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,200
And I …

15
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
I … I'm still a coward.

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,720
This is the money

17
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,280
I've worked so hard for decades,

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,480
It's not easy.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,759
I left it to my son.

20
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,440
I dare not take it out easily.

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,200
I can't afford to lose.

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,920
Of course,

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,360
if you have to let me sign it,

24
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,160
I can sign it.

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,120
But there are some things

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,640
I have to make clear, Mr. Zhao,

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,320
Just like what you said just now,

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,160
you said the board meeting

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
will be held the day after tomorrow.

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
Those brothers,

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,840
will there be any problem?

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,720
By the way,

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
when it comes to Ji Mo,

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,440
Your people,

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,760
most of them,

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,520
He's always been mine.

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,080
Let's just talk about it.

38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't mean anything else.

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,400
Look,

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,280
my brothers believe me

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,360
because they believe me.

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,680
Isn't your cooperation

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,840
based on trust?

44
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,680
But you don't

45
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,880
trust them now.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,720
If you don't trust them,

47
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,800
you don't trust me.

48
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,520
You don't trust me?

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,600
Doesn't that mean

50
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,000
you don't trust yourself?

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,320
You've done

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,440
such a great job. You,

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,320
What you don't need the most,

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,480
is trust.

55
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,960
Tell me,

56
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,360
I can sign it.

57
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,400
After I sign it,

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,560
let my brothers see it,

59
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,000
They'll think,

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,120
Mr. Zhao, you don't take them

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,040
as your own people,

62
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,840
they

63
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,560
It's chilling.

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,240
That's enough.

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,040
No need to sign it.

66
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,520
I trust you.

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,400
You really don't need to sign it.

68
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,240
Very happy.

69
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,960
Is that right?

70
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,200
Don't worry. At the meeting,

71
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
we will definitely support you.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,640
Well,

73
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,360
I'll get going.

74
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,880
Okay,

75
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,480
See Mr. Wang off,

76
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,280
Okay,

77
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,880
Don't worry.

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,840
Mr. Wang,

79
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,360
let me see you off.

80
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Let me see

81
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,320
There's no need for that.

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,320
Tell Mr. Zhao,

83
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,160
which way should I go?

84
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,480
I know it very well.

85
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
Mr. Zhao is indeed worried that

86
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,080
something will go wrong at the meeting today.

87
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,480
That's why I chose this method.

88
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,640
Please don't mind.

89
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,720
I don't mind.

90
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,160
Mr. Zhao is far-sighted.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,399
If I don't accept it, I have to accept it.

92
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,960
Yes,

93
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,720
Mr. Wang,

94
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,480
Sometimes, people really have to

95
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,720
think more about themselves.

96
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,840
After all, except yourself,

97
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,120
no one will really think of you.

98
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,400
Especially the pros and cons,

99
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,040
we have to weigh them well.

100
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,400
If you make any mistake,

101
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,000
you'll lose everything to Mr. Wang.

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
So Mr. Zhao is really

103
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,200
a little impatient today.

104
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I hope you can be more considerate.

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,360
Xiao Wu,

106
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,080
Zhao has a soldier

107
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,280
like you,

108
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,400
Sure

109
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,360
Tell Zhao

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,880
that his pie,

111
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,400
I, Lao Wang, can catch it.

112
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,080
Let's go.

113
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,000
Take care, Mr. Wang.

114
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,840
Come to our house for tea when you're free.

115
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,320
Mr. Ji,

116
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,840
Mr. Wang is here,

117
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,520
Mr. Ji,

118
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,640
when we meet,

119
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,640
There's no need to be

120
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,600
so secretive.

121
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,240
Sit down.

122
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,440
I just

123
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,960
don't want others to disturb me.

124
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,720
Someone else?

125
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,480
Someone

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
who is investigating you.

127
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,200
Ji Mo,

128
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,920
what day is it today?

129
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,280
What? I don't understand

130
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,120
what you're saying,

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,040
Wang,

132
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
I already know.

133
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,680
The fabric dealer reported

134
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
your bribery.

135
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,320
The investigators are investigating you.

136
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,040
Yes.

137
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,560
You're right.

138
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,920
So what?

139
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,480
Ji Mo,

140
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,200
you want to threaten me

141
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,240
with this, right?

142
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,600
I'm not threatening you.

143
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,440
I called you here today,

144
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,760
to give you a new choice.

145
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,840
Tell me.

146
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,280
Your wife

147
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,480
passed away a long time ago, right?

148
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,440
You have a son

149
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
who has been abroad,

150
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,360
That day,

151
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
I went to your office.

152
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,440
There is a layer of dust

153
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,760
on your desktop,

154
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,480
But only that photo,

155
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,800
which is exceptionally clean,

156
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,520
It means that you often look at it

157
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
and cherish it especially.

158
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,040
Besides,

159
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,760
your son has been abroad,

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,920
You didn't come back, did you?

161
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,800
Ji Mo,

162
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,680
what do you want to do?

163
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,440
You've been scrimping and saving,

164
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,320
and you've been working hard to make money,

165
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,320
Food and clothing are simple.

166
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,760
What is the money saved for?

167
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,000
Isn't it all for your son

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,760
abroad?

169
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,520
Ji, what on earth do you want to do

170
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,640
when you go around here?

171
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
As for the fabric dealer,

172
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
I really can't do anything about it.

173
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,000
But if you're on my side,

174
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,640
I promise you,

175
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,400
When the dust settles,

176
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,920
Yi Fashion will still have

177
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,840
a share of you,

178
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,480
Besides,

179
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,000
from now on, your son,

180
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,600
It will also be guaranteed.

181
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,520
Don't make any more mistakes Lao Wang,

182
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,400
you also hope that in the future, your son,

183
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,480
You have a father worthy of respect,

184
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,640
don't you?

185
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,120
You're awake.

186
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,880
That's right.

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,440
Don't sleep a little longer.

188
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,280
No,

189
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,440
I have an important meeting today,

190
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,400
so I have to go early.

191
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,840
I'm sorry,

192
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,200
I haven't had time

193
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,160
to spend with you lately.

194
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,520
It's okay,

195
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,440
actually,

196
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,640
I just want to see you every day.

197
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,800
Then I'll be happy.

198
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,640
All right,

199
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,520
thank you.

200
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,440
Let's go.

201
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,160
I'll get going then.

202
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,480
Hold on.

203
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,480
I'll go out later.

204
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,440
I have a little surprise

205
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,680
for you.

206
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,000
What are you talking about?

207
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Close your eyes.

208
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,280
Don't peek.

209
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,800
Okay,

210
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,560
Go ahead

211
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,840
and turn left.

212
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,240
Turn left.

213
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,040
Go straight.

214
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,640
It'll stop.

215
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,800
What is this?

216
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,680
I prepared this for you.

217
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,200
Bright starry sky,

218
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,600
you're busy with work now,

219
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,520
We can't go to see the stars.

220
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,160
So,

221
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,560
I prepared a star for you.

222
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,480
Look,

223
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,120
in the darkness,

224
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,640
There will always be light coming in.

225
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
So don't be afraid of the darkness.

226
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,840
Because of the darkness,

227
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,240
That's why the stars are in it.

228
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,080
It looks brighter.

229
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,760
Thank you, Ruonan,

230
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
but I'm with you,

231
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,800
There will never be darkness.

232
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
Every minute I spent with you,

233
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,440
every second,

234
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,000
It's like a dream.

235
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,720
So you're the one who made the dream?

236
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,960
Whether it's a designer,

237
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,240
a psychologist or an entrepreneur,

238
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,400
In fact,

239
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,840
you're doing it for yourself,

240
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,280
There are others who create a dream.

241
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,240
I know you're

242
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,520
exhausted.

243
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
What I want most is to

244
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,560
create a dream for you.

245
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,200
Let you live in a dream

246
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
all the time,

247
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,520
I won't be disturbed by the outside world.

248
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,040
But what I want to protect the most,

249
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,560
is the dream of you and Yi Fashion.

250
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,960
As for me?

251
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,880
It doesn't matter.

252
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,520
We still have plenty of time.

253
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,360
When the dust settles,

254
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,080
I'll tell you as soon as possible,

255
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,080
I'll wait for your good news at home.

256
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,120
You will succeed.

257
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,320
I believe

258
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,240
you're gone.

259
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
That's it.

260
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,000
It's not enough.

261
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,960
not enough

262
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,680
All right,

263
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,960
then I'll head to the battlefield.

264
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,080
I'm leaving.

265
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,080
Okay.

266
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,040
I'm leaving.

267
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,920
Today is the fifth board meeting of Wing Fashion

268
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,480
in the third quarter,

269
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
In response to the board members,

270
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,400
Zhao Yucheng proposed,

271
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,800
To make a decision

272
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,360
on removing Ji Mo

273
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,480
as the president of Yi Fashion.

274
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,840
Before that,

275
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,120
Mr. Ji,

276
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,880
I'd like to have a word with you.

277
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,600
First of all,

278
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,280
I want to apologize to everyone.

279
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,440
During my tenure,

280
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,480
a lot of things happened to Yi Fashion.

281
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,200
It's all because of my lack of working ability.

282
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
I'm sorry, everyone.

283
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,280
If I'm fired,

284
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,960
I'll accept it.

285
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,640
If I can stay in office,

286
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,720
I will prove my ability

287
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
with my strength.

288
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
I will live up to

289
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,120
the expectations of all shareholders,

290
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,800
At the same time,

291
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,680
I would like to remind some people,

292
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,200
Don't take advantage of the east wind.

293
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,000
Because the wind

294
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
may be uncertain.

295
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,720
That's why some people

296
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,960
shouldn't be led by the nose.

297
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,280
In the end,

298
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,080
I ended up empty-handed.

299
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,280
If you're done, let's vote.

300
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,040
Since Mr. Zhao is in such a hurry,

301
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,720
let's begin our decision.

302
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,040
Directors, vote now.

303
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,200
To support Ji Moji,

304
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,720
to continue to serve as

305
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,520
the president of Wing Fashion,

306
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,320
Please raise your hand.

307
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,880
Seven votes.

308
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,680
Those who object to Ji Moji continuing to serve as

309
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,240
the president of Wing Fashion,

310
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,240
Please raise your hand. Sorry.

311
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,840
Excuse me,

312
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,920
please wait a moment.

313
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,480
I have something to deal with.

314
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,200
Sorry.

315
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,560
Mr. Ji,

316
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,640
what do you have to deal with?

317
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,760
Why didn't I know?

318
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,120
No.

319
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,400
I just want to take a break.

320
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,720
I see.

321
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,640
You must have come up with something new

322
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,880
to deal with him, right?

323
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,520
Let me think.

324
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,040
You are.

325
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,240
I don't think today

326
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,720
is a good day.

327
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,920
I want to vote another day.

328
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,440
Am I right?

329
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,400
Where did you come up with

330
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,520
these inexplicable theories,

331
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,480
Then why did you

332
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,800
put a clock at that meeting,

333
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,160
That clock

334
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,080
is to remind Lao Wang.

335
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,680
Before voting,

336
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,080
I've given psychological hints

337
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,280
to Lao Wang over and over again.

338
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,640
In his mind,

339
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,680
he had a mindset of suspicion

340
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,400
towards Zhao Yucheng,

341
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,960
Once this mindset takes shape,

342
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,480
his suspicion of Zhao Yucheng,

343
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,880
It will only deepen but not weaken.

344
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,440
This is what psychology calls

345
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,240
the set effect,

346
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,160
And the ticking of that clock,

347
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,320
when people are anxious,

348
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,400
It will backfire.

349
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,880
It's like a time bomb,

350
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
reminding you

351
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,840
to make a choice all the time.

352
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,680
I left because

353
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,120
I wanted Lao Wang to make a trade-off.

354
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,440
His psychological defense,

355
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,600
has been broken down by me.

356
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,760
And that's

357
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,680
all I've said,

358
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,960
What should I do?

359
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
He should know

360
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,280
it's almost time to start

361
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,080
Mr. Ji is back.

362
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,880
Mr. Ji is back.

363
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,680
Mr. Ji.

364
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

365
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,520
Let's continue.

366
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,840
Let's continue with the last round of voting,

367
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,400
against Mr. Ji Mo,

368
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,840
As the president of Wing Fashion,

369
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,720
please raise your hand.

370
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:43,880
Seven votes,

371
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,000
even.

372
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,200
But one of the directors

373
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
didn't vote.

374
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,760
Who is it?

375
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,560
Director Wang

376
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,320
Lao Wang, what's going on?

377
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,000
Didn't he have

378
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,520
a clear position before?

379
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,200
Why are you still hesitating?

380
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,120
Why don't you vote now?

381
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,360
Don't make any more mistakes Lao Wang,

382
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,319
you also hope that in the future, your son,

383
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,319
You have a father worthy of respect,

384
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,440
don't you?

385
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,839
Lao Wang, what are you thinking?

386
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,960
Mr. Wang,

387
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,400
it's your turn to vote.

388
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,440
Me,

389
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,720
Me,

390
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,080
Me,

391
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,520
I support it.

392
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,400
Say it, Wang,

393
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,800
Ji Mo.

394
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,760
Are you sure?

395
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,280
Me

396
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,080
I'm sure.

397
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,280
By

398
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,320
Ji Mo continues to be

399
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,720
the president of Wing Fashion,

400
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,400
Sorry, Mr. Zhao.

401
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,080
The voting result will be announced now.

402
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,920
There are eight votes for it,

403
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,160
seven votes against it,

404
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,880
The number of votes against it is not enough,

405
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,920
so Ji Moji continues to serve as

406
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,240
the president of Wing Fashion.

407
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,760
Wang, what do you mean?

408
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:35,680
Mr. Ji,

409
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,480
congratulations,

410
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,960
Congratulations, Mr. Ji.

411
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,800
Mr. Ji,

412
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,320
how is Mr. Ji?

413
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,400
You've been working hard these days.

414
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,840
Thank you for your support.

415
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,680
Brother Lun,

416
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,920
how's the result?

417
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,120
What do you mean?

418
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,240
Mr. Ji won.

419
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,880
That's great.

420
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,640
Zhao Yucheng.

421
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,680
I told you

422
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,320
not to worry,

423
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,960
But I forgot to tell you,

424
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,880
the second half of the sentence,

425
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,760
I don't expect you

426
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
to be defeated.

427
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,360
Thank you.

428
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,200
But don't you think

429
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,840
you've played some tricks?

430
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,120
You can win in the end.

431
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,160
I didn't play any tricks.

432
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,960
It's your fault.

433
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,680
You've calculated everything.

434
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,440
But it misses the point. Once

435
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,960
there's a crack in trust,

436
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,640
It's easy to break through.

437
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,080
Besides,

438
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,080
money can't solve everything.

439
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,920
That means

440
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,920
we haven't spent the money yet.

441
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,480
It's been an hour since the board meeting,

442
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,840
why hasn't there been any news yet?

443
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,520
Did Zhao Yucheng win?

444
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,560
What do you think?

445
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,760
Did you get the result?

446
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,360
I made you worry again.

447
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,440
Are you in a hurry?

448
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,320
Tell me now.

449
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,360
Ruo Nan

450
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll hold on to the company.

451
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,560
We won.

452
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,480
We won.

453
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,960
That's great.

454
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,960
You've calculated everything.

455
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,720
But it misses the point. Once

456
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,880
there's a crack in trust,

457
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,400
It's easy to break through.

458
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,080
Wu, Wu,

459
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,960
come to my office.

460
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,720
Mr. Zhao,

461
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,000
Xiao Wu will go to the marketing department,

462
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,640
The countermeasures have been submitted.

463
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,280
You can tell me if you need anything.

464
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,160
Take the footage from the camera

465
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,000
in front of my office,

466
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,040
Send it to my computer.

467
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,280
Okay Do you want it now?

468
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,040
Now,

469
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,720
Okay.

470
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,920
Mr. Zhao, you're back.

471
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,320
Mr. Zhao,

472
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,720
how much benefit did Ji Mo give you?

473
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,600
Mr. Zhao,

474
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,560
it's not him,

475
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
If it's not him,

476
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,840
then who is it?

477
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,640
Yes.

478
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,120
It's Miss Su.

479
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,040
Mr. Zhao, I.

480
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,280
I got it.

481
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,120
Get out.

482
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,000
Everything is back to normal.

483
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,440
After you finish this infusion bag,

484
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,680
I'll come and have a look.

485
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,800
Thank you.

486
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,200
The board meeting is over.

487
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,520
What's the result?

488
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,080
As a result,

489
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,800
as you wish,

490
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,520
You got it.

491
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,360
Why?

492
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,760
I'm sorry.

493
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,120
I know you love him.

494
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,120
So I

495
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,200
didn't force you.

496
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,040
You must be on my side.

497
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,440
But at least I'm your brother,

498
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,920
and you shouldn't have

499
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,640
teamed up with him to fool me,

500
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,360
Am I right?

501
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,600
Brother, I was wrong.

502
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,160
I was wrong, okay?

503
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,240
I'm sorry.

504
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,000
I know you did it for my own good.

505
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,160
But since I came back,

506
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,400
I found that things

507
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,720
are getting out of control.

508
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,720
I can see the future.

509
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,000
That future is not what I want.

510
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,480
Wing Fashion,

511
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,440
it's my dream.

512
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,520
But,

513
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,720
I was the one who escaped,

514
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,400
It's not Ji Mo.

515
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,480
He's been holding on.

516
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,800
He fulfilled his promise.

517
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,080
If Yi Fashion doesn't have Ji Mo,

518
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,800
it won't be the Yi Fashion

519
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,560
I dreamed of.

520
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,280
Silly girl,

521
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,040
in his dream,

522
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,320
I don't have you anymore.

523
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,120
What I need to do now

524
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,840
is to help you get it back.

525
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,920
I'll get it back for you.

526
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,320
I want you to have it again.

527
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,640
Is it hard to understand?

528
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,640
And Ji Mo should

529
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,200
atone for what he did.

530
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,680
Is this logic hard to understand?

531
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,160
I'm the one who should atone for it.

532
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,520
It's not him.

533
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,800
He's right.

534
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:42,960
He is no longer

535
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,200
the Ji Mo he was three years ago.

536
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,880
I'm not Su Xiao from three years ago.

537
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,880
It's completely over

538
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,240
between us.

539
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,000
Okay,

540
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,720
You two can end it.

541
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,720
But between me and him,

542
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,360
it's not that easy to end.

543
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,040
Brother.

544
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,720
Brother, I'm begging you.

545
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,000
Brother, don't.

546
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,760
Xiaoxiao, Xiaoxiao,

547
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,440
doctor,

548
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,120
Come on.

549
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,920
Brother, why are you crying?

550
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,040
Are you hurt?

551
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,520
Let me blow it for you.

552
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Are you feeling better?

553
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
I've always wanted to have a brother.

554
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,040
I'm so happy that you're here.

555
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,680
I promise.

556
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,240
I won't let you get hurt again.

557
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,280
Brother,

558
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,840
you'll protect me too, right?

559
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
According to the data

560
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,880
of each test report,

561
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,000
It can be judged that

562
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,320
Miss Su is suffering from

563
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,240
advanced breast cancer.

564
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,720
Brother, I know you're the best to me.

565
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,520
Can you help me one more time?

566
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
-Help me one more time. -Brother, don't.

567
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,520
He's my boyfriend.

568
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,720
You mean he's a psychologist?

569
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,840
But why

570
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,200
didn't you know

571
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
you were lying?

572
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,200
I don't know what do you think?

573
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,720
But in my opinion,

574
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,360
he doesn't understand you at all.

575
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,560
He doesn't trust you. He's not good enough

576
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,720
for your brother. Stop it.

577
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,720
How many times did the doctor say that?

578
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,640
No drinking. No drinking.

579
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,800
Brother,

580
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,520
I'm really sad now.

581
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,240
Just let me indulge myself for a while.

582
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,880
Okay?

583
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
I know you hate Ji Mo

584
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,280
because of me.

585
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,160
I don't hate him anymore.

586
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,680
I forgive him.

587
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,640
I'll protect you.

588
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,040
I'll always protect you.

589
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,160
How is Su Xiao?

590
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,640
She's still being rescued.

591
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,560
I know she must really want to see you.

592
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,360
That's why I called you.

593
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,560
But that doesn't mean

594
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,840
I'll forgive you.

595
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,280
I don't think you know it yet.

596
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,720
The photo of my contract with Lao Wang,

597
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,520
Su Xiao asked Xiao Wu to take it for you.

598
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,920
She did it for you.

599
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,640
You'd rather betray me.

600
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,440
If anything happens

601
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,360
to Su Xiao this time,

602
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,200
I will fight hard with you.

603
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,960
You're Su Xiao's closest relative,

604
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,520
do you really understand

605
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,360
what she wants?

606
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,600
When she left,

607
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:32,960
it wasn't because

608
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,080
she didn't love Ji Mo,

609
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,800
But because she can't face Ji Mo

610
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,160
with a incomplete attitude,

611
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,680
When she comes back this time,

612
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,720
do you think she really wants to

613
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,200
go back to Ji Mo?

614
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,880
For a person who has faced life and death,

615
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,680
what he wants most is to make up for his regret.

616
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,320
Of course I don't deny that

617
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,920
she wants to have Ji Mo,

618
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,040
But what she wants most

619
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,040
is to get her memory back,

620
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,040
When I pick up my dream again,

621
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
I think Su Xiao

622
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,320
is braver than you.

623
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,120
At least she won't be like you,

624
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,560
she will only use her hatred to solve everything.

625
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,280
Doctor,

626
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,400
how is it?

627
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,840
The patient fainted this time,

628
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,600
mainly because of her

629
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,040
emotional fluctuations.

630
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,320
I'm fine now.

631
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,760
But her condition has worsened.

632
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,960
If it goes on like this,

633
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,320
I'm afraid time is running out.

634
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,560
Be careful not to irritate her again

635
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,720
in the near future.

636
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,760
Take her to relax.

637
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,280
Brother.

638
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,240
You're awake.

639
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,360
How do you feel?

640
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,360
I was sleepy and had a good sleep,

641
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,440
Brother,

642
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,920
You're not mad at me anymore?

643
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,680
I have no right to be angry with you.

644
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,400
I'm mad at myself.

645
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,720
Do you blame me?

646
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,960
You're too stubborn.

647
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,080
You're my only family.

648
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,800
How can I blame you?

649
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,600
I pushed you too hard.

650
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,080
I'm sorry,

651
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,840
it's not that you should apologize,

652
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,320
It's my fault.

653
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,080
I used to be busy with work,

654
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,840
so I didn't have time to accompany you.

655
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Even you got sick.

656
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,760
I don't even know.

657
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,120
Later, when I went abroad, I tried to make up for it,

658
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,160
but I realized it was too late.

659
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,880
The hole in your heart is too big.

660
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,160
It's not something I can make up for.

661
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,120
So this time when I came back,

662
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,280
I was thinking about

663
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,000
how to get Ji Mo

664
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,560
back for you.

665
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,960
But because of this,

666
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,400
I ignored your

667
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,560
real needs,

668
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,720
In fact, if Nan is right,

669
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,040
I didn't hear

670
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
your true inner voice,

671
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,199
I didn't do well.

672
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,000
It's been so many years,

673
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,120
isn't it sad?

674
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,840
With you by my side,

675
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,520
no matter how sad I am,

676
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
It's okay.

677
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,840
All these years,

678
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,880
thank you for your hard work, brother.

679
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,440
I'm not tired.

680
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,600
I'm your brother.

681
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,800
It's my duty

682
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,679
to take care of you.

683
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,440
I'll pour some water.

684
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,520
When I was sick when I was little,

685
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,120
you took care of me the same way.

686
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,800
How nice it was back then.

687
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,280
Life was simple,

688
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,400
It's easy to be happy,

689
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,600
as I remember,

690
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,000
At that time,

691
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,320
I always relied on you,

692
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,160
And then you

693
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,280
throw and throw,

694
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,480
You just can't get rid of it.

695
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,960
It's a pity that time flies. It

696
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,520
doesn't matter.

697
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Anyway, from now on,

698
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,520
we have plenty of time.

699
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,760
And the position behind me,

700
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,840
will always be yours.

701
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,560
Brother,

702
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,360
I want to swing, okay?

703
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,920
Okay.

704
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,520
Every time I breathe fresh air.

705
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,400
I feel very healthy.

706
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,480
Just like other ordinary people,

707
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,720
no different.

708
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,240
Don't worry.

709
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,240
I'm sure she'll get better.

710
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,840
I hope so.

711
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,600
That way, right?

712
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
You push me,

713
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,120
you push me higher,

714
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,160
Push.

715
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,040
Higher,

716
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,960
A little higher,

717
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,840
Brother, a little higher,

718
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,680
a little higher,

719
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,520
Okay,

720
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,880
I'm flying.

721
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,440
Higher.

722
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,000
Higher.

723
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,560
A little higher,

724
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,040
brother. A little higher,

725
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,120
I'm going to fly.

726
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,680
It can't go any higher.

727
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,640
What's wrong?

728
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,520
I remember when I was little,

729
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,200
I was like this,

730
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,440
I helped you push the swing,

731
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,160
you said you wanted to fly,

732
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,920
I'll push you higher and higher.

733
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,320
Higher and higher.

734
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,960
As a result,

735
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,240
you fell to the ground directly.

736
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,480
When I broke my arm,

737
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,120
I used to feel like,

738
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,600
As long as you can be happy,

739
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,840
no matter what,

740
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,760
I'm willing to indulge you.

741
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,920
But then,

742
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,080
every time I thought about that scene,

743
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,120
will blame themselves.

744
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,840
Everyone would think,

745
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,520
if I hadn't let go of the hand

746
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,760
that pushed the swing,

747
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,000
You wouldn't have fallen.

748
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,120
It's all in the past.

749
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,080
Don't miss it.

750
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,520
Actually, I've been thinking,

751
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,080
if I hadn't

752
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,920
helped you lie to Ji Mo back then.

753
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,600
But to stop you.

754
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,920
Maybe all of this

755
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,520
will be different from today.

756
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,760
In fact, I know very well in my heart

757
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,480
that not all the mistakes are made,

758
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,160
It's all because of Ji Mo,

759
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,600
the one who made the most mistakes,

760
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,360
Actually, it's me.

761
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,160
But I really don't have the courage

762
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,120
to admit my mistake.

763
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,640
So I took Ji Mo

764
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,720
as an outlet.

765
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,120
Put all the resentment,

766
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,560
ashamed and uneasy

767
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,800
Let it all out on him.

768
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,680
I'm sorry.

769
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,800
You don't need to feel guilty.

770
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,200
This is all

771
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,040
my own choice,

772
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,280
In fact, a fall

773
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
is really nothing.

774
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,400
After crying,

775
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,760
the pain will be over.

776
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,440
Actually, I was prepared for the worst

777
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,400
before I returned home.

778
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,240
But I have to

779
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,680
see him for real.

780
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,320
You know what?

781
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,960
The first time I saw him,

782
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,440
I thought it was worth it.

783
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,160
You're much stronger

784
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,920
than I thought.

785
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,760
That's because you're behind me.

786
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,760
You spoiled me and spoiled me all the time,

787
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,000
so that I don't have worries.

788
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,000
But it's time for me to grow up.

789
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,400
Because only in this way,

790
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,640
maybe I can get through it.

791
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,760
Brother,

792
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,760
thank you for taking care of me.

793
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,880
Let go of me.

794
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,720
Yes,

795
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,320
it's time to let go.

796
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,320
Slow down.

797
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,440
Are you tired?

798
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,520
I'm not tired.

799
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,440
I'm happy.

800
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,960
That's good.

801
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,560
I hope,

802
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,640
you can be so happy all the time.

803
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,560
I want to

804
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,760
I'll get you out of here.

805
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,720
I'll leave all my troubles behind,

806
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,560
and take you abroad for treatment.

807
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,240
Okay?

808
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,080
Okay.

809
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,840
Okay.

810
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,360
Abnormal.

811
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,120
Why did you eat so fast today?

812
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,720
What's up?

813
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,280
I have something to do.

814
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,840
Me,

815
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,440
Me

816
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,720
Do you want to borrow Ji Mo for a few hours?

817
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,040
Not bad.

818
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,400
Actually,

819
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,520
you can go if you want.

820
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
You don't have to ask me.

821
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,800
Am I that stingy?

822
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,680
Just go and have fun.

823
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,640
Just ignore me.

824
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,440
Go ahead.
