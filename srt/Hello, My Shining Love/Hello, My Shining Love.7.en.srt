1
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,960
Me too. It smells so good.

2
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,400
Thank you.

3
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:47,960
By the way,

4
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,280
did Mr. Ji

5
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,360
bring a sick male model here?

6
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,600
You almost scared me to death.

7
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,240
That's right.

8
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,960
You know he's sick,

9
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
and you ask him to do this and that,

10
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,040
What do you think?

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
Miss,

12
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,960
where do you think the sick male model

13
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,720
is?

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,120
It's in there.

15
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,360
Here,

16
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,800
I'll treat you to this.

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,400
Thank you, sister.

18
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,040
What are you doing here?

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm here to visit Star Class,

20
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,160
and bring some snacks

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
to please the staff.

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,440
Where are your snacks?

23
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,240
Throw it away.

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
-Throw it away. -Okay.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,600
Don't think too much

26
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,200
about this useless place,

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,560
I thought you were going to teach Sida,

28
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,440
but I didn't expect that you were bossing him around.

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,000
I made him laugh at by others.

30
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,320
Are you kidding me?

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,720
No, sister,

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,480
Mr. Ji is helping me.

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,120
You don't have to explain it to me.

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,080
I don't want to

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,720
waste my time

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,320
on a woman who's making a scene

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,680
like that.

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Who are you talking about?

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,600
Don't go.

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,520
Sis,

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,400
Sister, don't be angry.

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,360
He did it for my own good.

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
He's just helping me

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,080
overcome my psychological barrier.

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,480
Really? What did he help you with?

46
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,800
It's nothing.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,120
Just let me face up to my heart.

48
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,960
So what's in your heart?

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,440
Is it an angel or a devil?

50
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
Inside me,

51
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,560
there's an angel.

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
You're so shameless.

53
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,240
But it seems to be working.

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,120
At least,

55
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,400
you're getting cheeky.

56
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,320
I'm not boasting.

57
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,600
What do you think now?

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,840
It's okay.

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,960
But I'm still a little nervous.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,040
But don't worry,

61
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,840
I will

62
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,880
overcome my obstacles.

63
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,440
I will live up to your expectations.

64
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,760
Stand in the middle of the stage.

65
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,080
Really?

66
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,080
You should live up to yourself first.

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Get in the car.

68
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Where are we going today?

69
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,400
I went to see someone

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,280
and came to see Song Zihao again. Yes.

71
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,440
Luckily, you remember him.

72
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,520
I often come to see him.

73
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,760
I'm leaving.

74
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,680
Sis,

75
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,480
So you've been

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,680
visiting Zihao.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,360
But I heard from the company that

78
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,280
you two are not on good terms,

79
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,160
When Zihao was a trainee,

80
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,560
I was the one who took care of him

81
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,440
for so many years,

82
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,760
He's just like my own brother,

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,640
so why

84
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,680
did the internet say you're a demon agent,

85
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,000
If you don't explain,

86
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,800
what's there to explain?

87
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,320
People just want to hear

88
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,800
the truth they want to hear

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,720
What is it?

90
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,320
It doesn't matter to them.

91
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,880
Besides,

92
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,880
I'm not afraid of being misunderstood.

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,840
To be a man,

94
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,600
the most important thing is to have a clear conscience.

95
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,560
Zihao,

96
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
how was the filming in the dream?

97
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,960
Recite your lines properly.

98
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,960
You can't skip work.

99
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,880
This is your junior brother.

100
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,720
Say hello to the newcomer.

101
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,840
Hello, I'm

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,960
Sida. Hello,

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,080
Yes, I am.

104
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,400
Sister, as a newly signed artist,

105
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,480
I've seen your play before.

106
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,440
It's your junior brother.

107
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,280
Look,

108
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,040
You're very popular.

109
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,480
Sister, you were

110
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,920
like this before.

111
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,880
Touching Zihao's head?

112
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
When I was a trainee

113
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,240
in the company,

114
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,760
Every time I encouraged him,

115
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,240
I would touch his head,

116
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,600
Later on,

117
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,640
the conflict between the two of us,

118
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,880
It's getting deeper.

119
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,680
He won't let me touch his head.

120
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,880
She said she treated him like a child,

121
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,160
Think about it

122
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,880
At that time, it was quite good.

123
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,760
At least he can argue with me

124
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,080
and talk back,

125
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,640
Unlike now,

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,360
you're too good.

127
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,840
I'm not used to being good.

128
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
It's okay, sister.

129
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,600
And me,

130
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,040
I will take care of you

131
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,600
and protect you for Zihao.

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,720
I don't need your protection.

133
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,920
But I want you to remember,

134
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,080
take Zihao

135
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,000
as a guard.

136
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,080
In fact, in this circle,

137
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,360
how high you climb is not the point,

138
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,040
The point is whether you can

139
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,600
stand it or not.

140
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,640
When you're popular,

141
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,760
can you stand up to

142
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,240
all the hype,

143
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
If you can get through this,

144
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,400
you can win.

145
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,440
Otherwise,

146
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,400
you might fall down at any time.

147
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,960
Your cleanliness is purely

148
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,600
because I think highly of you,

149
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,360
No matter what you do in the future,

150
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,920
never forget,

151
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,200
The heart at the beginning,

152
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,640
Yes.

153
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't worry, sister.

154
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,800
I remember.

155
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,720
Brother Zihao,

156
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,240
will he wake up?

157
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,080
I'm sure I'll wake up.

158
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,400
He is a man

159
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,280
who is unwilling to be forgotten by others,

160
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,360
He was born to live

161
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,800
under the flash.

162
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,120
Zihao,

163
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,120
I know you're tired from work.

164
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,280
I really want to rest.

165
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll be back soon after I've had enough rest.

166
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,440
Sis,

167
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,440
I found that you are too kind.

168
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,520
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

169
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,440
Now that Zihao is sick,

170
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,320
you're the only one who insists on visiting him.

171
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't praise me.

172
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,040
Don't think

173
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,520
you can say something nice to me,

174
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,400
Then I'll relax my demands on you.

175
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Let's go back for a run.

176
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,160
Make up for the training

177
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,960
you didn't make up for today,

178
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,120
Yes

179
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,360
I'm running.

180
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,160
Sis,

181
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
I really have an angel

182
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,120
in my heart.

183
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,840
You're back.

184
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,000
Are you sleepwalking?

185
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,120
Don't wander around in front of me.

186
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
It'll make you look silly. Why don't you

187
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,040
make any noise when you're awake.

188
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,800
I heard from Sida that

189
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,680
you went to therapy with him.

190
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,800
I was wrong about you.

191
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
It doesn't matter.

192
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,880
I didn't expect

193
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,760
your understanding anyway.

194
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,280
Bring Sida to the show

195
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,440
for an interview the day after tomorrow.

196
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,240
Okay.

197
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,200
So you think he's fine?

198
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,560
I used to think

199
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,960
he rejected women too much,

200
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,520
There will be no emotion.

201
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,680
Lack of expressiveness.

202
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,720
But I found out today that

203
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,800
he has someone he likes,

204
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,960
So I have faith in him.

205
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,440
He has someone he likes,

206
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,520
why didn't he tell me?

207
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,440
Who is it?

208
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,960
It's not Sida's fault for not telling you.

209
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,520
Doesn't your agent

210
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,600
forbid artists to fall in love?

211
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,480
Do I look like someone

212
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,520
who doesn't make sense?

213
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,280
Aren't you?

214
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,160
No, I'm not.

215
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,480
Artistic creation comes from inspiration,

216
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,240
and artists'inspiration comes

217
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,760
from emotions and experiences.

218
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,200
If you don't touch women,

219
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,000
you won't be able to express and communicate.

220
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,240
You won't become

221
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,200
a qualified artist.

222
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,440
Yes.

223
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,840
Everyone has psychological problems,

224
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,640
but in different degrees.

225
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,920
I know you want to protect

226
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,960
Sida's innocence,

227
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,280
But you can't always treat him like a child.

228
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,240
You can only grow up

229
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,440
if you've been through a lot.

230
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,680
Yes.

231
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,640
The power went out.

232
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,080
Are you scared?

233
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,840
No.

234
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,200
I've been living here for a few years,

235
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,080
and the electricity hasn't been powered off.

236
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,360
Why did the power go out as soon as you got here?

237
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,120
Are you nervous?

238
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,520
Who's nervous?

239
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,120
Your pupils dilate

240
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,640
and your nostrils dilate.

241
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,720
Your facial muscles are constricted,

242
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,560
and your breathing is uneven.

243
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,080
There's a call.

244
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,560
Who called you?

245
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,400
I said the light came on,

246
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,560
Yes.

247
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,880
I'm going back to my room.

248
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
I'll go back now.

249
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,840
Why is your heart beating so fast?

250
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,960
An illusion.

251
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,320
It must be an illusion.

252
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,880
The merry-go-round

253
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,080
also means missing out.

254
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,880
There will always be a gap

255
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,480
between us.

256
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,680
Ji Mo.

257
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,840
Let's break up.

258
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
What a beautiful body.

259
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,240
Look at his charming long legs.

260
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,800
It's like coming out of

261
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
a comic book.

262
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,440
Look at his

263
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,840
snow-white creamy muscles,

264
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,120
I really want to take a bite.

265
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,280
If only I had

266
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,080
such a boyfriend.

267
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
So handsome.

268
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,760
He's so handsome.

269
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,840
You've been watching it for so long.

270
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Have you bought the tickets?

271
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,440
Remember to buy tickets

272
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,000
next time. You're so good.

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,800
Sida?

274
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,960
Sis,

275
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,520
Thank you.

276
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,160
The first rule of the artist's code

277
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,040
says you can't hide something from me.

278
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,000
You haven't been hiding anything

279
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,120
from me lately.

280
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,000
No.

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,160
Are you in a relationship?

282
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,480
Love?

283
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,760
How can you be in love?

284
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,840
Then why did Ji Mo

285
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,960
talk to you yesterday,

286
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,480
He said you have someone you like.

287
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,200
No.

288
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,320
Yes, yes, I like her.

289
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,600
She doesn't know I like her.

290
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,160
She won't like me either.

291
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,880
So you are unrequited love.

292
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,600
Yes.

293
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,320
Look at your face,

294
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,720
how handsome you are,

295
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,880
With such a good figure

296
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
and personality,

297
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,800
The point is, after following me,

298
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,240
you'll have a bright future.

299
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,720
Why doesn't she like you?

300
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,880
So, sister,

301
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,920
You are.

302
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,720
For or against?

303
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,160
Of course I support it.

304
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,920
Really?

305
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,280
I support your unrequited love.

306
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,600
But I don't support you to fall in love.

307
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,400
Look,

308
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,840
So you can

309
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,120
practice your emotions.

310
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,280
There's no gossip.

311
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,000
How nice?

312
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,240
You're still young,

313
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,520
and there will be many girls

314
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,560
who like you in the future.

315
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,600
She doesn't like you.

316
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,720
She has no taste.

317
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,840
You.

318
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,280
Do you really think so?

319
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,400
Of course.

320
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,600
So?

321
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,480
You have to work hard

322
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,640
for the girl you like,

323
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,840
Hurry up and become

324
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,720
a qualified artist.

325
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,840
The rising star of Wing Fashion.

326
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,880
That's the first step.

327
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,360
Don't let it slip.

328
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,080
Okay.

329
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,320
and become even better.

330
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,280
Better.

331
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,080
Don't be nervous,

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,160
just take it

333
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,120
as normal training.

334
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,680
Relax.

335
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,680
It's too loose.

336
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,560
Mr. Ji,

337
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,200
you usually have a hard rehearsal,

338
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,760
I specially brought lunch for you.

339
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,320
We have Chinese food, western food,

340
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
coffee, milk tea,

341
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,360
Which one do you like?

342
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,760
I never eat

343
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,320
at work,

344
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,200
Take it back.

345
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,000
Thank you.

346
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,320
So professional.

347
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,160
What do you think?

348
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,160
Why are you here so early?

349
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,640
You always pick it up,

350
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,400
so that you can see someone earlier,

351
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,760
right?

352
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,680
Mr. Ji,

353
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,400
you're just in time.

354
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,800
Take Sida with you later,

355
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,680
and bring him with you more.

356
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,040
Don't worry,

357
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
your new product is a big show,

358
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,120
I'll put more effort into it

359
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
than usual.

360
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,560
Work hard and work hard.

361
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,160
The feud between us

362
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,200
is ours.

363
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,440
Don't affect the artist.

364
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,360
Don't worry.

365
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,400
What do you think?

366
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,160
Sis,

367
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,400
How was it just now?

368
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,840
I think it's not bad.

369
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,520
Mr. Ji,

370
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
what do you think?

371
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,320
Much better than before.

372
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,400
At least I won't faint.

373
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,160
Then we passed.

374
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,520
I didn't say that.

375
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,440
Fei'er,

376
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,119
are you confident that you can take him well

377
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,040
before the big show?

378
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,200
Yes

379
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,359
Okay, then he's

380
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:20,960
your responsibility.

381
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,160
It's not over yet. Keep up

382
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,079
the good work,

383
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,480
Of course.

384
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,120
Sida passed the interview

385
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,800
so successfully this time,

386
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,480
It's all because of you.

387
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,520
Thank you.

388
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,600
You've trained him so hard,

389
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,920
and it's all because of you.

390
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,240
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

391
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,040
That's all.

392
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,120
I'm done.

393
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Let's go after you finish.

394
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,880
I thought you changed your mind.

395
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,000
If you're still so cold,

396
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,520
I'll get going.

397
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,120
Hold on.

398
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,360
There's a letter for you.

399
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,080
When you're not here,

400
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,160
I signed it for you.

401
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,200
My ex-boyfriend threw it away for me.

402
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,560
Aren't you curious about the content?

403
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,480
If it says

404
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,920
he's terminally ill.

405
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,320
If I'm about to die,

406
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,200
I might be a little curious,

407
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,760
So heartless.

408
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,680
No one is born

409
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,960
to be so heartless.

410
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,280
Aren't you going to open it?

411
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,640
What if there's a misunderstanding?

412
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,520
Misunderstanding,

413
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,120
that's because you haven't experienced it.

414
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,440
Abandoned.

415
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,040
The pain of being cheated,

416
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,720
how do you know I didn't?

417
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,280
Can you do me a favor?

418
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,200
Open it for me.

419
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,080
If there's a letter of

420
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,400
apology in it,

421
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,160
Then don't tell me.

422
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,760
I hate

423
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,920
fake apologies the most.

424
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,880
This is not an apology letter.

425
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,200
This is an invitation.

426
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,000
He's getting married.

427
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,600
Silly girl.

428
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,920
Why are you waiting for me here?

429
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,520
I told you,

430
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,600
I can't shoot it now. I have to wait

431
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,840
until I finish the main character's play.

432
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,920
So it's my turn?

433
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,560
Take a break.

434
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,680
It's still hot.

435
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,160
Sit down.

436
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,960
Cold, right?

437
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,120
I'm fine.

438
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,240
Put on your scarf.

439
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,080
It's too cold.

440
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,960
Come on.

441
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,280
What is this?

442
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,960
Is this true?

443
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,560
Do you want to explain?

444
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,600
Explain what?

445
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,200
Didn't you already see it?

446
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,320
Let's break up.

447
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,920
What is this?

448
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,080
All these years,

449
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,880
I've done so much for you,

450
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
Yes, yes,

451
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,600
yes.

452
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,280
You've done a lot for me

453
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,320
over the years.

454
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,760
But you're not losing money, are you?

455
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,960
If it weren't for me,

456
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
you wouldn't be the gold broker

457
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,320
you are now,

458
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,800
Right?

459
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,760
So these years,

460
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,760
let's just take advantage of each other.

461
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,600
Can you walk well?

462
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,160
From the very beginning,

463
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,640
you've been absent-minded.

464
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,680
What's going on?

465
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,640
Feier,

466
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,640
Ruonan is never late.

467
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,160
But she's not here yet.

468
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,120
Do you think

469
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,160
anything happened to her?

470
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,440
So you're thinking,

471
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,800
Ruonan,

472
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,480
No.

473
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,240
You must work hard today.

474
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,640
You must arrange this dance well.

475
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,440
Okay.

476
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,800
Why are you here?

477
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,960
Today is my artist's

478
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,920
training time.

479
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,160
Who did I think it was?

480
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,360
I didn't expect it

481
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,080
to be Ruonan's former assistant,

482
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,480
I almost didn't recognize you.

483
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,640
You

484
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,080
know what?

485
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,640
When I first met her,

486
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
she was beaten black and blue.

487
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,720
I think

488
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,640
he was caught for making false accounts, right?

489
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I still remember,

490
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,920
Ruonan paid back the money for you,

491
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,080
And she asked you

492
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,880
to be her agent,

493
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,000
What?

494
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,240
This money

495
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,880
Is it not enough to rent this practice room,

496
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,600
Sida?

497
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,800
Let's keep practicing.

498
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,080
When Ruonan comes back,

499
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,000
we'll leave.

500
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,160
Let's go.

501
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,280
She won't come today.

502
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,120
If you want to leave, just leave.

503
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,680
How do you know she won't come?

504
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,080
You don't seem to know yet.

505
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,400
If Lin Huan, the male artist my male sister used to bring,

506
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,920
is getting married,

507
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,280
He sent invitations

508
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,400
to everyone in the company,

509
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
She might be embarrassed to come.

510
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,360
Maybe when people ask about her,

511
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,440
she'll be embarrassed.

512
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,640
After all, Lin Huanyi

513
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,240
disclosed her love affair back then.

514
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,200
Ruonan, hide him in the snow right away.

515
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Like garbage,

516
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,160
throw him away.

517
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,480
It's not easy to be

518
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,440
Ruonan's artist.

519
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,120
They may be abandoned at any time.

520
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,520
Be careful.

521
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,280
I don't believe it.

522
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,000
If a male sister is definitely

523
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,760
not that kind of person,

524
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,000
I saw her take care of Zihao

525
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,320
with my own eyes,

526
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,200
She doesn't even care about

527
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,160
a humble person like me,

528
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,680
You can take care of her wholeheartedly.

529
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,520
How is that possible?

530
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,520
She's the person I admire the most.

531
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,120
I'm really touched by what you said.

532
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,120
Childish.

533
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,200
Sida?

534
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,280
You don't have to waste your breath with people like that.

535
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,880
She doesn't even have a basic conscience.

536
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,640
Let's go.

537
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,880
What are you looking at?

538
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:11,960
Rehearsal,

539
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
super cool,

540
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,200
This season's clothing style is good,

541
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,200
find a model to try it on.

542
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,280
-Okay, Mr. Ji. -Mr.

543
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,000
Ji,

544
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,000
You're not going to rehearse?

545
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,920
Why are you here?

546
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,400
Did you see Ruonan today?

547
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,360
How is she feeling?

548
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,680
Is there any abnormal behavior?

549
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,520
She received a wedding invitation

550
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,680
from her ex-boyfriend,

551
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,480
From yesterday until now,

552
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,920
I've been staying at home.

553
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,160
Lin Huan, you bastard,

554
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,640
hurt Ruonan like that back then,

555
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,120
How dare you send her an invitation now?

556
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,680
I really,

557
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,960
what did Lin Huan do

558
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,240
to Ruonan back then?

559
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,840
He.

560
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,960
Lin Huan was Ruonan's first love,

561
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,240
and also the first artist she brought.

562
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,720
Don't look at how overbearing

563
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,600
the men's team is now,

564
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,840
Back then, for Lin Huan's sake,

565
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,720
she was so humble.

566
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,080
After being an underground lover for years,

567
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,200
Lin Huan had a period of time,

568
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,800
If you can't get the play,

569
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,400
what about Ruonan?

570
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,000
So I tried my best to earn money to support him.

571
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
He went to various crews

572
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
and film and television companies to recommend him,

573
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,760
Ruonan worked so hard

574
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,560
to make him popular.

575
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,720
As a result, he became popular,

576
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,000
but abandoned Ruonan.

577
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,520
And

578
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,800
in the cruelest way,

579
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,160
That bastard,

580
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,400
he's a double-timer when he's popular.

581
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,440
Ruonan didn't know

582
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,360
until she was told,

583
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,600
Do you know

584
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,000
what the most infuriating thing is?

585
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
-Yes. -What is it?

586
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,120
He admitted his relationship right away.

587
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,600
He refused to admit

588
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,280
his relationship with Ruonan,

589
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,520
Don't say that you're afraid of affecting your popularity.

590
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,760
It's just that Ruonan is foolish enough

591
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,080
to believe his nonsense.

592
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,080
He thought he could take this opportunity

593
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,560
to have a good time with a female star.

594
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,280
What's the result?

595
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,920
You burnt yourself.

596
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,400
His popularity declined,

597
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
and no one asked him to take the play.

598
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,680
It soon disappeared.

599
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,640
So, are those rumors

600
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,400
true?

601
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,560
Of course not.

602
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,680
A lot of people don't know

603
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,000
the story behind this,

604
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,080
Everyone thought Ruonanxue

605
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,400
hid Lin Huan,

606
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,520
So that's why

607
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,640
a lot of people call her,

608
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,360
Demon Agent,

609
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,800
she must be in a lot of pain.

610
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,960
It's not just pain,

611
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,120
but once a person is deeply hurt,

612
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,760
The wound will heal.

613
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,840
But the pain,

614
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,480
it won't go away.

615
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,400
It will take root

616
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,000
in your heart.

617
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,520
Then a thick layer

618
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,760
of armor grows,

619
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Ever since Ruonan broke up with Lin Huan,

620
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,800
she has changed a lot.

621
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,360
She doesn't believe in love anymore.

622
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,480
But I'm the only one who knows

623
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,680
that she's just protecting herself.

624
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm so upset.

625
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,880
That's because you haven't experienced it.

626
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,040
Abandoned.

627
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,880
The pain of being cheated.

628
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,080
What about Ruonan?

629
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,920
In the room,

630
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,120
Ruonan,

631
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,920
Dugu Ruonan,

632
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,720
Dugu Ruonan,

633
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,400
Ruonan.

634
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,440
You.

635
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,920
Dressed so beautifully,

636
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
you went to the party.

637
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,320
Let's talk inside.

638
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,280
What are you trying to do?

639
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,760
Lin Huan is such a bastard.

640
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,800
Are you getting married?

641
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,880
He even shamelessly

642
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,080
sent you this invitation.

643
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,520
Scum to the sky.

644
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,000
Tomorrow,

645
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,800
I'll go with you to tear the scumbag,

646
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,800
I'm not that free.

647
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,800
I'm not going.

648
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,440
He hurt you so badly before,

649
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,320
but now there's such a good chance for you

650
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,600
to relieve your anger

651
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,280
Why don't you go?

652
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,680
I thought about it a lot last night.

653
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,320
It's been so many years,

654
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,520
everybody

655
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,760
Everyone should

656
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,920
live a good life,

657
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,680
He can meet someone

658
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,120
who can get married.

659
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,240
That's great.

660
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,360
I'll bless him.

661
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,960
Where is Dugu Ruonan?

662
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,440
Where is she?

663
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Are you still

664
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,240
the Dugu Ruonan

665
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,480
I know?

666
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,400
I thought

667
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,000
I would hate him all the time,

668
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,720
But the moment I received the invitation,

669
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,200
I suddenly realized,

670
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,880
It's finally over.

671
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,800
In my life, this person

672
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,280
has come to an end.

673
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,760
The happiness in the past,

674
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,600
I still smile when I think of it.

675
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,760
And the pain he gave me,

676
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,360
made me grow up.

677
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,440
It's all these bits and pieces.

678
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,080
... made me who I am now.

679
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,560
I like who I am now.

680
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,800
So there's no need for people from the past

681
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,400
to see each other.

682
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,800
No matter what decision you make,

683
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
I respect you.

684
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,200
As long as you're happy.

685
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,480
Tear up the invitation for me.

686
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,320
Okay,

687
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,960
Where?

688
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,280
Okay.

689
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,280
Scum.

690
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,480
Scum.

691
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,560
Have you read the interview questions

692
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,920
and answers I sent you?

693
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,360
Yes, I did.

694
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,880
Have you memorized it?

695
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,480
Yes,

696
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,680
but sister,

697
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,360
I'm new.

698
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,800
Who would interview me?

699
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,440
Don't forget who your agent is.

700
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,920
I'm an agent

701
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,200
who has brought countless artists,

702
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,440
Those reporters

703
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,720
will be very interested

704
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,120
in my new artist.

705
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,680
Do your best later.

706
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,480
Don't let it slip.

707
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,560
Yes.

708
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm ready.

709
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,720
I'm ready.

710
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
I'll give you a taste of

711
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,920
what it's like to be noticed,

712
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,600
Let's go.

713
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,840
Come on!

714
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,320
Did you see that?

715
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,840
This is

716
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,560
the charm of me as a lonely man

717
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,120
Sida This is your dress,

718
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,240
Thank you.

719
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,600
Hello, Mr. Ji.

720
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,840
You're nervous.

721
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,440
None of your business.

722
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,160
Don't delay the show

723
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,640
because you're nervous.

724
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,840
Why did you

725
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,920
hug Ruonan just now?

726
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,360
You were the ones who pestered me first.

727
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,760
Why are you talking about me?

728
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,880
Are you and your agent

729
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,120
so unreasonable?

730
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,560
Do you like Ruonan?

731
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,160
Please go out for a while.

732
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,240
Okay,

733
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Give me one minute.

734
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,960
Okay, Mr. Ji.

735
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,480
Let's go.

736
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,320
If you ask me that,

737
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,360
it means you're full of jealousy.

738
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:13,760
The woman you said

739
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,960
you liked last time,

740
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,600
Is it Dugu Ruonan?

741
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,640
Yes.

742
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,840
Ruonan,

743
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,000
I just like Ruonan,

744
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,800
I like her very, very much.

745
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,080
In your eyes,

746
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,440
she may be a demon.

747
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,320
In my eyes, she is an angel.

748
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,080
That's what I'm willing to do.

749
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,000
Stay by her side silently.

750
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,720
I will never allow

751
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,000
anyone to hurt her,

752
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,000
You're still young.

753
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,720
You're so bold.

754
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,080
How dare you like a woman like that,

755
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
but don't worry,

756
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,120
I'm not interested in her.

757
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,160
Really?

758
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,840
Really?

759
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,160
But... But

760
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,720
what?

761
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,000
You like her?

762
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,720
But it aroused my interest.

763
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,680
It seems that

764
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,400
she is really a good medicine.

765
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,760
It's a good medicine.

766
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,040
It doesn't make sense.

767
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,679
Sit here.

768
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,960
This is the center of the VIP table.

769
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,040
He treats me so well,

770
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,360
Right here on the stage,

771
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,760
you can see Sida directly,

772
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,679
After all, you are his medicine.

773
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,760
What do you mean?

774
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,600
What medicine?

775
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,680
All right. Just do it.

776
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,880
OK, OK, OK. What about

777
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,320
Brother Lun?

778
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,440
There's going to be a stage accident.

779
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,360
What else can we do?

780
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
It can only be broken.

781
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,400
-Go and deal with it. -Okay.

782
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,800
What's going on?

783
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,600
The order of appearance of the models,

784
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,880
why can't they match the music?

785
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,280
Mr. Ji,

786
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,680
there's a model in front of us. Go faster,

787
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,880
There's one minute more time

788
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,160
than expected.

789
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,240
If it really doesn't work,

790
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,440
we can only break it.

791
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,360
No way.

792
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,560
Every part of this show,

793
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,440
is designed.

794
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,320
If it can't be broken in the middle,

795
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,760
then what should we do?

796
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,240
Someone has to make up for it this minute.

797
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,520
Who will make it up to you?

798
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,360
The models and costumes

799
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,120
have been matched.

800
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,800
All the models in front of us have finished walking.

801
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,240
Sida?

802
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,560
Come here.

803
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,160
Now it's like this.

804
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,240
It's an emergency.

805
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,200
I need you to be on the same stage

806
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,000
with Fei'er,

807
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,040
Let's go alone. I … I'll go

808
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,760
alone.

809
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,480
That's right.

810
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,000
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

811
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,200
But it's a big responsibility.

812
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,440
As long as you walk through it,

813
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,880
you can become a real artist.

814
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,560
I can't do it.

815
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
I'll go alone.

816
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,120
I … I can't.

817
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,560
I'm afraid I'll screw it up.

818
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,680
Why don't you think about

819
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,880
how to screw it up?

820
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,360
You have to think about

821
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,560
how to finish it successfully?

822
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,360
When you go on stage later,

823
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,320
don't think about anything.

824
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,680
Just remember,

825
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,240
you're the only one on the stage.

826
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,800
Off the stage,

827
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,440
only the one you care about the most.

828
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,360
The person you care about the most,

829
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,560
you just need to move on.

830
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,360
Every step you take,

831
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,200
you get closer to her.

832
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,760
You put your confidence in yourself.

833
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,760
The most dazzling moment,

834
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,840
show it to her.

835
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,600
You don't need to attract anyone.

836
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,080
You only need to attract her.

837
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,880
That's enough.

838
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,960
What is it?

839
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,200
What's wrong?

840
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,640
Wait a minute. In the stands.

841
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,600
You just need to move on.

842
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,080
Every step you take,

843
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,720
you get closer to her.

844
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,000
Why did Sida leave alone?

845
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,520
Aren't you with Fei'er?

846
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,240
New links.

847
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,800
Give him more encouragement.

848
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,600
Don't look at me.

849
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,840
Sida is great today.

850
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,040
Thank you.

851
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,160
Sida?

852
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,800
You did a great job.

853
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,760
That's great.

854
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,880
How is Sis?

855
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,880
I'm not

856
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,680
a qualified artist now.

857
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,400
A mature artist

858
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,840
needs a lot of training,

859
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
But you are already

860
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,160
a qualified model.

861
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,520
Don't worry, sister.

862
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,440
Within one year,

863
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,920
I promise to become

864
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,480
a qualified artist,

865
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,800
I'll protect you.

866
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,920
I won't let you get hurt again.

867
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,640
What are you talking about?

868
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,000
Who would hurt me?

869
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,760
Those people in the company.

870
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,560
Forget it.

871
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,680
No one will hurt me.

872
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,080
Hurry up

873
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,320
There are a lot of reporters out there,

874
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,880
so let's try to get more shots.

875
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,600
So fast.

876
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,360
Okay,

877
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,760
I've always valued

878
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,120
the reputation of the brand,

879
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,240
Yi Fashion Group's

880
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,560
women's clothing in China,

881
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,960
It has always been the top seller,

882
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,240
and it is also

883
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,040
very well-known internationally.

884
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,520
This time I can work with Mr. Ji,

885
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,200
I am very happy.

886
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,400
Okay, look this way.

887
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:47,920
Mr. Ji,

888
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,360
it is reported that this wing fashion show

889
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,560
is the theme of women's clothing,

890
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,160
Why did you use a male model?

891
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,320
Next, will this male model

892
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,080
cooperate further

893
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
with Yi Fashion?

894
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,880
This time, Yi Fashion's

895
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,720
new product show,

896
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,680
Not only did you hire a supermodel Fei'er,

897
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,280
but you also used a male model

898
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,280
to perform the catwalk,

899
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,840
Sida

900
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,120
Come and stand beside me.

901
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,520
Hurry up.

902
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,080
I'm Dugu Ruonan, right?

903
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,920
Be careful.

904
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,560
With so much media,

905
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,160
are you Ruonan's rumored boyfriend?

906
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,920
If you go now,

907
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,440
it will only make her more controversial.

908
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,000
Put me down.

909
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,560
I'll get you into trouble.

910
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,480
I don't care about that much.

911
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,440
I only care about you.

912
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,600
Why don't you eat?

913
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,920
Sis,

914
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,440
this is too spicy. I can't eat it.

915
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,120
It's okay.

916
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,400
It's not too spicy,

917
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,320
Waiter,

918
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,680
please

919
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,200
make it more spicy for me.

920
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,800
Okay, wait a moment.

921
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,560
Thank you.

922
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,880
It needs to be spicier.

923
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,080
It's spicy enough, sister.

924
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,080
I feel like I'm getting allergic.

925
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,040
It needs to be spicy,

926
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,640
the kind that makes people cry.

927
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,920
Sister,

928
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,960
you're crying.

929
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,760
Why are you crying?

930
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,440
I'll get you water and paper.

931
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,520
No need.

932
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,920
I.

933
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,880
Zhizhi,

934
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,360
I just want to cry.

935
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,720
I feel like

936
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,960
I'm crying after eating spicy pot.

937
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,640
It's not embarrassing at all.

938
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,200
Then you can cry.

939
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,920
Just cry.

940
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,080
It's okay. Just cry.

941
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,880
It's embarrassing.

942
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,400
It's such a big occasion,

943
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,040
and all the media are here.

944
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,000
Forget it then.

945
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,960
Why did I fall?

946
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,960
He has lost all his temperament.

947
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,400
Me,

948
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,720
At least

949
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,440
I'm a famous person.

950
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,080
But I fell over there.

951
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,720
What a mess.

952
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,800
It must be ugly.

953
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,920
Tomorrow's newspaper,

954
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,560
and the internet will publish these

955
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,280
embarrassing photos of me,

956
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
Not ugly, not in a mess.

957
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,040
Don't be embarrassed.

958
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,560
You are the most beautiful in my heart.

959
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,160
Really?

960
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,200
That's ugly.

961
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,920
I don't want you to think,

962
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,640
I want

963
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,640
… I want everyone to think that I'm

964
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,840
beautiful.

965
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,720
Mei Mei,

966
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,400
everyone thinks you're beautiful,

967
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,760
-Why are you so cute? -Sister, wait

968
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,800
a minute.

969
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,600
I'm sorry.

970
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,720
It's all because of me.

971
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,640
You didn't get interviewed.

972
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,040
If I wasn't

973
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,280
your agent,

974
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,240
Your attention will be

975
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,760
much more than it is now.

976
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,400
Sis,

977
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,000
What are you talking about?

978
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,160
If it hadn't been for you,

979
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,000
I would still be acting like a dragon in the crew,

980
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,480
If it wasn't for you,

981
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,320
how could I have made it

982
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,840
to such a big show?

983
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,120
If it weren't for you,

984
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,440
I wouldn't even have the right to dream.

985
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,360
You know what?

986
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,400
Don't say that

987
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
again.

988
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,240
Kid,

989
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,520
you're good at comforting people.

990
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,720
I'm not comforting you.

991
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,800
I'm telling the truth.
