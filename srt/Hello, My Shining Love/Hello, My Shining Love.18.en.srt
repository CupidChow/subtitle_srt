1
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,120
All right. Pour less. Pour

2
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,680
less.

3
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,280
today

4
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,400
Or you can give me

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,480
a satisfactory explanation.

6
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,640
Or you can drink all these drinks.

7
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,880
Otherwise, no one will leave.

8
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,240
Don't push him.

9
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,960
He's drunk.

10
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,760
I drank it for him.

11
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,440
Did I force him? I didn't force him.

12
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,480
As long as he can give me

13
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,680
a satisfactory explanation,

14
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,440
I won't drink anymore.

15
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,840
Ji Mo, stop drinking.

16
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,400
What if you really drink it to death?

17
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
It has nothing to do with me.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But I'm really scared.

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,080
What's wrong with you?

20
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,400
If a man is sad,

21
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,840
I don't understand.

22
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,040
You obviously like her,

23
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,320
but you don't have to make both of them

24
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
feel so bad.

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,280
Let's go.

26
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,120
Come with me to see Ruonan,

27
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
and make it clear face to face Let's go.

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,160
If you know my past,

29
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,800
and who I am,

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,680
I wouldn't have said such a thing.

31
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,640
In the past,

32
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,120
maybe you killed someone in the past

33
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
and let go of the fire.

34
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,560
I did kill someone.

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,480
Do you still trust me

36
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
to hand Ruonan over?

37
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,320
Ji Mo

38
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,360
Slow down. Slow down.

39
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,800
Be careful.

40
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,520
Who are you scaring?

41
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,280
Why did you force him

42
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,360
to drink so much?

43
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,240
What if something really happens?

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,200
I'm talking to you.

45
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,720
Why are you acting so weird?

46
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,000
What did Ji Mo say to you just now?

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,280
He said

48
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,280
he was wrong,

49
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,640
He's lying to me.

50
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,080
He must be lying to me.

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,680
In order to avoid responsibility,

52
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,000
you scared me

53
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,320
No I have to

54
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,120
call Ruonan,

55
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,800
I have to stop thinking about her

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,440
Wait! Wait!

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,519
Please don't

59
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,040
get involved in their relationship.

60
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,000
There is no standard

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,480
for love.

62
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,520
You can't say who's right and who's wrong.

63
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,160
Am I right?

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,480
Besides,

65
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,200
you're not a client.

66
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,760
Let's make a clean break,

67
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
or keep pestering,

68
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,520
Let them choose for themselves.

69
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,760
But I can't just watch her

70
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,560
make a mistake,

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,360
Fall in love with a jerk.

72
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
Let me tell you,

73
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,200
what a person really thinks,

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,920
It's hard for outsiders

75
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,280
to get involved and understand,

76
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,000
Didn't I give psychological counseling

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,160
to many patients?

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
In fact, most of them

79
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,280
don't know what they want

80
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,720
in their hearts?

81
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,920
They were just kidnapped

82
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
by morals and standards. Truth,

83
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,920
Do you know

84
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,600
what the scariest thing is?

85
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,760
They live in

86
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,240
the definition and evaluation of others,

87
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,600
Others are hell.

88
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,920
That's what Sartre said,

89
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Let's

90
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,920
not be their hell.

91
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,120
Just let them

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,240
find out for themselves.

93
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,680
But look at

94
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,160
how desperate he is.

95
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,320
He not only tortured himself,

96
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,200
but also took Ruonan with him,

97
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,120
Suffer with him.

98
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,000
I really can't stand it.

99
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,720
Ji Mo has been

100
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,120
closing his heart now,

101
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,560
In fact, we both know that

102
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,240
he has a crush on Ruonan,

103
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,200
He's just afraid that he'll hurt her

104
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,880
if he's like this.

105
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,040
He's been

106
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,400
running away from his feelings,

107
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,120
I think,

108
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,600
the cause of all the problems,

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,840
It's because of Su Xiao.

110
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,080
Su Xiao

111
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,760
Ji Mo's ex-girlfriend?

112
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,200
That's easy.

113
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,040
Find her.

114
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
Let's ask him face to face.

115
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,320
Look at what I've said,

116
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,640
why don't you get it?

117
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,080
Stop messing around.

118
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,240
Slow down.

119
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,840
Fei'er,

120
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,600
what I told you in the car,

121
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Don't take it seriously.

122
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,920
Don't tell Ruonan.

123
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,600
Okay,

124
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,320
Okay, don't worry.

125
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,120
I won't tell you.

126
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,000
Then I won't see you off.

127
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,600
Let's go.

128
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,120
Goodbye.

129
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,080
Slow down.

130
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,640
Bye.

131
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,600
Hello Xiao Xiao,

132
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,520
can you help me investigate

133
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,080
Ji Mo's ex-girlfriend Su Xiao?

134
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,720
I want all of her information. -Come

135
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,760
on. -Slow down.

136
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,640
Sit down.

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,800
Ji Mo,

138
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,800
didn't you say

139
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,920
you've let go of the past?

140
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,080
Don't torture yourself

141
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,280
like this.

142
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,360
I tried to give up.

143
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,640
But every time I want to start

144
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,800
my life again,

145
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Su Xiao will appear

146
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
in front of me.

147
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,320
You've

148
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,560
been standing still.

149
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,360
You've never walked

150
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,680
out of Su Xiao's shadow,

151
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,080
A lot of people's pain

152
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,840
comes from their obsession

153
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,800
with the past,

154
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,280
Su Xiao is gone.

155
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,560
She's dead.

156
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,400
You're still binding yourself

157
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
to that obsession of the past,

158
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,320
Does it make sense?

159
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,040
Even if Su Xiao sees you

160
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,160
like this today,

161
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,520
She won't be happy either.

162
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,360
You're not feeling well

163
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,760
lately. Stay with me first.

164
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
I'm looking at you.

165
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,720
Where did you go last night?

166
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,560
To be honest,

167
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,280
I watched you

168
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,640
get into Zhao Yucheng's car,

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,680
Change your shoes.

170
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Last night,

171
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,800
I went to a bar.

172
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
I watched the night scene,

173
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,600
drank wine,

174
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
And then?

175
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,560
And then?

176
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,800
Then we went home separately.

177
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,440
It's boring.

178
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,680
By the way,

179
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,600
Well,

180
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,640
the necklace,

181
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,680
Let me have a look.

182
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
I returned it.

183
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,080
Are you out of your mind?

184
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,600
Are you just going to return it?

185
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,160
He's my client.

186
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
Of course I have to return it.

187
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,080
Don't tell me.

188
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,760
You can't tell that

189
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,920
he has feelings for you.

190
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,720
In such a public place,

191
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,840
I gave you

192
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,440
such an expensive necklace,

193
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,640
It's not obvious.

194
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Do you mean

195
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,440
I want to pursue this woman?

196
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,120
He's rich

197
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,360
and handsome,

198
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,080
You can be romantic.

199
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
What are you holding back?

200
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,720
Don't tell me.

201
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,960
You still can't forget Ji Mo?

202
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,920
It has nothing to do with Ji Mo.

203
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,720
I've made it clear to him.

204
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,840
Really?

205
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,560
Then I'm relieved.

206
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,320
Just because of Ji Mo,

207
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,120
don't go back to your old state.

208
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Zhao Yucheng,

209
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,040
a diamond man like him,

210
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,600
You must catch him.

211
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,440
Got it?

212
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,760
Diamonds will appreciate in value.

213
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,680
Where are the women?

214
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,520
It will depreciate.

215
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,080
So now,

216
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,760
there are still men willing to spend money for you.

217
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,800
Buy romance

218
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
and hold on to it,

219
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,320
Got it?

220
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,800
There won't be such a shop after this village.

221
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,720
I'm telling you,

222
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,120
who said a woman would lose value?

223
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,640
We're going to be women

224
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,160
who are worth more than diamonds,

225
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,000
Tell me honestly,

226
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,920
do you have feelings for Zhao Yucheng?

227
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,720
Zhao Yucheng,

228
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,360
Zhao Yucheng,

229
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,640
Zhao Yucheng,

230
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,640
I don't think he's real.

231
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,960
I don't think I can see

232
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,840
any weakness in him,

233
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,120
Isn't it good to have no shortcomings?

234
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,880
You have to look for

235
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,320
the kind of shortcomings that are always there,

236
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
You're the one who's sick,

237
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,400
aren't you?

238
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,680
You're crazy.

239
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,040
You don't understand.

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,520
He's a very troublesome person.

241
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,360
It's the easiest way to break through.

242
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,880
Because their desire

243
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,520
and purpose are obvious,

244
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,600
But,

245
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,400
on the surface,

246
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,800
people who seem to be calm and gentle,

247
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,240
It's often the most difficult.

248
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,720
It's not that they don't have desires,

249
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,880
but that they hide

250
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,240
their desires deeply.

251
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,240
Zhao Yucheng is very shrewd,

252
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,960
just say one thing,

253
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,520
You just don't like it.

254
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,360
If you like it,

255
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,120
Whatever you want.

256
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,520
Don't I know you well?

257
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,760
Dugu Ruonan,

258
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,800
the thing I'm most interested in right now,

259
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,720
It's about how to

260
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,120
make Sida popular.

261
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,960
So that I can

262
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,440
count money every day,

263
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,000
I also want to count money every day.

264
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,720
Okay, I'm going to get changed.

265
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,480
I have a job interview later?

266
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,960
6million's necklace.

267
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
You're crazy.

268
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,120
Sweet embrace,

269
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,920
Sida

270
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,560
Come to my office.

271
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,720
Sit down

272
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,360
This one

273
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,600
It's your schedule and schedule

274
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,920
for next week,

275
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,840
From next week,

276
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,840
you will officially debut

277
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,080
as a singer.

278
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,840
Let me tell you,

279
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,920
next Wednesday.

280
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,440
That is, on the 20th of this month, at 3: 00

281
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,240
p. m.,

282
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,520
It's the release of your single album.

283
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,000
When the time comes, there will be an exclusive

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,160
live broadcast by a media,

285
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,000
There will be an interview

286
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,760
later. I've listed all the questions for you.

287
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,480
Just write it down.

288
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,400
Take a look.

289
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,360
Are you listening?

290
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,440
Yes,

291
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,800
this is the critical period of your career,

292
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,520
I want you to cheer up,

293
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,280
or all the efforts we've done before

294
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,120
will be in vain.

295
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,000
Sis,

296
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,280
What did you do?

297
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,000
What I mean is,

298
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,560
I'd rather go back and be a walk-on.

299
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,720
I don't want you to betray yourself.

300
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,840
Sacrificing the hue,

301
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,640
no one would sacrifice himself

302
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,040
to sell the hue.

303
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,320
Did Zhao Yucheng give you a ride?

304
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,120
Diamond necklace,

305
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,160
photos are out,

306
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
And what else

307
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,440
did the Internet say about you?

308
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
They said that in order to get the endorsement,

309
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,320
I got close to Zhao Yu

310
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,600
and became someone to talk about me behind my back.

311
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,840
Forget it.

312
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,200
Even you don't believe me.

313
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,280
Yes,

314
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,480
I want to get

315
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,600
Ruiqi's endorsement for you,

316
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,200
But I don't have to do it

317
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,960
just for an endorsement,

318
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,760
I'm going to betray myself.

319
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,400
Or do you all think that

320
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,280
a woman's success,

321
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,880
You have to rely on men to get the upper hand.

322
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,440
No,

323
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,200
I'm sorry, sister.

324
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Remember,

325
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,000
don't use your eyes and ears

326
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,280
to know someone,

327
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,560
Use your brain and heart.

328
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,680
Remember, sister,

329
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,560
However,

330
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,680
Ruiqi's endorsement,

331
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,200
Can we give up?

332
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,360
I don't want you to be misunderstood all the time,

333
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,200
and I hate Zhao

334
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Yucheng very much,

335
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,080
I'm always around you.

336
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,600
You're still a newcomer.

337
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,240
I'm not qualified to pick partners.

338
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,040
This is an agent's business.

339
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,040
Don't give it to me.

340
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,400
I've been thinking too much,

341
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,280
preparing for the new album,

342
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,200
Also,

343
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,320
we're in a partnership,

344
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,440
Who should I contact in private?

345
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,920
You don't have to worry.

346
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,880
Ruonan,

347
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,480
a new assistant has been found.

348
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,080
That's great.

349
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,760
Now is the time to be short of people,

350
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,960
ask her to report it immediately.

351
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,720
Okay.

352
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,760
Ruonan's

353
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,000
new assistant is here.

354
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,720
No way.

355
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,920
Absolutely not.

356
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,480
Why are you here again?

357
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,520
You're really haunting me.

358
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,520
Fans nowadays

359
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,840
are so arrogant.

360
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,760
You even dare to apply for an assistant.

361
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,560
I'm not a fan.

362
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,880
I'm Sida's friend.

363
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,080
Don't come near me. I've seen

364
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,520
a lot of girls like you.

365
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,760
Are you leaving or not?

366
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,920
No, I'm calling security.

367
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,600
You,

368
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,920
Okay,

369
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,800
about last time,

370
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,800
I apologize to you and Sida.

371
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,160
It's my fault.

372
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,080
I shouldn't have dragged Sida into this,

373
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,560
but this time I'm here

374
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,520
to apply for an assistant sincerely,

375
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,840
Okay,

376
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,720
I promise you,

377
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,880
I will work hard.

378
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,080
I'll behave myself.

379
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,400
I won't make trouble.

380
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,480
Look, I've come all the way here

381
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
to apply for the job.

382
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,720
Don't you think

383
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,040
I'm sincere?

384
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,480
I don't think so,

385
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,840
Sis,

386
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,760
It's good that you don't think so.

387
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,000
This man is extremely unreliable.

388
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,320
It's very unreliable.

389
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,720
Don't make trouble here.

390
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,640
Please,

391
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,800
go back now.

392
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,000
Why am I unreliable?

393
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,800
How do you know?

394
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,680
I can't be an assistant.

395
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,960
How do you know if you don't try?

396
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,920
What do you know?

397
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,000
Do you know what an assistant is doing?

398
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,680
You know what?

399
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
I don't know.

400
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,880
I can learn.

401
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,840
I'm telling you, I'm smart.

402
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,440
To manage an artist like you,

403
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,240
it's easy.

404
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,880
I don't agree.

405
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,680
Anyway, I don't agree.

406
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,560
I will never agree to it.

407
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,680
Right, sister?

408
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,240
After thinking about it,

409
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,000
people change.

410
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,880
Sida?

411
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,160
You should give him

412
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,320
a chance.

413
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,840
You said your name is

414
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,600
Qiansha,

415
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,080
Shen Qiansha,

416
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,920
all right,

417
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,960
From now on,

418
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,520
you'll be Sida's assistant.

419
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,560
Come to work in a couple of days,

420
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:11,839
Sis,

421
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,280
Take her to the HR department

422
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,720
to welcome you.

423
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,520
Got it.

424
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,599
Sis,

425
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,960
Come with me.

426
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,319
Sister,

427
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:25,880
you won't really

428
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,040
let Qiansha stay.

429
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,400
Do you know

430
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,440
who Shen Qiansha is?

431
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
What kind of person could she be?

432
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,200
She's just a troublemaker.

433
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,880
Really?

434
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,040
Just now, HR told me,

435
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,280
she is the daughter of

436
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,800
the chairman of Ruiqi Group,

437
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,800
Zhao Yucheng,

438
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,320
it doesn't look that big.

439
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,000
Why does he have

440
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,120
such a big daughter? Zhao Yucheng

441
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,720
is the CEO and shareholder.

442
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,960
Well, Mr. Chairman,

443
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,880
Shen Qiansha is a good

444
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,520
network resource for you.

445
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,400
As it happens,

446
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,080
I want to be

447
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,240
the spokesperson of Ruiqi,

448
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,320
So I let her stay.

449
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,560
Get on well with each other.

450
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,480
If she stays,

451
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,440
she will

452
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,400
follow me every day.

453
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,360
No, no, no.

454
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,400
Don't worry.

455
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,880
It won't be long,

456
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,560
She will take the initiative to leave.

457
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,440
Really?

458
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,120
How can

459
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,640
such a young lady suffer?

460
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,200
It's not easy to be an assistant.

461
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,320
She will retreat soon.

462
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
My Lady,

463
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm sure

464
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,840
she won't be able to take it anymore in a few days.

465
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,560
She'll be gone by then.

466
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,000
Sida?

467
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,960
Sida. Sida,

468
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,480
I'm looking for you.

469
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,080
You know what?

470
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,320
I've got the job

471
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,240
done at HR,

472
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,880
I'm

473
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,680
your assistant now.

474
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,800
This is your business.

475
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,880
It has nothing to do with me.

476
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,600
How come it doesn't matter?

477
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,880
I'm your personal assistant.

478
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,120
I'll take care of your food, clothing, housing and transportation.

479
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,760
I don't need to be taken care

480
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,880
of. Sida, don't go.

481
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,840
You don't even know,

482
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,920
but I applied for the job

483
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,840
specially for you,

484
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,200
After you left,

485
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,880
I was in Yunnan by myself,

486
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,800
It's so boring.

487
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,360
And I miss you so much.

488
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,080
Wait a minute. If you're bored,

489
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,960
go to your friend.

490
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,200
Why are you looking for me?

491
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't have any friends.

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,080
How is that possible?

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,960
Ever since I was a kid,

494
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,080
I've been accompanied by nannies and housekeepers.

495
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,600
I'm going to school.

496
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,240
As soon as the class is over,

497
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,680
my dad's driver,

498
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,720
So he picked me up.

499
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,480
I don't have much communication

500
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,440
with my classmates.

501
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,600
And those people who are circling around me.

502
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,840
It's all because of my family's background,

503
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,200
so I don't care about them.

504
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,640
So you're my only friend.

505
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,680
Our only friend.

506
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,000
We've only known each other for a few days.

507
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,200
You don't have to come all the way

508
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,520
here for me, do you?

509
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,920
And you're here to apply for an assistant.

510
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,560
There must be a limit to your nonsense.

511
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,880
It really doesn't suit you.

512
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,640
Just go.

513
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,040
I'm not fooling around.

514
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,160
I'm serious.

515
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,080
Didn't you say we're not

516
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,240
from the same world?

517
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,880
Then I'll go to your world.

518
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,920
Come and see

519
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,080
what your world is like?

520
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,600
Then I can try to

521
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,800
integrate into your world.

522
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,000
But in my world,

523
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,760
you don't have to be a but.

524
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,480
You need to hire an assistant anyway.

525
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,400
Wouldn't it be better

526
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,440
to have someone familiar with you?

527
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,520
Future superstar,

528
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,440
show me around the company.

529
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:53,960
What do you think?

530
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,320
No, no, no.

531
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Sure,

532
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,120
let's go.

533
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,920
I have something to do.

534
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,600
I have something to do.

535
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,440
I really have something to do.

536
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,560
-Let's go. -I'm not leaving.

537
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,720
Mr. Ji,

538
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,520
what about this morning?

539
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,720
We need to have a meeting with the Design Department,

540
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,880
to determine the design plan

541
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,640
of Gao Ding series,

542
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,280
In the afternoon,

543
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,200
I'm going to attend an international fabric exhibition,

544
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,120
I'm going to have dinner

545
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,760
with a Spanish fabric

546
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,800
supplier tonight.

547
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,120
Okay,

548
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,240
got it.

549
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,960
Well,

550
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,680
at the charity dinner yesterday,

551
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,720
Did you go?

552
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,640
Are you okay?

553
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,000
I think,

554
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,600
what about Ruonan?

555
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
I still like you.

556
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,520
Who knew a CEO of Ruiqi

557
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,640
would be killed halfway,

558
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,200
You even came up here to give me such a big gift,

559
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,520
but I can't bear it.

560
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:38,960
Am I right?

561
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,480
What did you say?

562
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,960
If you don't know,

563
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
let me show you.

564
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,920
The employees of the company

565
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,000
have already spread the word.

566
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,120
He said Sida was going to shoot

567
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,960
the music video,

568
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,280
It was sponsored by Zhao Yucheng.

569
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,200
I think he has been in love

570
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,320
with Ruonan for a long time.

571
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,440
Mr. Ji,

572
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,080
where are you going?

573
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,080
We have a meeting later

574
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,480
Mr. Ji, who are you looking for?

575
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,640
Sir,

576
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,680
you can't do it without an appointment.

577
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,440
Feel free to come in.

578
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,320
Sir,

579
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,720
sir doesn't have an appointment,

580
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,880
You can't just come in.

581
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,840
It's okay.

582
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,280
Invite him in.

583
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,080
You're finally here.

584
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,920
But it was much later

585
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,840
than I expected,

586
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,560
Why did you approach

587
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Dugu Ruonan?

588
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,600
The first question

589
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,400
you asked me

590
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,480
after years of not seeing me,

591
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,320
It's all because of

592
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,680
Dugu Ruonan,

593
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,480
Is she important?

594
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,280
Yes.

595
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,440
She means a lot to me.

596
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,760
So please

597
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,760
don't go near her.

598
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,800
What about Su Xiao?

599
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,680
What is Su Xiao?

600
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,760
About Su Xiao,

601
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,080
it has nothing to do with Dugu Ruonan,

602
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't want to involve her.

603
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,720
it seems

604
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,800
You care about Dugu Ruonan,

605
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,040
but the more you care about her,

606
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,840
The more interested I am in her.

607
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,400
Or you can just admit to me,

608
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,400
that you're in love with Dugu Ruonan,

609
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,320
Do I have to answer

610
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,280
such a question?

611
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,760
You don't have to answer.

612
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,560
But I have to remind you,

613
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,480
you have a life on your back.

614
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You thought you owed Su Xiao

615
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,960
back then.

616
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,600
Can you still fall in love

617
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,200
with another woman openly?

618
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm telling you,

619
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,720
you don't deserve it.

620
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,320
Do you deserve to interfere

621
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,880
in my love and life?

622
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,480
If you have any resentment, come at me.

623
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,920
I'll wait for you.

624
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,960
I'll wait for you too.

625
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,440
Shengnan,

626
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,800
according to your request,

627
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,160
to launch a music album promotion,

628
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,000
and,

629
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,360
With the song "Big Woman",

630
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,680
our media

631
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,640
reposts

632
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,080
have accumulated

633
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,320
more than 200 thousand.

634
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,400
How's the sales of the new album?

635
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,400
The sales volume of electronic products

636
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,600
has reached about 50 houses.

637
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,840
For a new singer,

638
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,360
this is already a very good result.

639
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,080
Okay,

640
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,520
Thank you for your hard work.

641
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,480
The publicity on the Internet is great,

642
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,600
but remember,

643
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,680
The information on the Internet

644
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,880
has been updated very quickly,

645
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,000
So we need to keep up with

646
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,280
some new content,

647
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,240
What are you doing?

648
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,720
On one side is the gold owner of Ruiqi,

649
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,560
and on the other is Yi Fashion's old love,

650
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,080
Now Shengnan is going to have a headache.

651
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,240
I'm... I'm in a meeting.

652
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
What are you doing?

653
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,080
Dugu Ruonan,

654
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,160
I want you to leave that.

655
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,560
Stay away from the man named Zhao Yucheng.

656
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,320
Why?

657
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,360
Because I won't allow it.

658
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,120
Because you're jealous.

659
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,000
Whatever you think,

660
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,280
you just need to stay out of contact with him.

661
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,000
Didn't you tell me not to wait for you?

662
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,160
Then why are you still bothering me?

663
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,760
If you're in contact with other men,

664
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,720
it's not that I don't want you

665
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,960
to be in contact with other men,

666
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,200
I don't want you to be in contact

667
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
with Zhao Yucheng.

668
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,600
Yu Gong

669
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,640
Ruiqi sponsored

670
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,080
the shooting of Star's music video,

671
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,520
Besides,

672
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,440
we are interested in discussing the future cooperation,

673
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,520
In private,

674
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,440
Zhao Yucheng is a good-looking person,

675
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,960
Have a successful career, gentle

676
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,800
and generous, polite,

677
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,280
Why can't I get in touch with him?

678
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,600
I should get in touch with him.

679
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,280
When he contacted you,

680
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,760
he obviously didn't have a pure purpose for him,

681
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,000
Then what is your purpose?

682
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,000
Is your purpose pure?

683
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,480
Now when I'm in a meeting,

684
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,440
pull me out.

685
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,960
What do you want to do?

686
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,280
You only care about

687
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,600
the patient's mental thoughts,

688
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,800
Don't you care about

689
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,520
what I'm thinking?

690
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,440
You don't know how to

691
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,000
love someone at all,

692
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,120
You don't know how to love me at all.

693
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,360
Between us,

694
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,240
it's over.

695
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,960
He's my boyfriend.

696
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,760
All in all,

697
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,560
he's not as simple

698
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,280
as you think.

699
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,040
Whether it's Zhao Yucheng,

700
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,400
simple or complex,

701
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,960
At least he won't be like you,

702
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,480
he won't be like you,

703
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,400
He said

704
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
nothing happened

705
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,200
between us.

706
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,000
You come to disturb my life again.

707
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,800
If you don't have

708
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,000
anything else to do,

709
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,880
You can leave now.

710
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,440
I want to start my new life.

711
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,840
I won't see you off.

712
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,240
Are you going to be with him?

713
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,120
Yes.

714
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,240
I want to be with him.

715
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,640
If you fall in love today and get engaged tomorrow,

716
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,840
I'll ask someone to give you

717
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,080
the wedding invitation the day after tomorrow.

718
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,560
Sida?

719
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,920
Sida?

720
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Why are you here?

721
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,760
Didn't Ruonan ask you

722
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,400
to come back to work two days later?

723
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,520
I decided to come to work one day earlier.

724
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,680
Get familiar with the situation.

725
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,120
I came to pick you up from work.

726
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,400
I don't need it.

727
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,680
Where are you going?

728
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,480
Let's go home.

729
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,200
Let me give you a ride.

730
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,320
I've been training for a whole day and I'm tired.

731
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,360
Can you stop following me?

732
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,040
Leave me alone.

733
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,880
-Okay? -Thank you. Who's that girl next

734
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,560
to Sida?

735
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,680
Why haven't I

736
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,400
seen her before,

737
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,760
Ruonan hired a new assistant

738
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,800
for Sida,

739
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,440
You don't understand me at all.

740
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,960
Why are you working with me?

741
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,080
Then tell me. How would I know

742
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,000
if you didn't tell me?

743
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,680
It's good.

744
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,120
I haven't done anything yet.

745
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Put up the shelf first.

746
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,800
Let's go.

747
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,320
Let me show you my world.

748
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,520
Don't take it from me.

749
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,400
Excuse me,

750
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:39,920
young man.

751
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,360
I'm sorry.

752
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,760
Excuse me.

753
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,240
Excuse me. Let me pass.

754
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,440
I'm sorry.

755
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,120
Sida?

756
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,680
Are you getting off?

757
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,320
No, I won't.

758
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:12,840
Excuse me. Excuse me.

759
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,360
-I'll get off. -I'll get off. How

760
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,120
did you drive here?

761
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,160
Why are you so heavy?

762
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,600
Stand still.

763
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,000
Hold my hand.

764
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,560
Don't fall down again.

765
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,080
Hello Xiao Xiao

766
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,680
Hello Fei'er,

767
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,240
About what you asked me to investigate,

768
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,240
I found out.

769
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
What do you think?

770
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,920
I asked someone

771
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,480
to find an old classmate of Ji Mo's,

772
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,840
He happens to know

773
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,880
Su Xiao,

774
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,280
He said Su Xiao

775
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,520
disappeared

776
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,880
three years ago,

777
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,240
What does she

778
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,080
look like?

779
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,640
Tell me.

780
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,440
Get to the point.

781
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,800
How did he die?

782
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,760
say yes

783
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,200
Breast cancer.

784
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,360
You can't call him.

785
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,120
If I contact him,

786
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,160
won't it seem like I'm taking the initiative?

787
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,720
Hello, what's the matter?

788
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,320
Ruonan,

789
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,080
I have something to tell you.

790
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,320
But I don't know

791
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,720
where to tell you?

792
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
Think about it before you talk about it.

793
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,840
Don't take up my phone like this.

794
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,760
What if

795
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,520
someone calls me?

796
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,840
Are you waiting for a call?

797
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,440
What if you don't have

798
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,600
anything important to do,

799
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,480
Then tell me next time.

800
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,840
Or text me.

801
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,240
Actually,

802
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,240
it's not that urgent,

803
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,160
I just.

804
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,280
I won't contact you if I don't.

805
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,040
Don't contact me.

806
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,840
Is this from our company?

807
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,520
Why is the new comer so handsome?

808
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,600
You don't look like an employee.

809
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,600
You're new here.

810
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,920
This brand of stuff is really easy to use.

811
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,840
I'm talking to you.

812
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,120
I don't know you.

813
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,720
What are you talking to me about?

814
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,640
Are you awake?

815
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,040
-See who I am before you open your mouth. -Who

816
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,560
are you?

817
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,760
Dugu Ruonan is indeed

818
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
looking for an assistant.

819
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,920
Just like her,

820
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,040
you're so rude and rude!

821
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,760
Can you figure it out?

822
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,600
I'm Sida's assistant,

823
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,240
not Dugu Ruonan's assistant,

824
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
Don't confuse me with her.

825
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,880
Since he's Sida's assistant,

826
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,920
I don't even know

827
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,840
his senior.

828
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,560
Senior,

829
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,320
my name is Shen Qiansha.

830
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,640
I just joined the company,

831
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,240
and I'm not familiar with

832
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,440
the stars of the company.

833
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,760
Don't argue with me.

834
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,320
I told you,

835
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,880
you must remember me well.

836
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,800
I'm Song Zihao.

837
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,360
He's the first brother of this company,

838
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,160
Song Zihao,

839
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,440
Since you work for Sida,

840
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,960
and I'm Sida's senior brother,

841
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,760
If Sida

842
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,520
encounters any difficulties in the future,

843
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,680
And what unhappy things,

844
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,360
you have to tell me at the first time.

845
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,080
I might be able to help you.

846
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,280
No problem.

847
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,200
Senior,

848
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,560
are you familiar with him?

849
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,440
Do you know

850
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,640
what his habit is?

851
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,200
Like what you like to eat,

852
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,240
what movies you like to watch,

853
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,440
Or if he has any hobbies,

854
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,480
why don't you make a list for me,

855
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,400
I'll add you on WeChat. Is it convenient

856
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,320
for you to read it?

857
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,200
Do you want me to scan you

858
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,520
or you to scan me?

859
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,040
Let me scan you.

860
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,880
Come on.

861
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,400
Let me add you on WeChat.

862
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,920
Send this to you

863
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,480
for me.

864
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:09,960
Shengnan,

865
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,080
according to this publicity plan,

866
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,080
A number of interview questions

867
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,679
and key points of response have been drawn up,

868
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,600
Take a look.

869
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,719
Is there anything that needs to be added

870
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,800
or deleted.

871
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,639
Okay.

872
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,639
For Sida,

873
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,440
Thank you.

874
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,360
Sida?

875
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,639
Your side face is so handsome.

876
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,440
Sida?

877
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,880
I'm so bored.

878
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,520
I miss you so much.

879
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,720
I think you wrote

880
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,160
a wide range of publicity,

881
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,160
However,

882
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,120
it seems that the strength is not strong enough.

883
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,040
I suggest spending

884
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,320
all the money on one point.

885
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,720
For example, we can pick

886
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,240
some

887
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,600
strong Weibo tuba on it.

888
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,000
And then focus on Sida,

889
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,360
some publicity,

890
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,640
Do your best.

891
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,640
It would be better

892
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,680
this way.

893
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,720
Okay,

894
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,080
let's reduce the publicity plan

895
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,920
later.

896
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,280
Add a few key ways,

897
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,240
and then I'll show you.

898
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,880
If you think it's okay,

899
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,920
we can implement Star again,

900
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,080
What would you like for lunch? Sure.

901
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,160
Ruonan,

902
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,560
I agree with you.

903
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,160
Let's try to discuss

904
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,760
a few key publicity channels

905
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,120
before lunch,

906
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,560
And try to get rid of it

907
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,440
before you get off work.

908
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,440
Okay,

909
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,840
What do you want?

910
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,040
Me

911
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,680
Sida, sit down.

912
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,440
Qiansha,

913
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,160
what did you say

914
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,120
during the meeting?

915
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,840
I saw a lot of notes

916
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,880
in your notebook.

917
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,680
Let me repeat it for you.

918
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,320
Everyone just said that Sida,

919
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,920
Yes

920
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,120
Add something in response,

921
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,560
and then,

922
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,040
seem

923
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,160
Nothing serious.

924
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,480
Then we'll have

925
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,760
lunch next,

926
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,520
Did you listen to

927
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,360
the meeting or not,

928
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,600
Even if you can't keep up with your pen,

929
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,760
you have to keep up with your brain.

930
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,720
This is the workplace.

931
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,680
If you don't have the ability, you can leave.

932
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,920
Ruonan,

933
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,520
why did you hire

934
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,480
such an unprofessional person?

935
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,680
Quit her now.

936
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,360
So as not to waste everyone's time.

937
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,640
I agree.

938
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,200
I don't need such an assistant.

939
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,360
Sida?

940
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,160
Discuss the direction you mentioned just now,

941
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,280
with everyone,

942
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,760
Try to finish it

943
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,520
before you get off work today.

944
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,720
Can you give it to me?

945
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,400
Okay,

946
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,080
Okay,

947
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,480
I need to go out for a while.

948
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,120
How dare you cry.

949
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,480
Don't think I don't know,

950
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,720
but you know it.

951
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,560
I can't write it down.

952
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,320
You made a fool of me on purpose.

953
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,080
Even if you can't remember all the keywords,

954
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,800
you can remember them, right?

955
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,320
But it's my first time

956
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,040
to be an assistant,

957
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,800
How would I know?

958
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,120
Remember the key words.

959
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,840
It's the first time

960
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,640
for someone else to be an assistant,

961
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,560
Why can others remember it?

962
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,640
You can't remember.

963
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,600
You are not ready

964
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
to enter the workplace.

965
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,120
You can't even

966
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,040
be serious.

967
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,000
If you want to

968
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,320
continue fooling around.

969
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,880
You'll be eliminated sooner or later.

970
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,040
Don't tell me the truth.

971
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,840
Don't think I don't know

972
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,560
what I'm worth,

973
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,600
Yes,

974
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,520
I did because

975
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,480
you're the sponsor's daughter,

976
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,680
That's why I let you stay.

977
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,200
But you have to know,

978
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,760
Star can have what it is today.

979
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,040
It's hard work.

980
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Any stumbling block

981
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,440
that could change the situation.

982
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,440
I'll kick it off.

983
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,400
include

984
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,320
The daughter of Ruiqi Group,

985
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,400
let me tell you,

986
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,760
I've seen too much of this rich second generation.

987
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,520
They're arrogant,

988
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,560
Laziness doesn't seek progress,

989
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,720
and you always want to use money to solve everything.

990
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,720
Then you're of

991
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,680
no use,

992
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,760
Since your value is limited,

993
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,680
my tolerance for you will also be limited.

994
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,800
What's wrong with the rich second generation?

995
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,480
Did I eat a grain of rice from your house?

996
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,920
You're aiming at me,

997
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,680
hating the rich and prejudicing me.

998
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,000
I didn't do anything against you.

999
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,680
On the contrary,

1000
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,320
I hope you can study hard.

1001
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,760
If you want to change the prejudice of others,

1002
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,200
you have to change yourself first.

1003
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,640
If you want to

1004
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,360
rely on your dad forever,

1005
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,320
Then no one will look down on you.

1006
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,800
Hello, Mr. Zhao,

1007
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,680
Ruonan,

1008
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,760
I'm downstairs in your office now.

1009
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,920
I'd like to invite you

1010
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,720
to dinner. Do you have time?

1011
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,880
Okay,

1012
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,800
Please wait for me.

1013
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,560
Get down now.

1014
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,560
Someone of real use

1015
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,280
is here.

1016
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,280
I won't waste

1017
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,080
my time

1018
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,480
on a useless person.

1019
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,880
And let me tell you,

1020
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,440
I know you like Sida.

1021
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,360
But work

1022
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,880
is not a shortcut to your idolize,

1023
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,560
If you want to stay with him,

1024
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,360
I'll give you two options now.

1025
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,880
Or you can be

1026
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,800
a vase quietly,

1027
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,840
Why don't you just be

1028
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,720
an assistant?

1029
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,400
Make your own choice.

1030
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,000
Dugu Ruonan,

1031
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,600
let me tell you,

1032
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,880
I won't be a vase.

1033
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,600
Don't think that

1034
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,560
the rich second generation is useless.

1035
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,120
I will do my best

1036
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,360
to study.

1037
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,720
I want Sida to know,

1038
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,960
who is the most important person to him?

1039
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,240
Okay.

1040
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,680
I'll wait and see.

1041
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,440
Ruonan,

1042
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,000
Mr. Zhao,

1043
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,760
Zhao Yucheng,

1044
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,680
Shen Qiansha,

1045
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,760
What are you doing here?

1046
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,600
Could it be?

1047
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,480
My dad asked you to take me back.

1048
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,400
Do you think I'm that boring?

1049
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,200
Who are you calling boring?

1050
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,560
What are you doing here?

1051
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,520
I'm looking for Ruonan.

1052
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,040
I got it.

1053
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,000
You are what she said,

1054
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,800
a valuable person.

1055
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,600
Let me tell you,

1056
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,480
a knife on the prefix,

1057
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,000
Don't be used as a gun by others.

1058
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,960
Shen Qiansha,

1059
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,320
Ruo Nan is my friend,

1060
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,360
Please respect her.

1061
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,280
As long as you're not sent by my dad.

1062
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,560
Who do I care who you're friends with?

1063
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,720
Don't worry.

1064
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,000
As for Uncle Shen,

1065
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,040
I won't say more.

1066
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,880
Alright then.

1067
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,200
Then you can catch up

1068
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,600
with your friends.

1069
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,040
I went to see Sida.

1070
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,760
Let's go.

1071
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,760
Sida said before,

1072
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,920
Qiansha escaped from marriage?

1073
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,240
That's right.

1074
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,240
Because she ran away from the marriage,

1075
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,920
It caused the two families to be in a state of unease.

1076
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,480
Then why did she run away from the marriage?

1077
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,760
Family marriage,

1078
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
she doesn't agree.

1079
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,240
So it's still too young

1080
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,640
to choose to run away from marriage.

1081
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,960
Marriage

1082
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,760
is an exchange of interests.

1083
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,160
There's no emotion at all.

1084
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,440
So, in your opinion,

1085
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,560
marriage is about profit,

1086
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,520
It doesn't matter if two people

1087
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,280
don't have feelings for each other.

1088
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,360
Of course.

1089
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,560
Is there a problem?

1090
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
I'm curious.

1091
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,360
Actually, in my concept,

1092
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,080
love is not eternal.

1093
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,280
It's the profit.

1094
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
Besides, in the adult world,

1095
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,120
the standard to measure the pros and cons.

1096
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,760
It has never been in front of

1097
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,760
love, love and bread,

1098
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,200
I won't get married for bread.

1099
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,840
But I will strive for bread.

1100
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,280
Let love be free from hunger.

1101
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,880
I can buy bread myself,

1102
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,440
but I can't buy love.

1103
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,160
That's why love is so precious.
