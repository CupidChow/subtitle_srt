1
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,520
Zimmer

2
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,120
I heard from Chen Fei'er.

3
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,840
What about

4
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,040
If I have forgiven you,

5
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,920
I told you.

6
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,320
You should tell Zhao Yucheng

7
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,480
I told her in advance.

8
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,000
To save you from being so passive now.

9
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,120
I didn't say it because...

10
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
If a man is in love,

11
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,760
Has suffered too many grievances.

12
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,800
I don't want her to suffer too much.

13
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
What should you do?

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,760
If a man can't understand it for a while,

15
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,680
I won't forgive you.

16
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,880
She won't forgive you.

17
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,240
You can't see her.

18
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Zhao Yucheng and her

19
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,600
It's a working relationship.

20
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,200
What about you?

21
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,280
How about you and her?

22
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,480
It has nothing to do with anything.

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,320
What can I do?

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,680
What should I do?

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,120
Yeah, what should we do?

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,720
I think this advertisement

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,680
You're right.

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,360
You have to be awake to fight.

29
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,320
What are you short of now?

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,360
Fighting spirit.

31
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,560
Zimmer

32
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,760
You can't give up.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
Think about it.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,240
If Ruo Man is with Zhao Yucheng,

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,720
What if you get hurt?

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,640
Did I say I was giving up?

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,040
There must be another way.

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,120
That's right.

39
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,360
There must be another way.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,400
Let me help you think about it.

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,600
She doesn't see you.

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,440
You can find a chance to see her.

43
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,920
You two are not related.

44
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,480
You can create relationships.

45
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,040
What's the relationship?

46
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,920
Can make you two

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,200
You can't look up.

48
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,760
Like us.

49
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,800
A relationship like ours.

50
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
roommate

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,360
roommate

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,880
That's enough.

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,760
Move back.

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,640
To solve the problem.

55
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,320
I want to move back.

56
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,720
If the man doesn't allow it,

57
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,080
Yes

58
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,280
It's impossible.

59
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,200
Then what should we do?

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,320
If you move back now,

61
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,920
If the man doesn't agree with it,

62
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,960
So you have to use something

63
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,200
The unorthodox means of flinging around.

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
But the premise is

65
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,560
You have to

66
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,080
To enter this house.

67
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,360
What can we do?

68
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,680
To enter the house.

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,000
And made her helpless.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,720
It can make you logical.

71
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,040
Unless she's out of her mind.

72
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,200
sleep walking

73
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,640
That's enough.

74
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
Solve the problem.

75
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,000
If a man

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,000
If you're really angry,

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,160
Why don't you go to see Ji Mo?

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,440
Or Zhao Yucheng.

79
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Scold them.

80
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,840
How about giving them a beating?

81
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,240
No.

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,760
Men are not good.

83
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,920
Alright.

84
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,680
Let's drink at home.

85
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,440
I remember last time,

86
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,480
I left a bottle of red wine here.

87
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,080
Right?

88
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,280
Where is it?

89
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,040
Don't drink.

90
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,760
Wine is not good.

91
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,560
What do you want then?

92
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,240
So that you can breathe.

93
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,720
I will sit here with you.

94
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,120
It's been two hours.

95
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,280
The strategic deployment is completed.

96
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Leave now.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,640
That

98
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,920
I'm leaving now.

99
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,000
Where are you going?

100
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
What you need now is

101
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,400
Calm down.

102
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,200
Think about it.

103
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Which man is it?

104
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,920
To make you more angry.

105
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,480
And more

106
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,840
Affect your mood.

107
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,240
That person is the one you like.

108
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,840
Let's go.

109
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,800
I don't want to think.

110
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,200
I don't want either.

111
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,520
Why are you here?

112
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
How dare you come?

113
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,880
Don't go in.

114
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,440
stop

115
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,840
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,120
Why didn't you react?

117
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,880
Wake up.

118
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
feed

119
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,160
Are you sleepwalking?

120
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,200
Really?

121
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,920
let it be

122
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,160
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

123
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,600
They hurt

124
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,800
It's time to leave.

125
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,520
If a man

126
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,080
If a man

127
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,440
If a man

128
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Come out.

129
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,440
How dare you come out?

130
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,320
Come out.

131
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,280
You're awake.

132
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,120
You're awake.

133
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,720
You didn't go out?

134
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,320
Good morning.

135
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,160
I was wondering

136
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,760
Every time you sleepwalk,

137
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,360
You can dream back.

138
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,720
You're sleepwalking.

139
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,160
I'm also a victim.

140
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,640
Can't be controlled.

141
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,680
Since I'm here,

142
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,440
Just let me stay.

143
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,200
I can't control it.

144
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,400
I went to the doctor to get the medicine.

145
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,800
Regarded as hopeless

146
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,200
And went to the hospital for treatment.

147
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,920
This is not a hospital.

148
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,080
Don't be angry in the morning.

149
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,160
It's easy to hurt the liver.

150
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,800
Let's talk about it.

151
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,360
Don't you know how to express yourself?

152
00:10:59,560 --> 00:10:59,880
Well

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,920
Look at me first.

154
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,440
Write a word on my face.

155
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,520
Can you tell?

156
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,360
roll

157
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,640
This misunderstanding needs explanation.

158
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,160
Give me a chance.

159
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,520
Please tell me

160
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,200
Is testing my endurance.

161
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,640
Is testing my intelligence.

162
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,680
Zhao Yucheng is Su Xiao.

163
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,840
brother

164
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,440
He approached me.

165
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,800
It's all for Su Xiao.

166
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,320
You already know that.

167
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,760
But you didn't tell me.

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,720
You two,

169
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,160
Acting and singing.

170
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,680
You fooled me.

171
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,160
I'm busy.

172
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,240
I have no time for you.

173
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,360
roll

174
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,760
I'm not leaving.

175
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,080
It's Star's first day in the team.

176
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't have time to talk to you.

177
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,600
If I come back tonight,

178
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,480
If you are still here,

179
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,680
I'll call the police.

180
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,480
I didn't dare.

181
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,960
Never seen a bad guy?

182
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,400
Wait for me.

183
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,680
Today, Star saved you.

184
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,200
Really?

185
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,920
Thank Star for me.

186
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Go home early.

187
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,040
Waiting for you.

188
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,920
Hello, Jia.

189
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,280
You're doing 24 scenes, 26 scenes.

190
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,320
Are the actors ready?

191
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
26 shows, right?

192
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,800
Well

193
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,360
Okay, are you still taking the clothes?

194
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,960
What are you bringing?

195
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:53,880
to be dead

196
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,160
Thank you, Miss Star.

197
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Please drink.

198
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,520
Thank you

199
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,800
Okay, thank you, Miss Star.

200
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,480
Hello, director.

201
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,520
I'm so kind.

202
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,360
The agent of Star.

203
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,680
hello

204
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,720
Hello, hello.

205
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,120
This is Star's first day in the team.

206
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,600
Please take more trouble.

207
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,960
That's great.

208
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,120
Come on

209
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,120
Thank you, director.

210
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,480
Then we went to prepare

211
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,240
Thank you, director.

212
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
These are all

213
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,400
Who has been living in the world for years.

214
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,480
The cast and crew's talisman.

215
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,880
It's necessary to stay up late.

216
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
That's a lot.

217
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,560
sister

218
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,720
Why is there a warm baby?

219
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,160
Aren't you going to post it?

220
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,960
This must be posted.

221
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,000
During the shooting,

222
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,280
I didn't divide the winter and the summer.

223
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,920
You must wear short sleeves in the winter.

224
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,240
You can shoot the water scene.

225
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,760
when the moment comes

226
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,480
No one cares about your cold and fever.

227
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,760
We still need to shoot the progress.

228
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,520
Remember to eat the throat candy.

229
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,760
You can speak all day.

230
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,920
Take care of your voice.

231
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,720
That's great.

232
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,000
These safflower oil,

233
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,880
Band-Aid

234
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,120
Take care of him.

235
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,720
No one cares about you.

236
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,600
Got it, sister.

237
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,360
You told me so much at once.

238
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,840
Won't come here anymore?

239
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,520
I will come often.

240
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,480
But the company

241
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,600
You need me.

242
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,200
This time, I want you

243
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,480
Stay on the set alone.

244
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,800
To face something.

245
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,320
Well

246
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,560
The outsiders said that

247
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,200
The entertainment circle is very complicated.

248
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,960
that's right

249
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,240
The relationships

250
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,200
Is quite complicated.

251
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,720
Sida

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,400
Well

253
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,360
I really admire your simplicity.

254
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,960
But I can't always

255
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,200
To be with you.

256
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,920
You need to grow up and learn from yourself.

257
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,160
To face something.

258
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,680
Okay?

259
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,960
Don't worry, sister.

260
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,440
I will be there.

261
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,280
In this crew,

262
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,200
To learn how to shoot.

263
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,320
And learn how to grow up.

264
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,560
I believe in you.

265
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,560
What a coincidence.

266
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,720
If you are there,

267
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,400
Sida

268
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,200
So many things.

269
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,240
You're so thoughtful.

270
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,760
But don't worry.

271
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll give it to Zihao.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,200
Take good care of Star.

273
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,640
After all, it's the first time

274
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,720
To work as a team.

275
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,840
Zi Hao, what do you think?

276
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,760
Is also the male lead.

277
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Star is only a supporting role.

278
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,560
Our Si Da

279
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,080
I don't need your care.

280
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,120
You should manage Zihao well.

281
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,560
Like this,

282
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,640
The poker face.

283
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,040
You've been acting for years.

284
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm not afraid that the audience will get tired of it.

285
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,920
How could you say that?

286
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,320
Every drama of Zi Hao

287
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,640
Are all carefully selected by me.

288
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,400
Are big projects and big production.

289
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,600
Bossy president

290
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,480
Not everyone can act.

291
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,240
Big project, big production,

292
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,640
I think it's high pay and low quality.

293
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,640
I've told you many times.

294
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,280
Don't always look at the price.

295
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,760
You should think about it.

296
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,920
His future development

297
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,880
And positioning.

298
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,720
Why did you follow me for so many years?

299
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
I didn't even learn how to do that.

300
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,400
Sida

301
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
It's your first day.

302
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,360
How about I show you around?

303
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,320
I'll show you around.

304
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,240
Shen Qiansha.

305
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,640
Don't forget who you are.

306
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,640
Of course I know.

307
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,880
I'm all Star Wars.

308
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,280
Thousand yarn.

309
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,440
Thousand yarn.

310
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,280
Go back to the car.

311
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,200
No way

312
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,560
I'm staying with Star.

313
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,160
Right?

314
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,960
I really feel sorry for you.

315
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,480
Can't be managed.

316
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,240
Songzihao

317
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,400
With a time bomb, Shen Qiansha.

318
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,640
Thank you for your hard work.

319
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,160
Come on, Star.

320
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,320
Put it away.

321
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,840
What about us?

322
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,880
Go back and recite the script.

323
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,160
To discuss how to act.

324
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,520
good

325
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,760
Don't laugh here.

326
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,560
It's embarrassing.

327
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,720
Bye

328
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,560
Bye

329
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,760
Come to see Star.

330
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,600
You're welcome. Wait for me.

331
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,440
Qian Sha,

332
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,760
come back

333
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,240
You don't have to come back tomorrow.

334
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,360
To work as a copywriter.

335
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,440
No way

336
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,520
What's going on, you two?

337
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,600
Do you know?

338
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,480
She will stay on the crew.

339
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,600
Will cause you trouble.

340
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,280
I have the final say on whether she stays or goes.

341
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,840
I want her to stay with me.

342
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,960
She's my girl.

343
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,600
Come here.

344
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,280
Let go of me.

345
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,440
You're strangling me.

346
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,760
They are against me.

347
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,200
Let go of me.

348
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,760
I'm looking for Star. I want to...

349
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,360
Let go of me.

350
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,480
What are you doing?

351
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,240
That's it? Are you going to see Star?

352
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,480
Yes, what's wrong?

353
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,600
Star doesn't like you.

354
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,400
Why do you still have to...

355
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Around him.

356
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:56,920
You are

357
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,480
Do you have any self-esteem?

358
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,560
I did it for Sida.

359
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,960
I don't care about my self-esteem.

360
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,280
I came to the crew

361
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,800
In order to see him every day,

362
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,240
I want to follow him.

363
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,240
What's up

364
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,160
What do you care?

365
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,240
Do you believe that?

366
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,400
Just one word from me.

367
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,560
You have to leave the crew immediately.

368
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,920
I'll never see Sida again.

369
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,240
you

370
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,599
I can fire you at any time.

371
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,599
But I have to leave you here.

372
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,119
Guess why.

373
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,119
Of course I know.

374
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,200
Because I'm cute.

375
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
Shen Qiansha.

376
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,280
I want you to see clearly.

377
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Who is your real leading man?

378
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,680
Are you sick?

379
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,520
According to the latest market feedback,

380
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,200
The Ruiqi Group has been working hard

381
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,000
To expand their high-end business.

382
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,200
Some of our business clients

383
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,080
And started to buy.

384
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,200
Their dresses

385
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,800
If we

386
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
He stole a client from Rui Qi.

387
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,520
It's hard for us to

388
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,200
The rest of the promotion

389
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,280
20% performance.

390
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,000
I suggest we

391
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,360
To release the new season in advance.

392
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,920
Dress Collection

393
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,200
To keep our clients safe.

394
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,760
This way,

395
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,000
To stimulate the growth of sales.

396
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,960
It's unnecessary.

397
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,040
I think the dresses of last season

398
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,160
Can be released as usual.

399
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,680
Our regular client is still

400
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,920
You agree with our idea.

401
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,720
As long as we keep high quality,

402
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,040
A high quality dress.

403
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,640
They won't give up the purchase.

404
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,040
Maybe we can cut costs.

405
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,720
To increase profits?

406
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,920
I won't do it for profit.

407
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,440
And sacrifice the quality of the clothes.

408
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,040
This is just a vicious circle.

409
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,680
What we need to do now

410
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,360
How to attract new customers.

411
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,280
Why don't you ask the design department to come up with

412
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,800
Different styles of dress

413
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:37,920
Yes

414
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,400
Our designer

415
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,640
If you stay in the company for a long time,

416
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,280
It's hard to avoid

417
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,160
Thinking pattern.

418
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,280
The design of the project.

419
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,400
Has certain limitations.

420
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,920
It's been a long time.

421
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,160
It will cause the outside world

422
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,840
To create a stereotype of us.

423
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,000
To the new client.

424
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,040
Development and expansion

425
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,200
That's not the case.

426
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,720
Fire them all.

427
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,160
yes

428
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,600
Who said you're going to be expelled?

429
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,600
We only need to inject

430
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,800
Fresh blood.

431
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,400
We're here.

432
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,840
The original healing idea

433
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,440
Innovation in design

434
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,200
I want to hire a new designer.

435
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,480
President Ji.

436
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,040
this

437
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,520
These ones here

438
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,200
The designer's information is

439
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,480
I don't need them.

440
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,200
Throw it away.

441
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,960
Then...

442
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,520
I have a few more here.

443
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,720
The designer's information.

444
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,440
Would you like to have a look?

445
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,200
Give me a reason.

446
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,640
Because they have been working for years.

447
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,840
And he's very experienced.

448
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,120
And experienced.

449
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,880
Is their advantage.

450
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,360
Is also their weakness.

451
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,600
The current designers

452
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
Are influenced by the famous brands.

453
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Continue walking in the old steps and seclude oneself

454
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,640
And lack of originality.

455
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,040
I want to be young and thoughtful.

456
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,800
A designer who is popular.

457
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,280
There really is one.

458
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,760
this

459
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,680
Young and minority.

460
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,520
President Ji.

461
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,920
Take a look.

462
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,160
Thermansa

463
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,040
Why haven't you heard it before?

464
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
Cermanza is

465
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,200
Living in Spain.

466
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
A Chinese designer.

467
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,840
Is a rising rookie.

468
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,000
Her design style is bold and sharp.

469
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,560
The colors are also unique.

470
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,320
She has her own design brand.

471
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,360
This brand

472
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,160
Represents the Phoenix Nirvana.

473
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,440
It means rebirth.

474
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,760
I guess her life must be

475
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,360
Suffered a devastating blow.

476
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,640
I want to rebuild my life through design.

477
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,040
Isn't that the same way

478
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,120
This idea is very similar.

479
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,240
Help me contact her.

480
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,120
It's possible that

481
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,160
Is the person we are looking for.

482
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,960
Well

483
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:54,680
Thank you

484
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,200
Enjoy it.

485
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,760
Hello, Sermantha.

486
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,360
I've seen your work.

487
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,440
I want to know what you think

488
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,960
About the design of our group.

489
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,400
Thank you for following my work.

490
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,320
Since its founding,

491
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,000
The cure

492
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,240
As the core idea,

493
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,960
The dress design also focuses on quality.

494
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,600
But these dresses

495
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,880
Is too gentle.

496
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,960
Oh

497
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,040
I would like to know the details

498
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,400
Your dresses

499
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,560
Is very suitable to a woman's mind.

500
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,480
But women can only have

501
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,360
A gentle character?

502
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,280
Modern urban women

503
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,160
Not only independent,

504
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,240
And has a strong personality.

505
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,200
I like to use my design

506
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,560
To make them more aggressive.

507
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,200
More modern.

508
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Women's confidence

509
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,120
And charming.

510
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,720
Your answer is very original.

511
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,560
I agree.

512
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,800
We need to

513
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,120
A designer like you

514
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,200
I'm hungry.

515
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,600
let it be

516
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,440
Order whatever you want.

517
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,520
You're back.

518
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,200
Let's have dinner together.

519
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,880
No need.

520
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,920
I'm not hungry.

521
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,600
It's all done. Eat.

522
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,440
Have some hot soup first.

523
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,840
Eating meat directly is not easy to digest.

524
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,960
It tastes good.

525
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,040
If it tastes good,

526
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,520
I can make it for you every day.

527
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,600
I know you worked hard.

528
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,440
But I can't

529
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,320
Slow down your stomach.

530
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,560
He's adrift.

531
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,240
I want to go home every day.

532
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,600
To have a full meal.

533
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,080
So that I can feel at home.

534
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,600
I hope this meal

535
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,920
And every meal in the future.

536
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,520
Can make you feel

537
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,040
This is a warm harbor.

538
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,000
Have a drink first.

539
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,200
Wine steak.

540
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,840
With this pretty face,

541
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,800
You're so pretty.

542
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,680
No way

543
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,200
Don't let your guard down.

544
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,400
Dugu is like a man.

545
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,240
You have to...

546
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,480
Stay awake at all times.

547
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,840
Don't be fooled by him.

548
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,160
Who wants to drink with you?

549
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,200
When will you move out?

550
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,920
Move it.

551
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,560
Now you can wash it.

552
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,680
A comfortable hot bath.

553
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,840
No, no.

554
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,920
I want to stay awake.

555
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,240
Can't be fooled by him.

556
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,080
Have a cup of hot milk.

557
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,280
To have a good sleep.

558
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,760
What about

559
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,800
My roommate is not bad, right?

560
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,640
Can cook, clean and take care of the family.

561
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,480
And hot milk to drink.

562
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,800
You can use the bath water.

563
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,480
You can enjoy it for free.

564
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,960
Super one-stop service.

565
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,080
To know more about it.

566
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,840
Why don't you think about it?

567
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,520
Don't ask me to move out.

568
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,640
Alright

569
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,840
Really

570
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,920
Actually, there's a man at home.

571
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,040
Is quite good.

572
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,560
That's right.

573
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,760
As a free nanny.

574
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,800
That's right.

575
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,680
But the rent still has to be paid.

576
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,160
Give it to me.

577
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,120
Dugu is like a man.

578
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,760
You really have no backbone.

579
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,800
You slept so well.

580
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,520
It's been a long time.

581
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,680
You slept so well.

582
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,920
Is it because

583
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,760
The neat freak moved back.

584
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,640
It's so clean.

585
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,560
Are you leaving again?

586
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,440
Without telling me.

587
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,320
Let's go. It's perfect.

588
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,560
Pure and clean.

589
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,200
Good morning.

590
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,320
Breakfast is ready.

591
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,400
In the fridge.

592
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,240
Are you done washing?

593
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,360
Heat it in the microwave.

594
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,160
You can eat it.

595
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,000
what

596
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,080
You're not coming?

597
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,880
Then I'm not going to attend.

598
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,560
I hate this kind of reunion.

599
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,080
A big manager?

600
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,040
Come in.

601
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,680
Your bracelet is so beautiful.

602
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,720
If the man comes,

603
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,680
Why are you so late, Ruonan?

604
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,160
It's too late.

605
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Are you going to give yourself a cup?

606
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,520
That's right.

607
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:01,960
Hurry up.

608
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,360
Come on.

609
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,680
Here, toast to Ruo Man.

610
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,600
Come on.

611
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,440
If you are a man, you must drink it.

612
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,080
Come on.

613
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,040
It's been a long time.

614
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,160
Long time no see

615
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,080
Cheers!

616
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:16,960
If a man

617
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,760
Have a seat.

618
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,240
Sit down.

619
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,440
What are you doing recently?

620
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,880
Who are you bringing?

621
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,960
How many tickets can I get?

622
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,840
Signature photo.

623
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,600
If you let me go,

624
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,480
Take a photo.

625
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,760
That's even better.

626
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
There's no problem.

627
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,120
I'll arrange the time.

628
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,040
If the man is getting more and more beautiful,

629
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,360
Yes, he's so graceful.

630
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,520
Well

631
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
I'm still working.

632
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,280
I'm afraid it will be late.

633
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,160
Contact me when you're done.

634
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,920
Is your boyfriend looking for help?

635
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,480
I'll pick you up.

636
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,600
Call him here.

637
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
To your family.

638
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,480
Are you...

639
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,480
That's right.

640
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,480
That's right.

641
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,400
No

642
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,640
Garbage push.

643
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,880
Without a boyfriend,

644
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,320
At your age,

645
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,520
I don't have a boyfriend yet.

646
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,040
Listen to my advice.

647
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,720
A woman?

648
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,280
It's useless to earn so much money.

649
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,360
In the end,

650
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,920
To find a good home.

651
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,680
Right?

652
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,120
Yes

653
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,640
That's right.

654
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,920
Hurry up.

655
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,240
Otherwise, after the golden age,

656
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,440
It's hard to give birth.

657
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,720
It's hard to recover.

658
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,760
It's too late to give birth.

659
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,360
That's right.

660
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,240
By then,

661
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,120
You become

662
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,320
A fat old lady.

663
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,120
I won't even look at you.

664
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,400
Sorry

665
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,840
It's a company emergency.

666
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,800
Excuse me.

667
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,920
You eat first.

668
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,880
Go back to work.

669
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,880
Where are you?

670
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,200
Why are you so red?

671
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,840
It's none of your business.

672
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,920
Why are you looking for me?

673
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,520
Are you drinking again?

674
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
You should take care of it.

675
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,920
When a woman drinks wine, she falls ill.

676
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,640
If a man has been

677
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,720
And has a strange temper.

678
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,280
Men dare not approach her.

679
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,400
Even if a man is not afraid of death,

680
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
Go after her.

681
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,160
In the end,

682
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,560
She will scare me off.

683
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,440
Every year,

684
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,280
The reunion party.

685
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,760
She came alone.

686
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,560
You're trying to figure out a way.

687
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,920
If you don't come, you won't.

688
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,880
Does she think

689
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,000
It's embarrassing.

690
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,200
She pays every year.

691

Are all big.

692
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,280
You just want to show off.

693
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,360
Your own success?

694
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,760
In the entertainment industry.

695
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,400
It's great to make so much money.

696
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,440
What's the use?

697
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,600
You're so old.

698
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,160
And has such a strong character.

699
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,880
Who would be blind to see her?

700
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,560
To put it more nicely,

701
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,960
It's called a strong woman.

702
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,080
To put it bluntly,

703
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,520
Isn't that

704
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,720
Nobody wants her.

705
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,400
That's right.

706
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,920
What are you talking about?

707
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,720
If a woman is like her,

708
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,040
And failed.

709
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,120
It was a failure.

710
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,160

00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,240
Okay, hold on.

716
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,120
The most expensive.

717
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,200

I appreciate it.

Old schoolmates,

00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,840
In my life,

723
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,240
There's still time.

724
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,080
To worry about my marriage.

725
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,480
Whether in person,

726
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,960
Or behind his back.

727
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,800
I'll accept it.

728
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,440
But I'm telling you,

729
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,200
Everyone?

00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,880
Has everyone's pursuit.

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,080
Some people's dreams

732
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,720
To be a housewife.

733
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,400

Some people

And likes to be single.

737
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,080
Single life is very happy.

738
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,480
You won't die if you don't marry.

739
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,440
So,

740
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,360
I don't need you.

741
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,840
You can use your experience

742
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,640
To evaluate my life.

743
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,080
This glass of wine

744
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,920
Here's to us for decades.

745
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,080
Schoolmate affection

746
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,680
The wine is at the bottom.

747
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,840
The feelings will fade.

748
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,320
What are you talking about?

749
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,920
Who is this?

750
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,560
I don't know.

751
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,760
You're acting tough again.

752
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,920
What a man should do.

753
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,800
Let a man do it.

754
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,400
Sorry, everyone.

755
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,720
I forgot to introduce myself.

756
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,720
I'm Ruo's boyfriend.

757
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,880
My work is a little busy.

758
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
You're late, boyfriend.

759

Just enjoy it.

The benefits you deserve.

00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,640
If a man

764
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,160
You have such a handsome boyfriend.

765
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,480
You didn't tell us in advance.

766
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,440
That's right.

767
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,040
How should I address you?

768
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,160
My name is Zimmer.

769
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,080
Call me Xiaoji.

770
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,200
Xiaoji

771
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,400
Ji, where are you working?

772
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
How much is the monthly salary? Is there a house?

773
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,440
Don't blame me.

774
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,680
Our classmates

775
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,600
I just want to help Ruo Man.

776
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,960
I'm working in Wing Fashion.

777
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,200
The salary is not high.

778
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,840
And has no house.

779
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,000
Wing fashion.

780
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,440
It's a good place.

781
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,280
Are you...

782
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,360
Which department?

783
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
President's office.

784
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,679
As an assistant.

785
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,120
To be the president.

786
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,239
Sorry, everyone.

787
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,040
I didn't mean to

788
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,480
I heard the conversation.

789
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,040
Everyone cares about Ruo's marriage.

790
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,719
I'm also worried.

791
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,639
I've been proposing to Ruonan.

792
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,040
But she hasn't promised me.

793
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,520
But I really respect her.

794
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,480
She needs her own

795
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,600
Development space

796
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,639
You want help?

797
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,080
More people realize their dreams.

798
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
if

799
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,320
She's tired.

800
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,800
Or you think you can enter

801
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,280
At the next stage,

802
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,679
I will marry her.

803
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,560
I'll send you an invitation then.

804
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,280
And today's order.

805
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,120
I've bought them all.

806
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,120
Let's get together.

807
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,600
Ruonan and I are leaving.

808
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,280
Everyone knows she's busy.

809
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,560
It's hard for us to be together.

810
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,120
Bye

811
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,960
Bye, bye.

812
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,000
Eat well and drink well.

813
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,080
Bye

814
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,040
Bye.

815

Who is it? He's quite handsome.

816
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,000
So handsome.

817
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,800
So gossipy.

818
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,640
I'm also worried.

819
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,640
I've been proposing to Ruonan.

820
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,120
But she hasn't promised me.

821
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,560
But I really respect her.

822
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,840
She needs her own

823
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,920
Development space

824
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,880
You want help?

825
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,280
More people realize their dreams.

826
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,320
if

827
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,560
She's tired.

828
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,240
Or you think you can enter

829
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,520
At the next stage,

830
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,000
I will marry her.

831
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,240
Dugu is like a man.

832
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,360
Dugu is like a man.

833
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,160
Can't be easily shaken.

834
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,240
Mr. Zhao.

835
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,760
It's so early.

836
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,640
what?

837
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,680
Good morning.

838
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,280
Your condition is good.

839
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,160
It seems that last night,

840
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,120
You slept well.

841
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,480
I'm going to the crew now.

842
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,200
Look at Star.

843
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,880
So maybe today,

844
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,320
I can't chat with you anymore.

845
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,320
But I'm here today.

846
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,520
I'm not here to chat with you.

847
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,000
To talk to you about work.

848
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
I'm going to Nanjing.

849
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,560
With some brands.

850
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,400
Meeting the sponsors.

851
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,200
I have no idea

852
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,360
Are you interested in

853
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,240
Nankin

854
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,960
Yes

855
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,600
Wouldn't that be

856
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,320
We are going out alone.

857
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,360
It's not necessary.

858
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,240
I think

859
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,760
Is necessary.

860
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,600
Think about it.

861
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,880
Star is shooting now.

862
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,360
When the shooting is over,

863
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,760
You need some exposure.

864
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,920
To assist the publicity.

865
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,080
These brands

866
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,560
Are all fashion brands.

867
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,840
Don't say no.

868
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,480
You can look at these brands.

869
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,960
If you agree, come with me.

870
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It's okay to disagree.

871
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,880
Forget it.

872
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,840
This list

873
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,480
Is really attractive.

874
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,040
So if you're interested,

875
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,280
Go to Nanjing and talk to them.

876
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,320
Today?

877
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,960
today

878
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,280
It's so sudden.

879
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,160
I do things.

880
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,320
I don't like to drag my feet.

881
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,360
Don't worry.

882
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,520
Just work.

883
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,920
Of course

884
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,680
Alright then.

885
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,160
It's turned off.

886
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,120
Maybe the phone is out of battery.

887
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,400
You gave their company

888
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,200
Try calling.

889
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Hello, hello.

890
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,800
I'm looking for Dugu Ruuo Man.

891
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,400
what

892
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,080
She and Zhao Yucheng

893
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,360
On a business trip to Nanjing.

894
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,440
It's over.

895
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
President Ji.

896
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,960
I will never go there.

897
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,320
Then don't go.

898
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,400
Why are you there?

899
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,280
Right?

900
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,400
Can I rest assured if I don't go?

901
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,000
Don't worry.

902
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,760
You won't feel safe if you don't go.

903
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,120
How can you rest assured?

904
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,080
is or isn't

905
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,960
Then...

906
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,000
I have to go.

907
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,360
go

908
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,600
It's a relief to go there.

909
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,600
go

910
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,240
But I went there.

911
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,320
And I'm too stingy.

912
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,760
That's right.

913
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,000
It's not good to go.

914
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,800
A little petty.

915
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,120
Aron, let me ask you something.

916
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,680
A long time ago,

917
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,840
There's a lonely man.

918
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,280
And a widower.

919
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,520
What about this lonely man?

920
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,320
A long time ago,

921
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,800
To marry this daughter.

922
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,960
They almost fell in love.

923
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,720
Well

924
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,280
Then I want to ask you.

925
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,400
They are lonely.

926
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,920
For a business trip.

927
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,000
This is the chance

928
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,680
How big will it be?

929
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,560
actually

930
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,640
Are you alright?

931
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,040
It's good, right?

932
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,280
Ninepercent

933
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,440
It's 19.

934
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,200
nine

935
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,960
It's actually fine.

936
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Namely

937
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,400
And zero 1. Right.

938
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,040
No, no.

939
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,000
Book the nearest high-speed train for me.

940
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,920
good

941
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,400
President Ji.

942
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,880
There are no tickets available at this time.

943
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,400
Even without a ticket.

944
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,280
Xiao Chen.

945
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,080
Hurry up.

946
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,800
The clothes are ready.

947
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,560
Hello, everyone.

948
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,720
I'm an actress, Star.

949
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,080
It's my first day here.

950
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,880
Please take care of me.

951
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,520
These are my clothes, right?

952
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,280
The four rows of clothes

953
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,040
Is the leading role of Song Zihao.

954
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
Are you a male?

955
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,560
Your clothes are over there.

956
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,160
Listen up, everyone.

957
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,880
after

958
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,040
The Suihua of Star.

959
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,320
You don't have to be in the team.

960
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,080
I invited the most professional

961
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Stylists and makeup artists

962
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,840
All our clothes

963
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,800
And accessories.

964
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,040
From Europe.

965
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,080
you

966
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,720
Don't misappropriate it.

967
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,520
Isn't she Song Zihao's assistant?

968
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,840
Why are you so nice to Star?

969
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,680
This Sida is a newbie.

970
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,840
I didn't expect that

971
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,120
You're doing something.

972
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,440
Sida

973
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,840
Qian Sha, you're acting like this.

974
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,400
I'll wear the clothes of the team.

975
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,280
Take it back.

976
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,800
Sida

977
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,080
I've studied the script.

978
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,720
You played a rich second generation.

979
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
These two clothes.

980
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,080
How can you convince the audience?

981
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,880
Right?

982
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,240
But you're like this.

983
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,520
It will make people think

984
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,680
I'm doing something special.

985
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,560
Hurry up.

986
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,640
No way

987
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,440
Sida

988
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,520
Let me ask you something.

989
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,240
Well

990
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,360
Do you want to show

991
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,280
The best drama.

992
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,320
Of course.

993
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,040
Wearing these famous brands,

994
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,080
You will be more close to the people.

995
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,400
No, no. Or something special.

996
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,320
Listen to me.

997
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,560
If you don't wear well,

998
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,840
The audience will act.

999
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
The audience is acting.

1000
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,880
I'll be very interested in

1001
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,640
I suspect that

1002
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,520
Doubt your role.

1003
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,400
You wouldn't have

1004
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,320
Everyone's approval.

1005
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,280
You won't be recognized by everyone.

1006
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,080
If Dugu is a man, he will be disappointed.

1007
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,240
Do you want her to be disappointed?

1008
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,040
I hope

1009
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,960
So,

1010
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,120
For my dream,

1011
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,280
For art,

1012
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,080
For the sake of Dugu,

1013
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,800
Are you...

1014
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,840
You should accept my help.

1015
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,960
Put on these clothes.

1016
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,320
For Dugu,

1017
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,680
I think you're right.

1018
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,520
Take Star to change.

1019
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,640
Okay, everyone, let's go.

1020
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,920
Hurry up.

1021
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,680
For the sake of Dugu,

1022
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,320
Hurry up.

1023
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,640
Why am I so smart?
