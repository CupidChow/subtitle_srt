1
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,080
President Ji.

2
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,480
Are you trying to

3
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,200
The brand spokesman this year.

4
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,039
None of these are good.

5
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,880
That's a lot.

6
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,240
You haven't picked one.

7
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,800
What I want is

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,560
Flexible and changeable.

9
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,640
Malleable.

10
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,040
You have confidence in yourself.

11
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,280
To meet the brand requirements.

12
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,960
Ask them to find someone else.

13
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,680
Not President Ji.

14
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,600
Are you asking

15
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,000
Is too high.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
These are all

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Carefully selected.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,480
Are international famous models.

19
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,240
I want more than fame.

20
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,080
It's advanced.

21
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,600
And experience.

22
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,680
Do you understand

23
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,440
I know.

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,240
You don't understand. Neither do you.

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,640
I don't, but I get it.

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,760
I really understand.

27
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,880
I know. Let me show you.

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,080
What do you know?

29
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,000
Look at this.

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,720
Her name is Chen Fei'er.

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,320
She's a new model.

32
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,480
The momentum is strong.

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,600
Is very popular on the Internet.

34
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,800
A lot of fashion bloggers.

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,000
Are studying her.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,080
Every time she takes a street photo,

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,880
The clothes you're wearing.

38
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,360
Will become popular.

39
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,000
Is her scandal.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,720
And gossips.

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,560
She will be the face of the next season.

42
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,400
I'll do it now.

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,800
Look what you did.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,720
This is an advertising agency.

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,680
A letter from a lawyer.

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,360
They want to cancel the contract.

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,160
And proposed

48
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,520
A huge penalty.

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,440
I'll explain to the advertisers.

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,400
Tong Tong didn't tell you?

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,360
The advertisers don't want to contact you.

52
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,720
They asked for a replacement.

53
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,320
The public opinion outside

54
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,440
Are accusing the company of covering for you.

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,920
Such a negative news.

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,960
To the image of the company.

57
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,480
Caused a lot of damage.

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
therefore

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,360
Stop working.

60
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,120
Boss

61
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
You know that

62
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,360
About Zihao's car accident.

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,600
I know.

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,200
Over the years,

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,960
You're the best

66
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,000
Did create a lot of achievements.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,200
But this matter

68
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,000
And made the company suffer

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,080
A huge loss.

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,320
Merit equals merit.

71
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,640
If a man

72
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,560
How cruel this industry is.

73
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,120
I think you know better than me.

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,080
therefore

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,080
I can't keep you anymore.

76
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,880
Boss

77
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,760
How many employees

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,560
The lead artist.

79
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,280
I brought them out.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,400
No one knows them better than I do.

81
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,920
And the future development plan.

82
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
If I leave now,

83
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,200
It's hard to find another one.

84
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,120
To replace me.

85
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,640
that's right

86
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,399
You're

87
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,800
A very good agent.

88
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,040
But a few years ago,

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,360
If I didn't give you a chance,

90
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,200
You can't be that.

91
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,600
The current gold agent

92
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Everyone is from the new ones.

93
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,000
Experience can be accumulated and trained.

94
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,280
I have found it.

95
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,000
To replace you.

96
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,120
who

97
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,320
Tong Tong has been with you for three years.

98
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,520
The people you brought

99
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,600
Don't worry.

100
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Male sister.

101
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,560
Please wait a second.

102
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,720
Listen to my explanation. I...

103
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,560
You know that

104
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
The advertisers want to replace me.

105
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

106
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,440
I didn't dare to tell you.

107
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,000
I was afraid that you would be angry.

108
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
You dare not tell me.

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,200
Or you don't want to tell me?

110
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,360
About Zihao's car accident.

111
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,680
Did you release it?

112
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,560
The time of the photos in the magazine.

113
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,840
After Zihao's surgery,

114
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,680
On the first day,

115
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,520
At that time, the media didn't know

116
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,480
The car accident.

117
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,160
You and I are the only ones in the hospital.

118
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,360
Who else is there?

119
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,160
Zi Hao is the artist I brought.

120
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Something went wrong today.

121
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,200
The company will attack me first.

122
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,480
Then you can

123
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,760
You're stepping on me.

124
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,560
Tong Tong.

125
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,160
I've been giving you chances.

126
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,960
I was the one who brought you into the industry.

127
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,120
Over the years,

128
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,600
Whether in work or life,

129
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,120
I have helped you a lot.

130
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,920
I trusted you so much.

131
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,520
Why did you try to hurt me?

132
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,200
Why are you threatening me?

133
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,400
You have been working for three years.

134
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,840
The assistant who can't turn right.

135
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,120
Even this kind of thing can be done.

136
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,960
Am I here for free?

137
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,240
Please don't explain to me.

138
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,480
I'm not qualified yet.

139
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,320
If you really believe me,

140
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,160
You will let me be you.

141
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,360
For so many years?

142
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,560
She follows your ass every day.

143
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,520
Like a pug.

144
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,440
To please you?

145
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,680
That's because of your experience.

146
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,840
And ability.

147
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,240
You still need to train.

148
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
Do you think what you said

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,440
I will be grateful to you.

150
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,760
Feel guilty about you?

151
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
You always

152
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,200
A superior posture.

153
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,960
The charity

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,640
Give me the so-called chance.

155
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,840
I have to be grateful.

156
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,960
To accept it?

157
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,680
The people who have stayed with you all these years,

158
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,400
Which one is the last?

159
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,760
To leave you.

160
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,520
Songzihao

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
And Lin Huan.

163
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,080
Dugu is like a man.

164
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,000
Ask her.

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
The rest of the company

166
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,720
Who would want you to stay?

167
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,320
If a man

168
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,240
How cruel this industry is.

169
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,880
You know better than me.

170
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,080
In this world,

171
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,720
No one can't be replaced.

172
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,840
I have found it.

173
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,640
To replace you.

174
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,840
You always

175
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,880
A superior posture.

176
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,560
The charity

177
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,960
Give me the so-called chance.

178
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,040
I have to be grateful.

179
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,160
To accept it?

180
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,000
The people who have stayed with you all these years,

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,720
Which one is the last?

182
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,080
To leave you.

183
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,760
Ask her.

184
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,800
The rest of the company

185
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,040
Who would want you to stay?

186
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,480
Do you know why?

187
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,400
Are all the people avoiding you?

188
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,840
That's because of you.

189
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,080
You're too arrogant.

190
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,600
You don't care about others' feelings.

191
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,160
In your eyes, only work

192
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,040
Only gains and losses,

193
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,360
So you are doomed to be unloved.

194
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,840
That's why Lin Huan left you.

195
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,480
Miss, are you all right?

196
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,200
Nothing

197
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,880
Boss

198
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,040
Your spicy hot pot

199
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,720
It's too spicy.

200
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,480
It's so hot that my tear ducts have exploded.

201
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,360
How about I give you

202
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
And a soup pot.

203
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,400
No, no.

204
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
And spicy pot.

205
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,360
Is to be spicy.

206
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,320
That's it.

207
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,360
Give me another bottle of wine.

208
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,000
The spicy pot and wine

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,200
It's easy to hurt your stomach.

210
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,400
How about you?

211
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,679
It's not hurt.

212
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,919
I can bear any injury.

213
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,160
Okay, wait a moment.

214
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,800
Well

215
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,640
President Ji.

216
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,400
This is the design of a plus-size dress.

217
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,720
This time,

218
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,960
High saturation of bright colors

219
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,320
To match each other.

220
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,680
Mainly to reflect

221
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,760
The delicate curve sense.

222
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,720
Besides, we're

223
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,040
And avoid the details.

224
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,000
I want to

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
To highlight the rich and feminine taste.

226
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,280
Your definition of beauty is still thin.

227
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,680
Through the fabric and cutting,

228
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,920
To make the clothes more thin.

229
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,920
What's my purpose?

230
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,360
Let them wear them.

231
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
The clothes I designed

232
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,160
Will be happier.

233
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,440
You will love yourself more.

234
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,800
Instead of pleasing others.

235
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,560
Before the design,

236
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,640
To understand it deeply,

237
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,840
The people you serve

238
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,800
In modern society,

239
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
What's the cause of obesity?

240
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,280
Is too stressful.

241
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,120
Which leads to high insulin concentration.

242
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,080
Failure of hormone regulation

243
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,120
Will break their metabolic balance.

244
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,760
Which leads to physiology.

245
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,000
And psychological burden.

246
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,320
So what we have to solve

247
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
Not only the visual waist,

248
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,240
But to solve it.

249
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,600
Their psychological rubbish

250
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,520
And fixed thinking.

251
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
Let them wear clothes.

252
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,520
To smile more confident.

253
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,480
And smile more recklessly.

254
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,040
Show yourself more confident.

255
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,480
Fat people.

256
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,040
Because

257
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,520
The influence of public aesthetic.

258
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,120
Care about the eyes of others.

259
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,880
I can't be sincere.

260
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,840
We have to do that.

261
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,000
Put yourself in their shoes.

262
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,680
So I can make

263
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,920
To their satisfaction.

264
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
neighbor

265
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,280
Are you off work?

266
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,480
How much did you drink?

267
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,200
Not much.

268
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,480
Just a drink.

269
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,800
How many bottles?

270
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,200
Are you a woman?

271
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,560
A drunkard.

272
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,800
You want to vomit too?

273
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,640
I knew that when I met you,

274
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,680
It must be good.

275
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,720
neighbor

276
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,760
Don't always look at me.

277
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,200
Your face stinks.

278
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,760
What are you doing?

279
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,920
Why are you so hard to get along with?

280
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
I know you're doing this

281
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,800
About Song Zihao,

282
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,960
Are you angry?

283
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,800
sorry

285
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,760
Please forgive me.

286
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,280
Don't sleep here. Wake up.

287
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,440
I didn't sleep here.

288
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,920
But you're really talkative.

289
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,520
You said I would.

290
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,680
And fell into a trap.

291
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,320
I'll really fall down.

292
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,440
Planted in the valley.

293
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,960
Are you all right?

294
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,720
Nothing.

295
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
It's okay.

296
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,320
You can go home.

297
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,400
can

298
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Soft legs.

299
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,920
You can go home with soft legs.

300
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,080
Does it hurt?

301
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,560
It hurts.

302
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,320
Where does it hurt?

303
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,360
Do you need to go to the hospital?

304
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
You don't have to go to the hospital.

305
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
It hurts so much.

306
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,640
It hurts.

307
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,560
Right here.

308
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
here

309
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,480
Here.

310
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,320
My heart hurts so much here.

311
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
My heart will ache.

312
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,240
Why is it that

313
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,920
Hate me so much.

314
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,360
Do you?

315
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,640
Are all my actions bad?

316
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,960
I have troubles too.

317
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,160
It's too hard for me

318
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,280
I'm really hard now.

319
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,920
I'll take you home.

320
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,800
come

321
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,600
I want to hold back my tears.

322
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,320
I really admire you.

323
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
It's fun.

324
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,840
Not in my previous life.

325
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Do I owe you?

326
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,440
You're here to collect debts.

327
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Don't go.

328
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
I'm just so strong.

329
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,880
But in my heart,

330
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,840
I really want you to stay.

331
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,680
My head.

332
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,320
In my life,

333
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
Don't drink anymore.

334
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,160
I really...

335
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,440
In my life,

336
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,880
I don't want to drink anymore.

337
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,400
I have a headache.

338
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,040
You want to die?

339
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,360
Why is he in my house?

340
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,600
I was drunk yesterday.

341
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,040
What happened with him?

342
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,680
Don't leave.

343
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,920
Okay, I'm not leaving.

344
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,200
Come here.

345
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,040
What are you doing?

346
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,840
How can I face him?

347
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,920
You're awake?

348
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,320
Good morning.

349
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,840
Why are you at my house?

350
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,080
You've been torturing me all night.

351
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,240
You turned your back on me, right?

352
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,320
Don't admit it, right?

353
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,840
What did I do last night?

354
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,760
You have to ask yourself.

355
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,640
I've never seen it before.

356
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,960
You're so enthusiastic.

357
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,720
It's burning.

358
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm

359
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
When you're drunk,

360
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,080
Occasionally,

361
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
sometimes

362
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,200
Not often.

363
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,120
There will be some

364
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,600
Bad habit.

365
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,280
Bad habit.

366
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,760
Is very bad.

367
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,920
When I was drunk,

368
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,320
A lot of times,

369
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,560
That kind of behavior without consciousness.

370
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,760
But when I was sober,

371
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,359
Is actually a rational person.

372
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,599
I can't let you

373
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,720
It's a waste of time.

374
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,160
You have to be responsible for me.

375
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,480
I didn't.

376
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,800
How about you?

377
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,520
Right?

378
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,280
How about this?

379
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,040
What happened yesterday

380
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,720
Forget about it.

381
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,840
Go. Let it go.

382
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,080
The past can only be recalled.

383
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,960
No, don't think about it.

384
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
There's nothing to remember.

385
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,640
Alright.

386
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,880
But you have to promise me one condition.

387
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,600
What's the condition?

388
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,280
Sell me the house downstairs.

389
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,520
Dare you want to lie to me, right?

390
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,680
No way.

391
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,640
No way.

392
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Then sleep with me again.

393
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,520
Don't.

394
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,520
Don't be like this. I was wrong.

395
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,760
I was wrong. I'm kidding.

396
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,080
Be mature.

397
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,560
I will extend the lease for you.

398
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,600
Don't you want this house?

399
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,040
I will extend the lease for you.

400
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,080
In the short term,

401
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,360
I won't drive you away.

402
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,320
If one day,

403
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,600
I want to buy a new house.

404
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,320
To sell the house,

405
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,080
You're my first consideration.

406
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,360
To be responsible for what you said.

407
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,400
I'm like the kind of person

408
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,840
Irresponsible?

409
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,120
I'll send it to four.

410
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,280
How many times?

411
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,920
four

412
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,280
I swear,

413
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,120
I'll get back to work.

414
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,560
Drink the milk on the table.

415
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,200
Correct!

416
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,120
Although you sometimes lie and act,

417
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,680
Is quite annoying.

418
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,160
But it's good.

419
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,080
At least you're brave.

420
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,120
Didn't you say that

421
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,600
Are you an artist's designer?

422
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,680
Do you know the artist's designer?

423
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,560
And designers

424
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,880
The most important thing?

425
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,320
self

426
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
If you want to please the public,

427
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,880
And change yourself.

428
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,320
Then I'm not the one

429
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,160
Good designer.

430
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,800
if

431
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,160
To make so many people understand you.

432
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,080
Wouldn't that be too ordinary?

433
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,640
You are who you are.

434
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,480
Remember,

435
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,080
You are who you are.

436
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
The things you lost

437
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,760
Bring it back.

438
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,800
If you're a male sister,

439
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,160
If you're young,

440
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,800
early

441
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
I asked you to be suspended.

442
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,800
Why are you here?

443
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,040
This is the first time

444
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,680
To take the blame for the company.

445
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,320
All the evidence is inside.

446
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
I'll hold a press conference tomorrow.

447
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,840
To reveal these to the world.

448
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,400
Are you threatening me?

449
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,720
Since the company wants to burn bridges,

450
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,960
Throw me out.

451
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
I don't have to bear it anymore.

452
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,760
And the grievance.

453
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,080
What did you want

454
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,560
I'm coming back to the company.

455
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,400
Back to my position.

456
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,480
Well

457
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,480
Song Zihao has finished shooting.

458
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,520
This year, four seasons of advertising

459
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,560
Even if he

460
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,960
She was lying in the hospital.

461
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,600
It won't affect

462
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,200
You keep showing the new ads.

463
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,680
but

464
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,160
Your first year of advertising,

465
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,280
I can handle it.

466
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,360
What about the second year?

467
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,320
Within a year,

468
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,800
To cultivate a new one.

469
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,040
Who can be replaced.

470
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,200
when the moment comes

471
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,280
If Song Zihao hasn't woken up yet,

472
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,360
I will replace him with a new man.

473
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,720
For a year.

474
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,120
To cultivate a man like Song Zihao.

475
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,880
As a good actor.

476
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,000
Is that possible?

477
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,320
It's impossible.

478
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,120
If within a year,

479
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,800
I didn't fulfill my promise.

480
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,920
that

481
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,720
I will pay double the compensation

482
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,840
To compensate you.

483
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,080
This deal

484
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,480
You won't lose.

485
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,080
That's good.

486
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,800
good

487
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,880
We'll wait a year for you.

488
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,840
good

489
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,640
It's settled.

490
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,320
One year.

491
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,320
There's only one year left.

492
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,000
Time is short.

493
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,920
I must...

494
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,640
Find this newbie first.

495
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,000
Come on, everyone.

496
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,760
If you're a male,

497
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,200
If you're a male,

498
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,920
If you're a male,

499
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,640
The company's artists are all here.

500
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,320
In addition to the acting,

501
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,360
And answer the call.

502
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,840
The rest are here.

503
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,640
Well

504
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,800
However

505
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,360
But what?

506
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,760
Miss Tong said

507
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,360
You quarreled with the boss?

508
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,840
If the artist follows you,

509
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,360
to accept

510
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,760
There might be no resources.

511
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Resources

512
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,880
Do you know

513
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,200
The biggest resource of the company.

514
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,680
What is it?

515
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
It's human.

516
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,000
The manager and the artist.

517
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,400
The artist is a soldier.

518
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,840
The agent is the one

519
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,760
If you choose the wrong generals,

520
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,240
Then let's die together.

521
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,760
However

522
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,240
You are very lucky today.

523
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,360
Because of me,

524
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,360
The ace agent in the circle.

525
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,440
Dugu is like a man.

526
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,800
If you want to stay,

527
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,160
It has nothing to do

528
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,560
I will personally cultivate you.

529
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,920
If you don't want to,

530
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
You can leave now.

531
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,680
Nice

532
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,400
I'm glad.

533
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,160
You are all visionaries.

534
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,840
Male sister.

535
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,880
We can really

536
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
To choose freely?

537
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,720
If we choose to leave,

538
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,680
Will you be angry?

539
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,240
Of course not.

540
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm a

541
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,560
So easily angry?

542
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,560
Leave if you want.

543
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,200
I will never ask you to stay.

544
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,440
Let's go.

545
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:40,960
go

546
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,000
Don't you think about it?

547
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,520
I

548
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,920
Dugu is like a man.

549
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,240
Gold Agent.

550
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,280
You're walking fast.

551
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,840
You're in such a hurry.

552
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,080
He said that children nowadays

553
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,200
It's realistic.

554
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,480
That's rude.

555
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,040
You are so bad-tempered.

556
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,320
Who wants to follow you?

557
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,800
The company

558
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,680
Is there no other artist?

559
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,640
Yes, there is.

560
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
But I think

561
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,480
You may not want him.

562
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,560
So who am I?

563
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,200
Where is it?

564
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,120
I want to see him.

565
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,200
The scene just now

566
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,080
It's very good.

567
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,920
Thank you

568
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,280
Including the front.

569
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,360
Working with you all the way.

570
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,280
Are very happy.

571
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,080
Thank you, director.

572
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,920
And then later,

573
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,520
Well

574
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,040
And a kissing scene.

575
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,520
Well

576
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,840
In this drama,

577
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,800
This scene

578
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,600
It's short.

579
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,120
Just a minute.

580
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,760
then

581
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,240
The main story

582
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,840
You and your ex-boyfriend

583
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,200
There's a kiss.

584
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,200
I know.

585
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,640
I'm doing it for effect.

586
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,560
therefore

587
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,240
I want to tell you in advance.

588
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,400
Then we'll

589
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,120
I'm not borrowing.

590
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,440
good

591
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,160
It's real, okay?

592
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,960
Can I...

593
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:49,960
Thank you.

594
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,640
It's okay.

595
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,080
Then let's

596
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,000
Try this scene first.

597
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,480
Alright

598
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,560
Yes, and then later.

599
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,640
The actor has arrived.

600
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,800
Give it a try.

601
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,160
What are you doing here?

602
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
The shooting is about to begin.

603
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,800
What are you drinking?

604
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,280
What if he sees it?

605
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
Miss Tong,

606
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,840
When acting with an actress,

607
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,760
I was nervous.

608
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,080
I want to be bold.

609
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,000
Now it's you.

610
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,120
When you have a problem?

611
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,680
Do you know?

612
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,720
You've been acting as an extra for a year.

613
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,480
It's not easy for me

614
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,600
I'll get you a role.

615
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,880
The heroine's ex-boyfriend.

616
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,320
And more outstanding roles.

617
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,040
If you can't act, you can act for me.

618
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,480
but

619
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,160
Let's go.

620
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,320
Not so much, but...

621
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,200
I'm coming.

622
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,960
to do sth more quickly

623
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,120
How about the director?

624
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,680
Let's go first.

625
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,040
Hurry up.

626
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,320
Let's play it first.

627
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,480
Right?

628
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,200
Director, director.

629
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,320
This is the actor of our company.

630
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,160
Sida

631
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,360
Good morning, director.

632
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
You still know to come?

633
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,520
It has nothing to do

634
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,520
It's all over.

635
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,320
I

636
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,880
No,

637
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,320
He was learning his lines over there.

638
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,880
director

639
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,800
What word?

640
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,520
This is a kissing scene.

641
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,760
It's gone after the kiss.

642
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
Simmering emotions.

643
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,320
Forget it.

644
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,120
Come on, let me explain.

645
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,600
fast

646
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,400
This is your ex-girlfriend.

647
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,680
The last kiss.

648
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
Then you leave.

649
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,240
Stand here.

650
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,280
Alright.

651
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,920
Put on your makeup and patch it up.

652
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,840
Can you act?

653
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,480
No problem. It's okay.

654
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,480
I asked him to.

655
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,720
Alright?

656
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,240
Say it.

657
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,800
Can

658
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,560
Why is it so unreliable?

659
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,760
Get ready.

660
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,560
Come on.

661
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,560
Five scenes, one scene.

662
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,040
Get ready

663
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,560
start

664
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,960
Stop

665
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,720
Who is that?

666
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,880
What's your look?

667
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,480
This is a kissing scene.

668
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,800
It's not a fight.

669
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,680
Why are you holding your fist?

670
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,840
Don't be nervous.

671
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,840
Can you do it?

672
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,880
I'm sorry, director.

673
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,720
Come again.

674
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,000
Be smart.

675
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,760
Five scenes, two scenes.

676
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,160
Get ready

677
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,160
start

678
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,920
Stop, stop.

679
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,680
The actresses went up.

680
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,840
Why are you hiding?

681
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,520
She won't eat you.

682
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,640
What happened

683
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,640
Can you act?

684
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,800
Can you act?

685
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,720
Give me another chance.

686
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,760
Just once.

687
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
This is the last time.

688
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,800
You must pass this one.

689
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,080
I'm sure I can pass this time.

690
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,360
Don't be angry, director.

691
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,760
Five shots, three shots.

692
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,800
start

693
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,480
director

694
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,080
What's wrong with him?

695
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,760
You don't know how to shoot a drama, but you still drink.

696
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,920
The smell of alcohol.

697
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,360
How could an actor

698
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,040
Drinking?

699
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,320
Are you trying to make me sick?

700
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,680
I'll stop shooting.

701
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,880
This kissing scene

702
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,000
And then he died.

703
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,640
Bear it.

704
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,320
Just a minute.

705
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,400
I can't stand it for a minute.

706
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,800
It's either him or me.

707
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,000
Acting Assistant Director.

708
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,440
Yes, Director.

709
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,280
Replace him immediately.

710
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,760
Okay, sorry.

711
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,360
director

712
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,640
Please give me another chance.

713
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,360
I really want to perform this play well.

714
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
Don't act like a fool.

715
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,480
Get out of my sight. Now.

716
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,720
Don't show up in front of me.

717
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,840
Tong Tong, come here.

718
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,480
I

719
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,160
I'm telling you,

720
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,360
Tong Tong.

721
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,840
It's not you.

722
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,480
Are these actors?

723
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,120
How much did this slow down the progress?

724
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,320
He is a

725
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
A passer-by for ten thousand years.

726
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,040
A lifetime of acting as an extra.

727
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,720
I advise you to give up as soon as possible.

728
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,000
New actor and director.

729
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,880
Forget it.

730
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,680
If it weren't for the male lead,

731
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,640
Is from your company.

732
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,400
I'm telling you,

733
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,320
Like this,

734
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,560
Buy one get one free.

735
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,520
I don't know how to use it.

736
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,080
Sorry, director.

737
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,600
I won't let him

738
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,800
In front of you.

739
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,120
The director wants me to say,

740
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,840
You're no better than Ruo Man.

741
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,880
Has experience in this field.

742
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,480
She never brought

743
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,440
An unprofessional artist.

744
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,400
Think about it.

745
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,320
Have you changed the actor?

746
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,760
Okay, I'm almost there.

747
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
Here, get ready.

748
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,240
stop

749
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,520
Do you know?

750
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,680
How embarrassing you made me!

751
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,920
You've been an extra for a year.

752
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,640
It's full of corpses and bandits.

753
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,360
It's not easy for me

754
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,600
To push you into the drama.

755
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,160
What were you doing just now?

756
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,160
Are you still qualified to be an actor?

757
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,280
Tong, I'm sorry.

758
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,000
You got into trouble again.

759
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,240
From now on,

760
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,280
I will take a good photo.

761
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,840
I will go back and practice.

762
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,960
No.

763
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,320
You are being paranoid

764
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,360
No more.

765
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,360
The company won't raise an idle person.

766
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,600
You're not fit for this job.

767
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,800
Tong Tong,

768
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,600
Sister Tong.

769
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,000
I really want to be an actor.

770
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,320
Why don't you

771
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,120
Give me another chance.

772
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,720
I can do it without money.

773
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,080
No money.

774
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,640
Garbage is garbage.

775
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,840
Even if the packaging is beautiful,

776
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,760
The price is lower.

777
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,480
It's still rubbish.

778
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,640
No one wants it.

779
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,560
Everyone needs to know clearly.

780
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,280
Their own position.

781
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,920
Don't do it again.

782
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,000
Your dream of becoming a star.

783
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,960
You're really not fit for this industry.

784
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,040
I won't be able to

785
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,280
Other agents are willing to take you

786
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,520
Wake up.

787
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,560
That's right.

788
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,240
Where is she?

789
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,200
You need to know who you are.

790
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,600
Because you have no taste.

791
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,200
I think

792
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,920
The whole world is rubbish.

793
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,680
Right?

794
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,360
Sida

795
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,240
Who are you?

796
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,600
Gold Agent.

797
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,720
Dugu is like a man.

798
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,200
How did you know my name?

799
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,720
You're smarter than the others.

800
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,800
At least I know

801
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,040
I'm the gold agent.

802
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,920
Male sister.

803
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,160
Didn't the boss ask you to stop work?

804
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,200
The boss didn't ask me to stop work.

805
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,000
The boss asked me to train new people.

806
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,360
The girl went back to work.

807
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,840
I'm really happy for you.

808
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,520
But I'm working for the company now.

809
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,560
Director of Brokerage.

810
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,720
If you want to choose an actress,

811
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,960
It might be through me.

812
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,280
Should I recommend some to you?

813
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,080
Those crooked melons and split dates,

814
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,520
Use it yourself.

815
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,480
Moreover, my artist

816
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,920
It's none of your business now.

817
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,360
Want to have another identity?

818
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,560
Sida

819
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,360
What identity?

820
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
My artist.

821
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,240
can

822
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,680
But I...

823
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,040
But Miss Tong said that

824
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,120
Don't care what others say.

825
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,640
You have to believe in yourself.

826
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,480
Even if you don't believe in yourself,

827
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,120
You have to believe me.

828
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,720
I can definitely

829
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,680
To become a top star.

830
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,600
No one will

831
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,400
If you dare to say you are rubbish,

832
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,120
but

833
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,200
I can't even do that.

834
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,400
Are you with me or not?

835
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,880
Follow and follow.

836
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,680
You have a good taste.

837
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,280
You're really a good girl.

838
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,440
A gold broker.

839
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,600
The future star.

840
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,280
I'm so looking forward to it.

841
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,000
To see you succeed.

842
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,920
You can wait and see.

843
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,480
bye-bye

844
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
Star, let's go.

845
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,920
sister

846
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,680
Actually, you don't have to.

847
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,480
You fought with Tong for me.

848
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,480
Really

849
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,960
I used to be scolded.

850
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,240
This problem

851
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,040
From now on,

852
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,120
Only I can scold you.

853
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,080
No one.

854
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,320
To scold you.

855
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,000
Understand?

856
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,920
Understand?

857
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,680
I understand.

858
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,680
Nice

859
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,760
How old is this year?

860
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,880
Twenty

861
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,520
In 1998,

862
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:29,960
Yes

863
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,840
It's good.

864
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,960
This is the right age.

865
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,480
There is room for cultivation.

866
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,160
How many years have you been in the company?

867
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,840
What was it before?

868
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,160
Graduated from art school.

869
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,280
I've been working here for a year.

870
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,080
Not an art school.

871
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,640
Is an ordinary engineering university.

872
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,360
Without professional training,

873
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,360
You've been working in the company for a year,

874
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,400
What kind of acting?

875
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,640
to shoot a movie

876
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
I've been taking photos for a long time.

877
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,080
This year,

878
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,280
I've shot over 40 plays.

879
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,440
More than 40 units.

880
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,120
That's right.

881
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,600
365 days a year.

882
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,520
That's average.

883
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,760
One film a week.

884
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,960
Not bad.

885
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,000
Sometimes,

886
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,360
One film a day.

887
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,080
The longest was more than a month.

888
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,840
He was a retard.

889
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,280
The director said I laughed silly.

890
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,040
So innocent.

891
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,240
Let me stand next to the protagonist.

892
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,960
For more than a month.

893
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,760
I laughed so hard.

894
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,280
Really

895
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,080
All day long,

896
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,040
I have no choice.

897
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
Oh, my God.

898
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,880
This fool.

899
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,880
It's really a Wannian Passerby.

900
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,840
I'm alone in this business.

901
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,800
For eight years.

902
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,560
Finally,

903
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,080
Sign one.

904
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,040
Without foundation.

905
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,520
Layman.

906
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,840
Sister, are you all right?

907
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,280
Nothing

908
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,960
I'm so cold.

909
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,240
Cold

910
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,520
I only have a sweater.

911
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,200
Without a coat,

912
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,360
It's okay, my heart is cold.

913
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,280
My heart is cold.

914
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,360
There's no hot water here.

915
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,360
What can I do for you?

916
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,360
Look carefully.

917
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,240
He is quite handsome.

918
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,360
It's a pity that

919
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,920
impressive-looking but useless

920
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,640
Stand tall.

921
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,040
Take your legs and lower your abdomen.

922
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:09,800
go

923
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,320
Where are you going?

924
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
To remove the decay and the magic.

925
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,960
What is decay?

926
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,440
Sister, what is decay?

927
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,800
Please.

928
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,480
Don't ask.

929
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,639
So many problems.

930
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,679
But I think

931
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,800
Don't you think

932
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,320
I want to...

933
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,719
Understand?

934
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,639
I understand.

935
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,360
Got it.

936
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,040
I'll get your clothes.

937
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
Change it.

938
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,800
I'm really upset.

939
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,880
It's good. My outfit

940
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:44,520
President Ji.

941
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,719
What time is it?

942
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,960
Whether you can come or not.

943
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,880
I'll make another call.

944
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,000
Hurry up.

945
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,239
President Ji is here.

946
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:52,800
to do sth more quickly

947
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Let me introduce her.

948
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,080
This is President Ji of our group.

949
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,840
Aren't you the girl

950
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,560
Pleasantly surprised

951
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
You're the one who came to my house that night.

952
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,640
It's me.

953
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,320
You two know each other?

954
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,080
The contract today,

955
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,120
So we can talk, right?

956
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,240
That's right.

957
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,680
Sit inside.

958
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,880
Do you have a watch?

959
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,560
President Ji, I have a phone.

960
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,920
What time is it?

961
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,760
What time is the appointment?

962
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,040
three

963
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,720
An hour late?

964
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,760
Mr. Ji, there's a traffic jam on the road.

965
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,520
Let's come out.

966
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,800
Punctual is a model.

967
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,760
The basic principles.

968
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,840
If a model is late,

969
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,120
Then the clothes she was wearing

970
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,640
And lost it.

971
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,880
The chance to show it to the public.

972
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,360
For a clothing company,

973
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,200
Will never be tolerated.

974
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,560
I doubt it.

975
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,680
Miss Field, I'm really sorry

976
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,480
To cooperate with you.

977
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,240
Or

978
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,640
Think it over and come back.

979
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,280
Mr. Ji, don't doubt it.

980
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,320
You invited me here today.

981
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,600
Mr. Ji said that.

982
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,360
Don't you think about the consequences?

983
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,680
No

984
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,960
How about President Ji?

985
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,880
That's it.

986
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,320
He likes to

987
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,240
He said to the front.

988
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,080
He has it for everyone.

989
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,520
Your own requirements and guidelines.

990
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,040
I'm looking for a spokesman.

991
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,640
Not only fame,

992
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,280
The most important thing is the working attitude.

993
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,240
President Ji, Phil,

994
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,040
According to you,

995
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,280
We can't talk today.

996
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,160
When we cooperate next time,

997
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,200
I hope you are punctual.

998
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,240
Okay, President Ji.

999
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,320
I won't be late.

1000
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,880
Sorry

1001
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,600
Sorry

1002
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,240
President Ji.

1003
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,640
Aren't you going to sign Phyl?

1004
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,200
Why did you piss her off?

1005
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,680
If Phil

1006
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,840
With another company.

1007
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,760
Where do you want me to go?

1008
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,320
I'll find you another one.

1009
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,400
The new spokesman.

1010
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,240
Who said I was looking for a new one?

1011
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,720
Just now,

1012
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,960
Find out if she's in the circle.

1013
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,440
A strong competitor.

1014
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,400
Contact each other.

1015
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,520
To her manager.

1016
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,080
She will come back for me.

1017
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,600
This is Jimo.

1018
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,640
When did you meet him?

1019
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,040
Why didn't you tell me?

1020
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,160
Besides, you know them all.

1021
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,200
You can talk about it.

1022
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,120
You're really my intention.

1023
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,560
What are you laughing at?

1024
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,680
If what the man said is true,

1025
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,320
This person

1026
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,960
He's different from ordinary people.

1027
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,840
interesting

1028
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,040
interesting

1029
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,920
Then why are you angry?

1030
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
I wanted to

1031
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,920
To pick another one.

1032
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,360
I'm not in a hurry to get the endorsement.

1033
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Today,

1034
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,080
It's just a formality.

1035
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,960
but

1036
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,800
Now I've changed my mind.

1037
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,680
Make an appointment with them.

1038
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,040
The next time we meet,

1039
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,040
How is it, sister?

1040
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,360
Is there any change?

1041
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,280
It's beautiful.

1042
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,360
You must.

1043
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
An artist needs to dress up.

1044
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,920
Stars are packaging.

1045
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,080
You didn't bring anyone before.

1046
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,720
Nobody cares.

1047
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,920
It's different now.

1048
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,760
Now you're my artist.

1049
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,320
So, from the beginning,

1050
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,760
It's all my business.

1051
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,160
From now on,

1052
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,840
You need to study.

1053
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,120
How can I be a star?

1054
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,640
Start with the dressing.

1055
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,160
Well

1056
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,560
sister

1057
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,200
You're so nice to me.

1058
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
I'm so touched.

1059
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,440
I will make money for you.

1060
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,320
And repay you.

1061
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,240
Don't.

1062
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,520
Don't be so moved.

1063
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,480
In the future,

1064
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,400
From you,

1065
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,560
I earned it.

1066
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,520
Are you hungry?

1067
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,400
I'm hungry.

1068
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
What should I eat?

1069
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,920
You bought so many.

1070
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,160
How about a food stall?

1071
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,200
Just eat something.

1072
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,280
Let's have a buffet.

1073
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,160
So that you can have a full meal.

1074
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,120
Too thin.

1075
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,280
Let's go.

1076
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,320
What does it mean?

1077
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,400
It's okay. Eat.

1078
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,800
You've been hungry for a long time.

1079
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,280
How are you?

1080
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,360
I haven't eaten for two days.

1081
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,560
Isn't there a lunch box?

1082
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,000
Why didn't you eat it?

1083
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
because

1084
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,000
sister

1085
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,120
Have you seen

1086
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,640
The king of Zhou Xingchi's comedy.

1087
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,960
That's my favorite.

1088
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,760
A movie.

1089
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,960
When he started inside,

1090
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,480
Is acting as an extra.

1091
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,560
His dream is to become a

1092
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,480
Let everyone recognize his actors.

1093
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,760
But at the beginning,

1094
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,520
He didn't achieve the director's requirements.

1095
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,480
Which caused a drag.

1096
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,960
The progress of the whole crew.

1097
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,240
So his lunch box

1098
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,600
And was thrown to feed the dog.

1099
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,720
Every time I was scolded by the director,

1100
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,720
I will tell myself

1101
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,600
You don't deserve a bowl of packed lunch today.

1102
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,000
Because I haven't

1103
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,360
A real actor.

1104
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,000
therefore

1105
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,560
I haven't eaten much these days.

1106
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,200
So as to warn yourself.

1107
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,720
Actually, before this meal,

1108
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,160
I'm still hesitating.

1109
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,240
Should I choose you?

1110
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,840
But now I've decided

1111
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,360
No matter what,

1112
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,200
What obstacles and difficulties,

1113
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,440
I will be your manager.

1114
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,840
To support you.

1115
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,800
Sida

1116
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,400
You will be popular.

1117
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,560
And become a star.

1118
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,160
Never forget.

1119
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,840
What you just said

1120
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,800
Remember that you are hungry.

1121
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,880
This experience

1122
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,720
Okay?

1123
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,120
sister

1124
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,080
Are you really willing to

1125
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,840
Let me follow you.

1126
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,880
I'm not dreaming.

1127
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,480
Don't be too happy.

1128
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,000
Before you become my artist,

1129
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,200
I want to explain.

1130
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,120
My rules and requirements for artists

1131
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
Well

1132
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,560
You only need to listen to me from now on.

1133
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,800
What did I ask you to do?

1134
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,960
You have to do something.

1135
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,560
I won't let you do anything.

1136
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,000
Don't even think about it.

1137
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,880
You can't lie to me and avoid me.

1138
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,000
You didn't contact me.

1139
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,560
The phone will be on for 24 hours.

1140
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,160
You must reply within two minutes.

1141
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,280
I told you to go east.

1142
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,560
You can't go west.

1143
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,760
I told you to be a vegetarian.

1144
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,200
You can't cheat.

1145
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Can you do that?

1146
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,360
I can do it.

1147
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,320
We must do it.

1148
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,400
You will be my artist from now on.

1149
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,680
Am I dreaming?

1150
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,840
The dream has just begun.

1151
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,040
Eat it.

1152
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,840
Oh

1153
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,800
Hold on.

1154
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,000
to wait a moment

1155
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,720
Why are you standing there? Come in.

1156
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,800
Are you afraid that I will eat you?

1157
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,080
I will be afraid of you.

1158
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,880
Why are you so numb?

1159
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,760
Is it the leakage of electricity?
