1
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,280
What about

2
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,760
Do you want to help me?

3
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,240
Can I not help you?

4
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,320
But I'm really

5
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,120
A little sad.

6
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,040
You're so proactive.

7
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,600
Ask me out.

8
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,440
I thought you missed me.

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,120
I didn't expect that

10
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,400
Let me help you take the newbies.

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,280
Dugu Ruuo, let me ask you something.

12
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,000
Is work important?

13
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,600
Our relationship is more important.

14
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,480
You are important.

15
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,560
I want to make money.

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,440
Or you'll be old.

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,640
How can I raise you?

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,960
Okay, I want to hear this.

19
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,120
Seriously,

20
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,680
Help him more.

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,000
Teach him to walk on stage.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,440
What kind of audition is there?

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,800
Just give him a lift.

24
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,760
I know.

25
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
What you asked me to do,

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,960
I will definitely help.

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,640
Correct!

28
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,800
Last time,

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
The one I told you about.

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,440
The new endorsement deal.

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,960
Guess who I met.

32
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,680
who

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,280
The handsome guy downstairs

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
The one downstairs

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,360
What a coincidence.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,400
Is it a coincidence?

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
I didn't expect that

38
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,680
He is the president of Wing Fashion.

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,720
He is

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,720
It shows a very bad smell.

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,280
Promise me you won't go near him.

42
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,560
Stay away from him.

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,520
decline

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,960
Well

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
What does that mean?

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,840
Beauty, let's meet.

47
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,160
I don't have time.

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,520
Who are you?

49
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,600
I'm her husband.

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,320
husband

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,160
Aren't you a woman?

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,240
What's wrong with women?

53
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,480
You're free to be in a relationship now.

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,320
To disturb us.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,080
Do you know?

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,440
Get lost

57
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,520
My husband is so handsome.

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,080
Kiss me.

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,840
roll

60
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,720
There's more drama.

61
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,680
My best friend.

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,440
So handsome. Thank you.

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,520
One more cup.

64
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
You feel safe.

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Look, look.

66
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,760
You're so graceful.

67
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,800
Her legs are so long.

68
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,160
You're new here.

69
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,360
They say that serious men

70
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
The most charming.

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,360
To see you.

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,399
I finally believe that.

73
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,519
Don't you have the habit of knocking?

74
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,959
Knock it.

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
You didn't hear me.

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,160
What's the matter

77
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,840
Can't I come to you if I'm fine?

78
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,800
Yes

79
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,960
I have something to do today.

80
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,160
Please help me.

81
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,680
This new product show

82
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,280
I want to bring a male model on stage.

83
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,360
If I remember correctly,

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,240
This brand show is for women's wear.

85
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,720
We don't need male models.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,440
But your subsidiary brand

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,680
Don't you have menswear?

88
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Besides, every time,

89
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,800
Are all female models.

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,880
Walking here and there.

91
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,080
It's so boring.

92
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,720
Women's wear is for women.

93
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,320
Which woman?

94
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,400
I don't like to see handsome men.

95
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,720
Don't you think so?

96
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,880
It's a good suggestion.

97
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,880
but

98
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,040
This brand show

99
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,400
Has been rehearsed many times.

100
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,120
If a new model is installed,

101
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,640
To re-rehearse the design.

102
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,320
Will delay the project.

103
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,280
Don't worry.

104
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
You only need one.

105
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,200
When I came on stage,

106
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,880
He will stand next to me.

107
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,640
I'll be in charge of his rehearsal.

108
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,200
It seems that you're not interested

109
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,240
You're very thoughtful.

110
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,280
Are you jealous?

111
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm never jealous.

112
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,840
That's because

113
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,840
You haven't met

114
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,200
Who can make you jealous.

115
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,240
For example,

116
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,600
If you don't agree,

117
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,480
I'll take it as

118
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,920
I'm jealous of him.

119
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,000
I promise you,

120
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,400
Really?

121
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,680
Thank you

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,000
This is your reward.

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,600
Bye

124
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,920
what

125
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,440
Ask Star to leave.

126
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,600
Wing fashion show.

127
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,440
That's right.

128
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,240
You asked me to help you.

129
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,320
Looking for a chance?

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,680
Then I'm

131
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
A ready-made opportunity.

132
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,440
And you know Zimmer.

133
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,480
Two people working together,

134
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,400
You're so talkative.

135
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,160
No way

136
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
I told you.

137
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,760
I don't agree with Ji Mo.

138
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,760
It's not good to touch them together.

139
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,600
It's you who can't pull your face.

140
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,280
Ask for help.

141
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,880
I've already said that

142
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,800
I would never...

143
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,320
To cooperate with Wing Fashion.

144
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,040
I'm going to beg him.

145
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,040
Isn't it very embarrassing?

146
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,080
I think this face

147
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,800
You have to fight.

148
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,960
Think about it.

149
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,720
For a year,

150
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,920
It'll be over soon.

151
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,800
If that handsome young man

152
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,120
We should hurry up.

153
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Is that right?

154
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,160
Listen to me.

155
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,520
Hey, handsome guy.

156
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,920
Yes, he is so cute.

157
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
You're shy.

158
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,840
Let's go.

159
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,840
Why are you hiding?

160
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,040
It's all girls. I'm nervous.

161
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,200
This is the workplace.

162
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,040
These women are your colleagues.

163
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,360
You're here to finish the work.

164
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,520
What's there to be nervous about?

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,160
Show me your expertise.

166
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,840
I'm telling you,

167
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,600
Today,

168
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,760
I have one enemy.

169
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,040
Don't drop the ball.

170
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,920
Personal enemy

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,720
Well

172
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,840
Who is the enemy?

173
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,200
Don't ask so many questions.

174
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,960
Phil!

175
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,280
Mr. Ji, what you said

176
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,000
The male model?

177
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,280
We'll be there soon.

178
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
You know his manager?

179
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,000
I know him too.

180
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,520
If it's a male,

181
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,240
What a coincidence.

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840
What a coincidence.

183
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,760
Hello, President Ji.

184
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,640
Hello, President Ji.

185
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,560
You look great, President Ji.

186
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,800
come

187
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,480
This is Star.

188
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,840
Tell me, Mr. Ji.

189
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,280
Hello, President Ji. I'm Si Da.

190
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,760
Such a good girl.

191
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,160
Hello

192
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,520
Phil!

193
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,080
Take Star with you.

194
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,200
To visit the company.

195
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,760
What a beautiful company.

196
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,159
I have something to tell you privately.

197
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,880
To talk to President Ji.

198
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,240
Alright. Take your time.

199
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,360
Let's go, handsome.

200
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,880
All right, everyone has left.

201
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,840
Stop pretending.

202
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,840
sorry

203
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,200
President Ji.

204
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,080
I was wrong last time.

205
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,360
But you're not the kind of person

206
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,120
Who seems to have a personal vendetta.

207
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
Our relationship

208
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Don't affect the cooperation.

209
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,760
Star is my artist.

210
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,320
He's completely innocent.

211
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
I hope you can give him

212
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,560
A chance.

213
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,400
You really...

214
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm willing to compromise for five rice.

215
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,960
But I'm telling you the truth.

216
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,160
This brand show

217
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,280
Is very important.

218
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,480
I can't use your artist.

219
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,160
why

220
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,080
You said that.

221
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,360
What's his strength and talent?

222
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,160
Nothing.

223
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,960
I want professional models.

224
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,200
It's not an embroidered pillow.

225
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,480
You didn't use him.

226
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,880
How do I know he's unprofessional?

227
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,440
As far as I know,

228
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,480
The theme of your company

229
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,040
Wild and primitive.

230
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,920
Is there any place in the world

231
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,960
Men and women

232
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,360
More primitive and wild?

233
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,680
The shape of Star is exactly the same.

234
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
All he needs is a chance.

235
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,840
It seems you came prepared.

236
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,520
Of course

237
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,800
I'm very familiar with it.

238
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,960
Each of your themes

239
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,880
I'm really sincere.

240
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,080
To cooperate with you.

241
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,320
Please give me a chance.

242
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,960
good

243
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,640
For the sake of your sincerity,

244
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
I'll give you a chance.

245
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,600
Thank you, President Ji.

246
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
Thank you for your cooperation.

247
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,120
Good cooperation.

248
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,840
Good cooperation.

249
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,560
Come in.

250
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,240
on

251
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,880
Just one.

252
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,800
Where are the clothes?

253
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
The theme of this issue is

254
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,840
The original wild

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,480
Have you ever seen a primitive wearing clothes?

256
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,920
Is there any doubt?

257
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,720
I'll wear it later.

258
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,280
In front of so many people,

259
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,480
The interview naked.

260
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
You're so conservative.

261
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,760
If a man says you are simple,

262
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,280
I believe it today.

263
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
As a model,

264
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,840
You can't let it go.

265
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,280
How can Ruonan lead you?

266
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,560
No wonder she has a headache.

267
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm telling you,

268
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Today,

269
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,560
I have one enemy.

270
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,760
Don't drop the ball.

271
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,240
I'll change.

272
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,720
I'll change.

273
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,280
that

274
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,720
Take off your clothes.

275
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,760
Then someone

276
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
I'll measure your figure.

277
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,240
Well

278
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,280
Well

279
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,240
The clothes on show today are pretty.

280
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,880
Are you wearing it?

281
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,800
I haven't tried it yet.

282
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Let me have a look.

283
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,560
Who are you going to be?

284
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,840
I don't know.

285
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,320
Help me.

286
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,160
That's it.

287
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,240
Your skin is so nice.

288
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,080
Thank you

289
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,720
Hold it for me.

290
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,480
I'll try over there.

291
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,240
Yeah.

292
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
I want to be professional.

293
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,200
I want to work hard.

294
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,960
I can't embarrass you.

295
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,360
Hello, President Ji.

296
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,040
hard

297
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,600
Sida

298
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,320
Sida

299
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,000
brother

300
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,960
Brother, I'm here.

301
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,280
It's almost time. Come out.

302
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,800
Brother, can you come in?

303
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,640
Brother

304
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,920
I just want to show it to you.

305
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
Are you satisfied?

306
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,360
Brother, brother.

307
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,160
What's wrong with you?

308
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,360
Who taught you that?

309
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,360
Nothing.

310
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Sister, save my sister.

311
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,040
Why did you hit my artist?

312
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,600
He seduced me.

313
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,120
No, no.

314
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,200
It's a misunderstanding.

315
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,800
It was Phyl who asked me to take off my clothes.

316
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,960
Waiting for an interview.

317
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,160
I dare not show it to others.

318
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,600
I want to show him first.

319
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,480
I didn't expect that

320
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
So he hit me.

321
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,440
You're so sneaky.

322
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,680
Don't ask others to misunderstand.

323
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,320
You don't want to be seen.

324
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,800
How to be a model?

325
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,280
And you.

326
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,400
He's a new guy.

327
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,600
You have no judgment?

328
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,680
He said it was a misunderstanding.

329
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,600
He will explain it clearly.

330
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,160
Sida

331
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,360
You can be a good model, right?

332
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,080
I

333
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,560
can

334
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,760
Yes, he can.

335
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,800
I'll wait and see.

336
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,120
Don't be nervous.

337
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,360
I'll take you with me later.

338
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,640
Relax

339
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,280
Is this what you call a good model?

340
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
At the beginning,

341
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,040
Sida

342
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, my god. Am I so charming?

343
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,720
Sida

344
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,360
What's wrong with Star?

345
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,120
What's up

346
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,960
What's wrong? Let me see.

347
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,600
Are you all right?

348
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,280
Don't touch him.

349
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,160
lying flat

350
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,160
Look at the ceiling.

351
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,640
Look at the ceiling.

352
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,640
Take a deep breath

353
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,960
sister

354
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,720
Well

355
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,680
sister

356
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,520
It's okay.

357
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,880
She's recovered.

358
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,000
Come here, Si Da.

359
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,440
How is it?

360
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,640
sister

361
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,560
It's all right.

362
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,240
Is it OK?

363
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
His eyes were wandering just now.

364
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,920
Breathing is irregular.

365
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,240
Pressure on the throat.

366
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,560
This is a heterosexual relationship.

367
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
The symptoms of the disorder.

368
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,400
It's a kind of self-obsession.

369
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,480
As long as the patient is close to the opposite sex,

370
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,520
I'll be nervous all over.

371
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,760
It will cause syncope.

372
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,280
Yes

373
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,840
Yes, I think he told me

374
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,920
What heterosexual disorder does he have?

375
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,000
You knew he had the symptoms.

376
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,080
And asked him to be a woman.

377
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,040
Work in a clothing company.

378
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,280
Why are you the manager?

379
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,320
At this stage,

380
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
Not suitable for modeling.

381
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,480
You should find him

382
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,360
Psychiatrist

383
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,320
Aren't you a psychiatrist?

384
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,240
My idea is that

385
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,400
He can.

386
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,000
While working.

387
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,160
And treat the illness.

388
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,400
But I didn't know about his illness.

389
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,320
Are you kidding me

390
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm busy.

391
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,480
I don't have time to fool around with you.

392
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,080
I'll take him.

393
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,040
To see a psychiatrist.

394
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,280
And I'll come back tomorrow.

395
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,000
No way

396
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,640
Dugu is like a man.

397
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,920
In any case

398
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,920
I won't let him

399
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
To be the model of this rookie.

400
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,720
Are you all right?

401
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,920
Where are his clothes? Are you all right?

402
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,640
sister

403
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,760
Back off.

404
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,440
to be dead

405
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,840
Don't cry.

406
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,160
Hold back the tears.

407
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,200
There's nothing to cry about.

408
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,120
Hello, President Ji.

409
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,800
good

410
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,560
Who let you in?

411
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Why are you here?

412
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,080
You forgot?

413
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,520
The whole world knows that

414
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,640
Our relationship

415
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,360
How could you not let me in?

416
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,040
Good morning, Mr. Ji.

417
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,200
Good morning.

418
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,200
I just want to ask you one thing.

419
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,400
What are you doing here?

420
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,240
I just want to

421
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,520
The fact that Star can walk in the show,

422
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,160
To have a friendly negotiation with you.

423
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,960
But you didn't give me a chance.

424
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,720
I have to use

425
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,599
My own way.

426
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,720
Are you threatening me?

427
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,920
To force me to give in.

428
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,040
I'm telling you, there's no door.

429
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,280
You want to waste time?

430
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,240
Then you'll have to

431
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,280
It depends on how long you're using energy.

432
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,240
So bad-tempered.

433
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,800
Okay, President Ji.

434
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,440
Thank you

435
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
What's wrong, President Ji?

436
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
What happened?

437
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,720
You scared me.

438
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,880
If you're a male sister,

439
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,440
Get her out of here.

440
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,440
Hurry up.

441
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,600
Isn't it appropriate?

442
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,360
If the male sister

443
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,320
I've done so much for you.

444
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,560
Get out of here.

445
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,200
What has she done for me?

446
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,680
President Ji.

447
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,200
Stop avoiding it, okay?

448
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,120
If you're here for me,

449
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,920
Has gone to the company.

450
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,760
You're here to help.

451
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,040
Your stories have been touched.

452
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,000
The cleaner.

453
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,920
What story?

454
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,080
A ghost story.

455
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,480
For Zimmer,

456
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,200
I've been patient again and again.

457
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,840
No matter how he treats me,

458
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,240
Why are you so cold?

459
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,040
How could you trample on my dignity?

460
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,040
But I will always

461
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,240
I will always use it.

462
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,840
With my warm face,

463
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,480
To stick his cold ass.

464
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
I also know that

465
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,840
Without dignity.

466
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,280
But you know what?

467
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,320
Love has no dignity.

468
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,840
If we all know about it,

469
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,040
It's not easy for you.

470
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,600
Everyone is young.

471
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,120
Is it wrong to love someone?

472
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,880
that's right

473
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,640
that's right

474
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,400
When you were young,

475
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,600
I've never loved a few scumbags.

476
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,400
yes

477
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,200
But he's not really bad.

478
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,920
Sometimes,

479
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,480
Will treat me well.

480
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,560
Didn't I say that

481
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,720
I want to come here

482
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,840
What are you complaining about?

483
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,760
I just I know

484
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,880
I'm just too wronged.

485
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,000
I know. We all know.

486
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,640
Thank you.

487
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,800
But I hope

488
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,880
Don't tell him.

489
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,440
About my affection,

490
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,560
No, I won't.

491
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
because

492
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,840
I think this love

493
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,680
Just stay in my heart.

494
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,440
I don't want to

495
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,120
To trouble him, okay?

496
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,520
Don't worry, Miss Ruuo.

497
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,280
Don't worry.

498
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,000
Ah

499
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,760
Come on, guys.

500
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,840
Come on

501
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,800
We support you.

502
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,480
Thank you, aunt.

503
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,480
Dugu is like a man.

504
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,040
Are you done?

505
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,720
You're finally willing to talk to me.

506
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,920
Stop acting. No one is here.

507
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
I know you want Star on stage.

508
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
But he's really not the type.

509
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,840
You can only

510
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,880
You're doing harm to others.

511
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,440
Star is already training.

512
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,840
He just got cold feet yesterday.

513
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,000
I promise, next time,

514
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,200
He will never make a mistake.

515
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,480
No

516
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,360
Do you have any self-esteem?

517
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,120
Like you,

518
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,240
In the broker industry.

519
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,920
Are you always like this?

520
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,880
There's no bottom line.

521
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,800
Do you know what an agent is?

522
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,520
The agent is

523
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,880
The other side of the artist.

524
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,040
How beautiful the artist is.

525
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,240
How humble an agent is.

526
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,400
So what if you have no self-esteem?

527
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,760
If I want self-respect,

528
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,280
My artist.

529
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,240
You can't stand out.

530
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,160
I really admire you.

531
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,240
President Ji.

532
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,120
Do you know why I

533
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,520
Are you so eager for quick success?

534
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Because in this industry,

535
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,760
The competition is fierce.

536
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,520
The chance is gone.

537
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,320
But now,

538
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,560
To give Sida a chance.

539
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,560
Only you.

540
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,760
I really appreciate your persistence.

541
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,920
But I have my principles.

542
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,800
Are you still here?

543
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,440
You love to stay here, right?

544
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,080
Okay, stay here. I'm leaving.

545
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,400
President Ji.

546
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Long time no see

547
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,360
An'an.

548
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,480
Why are you here?

549
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,480
Last time you saved me on the rooftop,

550
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,320
I've been looking for a chance.

551
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,160
Thank you so much.

552
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,840
You're welcome.

553
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,480
I've been thinking about

554
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,120
What you said to me on the rooftop,

555
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,600
I think you're very manly.

556
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,920
Makes me feel safe.

557
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,720
President Ji, I think you misunderstood.

558
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm like this to everyone.

559
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,840
Actually, these days,

560
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,160
I was always scared.

561
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,080
I'm afraid of being alone.

562
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,840
I hope that

563
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,000
Someone can protect me.

564
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,640
You're suffering from trauma.

565
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,120
You need to find a psychologist.

566
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,080
I'm busy.

567
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,640
It's okay. You're busy.

568
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,280
When you're not busy,

569
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,200
We can make an appointment.

570
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,040
Are you free tomorrow?

571
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,200
There's no time. The day after tomorrow,

572
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,880
I'm busy every day.

573
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,280
I'll get back to work.

574
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,880
There were wolves and tigers.

575
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,320
To save the situation.

576
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,000
Someone is bothering me.

577
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,840
Help me get rid of her.

578
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,960
President Ji is asking me for help.

579
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,560
After the event,

580
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,760
Give Star an interview.

581
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,600
Deal

582
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,040
What should we do now?

583
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,880
I'll handle it.

584
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,080
She was on the rooftop last time.

585
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,240
The woman who wanted to jump off the building

586
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,680
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

587
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,960
I didn't have time to tell you.

588
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,000
you

589
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,320
Aren't you on the rooftop?

590
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,720
The lady who saved me?

591
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,000
Why are you together?

592
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,520
Because of

593
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,920
And saved lives.

594
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,280
And come together.

595
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,120
I think this is fate.

596
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
impossible

597
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,120
Don't you already have a husband?

598
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,200
I'm divorced.

599
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,840
Because I'm planning to marry him.

600
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,040
Right?

601
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,240
Yes

602
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,320
Yes

603
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,920
impossible

604
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,680
President Ji, why do you like it?

605
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,600
Such an old woman.

606
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,240
Why are you talking like this?

607
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,240
We are all women.

608
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Why are you attacking the age?

609
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,480
Won't you be old?

610
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,440
Yes?

611
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,800
Am I wrong?

612
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm younger than you now.

613
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,720
You're old and I'm younger than you.

614
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,640
You're too old to be shameless.

615
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,480
Old woman. Old lady.

616
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,280
Old lady.

617
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,120
So what if you're old?

618
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,160
The salt I ate

619
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,640
More than you have ever eaten.

620
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,160
About experience, ability and wisdom.

621
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,520
You are not my opponent.

622
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,600
Besides being young,

623
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,800
Without any advantage.

624
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,760
The nutrition is on your legs.

625
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
You don't have much brain.

626
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,600
An excellent woman like you

627
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,160
It's like

628
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,640
In the CBD.

629
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,680
Although he's older,

630
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,200
But the location is good and the price is high.

631
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,720
A lot of people can't get it.

632
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,440
And people like you

633
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,000
You're a brainless young girl.

634
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,880
It's like a new building in the suburbs.

635
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,280
The price is low.

636
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,520
Even if I post ads all over the street,

637
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,680
No one wants it.

638
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,120
Do you think it's comparable?

639
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,040
you

640
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,680
He's my man.

641
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,720
You can be jealous or jealous.

642
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,360
This is the charm of old women.

643
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,240
President Ji.

644
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,480
What do you really like about her?

645
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,200
She filled my life with excitement.

646
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,760
stimulate

647
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,400
baby

648
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,280
I'm old.

649
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,600
A little hypoxic after the fight.

650
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,680
Really?

651
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,840
Baby, you worked hard.

652
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,040
Baby, let's go home.

653
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,160
You're so thoughtful.

654
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,440
Okay, baby. Go.

655
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,720
You're working so hard, baby.

656
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,360
Baby, you want to cook?

657
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,520
Give it to me, baby.

658
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,200
Baby, I'll go back.

659
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,520
I have to cook for you.

660
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,960
Baby, you're so thoughtful.

661
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,920
Hurry home.

662
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,800
Let's not talk about it, okay?

663
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,240
Baby, let's go.

664
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,840
You two are both idiots.

665
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,640
What are you laughing at?

666
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm laughing at your mouth.

667
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,080
It's like a machine gun.

668
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,480
Obtrusive

669
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,200
No matter what,

670
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,160
You're right.

671
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,760
I'm just a talker.

672
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,960
What about

673
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,280
You pissed her off.

674
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,360
Whatever you say,

675
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,600
just

676
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,880
Thank you.

677
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,840
No need.

678
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,200
You just need to cash it.

679
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,360
What you said is fine.

680
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,360
Of course.

681
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,800
What I said,

682
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,640
Everything counts.

683
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,760
But you should pay attention to

684
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,200
She's unstable.

685
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,920
I'm afraid that I will make

686
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,040
And aggressive behavior.

687
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,560
When you meet her,

688
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,960
Don't irritate her. Stimulate her.

689
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,560
Contact me in time.

690
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,280
I'm telling you,

691
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,000
Don't cheat anymore.

692
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,360
She's a little girl.

693
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,400
Are you responsible for the problem?

694
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,160
I told you,

695
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,560
I have nothing to do with her.

696
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,240
So she got lost here.

697
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,720
I saved her before.

698
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,080
And her ex,

699
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,320
Before.

700
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,360
So it caused her

701
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,880
You see me as a safe haven.

702
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,040
So she had

703
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,000
Dependency and craving

704
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,920
But the craving is pathological.

705
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,280
The blind stress.

706
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,760
It has nothing to do with real feelings.

707
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,080
therefore

708
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,960
I kept my distance from her.

709
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,360
Is actually helping her.

710
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,200
For her sake.

711
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,160
Why are you so nervous?

712
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,560
So much about psychology.

713
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,640
I don't understand.

714
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,120
All men are the same.

715
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,680
If you get it, you won't treasure it.

716
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,800
You are so prejudiced against men.

717
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,600
Before,

718
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,240
What kind of stimulation?

719
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,320
Don't think you've studied for years.

720
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,240
psychology

721
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
You know me very well.

722
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,960
Stop it.

723
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,840
Do you think it's handsome?

724
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,240
shoulder

725
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,280
head

726
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,920
Look at me.

727
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,720
I don't believe it.

728
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
I can't cure you.

729
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,840
see

730
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Look at me.

731
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,760
Sister, I can't.

732
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,880
sister

733
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,920
Alright.

734
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,920
Relax.

735
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,400
Now you imagine me as

736
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,680
You're the most familiar with it.

737
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,120
The closest person.

738
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,000
And imagine her.

739
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,840
Standing in front of you,

740
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,160
Are you feeling better?

741
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,320
It's better.

742
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,600
You lack of love experience.

743
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,320
If you have

744
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,400
The woman you like,

745
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,640
All your problems are gone.

746
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,240
If you love someone,

747
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,520
What does it feel like?

748
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,320
If you love someone,

749
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,920
What does it feel like?

750
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,920
yes

751
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,840
The feeling of heart beat.

752
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,040
When you see her,

753
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,560
Your heart will beat fast.

754
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,680
And your joy will double.

755
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,040
but

756
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,960
And the pain will double.

757
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,920
in short

758
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,320
If you want to know,

759
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,920
Whether you like someone or not,

760
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,760
Just ask your own heart.

761
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,680
That's it.

762
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,760
Well

763
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,160
Correct!

764
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,080
That

765
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,280
That's all for today.

766
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,840
I'm going on a date.

767
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,640
I'll stay and practice on my own.

768
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,520
Just follow

769
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,560
The way I taught you.

770
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,760
Come on.

771
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,080
Bye

772
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,560
And march forward.

773
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,600
You are so prejudiced against men.

774
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,600
Before,

775
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,040
What kind of stimulation?

776
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,440
Who is it?

777
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,960
Why are you here?

778
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,120
Where's Zimmer?

779
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,920
How do you know where my home is?

780
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,760
You followed me?

781
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,840
Cut the crap.

782
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,560
Where is Zimmer?

783
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,880
He doesn't live here.

784
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
How could it be?

785
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,480
I saw

786
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,600
You got into the elevator together.

787
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,760
Zimmer

788
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,720
Zimmer

789
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,160
He doesn't live here, okay?

790
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,160
Zimmer

791
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,280
Stop it.

792
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,280
You...

793
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,760
Is it here?

794
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,280
Give it to me.

795
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,240
Give it to me.

796
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,200
What are you doing? Let go of me.

797
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,360
Let go of me.

798
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,360
This is my home.

799
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,640
Don't play tricks on me.

800
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,120
Ask Zimmer to come out.

801
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,960
Come back.

802
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,840
Calm down.

803
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,240
You're sick now.

804
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,160
You should go to the doctor.

805
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,280
Not looking for a man.

806
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,160
You've been

807
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,520
Once.

808
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,880
You can't do that to a man.

809
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,880
To find a sense of security.

810
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,320
Do you know how to love yourself?

811
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,720
Zimmer won't accept me.

812
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,560
But I didn't expect that

813
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,080
He will like it.

814
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,960
You are such a scoundrel.

815
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,720
I'm telling you,

816
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,280
You don't have to deal with my affairs.

817
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,960
Is he over there?

818
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,640
Come back.

819
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,600
Let go of me.

820
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,640
What a fart!

821
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,440
Move. I'll wait.

822
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,640
Hold on.

823
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,920
What's the smell?

824
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,080
Do you smell something?

825
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,840
What about my room?

826
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
How to do it?

827
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,440
Don't go.

828
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,240
feed

829
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,760
119?

830
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,080
My house is on fire.

831
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,320
Thank you

832
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,400
Nothing

833
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,880
The surname is Ji.

834
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,440
I'm not finished with you.

835
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,720
What happened

836
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,040
What happened to your family?

837
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,760
How dare you ask?

838
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,160
An An,

839
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,520
You did this to my family.

840
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,600
I burned everything.

841
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,080
It's An'an's house.

842
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,560
You're such a loser.

843
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,360
Hapless

844
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,200
bane of others' existence

845
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,600
It's bad luck to meet you.

846
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,960
Get out of here.

847
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,920
I warned you.

848
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,080
Don't irritate her.

849
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,720
The first person to contact me

850
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,680
You're telling me this now.

851
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,560
Is it useful?

852
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,320
Did you see that?

853
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,880
Have you seen my house?

854
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,800
I was careless.

855
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,720
Are you all right?

856
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,040
I'll take you to the hospital for a check-up.

857
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,400
Find a place to stay.

858
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,800
I'll handle the rest.

859
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,400
I was careless.

860
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,080
sister

861
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,280
Why are you here alone?

862
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,880
Who made you angry?

863
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,480
Sister, why are you...

864
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,880
She came out wearing this.

865
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,480
All I have now

866
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,440
This dress.

867
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,560
Why are you naked?

868
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,280
Because my house was burned down.

869
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,639
Was burned.

870
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,560
Are you all right?

871
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,679
You wouldn't have come.

872
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,719
I just came back from the police station.

873
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,480
I'm bored.

874
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,080
But don't drink.

875
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,840
Zi Hao was drinking.

876
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,960
Well

877
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,120
Have a coke.

878
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:51,960
Waiter/Waitress

879
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,280
Give him a Coke. Thank you.

880
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,800
OK

881
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,640
Why don't you drink Coke?

882
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,120
Drinking is bad for your health.

883
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,040
Your Coke.

884
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
Thank you. Give me another one.

885
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,920
good

886
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,840
I asked Phyl to come here.

887
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,000
Stay with me.

888
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,080
But she went on a date.

889
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,760
It's good for her to go on a date.

890
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,320
I'm here for you.

891
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,280
Please.

892
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,120
It's better for Si Da.

893
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
And obedient.

894
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,240
come

895
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,040
Why don't you have a Coke?

896
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,880
Nothing

897
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,040
Why aren't you sick today?

898
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Maybe it's my sister.

899
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,360
So I feel kind.

900
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,520
be familiar with

901
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,800
You won't be sick.

902
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,880
Right?

903
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,920
I told you it was good.

904
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,960
Zimmer said it can be cured.

905
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,760
What psychologist?

906
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,080
Is a quack doctor.

907
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,120
Then carry me now.

908
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,600
Hold on. I'll carry you.

909
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,840
No, you're drunk.

910
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,720
Let me carry you.

911
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,600
may not

912
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,640
why

913
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,400
You should be loyal to each other.

914
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,600
Hold on. I'll carry you.

915
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,160
Alright.

916
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,760
It's your turn to carry me.

917
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,520
Alright

918
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,440
I'll carry you.

919
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,560
I'll carry you to the podium.

920
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,160
all right?

921
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,880
I'll carry you to the podium.

922
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,600
But I'm afraid

923
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,840
I'll be a drag.

924
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,280
Imp

925
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,920
Since the first day I signed you,

926
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,840
I knew it.

927
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,840
You will definitely hold me back.

928
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,120
it doesn't matter

929
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,760
What I want to do,

930
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,240
I can definitely do it.

931
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,560
sister

932
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,920
Before I met you,

933
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,360
No one has ever done that.

934
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,880
Encourage me and support me.

935
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,440
And gave me a chance.

936
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,920
Sometimes I wonder

937
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,360
What do you see in me?

938
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,040
Put me down.

939
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,240
Put me down, can you?

940
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,640
How much is it?

941
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,640
He can drink very well.

942
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,680
Forget it.

943
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,360
It's too wet there.

944
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,440
Come on. Sit here.

945
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,480
OK?

946
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,480
sorry

947
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,680
The number you dialed

948
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,720
Can't be connected for the moment.

949
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,760
I remember.

950
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,720
When I first saw you,

951
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,080
You have stars in your eyes.

952
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,240
Stars

953
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,040
Well

954
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,000
What star?

955
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,960
The first time you told me,

956
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,640
When you like acting,

957
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,360
Your eyes are glowing.

958
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,560
At that time,

959
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,000
I said to myself,

960
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,160
Even if you're a deadwood,

961
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,080
I'll also try my best

962
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,480
To carve a flower.

963
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,400
sister

964
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,840
You're so kind.

965
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,720
Then I'm a rotten tree.

966
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,200
I will follow you.

967
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,240
Yes

968
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,160
That's my home.

969
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,480
This is the place.

970
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,440
This is my home.

971
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,520
My home is here.

972
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,480
We're almost there.

973
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,480
Alright, alright.

974
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,400
Put me down.

975
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,320
I'm fine.

976
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,440
I'm fine.

977
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,600
Go home.

978
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,920
I'll send you in.

979
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,680
No need

980
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,800
Male artist

981
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,960
You can't just enter.

982
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,400
A woman's home.

983
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,080
What if it's really troublesome?

984
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,880
Please.

985
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,960
I'm sorry.

986
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,920
Everyone is in trouble.

987
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,240
It's red hot.

988
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,000
It's red hot.

989
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,640
Hurry up.

990
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,120
Or your own home?

991
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,720
comfortable

992
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,120
Are you all right

993
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,880
Where are you now?

994
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,760
I was worried about you.

995
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
What sound?

996
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,800
I misheard you.

997
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,000
Wake up.

998
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,120
Who told you to sleep on my bed?

999
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,000
How did you get in?

1000
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,640
I want to sleep.

1001
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,720
Wake up.

1002
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,480
This is my home.

1003
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,480
I don't have a home.

1004
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,840
Why are you throwing up?

1005
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,640
Don't vomit here.

1006
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,000
Here, I'll help you up and go to the toilet.

1007
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,160
to feel relieved

1008
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,040
I have great taste.

1009
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,240
I won't vomit.
