1
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,280
Why are you throwing up?

2
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,080
Don't vomit here.

3
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,440
Here, I'll help you up and go to the toilet.

4
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,600
to feel relieved

5
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,480
I have great taste.

6
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,680
I won't vomit.

7
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,160
sister

8
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,320
sister

9
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,280
Sorry

10
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,560
A little bit too much.

11
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,640
Or sleep in your own home.

12
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
what

13
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,480
What are you arguing about?

14
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,320
It's not like you haven't slept with me.

15
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,200
Why would I...

16
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,320
Will wear your clothes.

17
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
Where are my clothes?

18
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,320
I'll take it off.

19
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,880
Take it off.

20
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,840
What did you do to me?

21
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,480
To correct you.

22
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,880
What did I do to you?

23
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,080
What did you do to me?

24
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,160
Don't change the subject.

25
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,520
Are you looking at my dark circles?

26
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,040
Last night

27
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,160
Because of you.

28
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,160
that

29
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
Last night

30
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,960
Is it more intense than last time?

31
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
different

32
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,600
Compared to last time,

33
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,960
A lot more intense.

34
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,280
I thought about it.

35
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,320
Most of the responsibility

36
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,240
Lies with me.

37
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll be responsible.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,160
What do you want to do?

39
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,920
We are all adults.

40
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,480
You shouldn't escape when things go wrong.

41
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,720
You should take responsibility.

42
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,920
you

43
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,520
How about living with me?

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,240
Who made a rule to sleep for one night?

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,400
To live together.

46
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,000
And I don't want to be with you.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
What kind of responsibility?

48
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm not a casual woman.

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,120
I have principles.

50
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,640
What are you thinking?

51
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,399
I'm talking about the house.

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,560
Your house is on fire because of me.

53
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,120
I can't let you

54
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,920
Sleep on the streets.

55
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,800
Homeless?

56
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,400
So the two of us

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
Nothing happened last night.

58
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,320
You were as dirty as a pig last night.

59
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,560
You threw up all over my house.

60
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,120
What do you think might have happened?

61
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,880
But help me change.

62
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,200
You've seen everything.

63
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,280
I'm in the modeling industry every day.

64
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,680
What kind? I've never seen it.

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,400
Your belly fat

66
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,320
Could I be interested in you?

67
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,840
You can't stay here.

68
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
If you live here,

69
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,200
So I signed it.

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,200
Why should I share with you?

71
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,680
This house is mine.

72
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,440
I rented this house.

73
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,000
So I have the right to use it.

74
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,760
I pity you for being homeless.

75
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,640
To let you live here.

76
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,520
The rent photo.

77
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,680
What's your problem?

78
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,400
If it weren't for your admirer,

79
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,920
Burn down my house.

80
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,440
Why should I be homeless?

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,360
Moreover,

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,560
As an unmarried young woman,

83
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,840
To live with you.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,680
Who don't know.

85
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,160
I thought I raised a toy boy.

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,120
How about we discuss it?

87
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
I knew you would burn your bridges.

88
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,400
We can't discuss it.

89
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,240
It was such a big deal yesterday.

90
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
The landlord is still refusing to forgive me.

91
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,760
Even if you lose the money,

92
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,360
Whether I rent it or not,

93
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,280
It's not so fast to find a house.

94
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,480
Just move back.

95
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,680
Sign or not, I'll take it.

96
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,120
Who says I won't sign it?

97
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,320
Why is it so thick?

98
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,560
What does it say?

99
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,720
Although I asked you to move in,

100
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,640
But I don't know

101
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,600
There are still requirements.

102
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,520
It lists

103
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,080
All the rules and guidelines

104
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,680
What's wrong?

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,240
Or something to add.

106
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,280
Sign it if you're fine.

107
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,880
I have an appointment later.

108
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,200
I'll read it when I come back tonight.

109
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
You're going out like this.

110
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,760
What are you doing?

111
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,400
Why?

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,440
It's not as big as I thought.

113
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,800
You're measuring my waist.

114
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,200
What do you think?

115
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,080
Drinking is a mistake.

116
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,840
Drinking is dangerous. Drink.

117
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,600
And brought President Ji.

118
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,560
Change your shoes.

119
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Are you all right

120
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,640
Where are you now?

121
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,520
I was worried about you.

122
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,720
You know you care about me.

123
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,280
He has conscience.

124
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,320
Put it on.

125
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,560
The size of these clothes

126
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,080
It would be perfect for you.

127
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,880
I didn't expect that

128
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,840
You're quite thoughtful.

129
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,320
President Ji.

130
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,520
Who's in here?

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,160
I haven't seen you for so many years.

132
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,480
To take a woman home.

133
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,120
I didn't bring her back.

134
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,680
She broke in.

135
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,960
You broke in?

136
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,720
No wonder that last night,

137
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
It's so fierce.

138
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,080
The clothes are torn off.

139
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,360
So early in the morning,

140
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,880
You asked me to buy clothes for you.

141
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,200
If you don't want to be dismissed,

142
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,960
Take back your imagination.

143
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,320
OK

144
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,960
early

145
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,640
early

146
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,080
I'm going to work.

147
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
Go home early.

148
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,120
I'll wait for you at home.

149
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,800
President Ji.

150
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,160
Last night

151
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,440
Don't you have a good rest?

152
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,920
Was tortured by that woman.

153
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,080
If the male sister is so fierce,

154
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,960
I have another one in the back.

155
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,200
Why don't you go back and prepare it?

156
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,720
What's wrong with you?

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,240
I'm not sick.

158
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,680
Aren't you living together?

159
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,440
You need to replenish your energy.

160
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,680
We're not living together, we are living here.

161
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,640
Her house was burned down.

162
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,680
It's my responsibility.

163
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,720
Out of pity and guilt,

164
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,000
I asked her to move in.

165
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,880
And move in.

166
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,200
We're living together.

167
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,040
Living together is the same thing.

168
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,160
Look at this. It's lonely.

169
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,760
Under the same roof,

170
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,080
This is often

171
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,480
The beginning of the story.

172
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,760
What can I do?

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,200
Let her sleep in the street.

174
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,560
Even if you pity her,

175
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,720
There's no need to

176
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,240
To stay at home.

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,040
I've never seen you before.

178
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,560
Brought another woman to stay here.

179
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,280
Is she a woman?

180
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,320
No

181
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,360
Besides,

182
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,800
I'm just stalling.

183
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,280
After the transition period,

184
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,960
She found a house.

185
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,080
I will ask her to move out.

186
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,120
wrong

187
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,680
I always think that

188
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,040
And treat other women

189
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,040
It's not the same.

190
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,080
In the past,

191
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,240
Those girls who are chasing you,

192
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,200
When he hanged himself,

193
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,160
I didn't see you pity her.

194
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,240
what

195
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,080
You want to live with Zimmer?

196
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,520
Not cohabitation.

197
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,600
Are living together temporarily.

198
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,000
Why don't you just move into my house?

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,600
That's it.

200
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,440
My house is so big.

201
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,960
And we can talk.

202
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,600
Forget it.

203
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,560
I've known you for so many years.

204
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200
Don't you know what kind of person you are?

205
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,960
She brings men home all the time.

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,240
How could I?

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,240
I'm living with Zimmer.

208
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,560
You only need to be with a man.

209
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,200
Deal with

210
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,120
I'm living with you.

211
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,840
You have to deal with a group of men.

212
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,040
Am I free?

213
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,320
Don't you hate Zimmer?

214
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
I hate him.

215
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,640
But I don't hate my house.

216
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,360
Just wait, lady.

217
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,680
After a while,

218
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,000
He'll take the money

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,840
Get out of here.

220
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,880
When you're alone,

221
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,080
You won't stay here.

222
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,600
You fell in love with Ji Mo, right?

223
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,920
Are you kidding me?

224
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,560
Am I so casual?

225
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,800
To perform idol drama.

226
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,120
How is that possible?

227
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,240
Or comfortable at home?

228
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,320
What time is it?

229
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,840
You still haven't come back?

230
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,840
let it be

231
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,920
You'd better not come back for the rest of your life.

232
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,560
This home is mine.

233
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,200
Don't take it.

234
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,640
And pissed him off.

235
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,480
Dugu is like a man.

236
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,040
Dugu is like a man.

237
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,720
Why are you talking so loud?

238
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
There's someone else at home.

239
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,240
Who allowed you?

240
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,200
Did you touch my stuff?

241
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,800
I just decorated it slightly.

242
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,840
That's great.

243
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,080
The style of the two of us.

244
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,000
right or wrong?

245
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,880
Okay, if you really

246
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,160
If you're very unhappy,

247
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Then I can change back.

248
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,040
all right?

249
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,600
Did you read the contract?

250
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,600
It's clear that

251
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,680
Don't violate the privacy of both parties.

252
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,480
I'm busy today.

253
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,120
I went shopping this morning.

254
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,360
I'm busy eating.

255
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,560
Then I have to decorate the room.

256
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,960
I didn't have time to read it.

257
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,000
Forget it. Go.

258
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,120
I can't talk to

259
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,600
Such a messy woman.

260
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,040
Living under the same roof.

261
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,160
Let's go.

262
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,760
Don't be so bad-tempered.

263
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,520
if it were not for

264
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,720
I don't want to leave this house.

265
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,280
I don't want to live with you.

266
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,280
What are you doing?

267
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,720
You...

268
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,240
Is that my underwear?

269
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,080
The fabric lacks texture.

270
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,600
It feels uncomfortable.

271
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,640
Take it back and redo it.

272
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,040
you

273
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,760
In the middle of the night,

274
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,560
And came to my room.

275
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,040
To steal my underwear.

276
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,640
Psycho pornographer.

277
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
What happened

278
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,520
Zimmer

279
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,560
This ring

280
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,880
I always carry it with me.

281
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,600
I want to give it to you.

282
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,400
sorry

283
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,960
I shouldn't have let you leave.

284
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,600
Stay

285
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,680
Stay with me, okay?

286
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,560
Sick

287
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,360
What's wrong with you?

288
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,600
You came to give me a ring in the middle of the night.

289
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,080
Zimmer

290
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,200
Are you sleepwalking?

291
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,120
Can you wake up when you're sleepwalking?

292
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
It's so scary.

293
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
It's so scary. So creepy.

294
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
metamorphosis

295
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,680
Why are you in my room?

296
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,160
So clean.

297
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,400
Pervert, this guy.

298
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,840
This is my room.

299
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,760
get up

300
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,840
get up

301
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,160
Sleepwalking is amazing.

302
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,960
get up

303
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,120
get up

304
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,360
Still not awake?

305
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,120
Good morning.

306
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,480
Why am I here?

307
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,600
Did you sleep well?

308
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,720
Yesterday,

309
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,240
Came to my room in the middle of the night.

310
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,120
To steal my underwear.

311
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,440
Sleep in my bed.

312
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,680
Don't you remember it?

313
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
That's impossible.

314
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,840
There's no way

315
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,080
To do such a thing.

316
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,400
I really can't see it.

317
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,160
You're usually so naughty during the day.

318
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
I didn't expect that

319
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,360
It changed.

320
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,840
You still have two faces.

321
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,120
I really don't know.

322
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,440
Why am I here?

323
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,560
If I do it,

324
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,920
What's out of line?

325
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,800
I apologize to you.

326
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,160
to feel relieved

327
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,480
You came yesterday.

328
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,000
Is to put my room

329
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,200
And cleaned up a meal.

330
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,440
It's really interesting.

331
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,560
It's the first time I heard her sleepwalking.

332
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,680
And cleaned the room.

333
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,720
metamorphosis

334
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,840
but

335
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,480
You harassed me repeatedly.

336
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,680
Has seriously affected

337
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
My life

338
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
I'm sleepwalking.

339
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,800
Yes?

340
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,880
Your girlfriends

341
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,320
Didn't I tell you?

342
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,880
I'm single.

343
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
I used to live alone.

344
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,840
Sleep alone.

345
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,200
Then why did you ask me to move in?

346
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,520
I'm a woman.

347
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,800
Speak nicely.

348
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,880
Are you a woman? Stop it.

349
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,120
It's the middle of the night.

350
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,760
Came to my room and harassed me.

351
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,800
I can sue you.

352
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,440
I can't talk to

353
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,080
With a sleepwalker.

354
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,480
Who knows I won't be able to

355
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,600
Will you take advantage of me?

356
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,440
So you're moving out?

357
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,520
Why should I move?

358
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,480
You have a problem.

359
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,920
You have to move.

360
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,720
We are all adults.

361
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Don't argue.

362
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,640
Or we'll sign the contract.

363
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,520
According to the

364
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,560
Rules and regulations. Go.

365
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,360
Who made mistakes, who moved away.

366
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,320
can

367
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,080
It's a contract.

368
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,880
I'm afraid of you.

369
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,440
When I was sleepwalking yesterday,

370
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,920
Give me this ring.

371
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,880
Do you want a cure?

372
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
You're sleepwalking.

373
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,800
When did you fall asleep?

374
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,640
To propose to her.

375
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,040
I don't remember.

376
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,280
Zimmer

377
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,520
You're the best student

378
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,680
You're really good at psychology.

379
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,400
Are you sure you want me to treat you?

380
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,160
Are you sleepwalking?

381
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,680
It's been a long time.

382
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,360
Back in school,

383
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,600
When you helped me with my paper,

384
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,440
I never thought

385
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,960
To be your doctor.

386
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,920
You don't believe that

387
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,600
Are you professional?

388
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,200
good

389
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,960
Then,

390
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,920
When did you have these symptoms?

391
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,480
This morning,

392
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,720
But according to my observation,

393
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,640
A long time ago,

394
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,000
This kind of symptoms.

395
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,840
Are you a psychologist?

396
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,960
You should know very well that

397
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,320
If it's not inherited,

398
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,040
Sleepwalking,

399
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,160
There are only two possibilities.

400
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,120
First,

401
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,560
Caused by organic brain lesions.

402
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,320
The second one?

403
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,560
Is caused by depression.

404
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,240
I had my health check last month.

405
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,960
I have no brain disease.

406
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,280
in other words

407
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,240
Is caused by depression.

408
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,720
Then we need to trace back

409
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,560
The cause.

410
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,800
The first time,

411
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,560
When did you have insomnia?

412
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,200
After you broke up with Su Xiao, right?

413
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,280
After you two separated,

414
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,800
You've always been single.

415
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,320
You're afraid to form a close relationship.

416
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,240
So you have no choice.

417
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,160
Fall in love with another person.

418
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,880
right or wrong?

419
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,880
Zimmer

420
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,200
I know. You and Su Xiao

421
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,040
After the separation,

422
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
It hit you hard.

423
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,640
I'm here to see you.

424
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,920
Not to talk about the past.

425
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,960
But your problem

426
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,400
In the past.

427
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,840
If you can heal yourself,

428
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,400
You wouldn't have

429
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,840
Appeared here, right?

430
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,200
Doctors can't treat themselves.

431
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,280
You know very well that

432
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,480
The acquired sleepwalking

433
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,880
It's a mental illness.

434
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,880
I'm your doctor now.

435
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,040
You're my patient.

436
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,360
As a doctor, I have the responsibility.

437
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
To understand your psychological changes.

438
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,280
I want to help you out of the shadow.

439
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,960
right or wrong?

440
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,080
I have no shadow.

441
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,000
good

442
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,080
Everyone who comes here says that.

443
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,760
Ji Mo, let me give you a piece of advice.

444
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,520
Your life is too rational.

445
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,600
At a glance,

446
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Are all black and white.

447
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,640
There's no color.

448
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,960
I even suspect that you have

449
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,080
Minor stress disorder.

450
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,120
Trauma syndrome

451
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,600
If you want to cure

452
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,760
First of all,

453
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,480
You shouldn't avoid your past.

454
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,160
Prescribe triazolam tablets.

455
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,160
Triazolam tablet

456
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,760
I can give it to you.

457
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,480
But,

458
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,880
Will only suppress your sleepwalking.

459
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,520
It won't cure you.

460
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,160
That's your problem.

461
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Alright

462
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,760
When you want to talk,

463
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,840
Come to me anytime.

464
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,920
Don't ask about each other.

465
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,120
Private life.

466
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Don't touch your personal belongings.

467
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,920
All the things in the room

468
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,240
After using or moving,

469
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,880
You must return to the original position.

470
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,480
You are not allowed to

471
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,960
In the public area.

472
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,320
You must take off your shoes when you come in.

473
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,240
Put your shoes in order.

474
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,440
The shoes must be in different shades.

475
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,400
In turn.

476
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,640
Keep the distance.

477
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,160
Five centimeters.

478
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,480
Continue

479
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,080
The mirror and the sink.

480
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,720
There can't be any water stains.

481
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,960
You must clean it up every time you use it.

482
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,600
Every time I take a shower,

483
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,640
You must dry the water on the bathroom.

484
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,840
The cleanliness of the room must be maintained.

485
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,120
The garbage is sorted and thrown away.

486
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,680
On the floor of the public area,

487
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,760
There can't be any hair.

488
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,520
These are the most basic.

489
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,960
I haven't thought of anything else.

490
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,040
You can add it.

491
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,480
Basically,

492
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,520
This is the overlord clause.

493
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
The most difficult artist.

494
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,960
I'm not as hypocritical as you.

495
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,320
This is totally unreasonable.

496
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,800
The distance between the shoes

497
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,480
No more than five centimeters.

498
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,680
Do I always

499
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,240
When you put your shoes,

500
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,680
I have to measure it with a ruler.

501
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
On the sink.

502
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,320
There can't be any water stains.

503
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,640
Wash your face and dry clean it.

504
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,960
The thing that drives me crazy is

505
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,240
The last one.

506
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,160
There must be no hair on the floor.

507
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,480
Do you know how hard

508
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,400
Losing an average of 100 hair a day.

509
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,760
Especially a woman.

510
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,200
A species that loves losing its hair.

511
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,560
The floor is covered with hair.

512
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,000
You can't help it if you don't agree.

513
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,520
Why are you relying on others?

514
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,360
Are you doing this on purpose?

515
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,160
You don't want me to live here?

516
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,760
In order to avoid unnecessary troubles,

517
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,000
During the contract period,

518
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,960
You can't fall in love with each other.

519
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,080
Violators must move out.

520
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,640
Think too much.

521
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,440
Even if I'm blind,

522
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,160
This wouldn't have happened.

523
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,960
But I'm worried.

524
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,400
You know,

525
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,840
A combination of wisdom and beauty.

526
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,360
With a beautiful woman.

527
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,680
I'm really scared.

528
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,160
You can't help yourself.

529
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,040
Infatuated with me.

530
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,920
What can we do

531
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,000
This kind of thing happened.

532
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,200
The probability is zero.

533
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,400
Can you guarantee that?

534
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,840
If I fall in love with you,

535
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,440
I'll move out.

536
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,480
It's a deal

537
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,760
Okay, time is up.

538
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,120
sister

539
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,760
Do you want to...

540
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,040
Watch me walk on the stage.

541
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,640
Your legs were weak just now.

542
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,920
On the floor.

543
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,960
OK?

544
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,320
no problem

545
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,960
I can do it.

546
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,800
Alright.

547
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,440
Not bad.

548
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,320
And graceful.

549
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,320
Imp

550
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,000
You've made great progress.

551
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,040
I told you, you are talented.

552
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
shy

553
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,920
Sida

554
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,360
Take a rest.

555
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,600
Go to the bathroom.

556
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,920
I don't want to.

557
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,520
Come and have some water.

558
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,280
Go on.

559
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,320
I've thought about it. Be good.

560
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,040
Take it easy.

561
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,160
What about

562
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,680
Zimmer said

563
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,360
Give Star another chance.

564
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,160
From your professional perspective,

565
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,400
After a week,

566
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,640
Can you be on stage?

567
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,920
He's on the stage now.

568
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,200
There's no problem.

569
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,600
But I'm afraid that

570
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,200
Heterosexual communication disorder

571
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,720
Will affect his condition.

572
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
You also know that

573
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,120
The modeling industry

574
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,320
The stability of the state

575
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,160
Is very important.

576
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,920
About his illness,

577
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,800
I went to check it too.

578
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,080
A lot of psychological books.

579
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,000
but

580
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,160
It's too hard to understand.

581
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,760
How about now?

582
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,040
It's not easy to help him.

583
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,400
To find a psychologist.

584
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,400
It's counterproductive.

585
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,640
What if it's self-defeating?

586
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,120
You forgot?

587
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,720
Your family

588
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,640
There's a ready-made one.

589
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,840
What about the psychologist?

590
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,680
Who is it?

591
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
He...

592
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,480
That's right.

593
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,920
Why didn't I think of him?

594
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,320
Right? It's ready-made.

595
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,800
Don't waste your time.

596
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,120
That's right.

597
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,920
You're back.

598
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,920
I got off work this morning.

599
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,280
And made a table full of dishes.

600
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,640
Let's eat together. Come on.

601
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,920
Can you cook?

602
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
Of course

603
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,000
Try my cooking.

604
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,520
This meal

605
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
To celebrate.

606
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,280
We are officially living together.

607
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,240
I've thought about it.

608
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,440
We can live together.

609
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,520
It's fate.

610
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,280
A bad marriage.

611
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,000
We've had some

612
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,640
A little misunderstanding.

613
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,200
But since we live together,

614
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,120
The roommates

615
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,520
We should help each other.

616
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,280
right or wrong?

617
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,960
What if

618
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,680
What are you doing?

619
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,440
If you need my help,

620
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,520
Just ask me.

621
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,840
I will definitely go through fire and water.

622
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,040
Will not refuse under any circumstances

623
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,800
What if

624
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,600
If I need your help,

625
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,680
I don't need your help.

626
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,520
I have no obligation to help you.

627
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,320
Why are you talking like this?

628
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,960
Come on. Take a look.

629
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,880
I'm very thoughtful.

630
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,560
My dishes

631
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,160
Especially for you.

632
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,720
It's delicious.

633
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,600
Who ordered it?

634
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,200
The old king at the alley.

635
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,440
I've been working all afternoon.

636
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,600
come

637
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,960
What do you want me to do?

638
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,080
What really happened?

639
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,520
Can't hide it from your eyes.

640
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,360
This is Bustar.

641
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,800
Is the interview coming soon?

642
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,600
I'm a little worried about him.

643
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,640
What emotional disorder?

644
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,440
Will affect his performance.

645
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,800
Aren't you a psychology expert?

646
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,480
I just want to say, can you...

647
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,920
To teach him.

648
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,640
I've already given him one.

649
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
For the interview.

650
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,320
That's right.

651
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,600
But this fashion show

652
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,440
For this child,

653
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,600
Is very important.

654
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
He has heterosexual disorder.

655
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,640
Not suitable for modeling.

656
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,040
Then your idea

657
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,680
Is to cure people.

658
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,800
Now he's sick.

659
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,720
Can't you cure it?

660
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
His heart?

661
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,840
Not all patients.

662
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,280
Can be helped.

663
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,600
So what?

664
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,600
You should ignore him.

665
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,680
For help?

666
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,640
You pulled him.

667
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,320
Can change his fate.

668
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,640
let it be

669
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,720
I'd rather beg him than myself.

670
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,480
Hypnotherapy

671
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,240
The analyst hypnotized the patient

672
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,960
And dig each other's souls.

673
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,720
Or something deep in your memory.

674
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,000
To find the root of the mental disorder.

675
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,800
hypnosis

676
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,840
Forcing therapy

677
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,320
The patient

678
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,679
Standing on the stage

679
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,960
The opposite sex,

680
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,440
With strong psychological stimulation,

681
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,280
And forced treatment.

682
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,360
That's okay.

683
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,000
Really?

684
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,400
Then your idea

685
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,040
Is to cure people.

686
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,160
Now he's sick.

687
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,080
Can't you cure it?

688
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,080
His heart?

689
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,680
So what?

690
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,680
You should ignore him.

691
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,760
For help?

692
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,680
You pulled him.

693
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,360
Can change his fate.

694
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,320
President Ji.

695
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,520
It's Yuxing Entertainment.

696
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
The agent is here.

697
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,360
He said he wanted to cooperate with you.

698
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,120
Meet Star Entertainment.

699
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,360
Isn't that

700
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,560
Dugu Ruuo's company?

701
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,840
What is she doing?

702
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,080
I pushed it.

703
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,600
But it seems that

704
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,200
Was not sent by Ruo.

705
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,680
But do you know this person?

706
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,680
Is Ruo's former assistant.

707
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,520
President Ji, we meet again.

708
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,360
You are not Dugu Ruuo's man.

709
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,200
Assistant?

710
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,880
What's the matter?

711
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,600
Hasn't she told you?

712
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,960
I'm from Yuxing Entertainment.

713
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,120
Director of Brokerage.

714
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,400
This is my new name card.

715
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,360
Put it there.

716
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,800
If you want to seek

717
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Artist cooperation.

718
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,080
You shouldn't come to me.

719
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,440
You should come to our group.

720
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,240
Propaganda Department

721
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,520
Or the public relations department.

722
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,720
I'm busy.

723
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,160
I think I can still

724
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,800
It's better to talk face to face.

725
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,520
These are

726
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,880
Some male models.

727
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,880
They are all chosen.

728
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,200
The famous

729
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,720
A top male model.

730
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,520
They are very experienced in catwalk.

731
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,240
I hope they

732
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,680
You can give me

733
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,840
At the new product launch,

734
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,200
You can use

735
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,040
Male model

736
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,720
Who said I would use a male model?

737
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,400
What's your opinion?

738
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,680
She said you're going to use

739
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,600
As the first male model of the press conference,

740
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,240
I see.

741
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,400
You want to get rid of Star.

742
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,040
To create vicious internal competition, right?

743
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,640
If you still say that,

744
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,080
And a member of Star Entertainment.

745
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,760
The artists are from the company.

746
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,400
If we do this,

747
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,680
It's all for the sake of the artist.

748
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,880
There is no vicious competition.

749
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,520
But this time,

750
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,480
I care about working with you.

751
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
We think that

752
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,600
No matter from qualifications or experience,

753
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,040
Can't meet the requirements.

754
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,760
So I chose these.

755
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,040
A model with better conditions.

756
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,760
This is also

757
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,160
A more responsible way.

758
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,880
I think you got the wrong idea.

759
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,040
first

760
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,800
I didn't say that.

761
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,080
To use Star as a model.

762
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,040
Second, I hate it the most.

763
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
Who played tricks behind my back.

764
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,920
As soon as you hear Star,

765
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,800
To interview models.

766
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,000
So I tried to make trouble.

767
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,640
Your eating style is too ugly.

768
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,480
I'm guessing you.

769
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,680
This is not the first time

770
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,280
It won't be your last time.

771
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,320
Compared to you,

772
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,280
I think Dugu is a man.

773
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,520
More straightforward.

774
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,520
President Ji.

775
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,400
I know you have a personal relationship with her.

776
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,480
But I don't have to.

777
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,040
That's a bad thing to say.

778
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,320
After all, I'm just trying to

779
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,360
It's work.

780
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
And I think

781
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,440
You should be professional.

782
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
didn't expect

783
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,320
It's so public and private.

784
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,240
The personal relationship

785
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,480
To work.

786
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,960
According to what you just said,

787
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,960
If we use means,

788
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,280
Then I think using means

789
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,520
It should be Ruo.

790
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,000
After all, she is using

791
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,160
Your personal feelings.

792
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,800
To help your own artist.

793
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,240
She's always

794
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,120
A trick used.

795
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,960
Who is dirty.

796
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,120
You will think others are dirty.

797
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,680
Typical psychological projection.

798
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,240
Allen delivers.

799
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,840
No need.

800
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,440
I'll leave by myself.

801
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,760
President Ji.

802
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,240
Are you standing up for Ruo?

803
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,760
Do you have Star's contact information?

804
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,240
Ask him out. I want to see him.

805
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,520
President Ji.

806
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,800
Why are we here today?

807
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,240
Do you want to get the chance to walk in the show?

808
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,360
Think about it.

809
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,440
If you're a male,

810
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,480
Where is Star?

811
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,120
Why aren't you in the rehearsal room?

812
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,240
I have her.

813
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

814
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,120
So our work today is

815
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,080
You are my assistant for one day.

816
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,280
I'll do whatever you want.

817
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,080
good

818
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,840
Then,

819
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,920
Your first task

820
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,360
Is to help these models.

821
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,520
President Ji.

822
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,520
Can I get another job?

823
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,560
Are you seeing a ghost?

824
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,680
It's so horrible.

825
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Or

826
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,080
I'll lean closer to you.

827
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,600
Are you all right?

828
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,040
The model

829
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,400
Pull the zipper on the back.

830
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,480
come

831
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,760
What's going on?

832
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,680
What's the matter with you

833
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,760
Come here.

834
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,680
No, no. Are you all right?

835
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,640
Don't come. Be careful.

836
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,840
Let me help you.

837
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
You all go out.

838
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,680
I'll handle it.

839
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,720
Okay, Mr. Ji.

840
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Put this on your nose and mouth.

841
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,760
Press on the edge.

842
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,080
Breathe evenly.

843
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,800
It can alleviate

844
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,880
Breathing too much.

845
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,800
Are you feeling better?

846
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,400
President Ji.

847
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,960
I really can't.

848
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,360
Don't push me anymore.

849
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,760
I'm pushing you.

850
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,560
I'm using the system desensitization method.

851
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,800
Through the things you fear,

852
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,680
To stimulate you.

853
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,880
Through contact,

854
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,400
To reduce your sense of rejection.

855
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,520
but

856
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,880
I have no choice now.

857
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,640
With so many girls,

858
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,800
I'll be nervous.

859
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,520
Okay, let's change the treatment.

860
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:52,920
To ease the pressure.

861
