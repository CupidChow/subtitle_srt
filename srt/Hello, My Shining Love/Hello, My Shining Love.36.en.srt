1
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,360
Hey,

2
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,080
Ruonan, it's me.

3
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,000
Why are you still here?

4
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,720
because

5
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,160
I want to see you.

6
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,880
There's no need for us to meet.

7
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,680
You can leave.

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,080
I don't want to trouble you.

9
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,960
But I really can't restrain myself

10
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,760
from thinking about you.

11
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,840
You have such a big heart.

12
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,840
You can hold two women.

13
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,840
I know.

14
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,520
In your heart, what happened to Su Xiao

15
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,600
is just like a thorn,

16
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,080
You won't forgive me.

17
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,600
But,

18
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,520
I've never betrayed you.

19
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
I just want to pay off

20
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,240
what I owe Su Xiao.

21
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,280
Don't you have one?

22
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,600
Do you dare to say that you have a clear conscience?

23
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,800
I have a clear conscience.

24
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,680
Please trust me.

25
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,480
Haven't I ever believed you?

26
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,800
Didn't I give you a chance?

27
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,720
You're right.

28
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,560
There is a thorn in my heart,

29
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,320
and that thorn is you.

30
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,960
But now,

31
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm going to learn to

32
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,800
pull this thorn out,

33
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,760
Because I don't want to be disappointed anymore.

34
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,360
I don't want to feel sorry for you anymore.

35
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,760
Do you have anything else to say to me?

36
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,040
If not, I'll go upstairs.

37
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
One more thing.

38
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,240
I'm going to stay with Su Xiao for a while.

39
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,040
There's a reason why I have to.

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,080
What reason?

41
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,240
I can't tell you.

42
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,120
I promised her.

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,520
Here we go again.

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,200
What do you take me for?

45
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,600
You have a secret with Su Xiao?

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,280
You have a past,

47
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,120
you have too many things to deal with.

48
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,600
Then go and be with her.

49
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,720
Why are you still here?

50
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,600
I've had enough.

51
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,120
I can't take it anymore.

52
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,440
Please don't come to me again.

53
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
I'm begging you.

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,640
Ji Mo,

55
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
after breaking up,

56
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,200
Only men are so depressed?

57
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,400
Men,

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,160
reason is greater than sensibility,

59
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,160
They will accept the fact

60
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
in the first place,

61
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Then their pain

62
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,520
will spread.

63
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,840
And women are different,

64
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,960
they will in a short period of time,

65
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,840
Let all your emotions

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,560
out.

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,920
Once they vent their anger,

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,920
it'll be the beginning of a new life.

69
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,800
So,

70
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,320
sometimes women

71
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,200
are more decisive than men.

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Then tell me,

73
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,080
how far is Ruonan?

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,760
Ruonan is strong on the surface,

75
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,160
but actually she is soft on the heart

76
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,880
and gets hurt,

77
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,680
He hides himself.

78
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,840
Don't let anyone see her wound.

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,840
Once you decide to leave,

80
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,960
you'll never look back.

81
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,800
Sure, sure,

82
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,680
Okay.

83
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,600
The broadcast of the new series

84
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
was a great success.

85
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,240
Not only did the number of follow-up page views

86
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,520
go up all the way,

87
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,920
Even the comments on the Internet

88
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
have a very good reputation.

89
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,520
Especially Sida,

90
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
as a newcomer,

91
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,440
Your performance in the play,

92
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,760
is very impressive.

93
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,520
In terms of topic volume and browsing volume,

94
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,120
it is not inferior to Song Zihao

95
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,320
who is in the same play at all.

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,200
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

97
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm willing to give Sida a chance,

98
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,560
so I looked at

99
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
the future direction of the script,

100
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,040
In this script,

101
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,240
there has always been a trend of double male lead,

102
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
So I decided to shoot the poster.

103
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,600
Sida, if you switch with Zihao,

104
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,200
the center position will be fixed.

105
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,440
Sida's follow-up publicity

106
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,560
will be mainly based on Sida.

107
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,360
I don't think it's a good idea.

108
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,840
After all, Sida and Zihao

109
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,160
are both artists of the company.

110
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,480
If it gets out like this, it won't sound good.

111
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
Sida is on the rise now,

112
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,680
I don't want some negative reports

113
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,760
that

114
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,480
Sida is competing with Zihao for the throne.

115
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,160
Sida's acting skills and hard work

116
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,440
are obvious to all.

117
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,880
Right?

118
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,040
If you don't have the ability,

119
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,000
you're afraid of being gossiped about.

120
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,960
Don't you trust

121
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,880
the artists in your company?

122
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,840
Of course I trust my artist.

123
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,040
But recently,

124
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,840
I accepted Mr. Lu's suggestion,

125
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,920
Look,

126
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,760
I think I can handle

127
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,360
this kind of pressure,

128
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,400
After all, a rising artist,

129
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,480
how can there be

130
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,320
no negative impact?

131
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,560
I don't want to lose this chance

132
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,520
because of this,

133
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,000
I think I can do it, Mr. Lu.

134
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,200
Wait a minute.

135
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Let's discuss it again.

136
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,440
I know.

137
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,520
Song Zihao

138
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,400
used to be your artist.

139
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,440
You're worried

140
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,520
that I'll hurt his interests.

141
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,640
But I hope,

142
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,039
you can also look at this matter

143
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,080
from a rational point of view.

144
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,360
After all, now,

145
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
I'm your artist.

146
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,640
Not Song Zihao, right?

147
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,960
All right, all right.

148
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,520
It's settled then.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,800
As for the follow-up promotion,

150
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll finalize it with you.

151
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,360
By the way,

152
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,600
Sida, come on,

153
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,800
Young man is ambitious.

154
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,080
I think highly of you.

155
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,440
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,600
All right, let's go. No need to see me off.

157
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,600
Goodbye, Mr. Lu.

158
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,760
Take care, Mr. Lu.

159
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,000
Goodbye, Mr. Lu.

160
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,200
I'm sorry,

161
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
but in front of Mr. Lu just now,

162
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,560
I was too direct.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,160
I didn't listen to your arrangement.

164
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,320
But I really

165
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,440
want to seize this opportunity.

166
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,600
Sit down

167
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm the one who should apologize.

168
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,560
As your agent,

169
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,480
I should

170
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,560
stand in your shoes,

171
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,320
For your sake.

172
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,080
Instead of being emotional.

173
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,800
It's not fair to you.

174
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,440
In fact, I am very happy in my heart,

175
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,320
through this matter,

176
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,440
I've seen your transformation and growth,

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,240
and you've become decisive.

178
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,680
You know what you want.

179
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,360
In this new

180
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,160
entertainment industry,

181
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,400
if an artist is ambitious,

182
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,720
That's why we can go further.

183
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,480
If you don't fight for it,

184
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,680
the chance won't

185
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,640
fall on you.

186
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,320
I just want to grow up quickly,

187
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,760
I just want to share

188
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,160
more things for you,

189
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,360
I want to prove myself with my actions.

190
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,680
I'm no longer the younger brother

191
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,160
who needs to be taken care of by you.

192
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,760
I will become

193
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,200
a man worthy of your dependence.

194
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,880
Trust my sister.

195
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,240
Okay,

196
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,680
I'll be waiting

197
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,320
for the day when you get on the podium.

198
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,240
What do you think?

199
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,640
Did Ruonan scold you?

200
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,680
No.

201
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,400
I just talked about

202
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,560
something at work,

203
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,120
What's wrong?

204
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,600
In the meeting room just now,

205
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,720
it was so awkward.

206
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,640
I was worried about you guys. Wait a minute.

207
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,440
Will you have a fight?

208
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,200
It's good that you don't have one.

209
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,960
You scared me.

210
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,720
Is my relationship with Ruonan

211
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,760
that fragile?

212
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
But I don't understand.

213
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,400
Why are you questioning Ruonan?

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,680
Qiansha,

215
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,320
do you think I'm wrong?

216
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,400
I think both of you are right.

217
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,040
But this seems

218
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
to be the first time you've contradicted her, right?

219
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,400
Why on earth?

220
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
Because I want to be popular,

221
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,400
I want to be a first-line actor,

222
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,360
I want to succeed quickly.

223
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,880
This idea,

224
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,000
it seems,

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
has never been so strong

226
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,200
as Sida?

227
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,160
I feel like

228
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,120
you're a different person.

229
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,800
What's wrong with you?

230
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,400
Did you?

231
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,680
I just suddenly hate

232
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,800
who I used to be,

233
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,840
Don't fight for anything, don't fight for anything,

234
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,440
don't want anything.

235
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,680
Not strong enough.

236
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,000
That's why I failed.

237
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,360
Only those around her will get hurt because of me,

238
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,520
and she will be wronged because of me.

239
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,960
But there's nothing

240
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,040
I can do.

241
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
You're so cowardly.

242
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,320
So from now on,

243
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,720
I want everything.

244
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,680
I don't want to leave any regrets.

245
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,640
Whether it's a relationship

246
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,840
or a career,

247
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,640
do you mean Ruonan?

248
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,760
Yes

249
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,560
I don't want to be

250
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,600
the younger brother anymore,

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,960
I want to be

252
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,000
a man worthy of Dugu Ruonan,

253
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,160
I want to protect her.

254
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,560
I won't let her

255
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,680
get hurt at all,

256
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,480
For this reason, I can give up on everyone.

257
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,840
Including me?

258
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,040
That's right.

259
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,560
You know what?

260
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,560
Dr. Ai from Psychiatry,

261
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,640
seems to have broken up with

262
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,560
his supermodel girlfriend.

263
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,640
Isn't that a matter of course?

264
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,960
He's a supermodel. What kind of man

265
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,120
have you never seen before?

266
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,840
I'm sure he's just playing with Dr. Ai,

267
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,480
so he'll get another one when he's done.

268
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,160
I was wondering why Dr. Ai

269
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,040
has been so haggard lately?

270
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,080
You think he finally got it?

271
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,720
And now he's dumped.

272
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,000
Will it leave a psychological shadow?

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,720
Of course.

274
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,360
-Hello, Dr. Ai. -Hello, Dr.

275
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
Ai.

276
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,560
Please sign it.

277
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,160
Hello, mom.

278
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm working.

279
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,920
I'll call you back later.

280
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,640
Wait, wait, wait.

281
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,760
Your dad and I went to see

282
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,240
an old classmate two days ago,

283
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,080
Her daughter is 23 years old,

284
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,760
and she has a handsome face,

285
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,880
She's gentle and virtuous,

286
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,960
and she has a good job,

287
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,480
As for your personal problem,

288
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,560
haven't you solved it yet?

289
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,760
Do you want to get to know him?

290
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,800
Mom, I don't want to go on blind dates anymore.

291
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,160
Think of it as a friend.

292
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,560
I left the phone number to him.

293
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,320
Get in touch with her.

294
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,440
All right.

295
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,360
Ali must be out of his mind

296
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,880
at this moment.

297
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,840
I don't think about tea and rice,

298
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,240
and I'm out of my mind.

299
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,640
I don't think he's in the mood

300
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,200
to work these days.

301
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,800
Although I, Chen Fei'er,

302
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,240
won't turn around.

303
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,400
But you can't look at him.

304
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,640
Give up on yourself, right?

305
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,680
Just let me show up nicely.

306
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,840
Save his hopeless life.

307
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,240
Dr. Ai.

308
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,240
Excuse me,

309
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,920
hello,

310
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Where's Dr. Ai?

311
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,280
Dr. Ai is not here today.

312
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,160
Sure enough,

313
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,720
isn't he on duty today?

314
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,800
He asked for leave today.

315
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,320
I think she went on a blind date.

316
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,160
What?

317
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,440
A blind date?

318
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,240
It seems awkward.

319
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
Let me introduce myself first.

320
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,280
My name is Lin Jia.

321
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
I'm 26 years old.

322
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,320
Where's my mom?

323
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,560
It's because it's convenient

324
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,480
to introduce me to a boyfriend,

325
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,200
So she deliberately underreported me

326
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,320
for three years.

327
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,840
As for the rest,

328
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,160
I believe my mom and your mom

329
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,400
have already talked about it, right?

330
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,080
I told you.

331
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,920
That's good.

332
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,720
I feel good about you.

333
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,760
I think it's quite pleasing to the eye.

334
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,440
I think we can

335
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,640
get to know each other.

336
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,400
And then

337
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,720
… Yes, I'm sorry,

338
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,880
I have to apologize to you.

339
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,600
This blind date,

340
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,880
it wasn't my intention.

341
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,760
I don't want you to misunderstand.

342
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,920
Then I'll waste your time.

343
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,400
Don't think too much.

344
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,800
I think my first impression of you

345
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,200
is very good,

346
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,120
I think you are also very good.

347
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,000
It's just that

348
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,960
I just recently got out of a relationship,

349
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,880
I want to stay single for a while.

350
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,280
Be alone for a while.

351
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,359
I think I'm quite straightforward.

352
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,760
But I didn't expect you

353
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,160
to be more direct than me.

354
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm curious.

355
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,960
Tell me,

356
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,480
you don't want to start

357
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,800
a new relationship.

358
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,920
That means,

359
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,960
you haven't let go of your ex-girlfriend.

360
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,920
If you can't let it go, you have to let it go.

361
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,800
Because from beginning to end,

362
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,520
it was all my wishful thinking

363
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,480
and she didn't have

364
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,840
that idea

365
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,720
for me at all,

366
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,200
Who told you that I'm not good at you?

367
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,520
I don't have

368
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,400
that kind of feelings for you.

369
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,920
Why are you here?

370
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,920
Why can't I come?

371
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,680
If I didn't come to rescue you,

372
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,760
how did you get abducted?

373
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,360
I don't even know.

374
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,120
Ex-girlfriend?

375
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,320
I'm not his ex-girlfriend.

376
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,760
I haven't officially

377
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,560
broken up with him.

378
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:53,840
You.

379
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,400
Now it's a third party,

380
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,960
you know?

381
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,040
Chen Fei'er, stop messing around, okay?

382
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,600
You never saw that

383
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,920
I was a third party.

384
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,120
I see it now.

385
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,240
Can you be reasonable?

386
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,360
No matter how unreasonable I am,

387
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
I'm better than someone

388
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,680
thinking about someone else's boyfriend,

389
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
Chen Fei'er,

390
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,000
you have bad eyes,

391
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,040
If you don't know the goods,

392
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,520
don't blame others for picking them up

393
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,480
and taking them back as treasures.

394
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Only when others rob you of food,

395
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,840
do you know how to protect food.

396
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,880
Your behavior

397
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,600
belongs to the habit of dogs,

398
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
What is a dog?

399
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,440
Dogs,

400
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,160
Who are you scolding?

401
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,720
Chen Fei'er,

402
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,680
stop it.

403
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,360
Come out! Come out!

404
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,600
-She scolded me. -Stop it,

405
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,560
okay?

406
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,320
Really,

407
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,360
Chen Fei'er,

408
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,480
How long are you going to make a scene?

409
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,280
If you don't help me,

410
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,760
you'll still be mad at me.

411
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,800
Chen Fei'er, we have nothing to do

412
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,560
with each other now.

413
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,360
I have no reason to tolerate you.

414
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,320
I'll bear with you any longer.

415
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,200
Please don't disturb

416
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,000
my life anymore, okay?

417
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,880
Don't be stubborn.

418
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,680
It won't do you any good

419
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,640
to try to be brave at this time.

420
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,800
if

421
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,680
If I want to apologize,

422
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,400
maybe I'll accept you

423
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,240
as soon as I'm soft-hearted.

424
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,360
Chen Fei'er,

425
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,480
I'm not messing with you.

426
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,840
I'm not playing games

427
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,920
with you. I'm serious.

428
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,120
Chen Fei'er,

429
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,280
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

430
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,200
The two of us are

431
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,160
two parallel lines,

432
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,160
If we have an intersection,

433
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,480
it's just an arithmetic error.

434
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,800
I think it's good now.

435
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,200
We're back

436
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,120
on track.

437
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,080
I'm starting

438
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,440
to return to my own life.

439
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,760
After you and I, Chen Fei'er,

440
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,080
fell in love,

441
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,520
How can you forget everything you want?

442
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,520
Chen Fei'er,

443
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,000
could you please wake up?

444
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,760
The one sitting inside

445
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,800
is my blind date,

446
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,760
I'm very satisfied with her.

447
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,040
I'm ready

448
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,760
to forget you.

449
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,680
Ali, stop!

450
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,640
Ali,

451
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,680
I know you still like me.

452
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,960
If you take back

453
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
what you just said,

454
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,480
I'll take back my decision to break up.

455
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,320
We don't owe each other anything.

456
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,040
Start over.

457
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,960
I'm telling you,

458
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,680
this is your last chance.

459
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,040
I won't come to you again.

460
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm telling the truth.

461
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,560
I knew it.

462
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,960
You still care about me.

463
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,680
Chen Fei'er, you're wrong.

464
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,200
I don't care about you anymore.

465
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,360
Because my care is of

466
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,640
no value to you.

467
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,360
I don't need you to pity me,

468
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,640
and give me another chance.

469
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,200
Because I don't want to be

470
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,120
your sidekick anymore.

471
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,480
I don't want to be your driver anymore.

472
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,960
I don't want to be on call anymore.

473
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,440
I don't want to worry about you anymore.

474
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,360
Chen Fei'er,

475
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,320
it's officially over.

476
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,440
Okay.

477
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,960
It's over when it's over.

478
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,720
Don't regret it.

479
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,320
I'm sorry. I should

480
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,080
apologize to you

481
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,920
on her behalf.

482
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,480
Is she a tiger?

483
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,080
Just kidding.

484
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,920
He has a bad temper,

485
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,800
But I can tell that

486
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,000
she likes you a lot.

487
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,880
She likes me.

488
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,520
That's because she had a whim.

489
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,160
We are from

490
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,640
two different worlds.

491
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,520
If we're together,

492
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,280
we'll only make each other feel awkward.

493
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Just like today.

494
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,800
My play just now,

495
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,120
isn't it a bit too much?

496
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,480
I feel

497
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,440
a little embarrassed.

498
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,800
No,

499
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,480
I didn't say you were in a mess just now,

500
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,240
I'm trying to explain.

501
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,000
But you're pretty good.

502
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,960
Few girls

503
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,880
can defeat her.

504
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,000
Really?

505
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,760
One thing I don't quite understand,

506
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,120
the first time we met,

507
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,200
Why are you helping me?

508
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,320
I believe in intuition.

509
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,560
When I first saw you,

510
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,520
I thought we hit it off.

511
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,520
I think you are very sincere.

512
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,040
He attaches great importance to friendship.

513
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,080
And a little cute.

514
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,040
It's okay.

515
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,040
If you can't be with your ex-girlfriend,

516
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,040
then the old ones won't go

517
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,880
and the new ones won't come.

518
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Try it with me.

519
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,200
I'm pretty good, too.

520
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,080
You were quite gentle and virtuous just now.

521
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,960
Now.

522
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,520
I really can't pretend anymore.

523
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,600
You're too honest.

524
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,280
Beat me back to my original form at once.

525
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,240
Do you have anything to do tonight?

526
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,440
Why don't we go disco dancing?

527
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,680
I can't jump anymore.

528
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,920
Stop jumping.

529
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,480
You … Are you Chen Fei'er, who is very popular

530
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,320
recently?

531
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,800
Yes, it's me.

532
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,600
-Hello. -Hello.

533
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,640
My name is Ali.

534
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,400
I …

535
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,400
Ali, I saw your commercial,

536
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,600
I didn't expect you

537
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,320
to be prettier in person than in the photo.

538
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,040
Fei'er,

539
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,120
I'm really, really,

540
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
I like you very much.

541
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,680
You have to believe that

542
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,720
no matter what the problem is,

543
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,280
You can handle it, okay?

544
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,520
I don't care about your past.

545
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,720
I love you.

546
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
I will also love your past

547
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,160
and I will always be by your side.

548
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,920
Even if everyone

549
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,960
doesn't like you.

550
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,160
I'll still like you.

551
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,680
Xiaoxiao,

552
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,920
Xiaoxiao

553
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:55,840
Brother,

554
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,400
Why are you here?

555
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,320
Look at your face.

556
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,160
I'm fine.

557
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,480
I'm really fine.

558
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,600
Ji Mo

559
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,480
made you sad again.

560
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,440
He's been with me lately.

561
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,400
He doesn't reject me

562
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,360
as much as he used to.

563
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,320
Although,

564
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,400
they're just friends.

565
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,760
I think he's here.

566
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,480
My heart is not here.

567
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,520
Don't think too much.

568
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,520
Keep him here first.

569
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,880
Keep your heart.

570
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,280
No problem.

571
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,280
I still have feelings for you.

572
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,480
It hurts, too.

573
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,280
I don't know.

574
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,360
How long can I be blind and willful?

575
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,640
Well,

576
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,400
Xiaoxiao,

577
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,800
Xiaoxiao.

578
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:43,920
Get off.

579
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:44,960
I'm not going.

580
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,200
Doctor,

581
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,280
how is it?

582
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,160
Don't be too nervous.

583
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,080
Even if it recurs,

584
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,120
it's dangerous.

585
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,640
But fortunately, the spread is not serious.

586
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,840
As long as it can cooperate with the treatment,

587
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
it can still be suppressed.

588
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,160
Like I said,

589
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,040
it's not serious.

590
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,000
Don't think it's not serious.

591
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,760
Despise,

592
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,080
you must pay attention to,

593
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,720
Don't have too much mood swings.

594
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,760
Otherwise, the deterioration will be accelerated.

595
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,240
Doctor,

596
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,520
we'll cooperate with the treatment.

597
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,680
We're in the hospital.

598
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,840
What are you doing?

599
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,360
What else can I do

600
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,040
to cure the disease?

601
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,600
From now on,

602
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,240
you should stay in the hospital and get treated.

603
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,120
I'll send someone to take care of you.

604
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Are you sending someone to take care of me,

605
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,840
or are you sending someone to spy on me?

606
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,920
Whatever you think.

607
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,640
Anyway, there's no room

608
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,320
for negotiation this time,

609
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,720
Doctor,

610
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,440
get a hospital bill.

611
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,120
Okay.

612
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,120
Do you know

613
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,520
about Su Xiao's relapse?

614
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,880
You got it.

615
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,200
Did you ask her to hide it from me?

616
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,720
She didn't tell you,

617
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
because she didn't want you to be in pain,

618
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,120
She doesn't want to be treated

619
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,960
as a patient anymore,

620
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,640
But she's a patient now.

621
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
What the patient needs most now

622
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,680
is treatment,

623
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,760
We can't waste a second.

624
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,800
Do you know that?

625
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,200
So I've been taking care of her.

626
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,160
I've tried my best to find her.

627
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
The best doctor.

628
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,760
So?

629
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,840
Are you making up for it?

630
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,120
If it weren't for you,

631
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,360
Su Xiao wouldn't have lost control of her emotions,

632
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,520
And it won't recur.

633
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,280
Do you know that?

634
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
If it's my responsibility,

635
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,120
I won't shirk it,

636
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,000
But have you ever thought that

637
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,400
Su Xiao can become like this.

638
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
You're also responsible.

639
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,440
In this world,

640
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,120
no one

641
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,600
cares more about Su Xiao than I do.

642
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,120
Don't hurt her again.

643
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,200
I'm begging you.

644
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,680
Mr. Zhao,

645
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,760
where have you been hiding these days?

646
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,280
I called you more than 800 times,

647
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,800
but you finally called me back today.

648
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,200
Let me tell you,

649
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,560
how is Yi Fashion doing?

650
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,000
Okay.

651
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,160
Very good.

652
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,080
Isn't that your rule?

653
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,120
It's up to your sister.

654
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,720
I'm determined to cooperate.

655
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,240
But your sister doesn't care,

656
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,760
she only has Ji Mo in her eyes,

657
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,080
It's fine now.

658
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,680
Ji Mo is back.

659
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,480
And your sister helped me out.

660
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,440
How audacious of you

661
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,320
to come and check my account.

662
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,640
Mr. Zhao,

663
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,560
We two

664
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,920
But we're in the same boat,

665
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,920
when the accounts are cleared up,

666
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,760
I'm sure it's over.

667
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,040
You won't feel any better.

668
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,320
Don't worry.

669
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,320
I've changed my mind.

670
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
From now on,

671
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,920
the rules of the game,

672
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,240
It's up to me.

673
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,120
Mr. Zhao,

674
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,840
it should have been like this a long time ago.

675
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,520
I will cooperate with you no matter what you say.

676
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm going to ruin

677
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,720
Ji Mo's reputation,

678
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,440
There will never be a turning point.

679
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,640
Change this place.

680
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,440
Okay,

681
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,720
contact a few media outlets for me.

682
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,040
Arrange interviews and publicity

683
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,920
for Song Zihao,

684
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,840
Based on Song Zihao's current reputation,

685
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,080
do you still want to promote him?

686
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,200
Sorry, it can't be operated.

687
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,640
And now all the resources

688
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,440
of the company,

689
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,440
It's all on Sida.

690
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
I don't have any extra energy.

691
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,280
I arranged several big variety shows

692
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,320
for Zihao,

693
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,080
This is his plan for the near future.

694
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,240
As long as he's an artist in the company,

695
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,880
for one day,

696
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,400
We must cooperate with his propaganda.

697
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,080
Tong Tong,

698
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,560
are you too impatient?

699
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,320
There are so many negative news

700
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,080
about Song Zihao.

701
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,800
Why did you let him be on a variety show?

702
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,400
Do you want to

703
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,560
push him to the forefront?

704
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,400
Or what?

705
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,680
Are you waiting to die?

706
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Wait until you can't push it out,

707
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,600
right?

708
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,840
Your department is interesting.

709
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,840
When Song Zihao was on fire,

710
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,240
he followed me one by one.

711
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
I have to arrange work for him.

712
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,720
What's going on now?

713
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,160
Are you trying to steer in the wind?

714
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,960
You went to curry favor with Sida, didn't you?

715
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,760
I'm telling you, the wind and water in the entertainment industry

716
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,800
have always changed in turn,

717
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,480
When Song Zihao became popular,

718
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,080
Sida didn't know about it.

719
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,960
Where are you playing a walk-on?

720
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,040
Sida is on fire now,

721
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,760
who will know him in a few months'time?

722
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,160
And remember it.

723
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
I'm the Director of Brokerage

724
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,360
of this company,

725
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,720
You just don't want to do

726
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,200
the work I've arranged,

727
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,480
You have to cook for me, too.

728
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,680
No way.

729
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,760
Hey,

730
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,440
Now Song Zihao

731
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,880
is in such a big mood,

732
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,040
He's in such a bad state,

733
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,680
you don't care but you still want to

734
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,280
take jobs and make money everywhere,

735
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,640
Is human blood steamed bread delicious?

736
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,600
Can you eat it?

737
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,920
Little girl,

738
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,000
since when is it your turn to

739
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,600
teach me a lesson here?

740
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,760
You used to be just

741
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,520
my assistant,

742
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,240
Now I've got a promotion.

743
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,880
How dare you show off your power to me?

744
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,200
Unfortunately,

745
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,400
no matter how you scamper,

746
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,080
Sida just ignored you.

747
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,800
So what?

748
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,280
You still can't get

749
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,400
what you want,

750
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,440
how

751
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,600
You're quite angry.

752
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,680
Are you going to lose your temper?

753
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,040
But let me tell you,

754
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,360
you have a bad temper,

755
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,920
It's useless to me.

756
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,320
Let me give you some advice. Be practical

757
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,320
when you do things.

758
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,080
Otherwise, it will be a waste of time.

759
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,680
How dare you!

760
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,480
If you had been more practical,

761
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,880
you wouldn't have

762
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,800
come this far,

763
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,960
We haven't decided yet.

764
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,400
You're starting to make

765
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,480
sarcastic comments here, aren't you?

766
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,920
You don't need to share.

767
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,560
You've already lost.

768
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,080
Tong Tong, do you know

769
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,320
what your biggest problem is?

770
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,480
It's always someone else's fault.

771
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,120
You didn't do anything wrong.

772
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,120
Zihao used to be

773
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
a potential artist.

774
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,720
He has become what he is today.

775
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,200
It's all your responsibility.

776
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,400
Don't sell well

777
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,920
when you get a little cheap,

778
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,679
Let's wait and see.

779
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,480
Just wait and see.

780
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,719
Stare at me and stare at me

781
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,440
with such big eyes,

782
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,719
You're angry.

783
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,320
I'm so mad.

784
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,239
Don't be angry. Be angry

785
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,600
with someone like that,

786
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
It's a waste of energy.

787
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,960
She has a long face,

788
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,440
so don't be angry with her.

789
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,400
Yes,

790
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,239
but sister,

791
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,960
You were so handsome just now.

792
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,320
Qiansha, look.

793
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,920
If something like this happens,

794
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,800
how should we deal with it?

795
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,840
Song Zihao, why are you doing this?

796
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,600
Yes, right here.

797
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,080
Look,

798
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,320
Qiansha

799
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,320
Ruonan,

800
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,440
what's going on?

801
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,159
When Song Zihao recorded the reality show,

802
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,600
he ran away in front of everyone.

803
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,880
I feel like

804
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,120
he's like a demon now,

805
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,800
No one can stop him.

806
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,560
It's impossible.

807
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,920
Zihao usually pays the most attention to image,

808
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,920
even if he is a little willful,

809
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,600
But I also lost my temper

810
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,400
in private,

811
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,760
I don't know either.

812
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,120
I used to think

813
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,200
he was unstable,

814
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,800
But this time it's too exaggerated.

815
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,440
I have a bad feeling.

816
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,080
Song Zihao,

817
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,400
do you still think

818
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,880
you're the hottest celebrity?

819
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,640
Stop it. Stop it.

820
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,720
Stop it.

821
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,000
It won't happen.

822
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,480
I won't.

823
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,480
I'm a big star. Song Zihao

824
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,080
won't.

825
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,680
It's not like they don't like me.

826
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,880
It's not like you don't like me.

827
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
They won't.

828
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:39,960
Hey,

829
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,320
Hello, Zihao.

830
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,800
Where are you?

831
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,120
I'm at home.

832
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,280
Why does your voice

833
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,200
sound weird?

834
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,360
Hey, talk to me.

835
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,880
Sis,

836
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,440
The best decision

837
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,560
I've ever made in my life.

838
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,640
I can be your artist.

839
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,960
How's it going, sister?

840
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,600
Song Zihao, open the door.

841
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,720
This is Shen Qiansha,

842
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,520
I have the password.

843
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,480
Song Zihao,

844
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,840
Song Zihao, open the door,

845
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,960
I'm Shen Qiansha.

846
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,760
Open the door.

847
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,080
Get out of the way!

848
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,680
Sister, be careful.

849
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,160
Song Zihao,

850
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,120
Song Zihao,

851
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,920
Call an ambulance.

852
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,560
Zihao,

853
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,600
Zihao,

854
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,320
Zihao,

855
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,280
Zihao

856
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,480
Sis,

857
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,360
I'm so scared.

858
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,960
I'm so scared.

859
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,280
Don't be afraid.

860
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,560
The patient is now

861
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,280
out of danger.

862
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,040
After the anesthetic is over,

863
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,040
he'll wake up.

864
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,000
But for his condition,

865
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,560
we still need to continue to observe it.

866
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,800
By the way,

867
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,680
has he been taking medicine on time lately?

868
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,480
Take medicine?

869
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,760
What medicine does he take?

870
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,600
Aren't you his family?

871
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,960
The patient is suffering

872
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,080
from severe depression.

873
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,080
You have to take

874
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,920
antidepressants on time,

875
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,120
Severe depression?

876
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,840
Are you sure?

877
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,640
Didn't the family members

878
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,800
who came last time tell you?

879
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,600
The psychiatrist

880
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,960
has already told me,

881
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,040
If his illness

882
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,440
is not

883
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,720
controlled by this drug,

884
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,480
Or if he is stimulated,

885
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
he will most likely

886
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,400
do something extreme.

887
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,800
I heard that he was still

888
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,520
recording the show the day before,

889
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,640
How do you take care of the patients?

890
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,680
I should have guessed it.

891
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,480
I can't believe

892
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,400
I didn't see it at all.

893
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,640
If I had stopped him earlier,

894
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,000
he wouldn't have been like this.

895
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,560
Stop blaming yourself. It's all my fault.

896
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,400
It's not your fault.

897
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,920
Why are you here?

898
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,040
Song Zihao is my artist,

899
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,120
I don't want others

900
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,000
to disturb him.

901
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,160
Please leave now.

902
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,920
You know he's your artist?

903
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,520
Is this how you're responsible for him?

904
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,840
You knew that

905
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,880
he was sick.

906
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,400
And you let him run around,

907
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,320
doing publicity,

908
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,160
Do you think of him as a cash cow,

909
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,320
or a robot,

910
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,880
How could you use him like this?

911
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
Do you still have humanity?

912
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,840
Who are you to teach me a lesson?

913
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,800
You abandoned

914
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,840
Song Zihao first,

915
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,360
Now he's my artist.

916
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,120
What should I do?

917
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,240
It's my own business.

918
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,280
Besides,

919
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,560
Song Zihao's illness is his business,

920
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,920
I didn't drive him crazy.

921
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,880
I'm telling you,

922
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,480
this slap,

923
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
It's for Song Zihao.

924
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,440
If anything happens to him,

925
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
I won't let you go.

926
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,760
Do you think it's useful for you

927
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,080
to say such harsh words to me now?

928
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,920
A loser like him,

929
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,840
how can he be of use to me?

930
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,000
You're really here to ask for a beating.

931
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,600
You can go back now.

932
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,000
You're awake.

933
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,080
Sis,

934
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,240
Ruonan,

935
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,200
help me up.

936
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,760
Okay.

937
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:24,840
Sis,
