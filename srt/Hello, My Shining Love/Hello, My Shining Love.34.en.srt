1
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,480
Hello, everyone.

2
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,560
I embrace the future.

3
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,960
Sida

4
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,440
Sister, you're here.

5
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560
You are so energetic.

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,520
Brother, you're here too.

7
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,800
What about

8
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,640
Are you nervous?

9
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,400
Don't be nervous.

10
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,800
I heard there are many people here today.

11
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,320
Song Zihao's fans.

12
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,759
If they know

13
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,800
If Zihao didn't come,

14
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,000
I will definitely take it out on you.

15
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,280
Are you ready?

16
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,600
to be ready

17
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,680
No problem, sis.

18
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,560
Don't worry.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,680
Besides, with you,

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm more confident to face it.

21
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,960
strange

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
I think this kid

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,840
Why are you growing up all of a sudden?

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,240
Of course, I can't...

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,680
Like a child.

26
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,160
I want to be mature.

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,360
So that I can be worthy of her.

28
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,560
To be worthy of my artist.

29
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,520
Alright then.

30
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,200
We will wait for you in the front.

31
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,000
See you later.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,520
Come on

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,440
Wait, wait.

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,120
Hair, hair.

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,880
All right.

36
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,480
Sida

37
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,040
Come on. Try this on.

38
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
It's too late.

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,000
every time

40
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,680
It's so close.

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,000
You know,

42
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,400
Am I always

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,560
Can't catch up with her?

44
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,960
When are you willing to

45
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,920
Look back.

46
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,400
Are chasing your men.

47
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,760
Distinguished guests and friends,

48
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,840
Good morning, everyone.

49
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,560
First of all, welcome to

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,440
TV series embrace the future of you.

51
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,480
The premiere press conference.

52
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,760
I'm only here to represent

53
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,440

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,840
To express my heartfelt thanks.

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,040
And a warm welcome.

57
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,160
Then the next time,

58
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,040
Let's use the warmest applause.

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,880
Please embrace the future.

60
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,040
The main character.

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,000
Please welcome

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,520
They are

63
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,320
The producer of the show

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,280
Mr. Lu Jia,

65
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,079
Welcome.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
The director of this drama, Mr. Hou Zhen,

67
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,880
Welcome.

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,440
The heroine Jia

69
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,240
welcome

70
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,080
And the new actor Si Da.

72
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,560
Let all the guests

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,920
The warmest applause

74
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,040
To our chief creators.

75
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,960
Where is Song Zihao?

76
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,680
Why did Song Zihao

77
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,720
Didn't attend the scene.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,760
Right. Why isn't Song Zihao here?

79
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,040
I'm also here

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,360
Explain it simply.

81
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,400
The hero of this drama, Song Zihao.

82
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,960
Because I'm not feeling well.

83
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,000
I didn't come here

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,240
At the press conference.

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,400
But the No.2 of this drama

86
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,720
That's Song Zihao.

87
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,840
He's a fellow disciple.

88
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,760
Sida

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,560
Has arrived.

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,680
The scene of our press conference.

91
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,440
What the hell?

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,240
Song Zihao is not coming.

93
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

94
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,720
That's right. Why didn't you tell me earlier?

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Why?

96
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,800
Why didn't you inform us earlier?

97
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
Fans, don't worry.

98
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,760
Let Star say something.

99
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,880
Thank you

100
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,800
Hello, everyone. I'm Sida.

101
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,520
Where is Zihao?

102
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Because of my health,

103
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,880
So I didn't come to the scene.

104
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,560
I believe he also wants

105
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,960
To see all the friends at the scene.

106
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,280
Of course, if everyone

107
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,240
And support him,

108
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,280
I hope that

109
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,400
More publicity.

110
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,760
He must be able to feel

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,680
It's here.

112
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,760
And I'm here for Zihao.

113
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,600
Thank you.

114
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,240
Thank you

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,160
And thank you, Sida.

116
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,600
Let's give it to Zihao.

117
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,480
It's for Star.

118
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,720
And to all of us.

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
The creative team

120
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,560
Thank you

121
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,040
This speech

122
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,600
Did you prepare it for him?

123
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,640
No

124
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,440
This little thing

125
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,680
You don't need me to prepare.

126
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,160
He has really grown up.

127
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
It seems that my previous worries

128
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,920
Is unnecessary.

129
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
He's already

130
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,960
Qualified artists.

131
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,840
For such a long time.

132
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,040
It finally paid off.

133
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,680
You are also important.

134
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,200
Without your efforts,

135
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,920
He can't do that today.

136
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,680
Stand there.

137
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,880
Why didn't Song Zihao

138
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,760
At the scene.

139
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
Your artist

140
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,960
Whether he follows professional ethics.

141
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
For their actions.

142
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,760
With strict constraints?

143
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,720
Please answer it.

144
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,840
Zihao and I are

145
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
The same company.

146
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,880
How dedicated he is.

147
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,680
I believe that everyone

148
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,640
It's obvious that

149
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,120
He is really

150
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,880
It's because of your health.

151
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,760
So I didn't come.

152
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
At the press conference.

153
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,480
Since everyone is like this,

154
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
To support Zihao.

155
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,040
How about we support each other?

156
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,840
Our new drama.

157
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,960
Your first performance

158
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,880
As the second male.

159
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,960
As a new actor,

160
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,760
Do you think

161
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,480
This is so lucky.

162
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Did you violate the industry ethics?

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,760
covert activities

164
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,600
Camera obscura

165
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,080
If there is a hidden camera,

166
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,400
Shouldn't I be the male lead?

167
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,960
Miss Dugu is in the circle.

168
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,840
Is a famous snark agent.

169
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,360
And worked with Song Zihao for many years.

170
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,240
But I still want to cancel the contract.

171
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,640
that

172
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,920
In this cooperation,

173
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,600
Will you encounter the same problem?

174
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,360
These are all

175
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,280
A misunderstanding of her.

176
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
If you are not only my bole,

177
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,840
Is also Zihao's music.

178
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,960
I believe

179
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,240
She will be understood.

180
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,920
Today,

181
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,640
I want to be here with her.

182
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,280
In one photo.

183
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,360
To prove our relationship.

184
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,840
It's not like the rumors.

185
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,720
That's bad.

186
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,240
He wants to

187
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,520
Invited me to the interview.

188
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,480
Go.

189
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,080
What about you?

190
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,640
I will always stand behind you.

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,200
This is my gold manager.

192
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,000
How can a group photo be taken without me?

193
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,120
I'm his gold-medal assistant.

194
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,760
Yes, you are also a great hero.

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Of course.

196
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,360
Zimmer

197
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,440
I'll wait for you at the observation deck of the hotel.

198
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,000
I have something to tell you.

199
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,120
Can you come over?

200
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,960
Si Da, you're next.

201
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,880
Any other plans?

202
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,159
I'll listen to my agent.

203
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,240
Of course, we will help him.

204
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,159
There's a lot of planning.

205
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,600
This is just a start.

206
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,920
If you don't show up,

207
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,600
I will always be here waiting for you.

208
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,200
But Star's current intention

209
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,040
He wants to be a good actor.

210
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
I hope you can

211
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,120
Give him more chances.

212
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,720
To report more good news.

213
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,520
Thank you

214
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,040
Take care of our newlyweds.

215
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,720
Thank you

216
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,440
You're here.

217
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,480
I'm here this time.

218
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,440
To tell you that

219
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,960
Let's not meet in private anymore.

220
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,280
Stop doing meaningless things.

221
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,880
If there's another time,

222
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,360
I will never come again.

223
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,040
The industry cares about

224
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,120
You and Yi Fashion President

225
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,320
Mr. Zimmer's relationship

226
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,200
I want to know whether you

227
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,280
Working together?

228
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,520
When were you together?

229
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,240
This is not the point today.

230
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,200
I want to take the space

231
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,400
Leave it to the main producer.

232
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,960
Sida, actually,

233
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,720
All the way here,

234
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,600
It's very hard.

235
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,360
Including the role.

236
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,800
Of course, everyone will say

237
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,720
He worked so hard.

238
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,040
But he really suffered.

239
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,080
Most people have no way.

240
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Under the pressure.

241
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,280
You can interview him.

242
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,560
And maybe this scene

243
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,480
He will outshine the male lead.

244
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,120
I'm kidding.

245
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,840
I believe that

246
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,840
Not only

247
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
My efforts alone

248
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,480
And my assistant, Qian Sha.

249
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,600
And help me a lot.

250
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,000
In this drama,

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,920
My efforts

252
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,240
I believe in hope.

253
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,720
In the drama.

254
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,400
Thank you.

255
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,960
You were right.

256
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm not

257
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,520
The previous Su Xiao.

258
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,960
Now, Su Xiao

259
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,040
Not only is a part of his body missing,

260
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,080
A piece of my heart is missing.

261
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,440
Su Xiao, don't be like this.

262
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,400
I wanted to die.

263
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,600
I can't accept myself like this.

264
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,000
But in my mind,

265
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,000
You always appear.

266
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,960
You make me want to die.

267
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,800
You know what, Zimmer?

268
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,440
You are my courage to live.

269
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,960
I hate myself too.

270
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,840
but

271
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,320
If so,

272
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,960
To let you look at me again.

273
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,680
I have the courage to live.

274
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,280
strange

275
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,320
You said you would wait for me.

276
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,200
Where are you going?

277
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,280
Please have a look here. Thank you.

278
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,240
That's great.

279
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,480
Star, can you look over here?

280
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,280
Thank you

281
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,400
Please have a look here. Thank you.

282
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,040
Mr. Zhao.

283
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,640
We must

284
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Are you so sharp?

285
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,040
How could it be?

286
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,960
I'm not interested in

287
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,440
I've always been very enthusiastic.

288
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,800
Are you looking for Zimmer?

289
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,720
He's with Su Xiao.

290
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,360
At the observation deck upstairs.

291
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,240
Star, please look at the camera.

292
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,760
Thank you

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,680
impossible

294
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,000
The relationship.

295
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,080
Nothing is impossible.

296
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,800
Take a look, Star.

297
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,400
Thank you

298
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,160
Haven't you lost

299
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,920
The power to live.

300
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,920
You're just sick.

301
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,280
What's wrong with you?

302
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,160
You need treatment.

303
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,320
During the three years since you left,

304
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,240
I was sick.

305
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,720
I'm not willing to change.

306
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,000
Stuck in the past.

307
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,080
I can't get out.

308
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,040
Until I met Ruonan.

309
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,000
It was Ruonan who saved me and made me recover.

310
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,000
Do you think I'm fine now?

311
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,120
So you can do the same, Su Xiao.

312
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,400
You can also go back

313
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,600
Pull out of the pain.

314
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,680
I can't.

315
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,280
I can't get out alone.

316
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,400
If you don't believe it, if you try,

317
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,920
How do you know you can't?

318
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,880
Suxiao

319
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,720
I believe you can do it.

320
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,280
Your life

321
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,080
You can start all over again.

322
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,400
You can recover.

323
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,520
Zimmer

324
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,400
I can't get out alone.

325
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,200
I don't know how to let myself go.

326
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,160
Zimmer, can you help me?

327
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,920
You can help me.

328
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,200
Who came out?

329
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,840
You want me to get better.

330
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,680
right or wrong?

331
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,000
Su Xiao, calm down.

332
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,760
Suxiao

333
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Two stupid women.

334
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,160
You really have no taste.

335
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,160
I was the one

336
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,480
The best choice.

337
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,520
I should go back.

338
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,160
If the man is waiting for me,

339
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,200
Do you really care about her?

340
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,480
For her.

341
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,160
Can't stay with me for a while.

342
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,400
that's right

343
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,520
I really care about her.

344
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,120
I'm afraid she's been waiting for a long time.

345
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,840
She will be sad.

346
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,440
Will be disappointed.

347
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,200
Suxiao

348
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,520
Suxiao

349
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,160
Suxiao

350
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,040
Suxiao

351
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,120
He's here.

352
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,520
He's here.

353
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Why are you here?

354
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,240
What's up

355
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,800
What's wrong with you?

356
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,280
Is it Qi Mo again?

357
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
I knew it.

358
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,960
I'm here.

359
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,920
So you said,

360
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,680
He met Su Xiao privately.

361
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,840
And hugged Su Xiao.

362
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,480
He doesn't know where he is now.

363
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,960
I haven't contacted you.

364
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,040
Dugu is like a man.

365
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,040
Can you stop holding it in?

366
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,120
If you're unhappy,

367
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,760
You can scold them.

368
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,120
I will scold with you.

369
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,320
Then maybe all this

370
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,480
I misunderstood.

371
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,960
Actually, I should

372
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,480
Go to him directly.

373
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,600
It's good to ask.

374
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
Before the truth is out,

375
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,560
I don't even seem to be angry.

376
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,880
You have no confidence.

377
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,560
Do you think I'm stupid?

378
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,800
You're not stupid.

379
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,240
You just love him too much.

380
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,960
I hope he can live up to it.

381
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,880
Your trust

382
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,440
And then a little earlier.

383
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,280
To explain to you.

384
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,920
Don't be sad.

385
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,600
For a man?

386
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,000
Zimmer

387
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,960
Zimmer

388
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,960
Zimmer

389
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,200
All right.

390
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,560
I'm not leaving. Go to bed.

391
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,600
Lie down and sleep.

392
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,600
Lie down. Where are you going?

393
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,880
Where have you been?

394
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,360
Don't go.

395
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,360
Don't go.

396
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,360
Have a good sleep.

397
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,160
Zimmer

398
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,840
Where were you last night?

399
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,760
You didn't answer my calls.

400
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,040
That's why I want to ask you.

401
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,000
Yesterday at the press conference,

402
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,120
Frence leave

403
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,960
Disappear for a whole night.

404
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,560
Where have you been?

405
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,400
Su Xiao,

406
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,720
It's Su Xiao again.

407
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,280
Don't you think it's funny?

408
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,840
Su Xiao is stuck forever.

409
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,400
Between us,

410
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,080
She was dead.

411
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,720
We spent so much time

412
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,600
To be together.

413
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,280
Now she's alive.

414
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,040
Still exist between us.

415
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,840
I understand now.

416
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,200
It turns out that everything is true.

417
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,280
There's a first come first served.

418
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,240
Love is no exception.

419
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,840
It's probably between the two of you.

420
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,680
I'm the one

421
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,880
An unnecessary third party.

422
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,560
There has never been a third party.

423
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,840
You are the only one

424
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,960
If a man

425
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,680
Su Xiao and I

426
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,880
It's already over.

427
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,280
Did you really end it?

428
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,200
Enough.

429
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,160
If a man

430
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,920
Don't be like this, Ruuo.

431
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,760
If you're a man, let me explain.

432
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,920
From the beginning to the end,

433
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,680
It's all a misunderstanding.

434
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
I've heard too many explanations.

435
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,040
A misunderstanding.

436
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,520
Will only remind me of this relationship.

437
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,760
Is a mistake.

438
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,000
Since you can't make a decision,

439
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Then I'll do it.

440
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,520
We're done.

441
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,560
I disagree.

442
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I don't agree. Let's just

443
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,680
To break up hastily.

444
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,880
Break up.

445
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,600
There's no such thing as sloppy.

446
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
What are you doing?

447
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,800
I beg you.

448
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,000
Don't torture me, okay?

449
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,960
Please leave me alone.

450
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,240
Please let go.

451
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,120
And please move away.

452
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,400
Are you good at acting or not?

453
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,680
What's the plot?

454
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
What line?

455
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,160
Come on. Take a look.

456
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,600
If you are not satisfied,

457
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,640
I'll change it now.

458
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,960
I'm not satisfied anywhere.

459
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,560
How many times has it been?

460
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,600
If you don't change it with your heart,

461
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,440
How can you write well?

462
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,040
This script has only one word.

463
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,440
rotten

464
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,440
What's up

465
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,520
The director came at the right time.

466
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,400
Come on.

467
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,440
This new script

468
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,560
What is it? Tell me.

469
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,720
Zihao

470
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,720
Don't be so demanding.

471
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,800
Think about it.

472
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,040
You want such a high pay,

473
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
We don't have any money now.

474
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,480
Hire a good writer for you.

475
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,000
We need to invite

476
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,120
It's normal.

477
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,120
Come on, director.

478
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,880
Take a look.

479
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,240
The script is new.

480
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,160
I just had a car accident.

481
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,040
I was hit by a car. How far is it?

482
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,600
I didn't say anything when I got up.

483
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,360
Limping to confess to the heroine.

484
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,080
I'm playing Deadpool.

485
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,680
Am I invulnerable?

486
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,440
Come on, the next one.

487
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,480
Come here.

488
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
I'm still in a wheelchair.

489
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,440
Fighting with a second man.

490
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,560
I'm not that crazy.

491
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,080
How much I hate him? I...

492
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,000
Not the director.

493
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,240
Just tell me.

494
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,680
This stupid drama

495
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,360
You won't be scolded.

496
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,800
Zihao, look.

497
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,240
The audience now loves

498
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,760
Look at this infatuated Mr. Ba.

499
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,200
This is what the market needs.

500
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,320
The screenwriter has no choice.

501
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,640
Master Ba, you're a six pancake.

502
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,000
Do you think the audience

503
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,040
Is it 250?

504
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,480
At this level,

505
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,760
It doesn't matter if the play is not shot.

506
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,080
director

507
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,200
Miss Tong,

508
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,440
The public opinion is very bad for us now.

509
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,800
The reaction from the netizens was very fierce.

510
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,680
How many times have you dropped the hot search?

511
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,440
Can't be removed.

512
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,120
And almost all the netizens

513
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,440
Are supporting Star spontaneously.

514
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,280
Step on the throne.

515
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,880
I'm worried that

516
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,760
We'll issue a clarification press release.

517
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,720
It's too late.

518
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,160
Spontaneously.

519
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,160
I don't think it's that simple.

520
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,360
There must be someone behind this.

521
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,200
Dugu is like a man.

522
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,120
Now Song Zihao's black press release

523
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,200
It's all over the Internet.

524
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,840
Instead, Sida reaped the benefits.

525
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,760
The popularity boom.

526
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,480
Don't tell me.

527
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,240
You have nothing to do

528
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,400
Has nothing to do with it.

529
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,760
So you think

530
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,640
Now I'm behind it.

531
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,520
Put black material, step on it.

532
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,280
Obvious

533
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,000
Tong Tong, I said you're a loser.

534
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
You really can't support the wall.

535
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,920
How long has it been?

536
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,880
He has a bright future now.

537
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,200
You ruined everything.

538
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,720
As a manager,

539
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,400
To push their artists into the fire.

540
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,400
Now you have the nerve to question me.

541
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,040
Dugu is like a man.

542
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,480
You're so vicious.

543
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,000
You put so much dirt out.

544
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,920
Now it's all deducted.

545
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,960
My head.

546
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,560
I'm not you.

547
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,680
I have a bottom line.

548
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,200
I won't do it. Put some black material on the back.

549
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,280
This kind of thing,

550
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,440
Because I know

551
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,080
If you do something bad, you will get what you deserve.

552
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,800
Now, Song Zihao has been hacked by the whole Internet.

553
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Is your retribution.

554
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,120
What you have to do is not

555
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,880
You came here to punish me.

556
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,720
But to protect Zihao.

557
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,240
He's suffering alone.

558
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,760
All the public opinion and pressure,

559
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,280
If anything happens to him,

560
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,800
Are you in charge?

561
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,200
My own artist.

562
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,360
I don't need you to teach me.

563
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,080
What should I do?

564
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,800
Dugu Ruo, I'm telling you,

565
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,400
This matter

566
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,640
I will definitely find out

567
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,560
You'd better put it away.

568
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,440
You're a fox.

569
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,360
Don't let me find anything.

570
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,200
You're really playing the piano.

571
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,040
You're allergic to alcohol. Why are you drinking?

572
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,120
Don't be mad.

573
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,880
It's good to see you.

574
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,560
Why are you scolding me?

575
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,080
I'm so happy.

576
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,640
Are you drinking?

577
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,120
And drank my brain out.

578
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,160
Why didn't you go to the press conference?

579
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,760
Do you know?

580
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,520
Your name has been

581
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,680
It's always on the top search list.

582
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,040
Are you concerned about me?

583
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,040
In this way, I can get your care.

584
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,360
I think it's worth it.

585
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,080
Songzihao

586
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,320
I don't care about you.

587
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
I just don't want

588
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,800
You affect Star.

589
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,080
Do you know that your fans

590
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,360
And scolded him to death.

591
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,440
It's Star again.

592
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,280
Shen Qiansha.

593
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,800
What do you take me for?

594
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,560
I'm full of you.

595
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,200
But you only have eyes for Star.

596
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,560
All of you

597
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,720
You only care about Sida.

598
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,360
You're the same. So are you.

599
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,840
Has anyone of you ever really cared

600
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,680
My feelings.

601
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,480
You're a big name.

602
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,600
Not going to the press conference.

603
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,720
Why are you blaming others?

604
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,360
No one told me to go.

605
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,920
I've been working on the crew

606
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
And shoot them.

607
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
Everyone said that I

608
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,120
Don't be professional.

609
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,480
They like to chase rumors.

610
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,120
I don't care to watch.

611
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,000
Why don't you believe me?

612
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,280
Even you and them

613
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,160
To scold me.

614
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
Shen Qiansha.

615
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,840
You don't have to like me.

616
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,760
But can you not hurt me?

617
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,760
Songzihao

618
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,480
Songzihao

619
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,440
Song Zihao, listen to me.

620
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,840
Songzihao

621
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,040
Songzihao

622
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,920
sorry

623
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,080
Listen to me.

624
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,800
I'm really sorry.

625
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,840
All I care about is Star.

626
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,040
I never thought about it.

627
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Your feelings.

628
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,040
Because you and Tong Tong

629
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,920
Always targeting him.

630
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,640
I thought this time,

631
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,400
You're making things difficult for him.

632
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,360
You're right.

633
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,280
I shouldn't only believe

634
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,000
Public opinion gossips.

635
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,840
I should figure out

636
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,720
The truth of the matter.

637
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,960
But I think

638
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,480
You should explain to everyone.

639
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,160
I don't want to see you like this.

640
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,520
And always depressed.

641
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,160
I don't need your pity.

642
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,720
I don't need their understanding.

643
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,680
But if you do that,

644
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,400
You can only make mistakes again and again.

645
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,280
I don't care.

646
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,160
Those who understand me don't have to explain.

647
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
People who don't understand me,

648
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,360
Why bother?

649
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,600
Don't you think you are too selfish?

650
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,960
What about you?

651
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,480
Have you ever worried about

652
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,400
My situation

653
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,960
Even if it's only a minute,

654
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Just a second.

655
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
You're here today.

656
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,760
Is it really just because of Star?

657
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
What time is it?

658
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,240
Why are you asking this?

659
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,280
Now,

660
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,600
All I can think about is

661
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,920
How to help you.

662
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,080
What should I do?

663
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,400
Just a kiss.

664
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,120
Song Zihao, are you crazy?

665
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,160
What are you doing? Let go.

666
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,040
What are you doing?

667
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,920
You bastard.

668
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,520
Thousand yarn.

669
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,720
sorry

670
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,640
I can't catch it.

671
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,280
What I need now

672
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,320
This is the slap.

673
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,560
Songzihao

674
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,520
I hate you.

675
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,000
I hate you.

676
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,240
I hate you.

677
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,640
Zihao

678
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,520
Zihao, open the door.

679
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,080
I know you're in there.

680
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,400
Songzihao

681
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Zihao

682
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,360
Zihao

683
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,760
Why is it so strong?

684
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,760
Good gracious!

685
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,520
How much did you drink?

686
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,400
You should take care of it.

687
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,840
I'm happy.

688
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,880
You're the First Brother of Yuxing.

689
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,920
Target of public criticism

690
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,360
How many people are jealous of your position?

691
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,440
You should be more careful.

692
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,720
Whoever wants to be the first brother,

693
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
I don't care.

694
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,960
I'm telling you,

695
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,480
What about me?

696
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,280
I regret it.

697
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,240
I really regret it.

698
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,080
I regret that

699
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,880
To choose you as my manager.

700
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,160
I regret that

701
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,640
To leave Dugu Ruoruo.

702
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,920
It's you.

703
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,680
You ruined me.

704
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,080
You regret it?

705
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,600
I regret it.

706
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,720
Dugu Ruuo and I

707
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,000
For a long time.

708
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,840
You're the only one

709
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,760
It's useless.

710
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,640
You don't have the ability to be bad-tempered.

711
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,080
Even Star is a supporting role.

712
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,960
I won't compete with you.

713
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,240
Who are you to hate me?

714
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,560
What are you doing?

715
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,440
Song Zihao, what are you doing?

716
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,720
Are you satisfied now?

717
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,600
to feel relieved

718
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,680
I won't hurt you.

719
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,240
I only hurt myself.

720
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,080
Anyway,

721
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,720
Everyone hates me.

722
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,120
If anything happens to me,

723
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,320
No one will care about me.

724
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
I won't give it to anyone.

725
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,560
To cause trouble.

726
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Right now,

727
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,960
You want to be so quiet.

728
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,800
Stay there.

729
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,880
I don't want to talk about work.

730
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,159
If you're alright,

731
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,800
come

732
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,280
Have a drink with me.

733
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,639
Songzihao

734
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,159
Are you really crazy?

735
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,000
Are you a person

736
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Calm down.

737
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,600
sister

738
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,040
Contact information of all media.

739
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,840
It's all here.

740
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,720
It's on paper.

741
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
There are also online platforms.

742
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,840
There are many marketing tuba.

743
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,680
Are inside.

744
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,280
Also

745
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,440
Clarified material

746
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,600
And get ready quickly.

747
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,640
All the expenses

748
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,520
From the publicity fund of Star.

749
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,560
I'll be responsible for the consequences.

750
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,560
sister

751
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,160
Are you sure you want to help?

752
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,600
That bastard Song Zihao?

753
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,400
Is that difficult?

754
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,320
Do you want to see him ruin it?

755
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,800
Of course I don't want to.

756
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,080
but

757
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,120
Anyway, he's an asshole.

758
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,200
All right, get back to work.

759
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,400
good

760
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,400
If you see her again,

761
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,800
I'll move out today.

762
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,840
I want to see you before I leave.

763
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,280
I will wait for you at home.

764
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,760
Don't wait for me.

765
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
I don't want to see you.

766
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,240
You should just leave.

767
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,280
Yes

768
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,960
I hate you so much.

769
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
You are so arrogant.

770
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,600
You're so cool.

771
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,000
You are so arrogant.

772
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,280
How are you?

773
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Delicious

774
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,960
I used to think

775
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,160
Security is work.

776
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,280
house

777
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,760
And the money in the bank.

778
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,400
But now I think

779
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,720
If you don't have these,

780
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,280
It's okay.

781
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,040
I still have

782
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,320
A sense of security.

783
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,080
Maybe it's because of you.

784
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,120
sister

785
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,920
If you're a male,

786
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,720
Why are you still here?

787
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,920
Do you have work to deal with?

788
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,640
Yes

789
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,320
I still have some work to do.

790
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,760
Okay, I'm leaving now.

791
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,360
good

792
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,280
Go back early.

793
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,520
Bye

794
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,480
Don't waste time.

795
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,560
Go home and rest.

796
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,600
I'm leaving.

797
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,800
How dare you come?

798
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,160
Don't go in.

799
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,920
stop

800
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,160
I'm sorry.

801
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,520
Every time you sleepwalk,

802
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,000
You can dream back.

803
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,040
Are you cheating?

804
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,960
I'm not leaving.

805
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,680
Go home early.

806
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,400
Waiting for you.
