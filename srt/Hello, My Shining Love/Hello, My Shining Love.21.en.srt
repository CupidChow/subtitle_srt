1
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,280
Mr. Zhao.

2
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Why are you here?

3
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,600
I didn't expect such a heavy rain.

4
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,440
Because I knew

5
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,520
You can't carry an umbrella.

6
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,160
What a coincidence.

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,960
To send you home.

8
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,040
that

9
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,480
Okay, thank you.

10
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,039
Thank you.

11
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,080
Be careful.

12
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,520
It's raining so hard.

13
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,800
Is really big.

14
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
If you hadn't come to pick me up,

15
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,040
I didn't even know.

16
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,440
When are we waiting for the bus?

17
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,960
It's okay.

18
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,640
Even if I didn't come,

19
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,480
As long as you call,

20
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,520
I'll be there soon.

21
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,160
I won't.

22
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,560
Let the woman I love

23
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,040
Waiting for the bus for so long.

24
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,440
Are you here today?

25
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,240
I want to give you a gift.

26
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,960
In the drawer.

27
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,000
This place.

28
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,440
this

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,480
This is

30
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,280
this

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,120
this

32
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,400
If the sales of Star's new album

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,960
If it can reach the expectation,

34
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,680
I want to...

35
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,560
He must have a good chance.

36
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,720
To be the spokesman of our group.

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,440
very good

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
That's great.

39
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,960
Great. Thank you.

40
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,560
So,

41
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
This gift

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,880
To your heart.

43
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,720
It's very suitable for me.

44
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,240
However

45
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Is it because

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
To please me.

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
To use Star.

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,760
Frankly,

49
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,160
I do want to use this contract

50
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,320
To win your favor.

51
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,480
But you don't have

52
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,560
Too much pressure.

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,560
Don't forget that

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,160
I'm a businessman after all.

55
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,600
A losing business.

56
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,040
I won't do it.

57
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,760
What about me?

58
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,320
Is really optimistic about Star.

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,360
I believe

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
With his development prospect,

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,560
We can definitely reach

62
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
The standard of the spokesman of our group.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,600
Of course, the most important thing is

64
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,400
He has

65
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
An excellent manager like you

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,360
Mr. Zhao.

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,960
Thank you.

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,840
Didn't I tell you?

69
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,360
Stop calling Mr. Zhao.

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,240
It's too complicated.

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,400
Old Zhao.

72
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
I've been busy all day.

73
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,440
You must be exhausted.

74
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,640
Now it's raining.

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
I'll drive slowly.

76
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,880
Get some sleep.

77
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,520
Yes

78
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,760
Lately

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
The whole team

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,160
Are working hard

81
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,440
So busy.

82
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,960
No one

83
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,360
Have a good rest.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,760
However

85
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,680
I hope Star can

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,240
Be ambitious.

87
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,640
You're awake.

88
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
You fell asleep?

89
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,320
I saw you were tired and fell asleep.

90
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,280
So I didn't call you.

91
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm here.

92
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,480
Thank you. I'll be back.

93
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,720
Bye

94
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,280
Good night!

95
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,880
Zhao Yucheng kissed you secretly.

96
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,920
What's your reaction?

97
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,920
nonsense

98
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,280
In that embarrassing situation,

99
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,200
How can I react?

100
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,360
I can only pretend to wake up just now.

101
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,640
When you don't know anything,

102
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,160
And fled back.

103
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,600
That's right.

104
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
That's not what I asked.

105
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,960
What I'm asking is that after he kissed you,

106
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,960
you

107
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,160
What does it feel like?

108
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,360
I want to slap him.

109
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,200
Dugu is like a man.

110
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,560
You were sent down.

111
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,800
What Ecstasy?

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,280
Such a perfect diamond man.

113
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,120
And sent them here.

114
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,960
Not only are you not interested,

115
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,480
You even have a way out.

116
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,760
You didn't give it to her.

117
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,200
Can you be rational?

118
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,080
So of course I didn't slap him.

119
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,320
Of course I'm rational.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,640
I just got a contract.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,600
I don't want a slap.

122
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,440
She slapped me.

123
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,120
Am I stupid? I...

124
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,560
You're really stupid.

125
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,960
You deserve to be single.

126
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,440
Don't fall in love with you.

127
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,080
If you don't like it, put it up.

128
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,360
You have a choice.

129
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,400
A more suitable object.

130
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,920
Why are you asking for trouble?

131
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,560
You're good at speaking.

132
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,160
You speak clearly.

133
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,560
What about you?

134
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,640
Isn't Ellie

135
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,520
Really likes you?

136
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,200
Don't talk to me.

137
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,160
There are many people chasing me.

138
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,880
So my choice is very broad.

139
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,600
Also

140
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,800
Don't change the topic with me.

141
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,560
I know what you mean.

142
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,360
It's easier to be loved.

143
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,400
But I still

144
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,039
Longing for the feeling of heart.

145
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,679
A little more.

146
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,840
Although Zimmer often made me angry,

147
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,520
But I think

148
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,679
Love without pain

149
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,440
It's meaningless to be happy.

150
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,920
So in love,

151
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
I still want to be the one

152
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,200
Who are desperate.

153
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,680
I'm not afraid of tears.

154
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,080
I'm afraid that

155
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,400
You don't even have the courage to cry.

156
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,320
You're so talkative.

157
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,120
You...

158
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,640
Will be doomed to fail.

159
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,880
In Zimmer's hands,

160
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,160
I want to fall into his hands.

161
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,960
What about

162
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,360
That's how I like him.

163
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,640
Are you a flower?

164
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,560
You're still in his hands.

165
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,040
There's no cure.

166
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,680
Incurable

167
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,520
That card.

168
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
Be careful.

169
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,400
The brand.

170
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,960
Put the brand on the right side.

171
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,120
Yeah, put it over there.

172
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,320
Here, let me help you.

173
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,040
Let's go there.

174
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,800
Okay, this way.

175
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,800
If you're a male,

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,120
On the table.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,840
Come on.

178
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,560
OK

179
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,720
Facing each other.

180
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,520
All right, everyone, get ready.

181
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,640
No, no.

182
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,840
No, no.

183
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,280
Leave it first.

184
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,200
If someone brings flowers,

185
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,080
Thank you

186
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,320
Go that way.

187
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,280
Put it in that row.

188
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,880
I wish you all the best.

189
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,560
Hello, everyone.

190
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,720
I'm Sida.

191
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,080
I started from

192
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
An ordinary boy.

193
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,440
Now,

194
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,040
Without you.

195
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,120
Everyone's love

196
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,440
I know.

197
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,960
I'm not good enough now.

198
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,800
But in the future,

199
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,960
Will work harder.

200
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,000
And live up to you.

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
Everyone's love

202
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,760
Thank you.

203
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,080
Come on, move forward.

204
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,040
here

205
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,440
One by one.

206
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,640
This way please.

207
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,360
Male sister.

208
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,720
Mr. Zhao of Ruiqi Group is here.

209
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,160
Mr. Zhao, why are you here?

210
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,200
Old Zhao.

211
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,480
Thank you.

212
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,880
I have received your flowers.

213
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,000
You don't have to come here.

214
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,760
We are friends.

215
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,920
Only flowers?

216
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,160
The signing is so successful.

217
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,360
I have to be there.

218
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,320
Congratulations to you.

219
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,880
Today's success

220
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,040
And you.

221
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,520
Thank you so much.

222
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,120
sister

223
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,200
Congratulations, Star.

224
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,640
The book signing was successful.

225
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,800
sister

226
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,240
Look at this flower.

227
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,480
He must be tired.

228
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
When you see President Zhao,

229
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,120
Why didn't you say hello?

230
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,560
He's a sponsor.

231
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,440
Thank you, President Zhao.

232
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,920
Don't worry.

233
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,280
Have dinner together tonight.

234
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,200
Alright.

235
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,640
sister

236
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,080
You promised me

237
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,120
Let's have dinner together tonight.

238
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,480
To celebrate today's success.

239
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,280
Yes

240
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,480
Is actually just a

241
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,840
A little celebration party.

242
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,440
otherwise

243
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,040
Come with me when you have time.

244
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,160
Hi, sis.

245
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,600
I just brought a bottle of wine.

246
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,520
As a celebration for Star.

247
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,240
That's great.

248
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,120
For the new season.

249
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,160
I've completed everything.

250
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,400
All the materials

251
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,560
I chose them myself.

252
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,000
Hello, Si Da.

253
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,920
Hello, brother.

254
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,400
Something's wrong. Come here.

255
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,720
Something big is going to happen.

256
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm having a meeting.

257
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,880
Your book signing party.

258
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,680
I can't go either.

259
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,440
No, you have to come.

260
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,120
That Zhao Yucheng

261
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,240
You're harassing Ruo again.

262
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,200
He said he would drink tonight.

263
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,560
He must want to get Ruo drunk.

264
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,800
He has a bad intention.

265
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,560
Is she drinking again?

266
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,840
Si Da, I'm telling you,

267
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
You must take care of your sister.

268
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,920
She can't drink.

269
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,200
She fell ill after drinking.

270
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,640
She can't be with a man.

271
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,200
Let's drink together.

272
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Especially Zhao Yucheng.

273
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,200
No

274
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,240
I can't stop her.

275
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
She wouldn't listen to me.

276
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,920
I'll be there later.

277
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,160
Let's make it short.

278
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,720
Product Development Department

279
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,200
Contact the factory to start production as soon as possible.

280
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,840
The embroidery part should be supervised.

281
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,840
Sales department.

282
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,280
Make a specific sales plan.

283
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,440
Including all the items

284
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,320
Specific quantity

285
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,200
The publicity department contacted the model.

286
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,440
And shoot promotional photos and videos.

287
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,240
Legal Department.

288
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,360
To prepare my previous prosecution documents.

289
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,920
Any questions.

290
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,120
Can contact Aron.

291
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,600
Okay, let's finish the meeting.

292
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,360
Welcome to the Dream Bus.

293
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,960
Shen Qiansha.

294
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,880
You're the only one.

295
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,200
Whether it's a surprise or not.

296
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,120
What accident?

297
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,240
It's an accident.

298
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,520
Get out of the car. I'm busy.

299
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,240
Forget it.

300
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,440
You want to get off the boat?

301
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,320
I have no time here.

302
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,920
Fooling around with you.

303
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,440
I want to get off.

304
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,800
Master, stop the car.

305
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm not fooling around with you.

306
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,320
This is your first book signing party.

307
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,840
I have carefully prepared

308
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,360
This victory trip

309
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
For this trip,

310
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,320
I rented this bus.

311
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,960
And I've made it a few days earlier.

312
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,040
To study the route?

313
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,360
What line?

314
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,800
What victory trip? I...

315
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,200
Master, please.

316
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,080
No, sir. Stop the car.

317
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,640
Master worker

318
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,560
This passenger

319
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,120
Please take your seat.

320
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,640
And enjoy it patiently.

321
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,880
The scenery outside the window

322
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,640
I promise.

323
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,480
When we got there,

324
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,880
I would have stopped.

325
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,080
What's there to admire?

326
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,320
Do you remember it?

327
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
When you first came to Shanghai,

328
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,240
The rented house is over here.

329
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,720
It's far from the city.

330
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,880
But the house price is cheap.

331
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,600
So, you're always

332
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
He was on the bus from morning to night.

333
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,280
To every crew.

334
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,000
To apply for an actress.

335
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,800
How do you know these things?

336
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,400
Of course I know.

337
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,320
I'm your number one fan.

338
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,120
I've done my homework.

339
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,960
This place is

340
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,360
The place where your dream started.

341
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,280
I'm here today.

342
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,080
I brought you here to reunite the past.

343
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,160
How is it? Are you touched?

344
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,840
Missyou

345
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,400
Go away. You have no money.

346
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,920
Give me some money.

347
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,720
Let's go.

348
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,640
Now this scene

349
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,960
The weight of lifting things

350
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,720
And fainted.

351
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,520
Understand?

352
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,920
The two cloths should be prepared.

353
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,680
OK

354
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,480
Get ready.

355
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
start

356
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,560
What are you looking at? Are you eating?

357
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,040
Let's eat.

358
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,120
collect

359
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,280
Sorry

360
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,200
I have to answer the phone.

361
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,200
I'll meet you upstairs.

362
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,680
good

363
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,320
feed

364
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,200
Hello, Si Da.

365
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,320
I'm here. Where are you?

366
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,320
what

367
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,520
The bus can't get off.

368
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,880
No, you're not here.

369
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,040
What should I do?

370
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,440
I'll take the lead.

371
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,560
How can I do that?

372
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,480
Don't worry, I'm not.

373
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,920
Forget it. Hang up.

374
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,880
Why are you here?

375
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,080
Let's eat.

376
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,280
What a coincidence.

377
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,440
Are you here for dinner?

378
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,680
Yes, it's a coincidence.

379
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,960
Since you've met

380
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,800
Let's go together.

381
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,080
You did it on purpose.

382
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,320
Am I so free?

383
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,600
Then change to another one.

384
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,760
I'm on a private date.

385
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,600
inconvenience

386
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,760
You ate with Zhao Yucheng.

387
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,560
It's a date.

388
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,560
How do you know?

389
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,440
I have dinner with Zhao Yucheng.

390
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
Si Da told me.

391
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,640
He said

392
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
To celebrate the success of the book signing,

393
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,120
So I came to treat you.

394
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,840
It doesn't count if I didn't invite you.

395
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,800
I'm not going in.

396
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
You are not allowed to enter.

397
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,160
Are you trying to make trouble?

398
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,520
How can I be a troublemaker?

399
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,720
I'm helping you.

400
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,440
To help you.

401
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,080
To supervise your bad habits.

402
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,960
What's wrong with me?

403
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,520
The problem of confusing your family after drinking.

404
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,839
You're the one who's sick.

405
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,920
What do you care?

406
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,839
Leave now.

407
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,640
I'm not leaving today.

408
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,079
Get out of here.

409
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,119
I won't.

410
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,520
Don't enter.

411
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,760
Let go of me.

412
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,760
Let go

413
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,480
Let go of me.

414
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,480
I won't.

415
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,920
Let go of me.

416
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,760
I didn't expect that

417
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,720
Will invite him over.

418
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,000
If you find it inconvenient,

419
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,360
It's not inconvenient.

420
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,320
We can eat together.

421
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,160
Alright.

422
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,440
Don't pull me.

423
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,120
Come down. Come.

424
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,680
It's raining.

425
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,080
I really can't read it.

426
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,080
I have an appointment with Young Master Ruo.

427
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,160
Having dinner with Brother Qi Mo.

428
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,320
I have to leave tonight.

429
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,640
Just a glance.

430
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,520
This movie theater is the place

431
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,320
The last stop.

432
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,760
Is the end of your dream.

433
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,040
Than eating with Dugu Ruuo Man.

434
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
Is much more important.

435
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Shen Qiansha.

436
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,000
Why are you so cruel?

437
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,680
I was really touched.

438
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,960
You have to make me hate you?

439
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,560
What dream terminal?

440
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,240
You know my dream.

441
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,000
What is it?

442
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
Of course I know.

443
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,360
Just go inside and have a look.

444
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,800
If you are not satisfied with it,

445
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,160
Can you come out again?

446
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,920
No, I don't have time.

447
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,520
It's too late for you to go back.

448
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,160
Don't forget that

449
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,560
We spent two hours

450
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,480
So I came here.

451
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,240
Shen Qiansha.

452
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,760
Just take a look.

453
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,640
I promise.

454
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,920
If you are not satisfied,

455
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,720
I'll drive you back myself.

456
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,480
Just a glance.

457
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
Let's go.

458
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,480
to do sth more quickly

459
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,640
see

460
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,720
These are all

461
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
My friend's collection.

462
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,480
What about

463
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,680
Let's go. Come in.

464
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,840
What about

465
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,080
Just the two of us.

466
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,720
That's right. This movie

467
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,200
It's for you.

468
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,720
All right, I'm leaving now.

469
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,160
Don't go.

470
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,520
Just one last look.

471
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,480
It's really the last time.

472
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,120
Just a glance.

473
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,000
Didn't you say it's just a glance?

474
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,760
The movie will begin soon.

475
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,600
Come on.

476
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,320
sit

477
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,840
Why hasn't Star come yet?

478
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,680
He can't come.

479
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,600
Just the three of us.

480
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,360
Since he's not coming,

481
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,280
Go back.

482
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,600
Why should I go back?

483
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm hungry.

484
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,400
Waiter, serve the dishes.

485
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,400
She's obviously jealous.

486
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,840
You still won't admit it.

487
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,000
How stubborn are you?

488
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,160
Waiter/Waitress

489
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,480
Hello

490
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,240
Get the wine.

491
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,760
good

492
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,400
No need.

493
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,440
Wake up my bottle of wine.

494
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,040
OK

495
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Don't wake up.

496
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,760
We're not drinking today.

497
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,000
Who told you to drink it?

498
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,600
You don't have to drink it.

499
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
Old Zhao wants to drink.

500
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,240
Old Zhao.

501
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,880
When are you?

502
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,720
You're so close.

503
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,800
When you don't know,

504
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,760
I made a deal with Zhao.

505
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,800
Happy today.

506
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,760
Drink more.

507
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,440
good

508
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,680
Finish your own wine.

509
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,440
What stinks?

510
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Don't you know that?

511
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,640
What's wrong with you?

512
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,840
Nothing?

513
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,640
Don't listen to him.

514
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,120
It seems you don't know.

515
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,840
It seems you don't know it.

516
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,920
Even if she drinks wine,

517
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,800
You don't even know.

518
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,920
I didn't know that.

519
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,520
I will know in the future.

520
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,360
I didn't know you before.

521
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,400
There's plenty of time.

522
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,480
And slowly understand.

523
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Anyway, from now on,

524
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,640
Ruonan and I

525
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,280
I have plenty of time.

526
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,960
Right?

527
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,600
Yes

528
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,240
Also

529
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
I'm telling you,

530
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
Don't go deep.

531
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,200
Distance produces beauty.

532
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
What do you mean?

533
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,320
I don't mean anything.

534
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,520
Are you saying I'm bad?

535
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,360
I didn't say that.

536
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,280
Besides

537
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,160
sloppy

538
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,760
You lie and get into trouble.

539
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,880
I don't like to clean the room.

540
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,720
And likes to talk big.

541
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,760
Overbearing and strong,

542
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
There are no shortcomings.

543
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,200
You're tired of living.

544
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,480
Add another one.

545
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,760
Bad-tempered and impulsive.

546
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
But in my opinion,

547
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,120
It's not a problem.

548
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,120
You think she's messy?

549
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,600
In my opinion,

550
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,920
That's casual.

551
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,560
She's a liar.

552
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,600
In my opinion,

553
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,080
You know how to improvise.

554
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,720
You think she's a troublemaker?

555
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,520
In my opinion,

556
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,880
It shows courage and sincerity.

557
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,440
Because I like Ruowan.

558
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,000
So everything she did

559
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,040
It's shining to me.

560
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,800
Look at Old Zhao.

561
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
And chat a lot.

562
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,280
It's so beautiful, Star.

563
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,200
What's your favorite line?

564
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,440
My favorite is

565
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,080
Your mouth is broken.

566
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,040
How about some lipstick?

567
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,760
Then they kissed.

568
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,200
So romantic.

569
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,120
What about you?

570
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,000
My favorite line is

571
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,600
No matter you think highly of me,

572
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm an actor.

573
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,960
Si Da, you're amazing.

574
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,880
This film

575
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,240
I've seen it countless times.

576
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,640
You know your lines.

577
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,280
I've checked you.

578
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,520
All the information

579
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,000
I know what you like most.

580
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,080
Is this movie.

581
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,000
I have a dream.

582
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,160
Is to be an actor.

583
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,720
Sooner or later,

584
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,840
I'll start from an extra.

585
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,320
To become an actor.

586
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,000
A real actor.

587
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,480
Then why don't you

588
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,800
Why did you stop acting?

589
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,200
Isn't that your dream?

590
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,680
Have you been drinking?

591
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,280
Who are you drinking with?

592
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,760
If a man

593
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,400
Only Ruowan?

594
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,800
Did Chen Fei go?

595
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Phil!

596
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,560
Phil, no.

597
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,000
Zhao Yucheng.

598
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,680
Why are you drinking with him?

599
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,200
Isn't this a grand banquet?

600
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,120
Sit down.

601
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,080
I'll get you some water.

602
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,280
Come on. No.

603
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,440
What are you doing?

604
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,800
So many shadows of lonely men.

605
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,200
I need some water.

606
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,480
I'll get you some water.

607
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,160
I'll get you some water.

608
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,400
Sit down.

609
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,000
Good gracious!

610
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,640
You're jealous.

611
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
I'm not jealous.

612
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,000
How could I be jealous?

613
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,200
Watch this.

614
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,040
I added this to the water.

615
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,240
The vinegar for making feet.

616
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,400
foot bath

617
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,080
Answer the phone.

618
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,880
Don't answer it.

619
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,800
Don't sleep here.

620
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,520
Go upstairs and sleep.

621
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,240
Zimmer

622
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,960
Not if you fall asleep.

623
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,280
The shadow of Dugu Ruoruo.

624
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,440
You said you weren't jealous.

625
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,200
I think you're

626
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,440
You came back after eating vinegar.

627
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,800
Are you still worried about Zimmer?

628
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,520
No.

629
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,440
I actually envy him.

630
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,680
What do you envy him for?

631
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,080
I envy him.

632
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,560
Can affect your mood.

633
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,320
To make you angry.

634
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,160
To make you worry.

635
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,120
And make you smile.

636
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,760
That's not true.

637
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,840
Don't misunderstand me.

638
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,120
It's you. Don't misunderstand.

639
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,080
I didn't...

640
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,240
To blame you.

641
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,760
It's just pure envy.

642
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,320
even

643
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,000
And even jealous.

644
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:41,840
I also hope

645
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,200
When you're with me,

646
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,480
To be with him.

647
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,920
Relax

648
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,800
comfortable

649
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,720
I also hope

650
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,320
I can affect your emotions.

651
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,280
Even a tiny bit.

652
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,720
I still have Zimmer in my heart.

653
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,320
You can't pretend to be someone else.

654
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,200
I know.

655
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,920
but

656
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,160
I think you should

657
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,720
I don't mind.

658
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,440
I can wait.

659
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,240
When you're done,

660
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,440
The day I put him down,

661
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,360
Mr. Zhao.

662
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,280
Thank you for taking me home today.

663
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,200
don't mention it

664
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,920
I'll go up first.

665
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:47,800
If a man

666
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,880
Some words.

667
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,600
I still want to tell you

668
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,560
I'll leave right away.

669
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,280
Okay?

670
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,160
You know,

671
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,280
I've been

672
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,680
Are rational people.

673
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,600
But since I met you,

674
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,800
A lot of things have changed.

675
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,240
Little by little,

676
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,920
And emotional.

677
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,000
Don't be so rational.

678
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,080
because

679
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,520
Because I really love you.

680
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
I just want to say that

681
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
If one day,

682
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,160
In your heart,

683
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,640
I'm really putting Jimo down.

684
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,840
Remember to come to me first.

685
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,640
I won't be like him.

686
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,760
Won't let go easily like him.

687
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,920
Dugu is like a man.

688
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,640
Why are you here?

689
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Are you sober?

690
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,360
Yes

691
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,680
You woke me up.

692
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
I dreamed that you two were dating.

693
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,360
I didn't expect my dream to come true.

694
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,400
Has come true.

695
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,920
Dugu is like a man.

696
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,600
Are you trying to piss me off?

697
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,480
Why are you angry?

698
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,960
It's none of your business

699
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,200
Are you jealous?

700
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,360
Are you jealous?

701
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,640
No.

702
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,640
No,

703
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,320
I'll take you upstairs.

704
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,440
Sure. Would you like to have a cup of tea?

705
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,760
Sorry

706
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,760
What kind of tea?

707
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,240
Don't take men home at night.

708
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Not during the day.

709
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,120
What's the matter? The company said

710
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,880
You should

711
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,920
Go upstairs.

712
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,800
Sorry, Mr. Zhao.

713
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,880
Let's drink some other time.

714
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,280
Good night!

715
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,240
Goodnight

716
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,760
You said you weren't jealous.

717
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,200
pretend

718
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,320
Don't pretend.

719
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,160
In front of me,

720
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,960
He will show his true shape.

721
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,560
But the way he's jealous,

722
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
And charming.

723
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,720
Let's go.

724
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Do you really want to pester Ruo Nan?

725
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,080
When will it be?

726
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,400
This sentence

727
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,880
I also want to ask you

728
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,120
It's our business.

729
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,560
I don't need you to worry about it.

730
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,280
Really?

731
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,400
I'm pursuing Ruuo Nan.

732
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,120
If the man agrees,

733
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,120
Trying to develop with me.

734
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,560
At this moment,

735
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,120
You always show up to harass her.

736
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,000
Do you think

737
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,360
Is it related to me?

738
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,720
So, you're in a relationship?

739
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,680
Not yet.

740
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,880
But soon.

741
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,720
So you better stay away from her.

742
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,240
impossible

743
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,840
impossible

744
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,360
So you admit that

745
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,960
And fell in love with Dugu Ruuo.

746
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,920
that's right

747
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
Before you,

748
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,240
Longer than you.

749
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,360
in other words

750
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,480
Admit yourself.

751
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,480
Betrayed Su Xiao.

752
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,840
Really?

753
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,320
My love for Su Xiao

754
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,120
I don't need anyone to doubt it.

755
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,480
I never betrayed her.

756
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,920
And forgot her.

757
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,920
But if a man shows up,

758
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,200
I love her very much.

759
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,120
Unable to restrain

760
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,160
and

761
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,720
Your appearance

762
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,480
To make me more sure.

763
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,600
You should stop hesitating.

764
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,800
Whether you believe it or not,

765
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,360
Su Xiao is indeed gone.

766
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,320
For Su Xiao's sake,

767
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,840
You don't deserve to mention Su Xiao.

768
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,720
By the way,

769
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,120
To protect your Ruuo.

770
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
I'm warning you.

771
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,760
If a man is my bottom line,

772
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,880
casual

773
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,360
What happened last night?

774
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,120
Why didn't you contact me?

775
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,280
sister

776
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,880
sister

777
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,480
I'm busy.

778
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,760
You're here at the right time.

779
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,159
I'm watching it now.

780
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,239
About your pre-sale meeting.

781
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,840
The reaction this time is very good.

782
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,240
I'm going to add more.

783
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,280
Really?

784
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,560
It's great.

785
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,360
Why didn't you come to dinner yesterday?

786
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,960
yesterday

787
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,440
And called Jimo here.

788
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,960
Do you know how embarrassing I am?

789
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,480
Where were you yesterday?

790
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,600
To watch a movie.

791
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,000
Watching movies.

792
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,680
The king of comedy.

793
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,480
sister

794
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,880
Do you remember how often I

795
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,240
About this film?

796
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,080
That's it.

797
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,880
Let me make up my mind.

798
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,960
Into the entertainment industry.

799
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,400
That's great.

800
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,080
Keep this faith.

801
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,160
Keep working hard.

802
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,320
You will soon be

803
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,640
The most popular singer.

804
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,560
singer

805
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,920
but

806
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,480
For singing,

807
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,760
I think I want to act more.

808
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,800
That's OK.

809
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,360
When you have a few more,

810
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,560
The best-selling single.

811
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,240
After stabilizing your popularity,

812
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,640
You can slowly

813
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,200
From singer to actor.

814
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,880
But now,

815
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,840
Don't want to be defined as a singer.

816
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,040
I know.

817
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,000
You're an all-around artist.

818
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,240
That's how I positioned myself.

819
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,520
Sister, I want to be an actress.

820
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,080
When I was watching a movie yesterday,

821
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,160
I suddenly feel that

822
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,280
My own shadow.

823
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,160
Just like before,

824
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,240
Although I'm just an extra,

825
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:11,880
Not here.

826
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,160
It fell there.

827
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,320
but

828
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,960
I lived a full life.

829
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,520
I have something to look forward to.

830
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,520
Although she seems to be

831
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,000
It's just a dream.

832
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Is so impractical.

833
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,240
But it made me very motivated.

834
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,360
Is very promising.

835
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,440
Unlike now,

836
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,600
I practice and perform every day.

837
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,560
Rehearsal and performance.

838
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,640
I almost forgot.

839
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,000
My original intention.

840
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,240
I know.

841
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,320
With such an achievement,

842
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,360
It's not easy.

843
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,760
I don't want to let you down.

844
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,560
But in my heart,

845
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,160
Singing is work.

846
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,480
Acting is my dream.

847
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,280
Sister, I want to be an actress now.

848
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,760
Sida

849
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,440
You're on the upswing of your career.

850
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,120
And you're about to become

851
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,560
The spokesman of Rui Qi.

852
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,480
You know what that means?

853
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,760
You're about to become

854
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,000
An A-list star.

855
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,120
This is the turning point of your life.

856
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,880
If you want it now,

857
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,520
To become an actor,

858
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,720
How about we

859
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,560
The contract will conflict.

860
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,720
Your roadshow will be reduced.

861
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,440
The crew's time

862
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,840
He might not be able to cooperate.

863
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,320
The efforts we are making now

864
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,760
It will all be in vain.

865
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,200
Or should I

866
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,000
You want to go back?

867
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,040
As an extra.

868
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,360
Maybe my qualifications

869
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,520
Is only suitable for acting.

870
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,720
I didn't mean that.

871
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,720
It's not me.

872
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,920
I mean,

873
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,400
I mean,

874
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,920
I'm too arrogant.

875
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
I shouldn't have thought about it.

876
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,600
I'll go back and practice my song.

877
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,920
I'm going back to writing songs, sister.

878
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,080
Thank you

879
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,680
To support me today.

880
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,840
I went from an ordinary

881
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,360
The big boy has come so far.

882
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,000
Without you.

883
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,200
Everyone's love

884
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,320
I know.

885
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,080
I'm not good enough now.

886
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,960
But in the future,

887
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,240
Will work harder.

888
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,120
And live up to you.

889
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,240
Everyone's love

890
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,560
Thank you.

891
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,200
That

892
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:38,960
I want some coffee.

893
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,840
Go buy it for me.

894
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,640
What did you say

895
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,880
I said I wanted coffee.

896
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,600
trouble

897
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,720
Okay, I'll buy it.

898
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,680
Wait

899
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,520
What are you doing?

900
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,600
That

901
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,280
Yesterday afternoon,

902
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,120
What are you doing?

903
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,160
Are you going to see

904
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,240
The signing party of Star.

905
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,560
That's right.

906
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,720
Haven't I told you?

907
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,560
I'm not sure.

908
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,240
Shen Qiansha, have you figured out

909
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,800
You're my assistant.

910
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,040
Bring it here.

911
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:16,960
Bring it here.

912
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:17,880
Give it to me.

913
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,320
Don't.

914
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,160
Give it to me.

915
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:19,960
Don't.

916
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,000
Don't delete it.

917
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,680
Give it to me.

918
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,080
What's wrong with you?

919
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,120
Hey, let me tell you something.

920
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,000
Don't listen to this.

921
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,120
A messy song.

922
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,880
Shen Qiansha, can you...

923
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,960
Wake up.

924
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,400
Don't be a anthomaniac.

925
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,240
Look, all you like are

926
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,160
What kind of person?

927
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,680
You have no taste at all.

928
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,800
Songzihao

929
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,080
Although I'm your assistant,

930
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,760
But who do I like?

931
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,440
I don't have to tell you.

932
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,720
I just love Star.

933
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,760
I'm obsessed with him.

934
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,840
What about

935
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,040
Okay, then tell me.

936
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,440
What do you like about him?

937
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,360
Where is he?

938
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
He's good everywhere.

939
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,040
How could you

940
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,240
Dugu is like a man.

941
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,560
Are you blind?

942
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,400
It's not Shen Qiansha.

943
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,160
I'm telling you,

944
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Remember that.

945
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,560
You're my assistant.

946
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,720
My people

947
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,400
What should I ask you to do?

948
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,000
What are you doing?

949
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,680
You don't like to leave.

950
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,240
Let's go.

951
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,040
I

952
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,840
You can't come back if you leave.

953
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,960
To leave this company.

954
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,240
Is he still talking to you?

955
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,360
Who said I was leaving?

956
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,840
I'll buy you some coffee.

957
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,160
Hold on.

958
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
What about you?

959
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,920
Help me get these scripts

960
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,920
I've read them all.

961
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,160
Mark the lines for me.

962
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,640
The character's mood.

963
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,280
And those are

964
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,160
Give it to me this week.

965
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,680
That's a lot.

966
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,480
How can I finish it in a week?

967
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,200
Aren't you free?

968
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,360
To go to the book signing party.

969
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,080
You must have time to read the script.

970
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,840
Yes?

971
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,960
I don't want to.

972
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,040
I'm doing it.

973
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,160
I'm so happy.

974
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,560
Wait

975
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,920
Don't forget that

976
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,320
Script

977
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,920
I love the script so much.

978
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,320
I've been reading scripts since I was young.

979
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,800
My whole family loves the script.

980
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,840
CAUTION

981
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,880
He's dead.

982
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,480
Stinks, Song Zihao.

983
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,480
Stinky!

984
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,520
Why are you here, Star?

985
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,680
Are these all scripts?

986
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,720
That's right.

987
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,000
This is Song Zihao's new play.

988
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,680
Song Zihao asked me to

989
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,080
Everything is marked.

990
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,480
There are so many scripts.

991
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,680
Let me read it in a week.

992
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,240
It was meant to mess with me.

993
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,680
Let me help you clean up.

994
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,880
I want to see the script.

995
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,080
Si Da, you're so kind.

996
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,600
He said he would read the script.

997
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,160
What's so great about the script?

998
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,480
You said you wanted to see me.

999
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,160
That's it.
