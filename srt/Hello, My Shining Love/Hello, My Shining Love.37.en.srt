1
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,600
You're awake.

2
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,680
sister

3
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,840
If you're a male,

4
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,800
Help me up.

5
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,360
good

6
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,440
sister

7
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,520
Why am I in the hospital?

8
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,640
Don't you remember anything?

9
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,440
Zihao

10
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,240
Zihao

11
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,200
Don't think about it.

12
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,720
Relax.

13
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,280
Don't think about it.

14
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,080
sister

15
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,600
I shouldn't have gone to the bar.

16
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,680
I shouldn't have quarreled with you.

17
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,520
I'll never give it to you again.

18
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,480
To cause trouble, okay?

19
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,400
What are you talking about?

20
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,920
I said,

21
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,200
I want to cancel the contract with you.

22
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,560
They're angry words.

23
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,640
Don't take it seriously.

24
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,440
Don't give up on me.

25
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,520
What do you remember?

26
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,040
I still remember

27
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,800
I still remember

28
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,160
I still remember the day we

29
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
From the bar.

30
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,520
And had a huge fight.

31
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
I got on the bus in a fit of pique.

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,920
And had a car accident.

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,840
Later,

34
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,680
Dugu Ruuo never thought about

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,640
My personal appeal.

36
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,040
Has arranged a lot of things for me.

37
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,480
Endless heavy work

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,800
She doesn't respect the artists.

39
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,280
I can't bear it.

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,960
I can't be with

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,520
Without humanity and bottom line.

42
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,680
To work together again.

43
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,200
therefore

44
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,800
I made

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,120
To change my agent.

46
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,080
Why are you so excited?

47
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,840
Have you slept together?

48
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,560
It's interesting.

49
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Stop fighting.

50
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,320
sister

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,520
It was a long time ago.

52
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,440
Right?

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,840
Don't think about it.

54
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,839
When I woke up last time,

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,279
I saw you too.

56
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,920
Everything

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,760
Will it be different?

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,320
Don't think about it.

59
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,360
Thank you for working so hard

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,040
You have worked hard.

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,840
But no matter how hard you try,

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,600
I can't go back.

63
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,160
Why did the side effects come so fast?

64
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,320
Suxiao

65
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,920
How do you know?

66
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,680
In this hospital,

67
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,400
Did my brother go to see you?

68
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,320
He must have said

69
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,160
It's very harsh.

70
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,120
Don't mind.

71
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,760
Because of me,

72
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,240
That's why he's like this.

73
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,000
He didn't do it on purpose.

74
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,000
Zhao Yucheng didn't tell me.

75
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,200
The hospital informed me.

76
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,080
You transferred to the hospital?

77
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Since my brother knew that

78
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,520
After the recurrence,

79
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,480
He's very protective.

80
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,760
He insisted on using a doctor he trusted.

81
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,960
And won't let me see you.

82
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,000
I want to see you.

83
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,040
I'm scared.

84
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,200
Don't worry.

85
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,280
No matter what Zhao Yusheng says,

86
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,800
I will keep my promise.

87
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,280
To treat you.

88
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,400
Until you recover.

89
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,160
Let's go.

90
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,320
Go to chemotherapy with you.

91
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,560
Twenty-two.

92
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,520
This is your medicine.

93
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,480
Okay, thank you.

94
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,320
Have a good rest.

95
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,400
Songzihao

96
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,400
Don't make a noise in the ward.

97
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,800
Will disturb people's rest.

98
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,280
Are you really awake?

99
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,440
Are you all right?

100
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,600
Give me a little more.

101
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,840
Something really happened.

102
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
You fool.

103
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,320
Why are you sick?

104
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,440
You didn't tell me?

105
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,520
Besides,

106
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,280
You're my only friend.

107
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,760
What should I do if you're dying?

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,480
Do you know how scared I am?

109
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,440
Calm down.

110
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,520
Nothing.

111
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,520
unless

112
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Unless you promise to

113
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,240
And never do anything stupid again.

114
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,720
good

115
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,400
I promise.

116
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,400
Really

117
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,760
I take this medicine every day.

118
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,760
I'm tired.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,919
I'm too lazy to lie to you.

120
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,640
What do you want to eat?

121
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,600
I'll buy it for you.

122
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,799
No, no.

123
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,600
Don't bother me here.

124
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,240
That's enough.

125
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,200
The doctor said

126
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,000
I need to rest.

127
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,560
Say yes and mean no

128
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm looking at you.

129
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,560
I wish I were here.

130
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,320
Stay with you.

131
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,880
But I'm very busy.

132
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
When I get off work,

133
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,440
To bother you again.

134
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,080
Leave now.

135
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't be like last time.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,760
I was fired.

137
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,560
Songzihao

138
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,600
I'm glad you're not dead.

139
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,680
Today is my happiest day.

140
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,880
You did this?

141
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,480
Right?

142
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,400
Shouldn't you be busy now?

143
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,360
Why do you still have time to come to me?

144
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,840
You lied to the press.

145
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,080
Seems to have passed for a while.

146
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
The current crisis

147
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,560
But in fact, it's not conducive to

148
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,840
The development of Song Zihao.

149
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,200
You harmed him.

150
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,760
Why should I

151
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,640
For Song Zihao,

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,360
He is doomed to fail to turn over.

153
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,760
I'm thinking more about

154
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,640
How can I protect myself?

155
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,320
Don't be too proud.

156
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,120
Even if I fail this time,

157
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,880
I'm also going to drag you and Star

158
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,600
As the understudy.

159
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,680
For yourself,

160
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,880
And hurt the artists.

161
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,320
You don't deserve it.

162
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,280
To be an agent.

163
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,040
You don't like me?

164
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,520
You can clarify in front of the media.

165
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,040
See if they believe you.

166
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,000
Even if they believe it,

167
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,880
Then I won't be the unlucky one.

168
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,440
It's Song Zihao.

169
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,240
Don't you love Zihao the most?

170
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,640
Give it a try.

171
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,760
If this matter

172
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,960
He will commit suicide or something.

173
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,040
You harmed him.

174
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,360
You haven't realized it yet.

175
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
I made a mistake.

176
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,760
You're too selfish.

177
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,840
If you're a male,

178
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,680
When it comes to selfishness,

179
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,240
We are the same.

180
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,360
I won't lose to anyone.

181
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I'm different from you.

182
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,760
I won't hurt the artist.

183
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,480
Never.

184
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,960
You'll get what you deserve.

185
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,920
Wait and see.

186
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,160
According to insiders,

187
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,480
Song Zihao's illness and Sida

188
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,840
The constant stimulation.

189
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,800
Is this true?

190
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,280
It's my decision to steal the role.

191
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,840
What's wrong?

192
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,920
Just ask me directly.

193
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,800
Thank you.

194
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,040
We don't respond anymore.

195
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,200
What are you doing?

196
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,360
It's me.

197
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,880
To make a false claim.

198
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,000
To take the role.

199
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Otherwise, Miss Tong Tong wouldn't have

200
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,680
To get the information.

201
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,440
I'm a man.

202
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,000
I should take the responsibility.

203
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,960
The responsibility I should take.

204
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,520
To protect you?

205
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,360
You don't have to take any responsibility.

206
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,560
I don't need your protection.

207
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,320
I'm an agent.

208
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,400
I'll handle it.

209
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,400
Your responsibility is

210
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,920
In a down-to-earth manner,

211
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,880
Give me the trick. Come on.

212
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,040
But I don't want to lie now.

213
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,200
I just want to be honest.

214
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,880
My heart

215
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,400
What are you thinking?

216
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,720
The first person I love is you.

217
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,640
You taught me

218
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,880
How to love someone.

219
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,000
But now you want to take it back.

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,240
Asked me not to do that.

221
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm a man.

222
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,760
I also have someone I want to love.

223
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
That's you.

224
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,960
Stop thinking about it.

225
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,960
I won't give you a chance.

226
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,000
I will never have the chance.

227
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,920
Si Da, what are you doing?

228
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,600
Do you know?

229
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,560
Now, I've searched ten places.

230
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,680
All eight are yours.

231
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,880
None of them is positive.

232
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,000
The public relations team has

233
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,840
Hurry up.

234
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,160
I just want to take responsibility for what I should do.

235
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,880
I don't want to drag others down.

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,760
The explanation.

237
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
If you have explained it,

238
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
Why do you still say those words?

239
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,520
This will not only affect you,

240
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,920
And make things difficult for Ruo.

241
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,960
Do you know?

242
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,280
I can't handle so many things.

243
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,560
I just want to be honest.

244
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,440
In my heart,

245
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,720
I don't want to be depressed.

246
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,080
To her.

247
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,440
What's wrong with me?

248
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
What do you mean?

249
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,840
you

250
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,200
Do you have a relationship

251
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,040
To confess?

252
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,600
If she treats you as her brother,

253
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,920
What do you want her to do?

254
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,280
I'll explain to the company.

255
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,720
But I won't.

256
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,840
To change my choice.

257
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:35,960
but

258
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,120
This has nothing to do with you.

259
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,840
I'll handle it myself.

260
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,440
If a man

261
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,800
Are you all right

262
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,440
sorry

263
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,400
The number you dialed is powered off.

264
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,640
feed

265
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,400
Brother Jimo.

266
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,840
Is Ruo there?

267
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,640
She's not here.

268
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,480
What's up

269
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,360
The boss is mad.

270
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,520
If she doesn't show up,

271
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,800
Fire her immediately.

272
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,520
But I called her.

273
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,720
She's always turned off.

274
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,280
I've seen the news.

275
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,600
This is very important

276
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,960
Is indeed a big blow.

277
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,840
But she always

278
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,640
Facing the problem directly.

279
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,920
How could she suddenly disappear?

280
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,520
actually

281
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,640
Something happened today.

282
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,680
What have you done?

283
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,720
Do you know about this?

284
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
What's the consequence?

285
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,080
I'm just putting my

286
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,040
Speak your mind.

287
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,800
What's wrong with me?

288
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,360
I have the ability to protect my sister now.

289
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,400
I don't want to just

290
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,520
And be her brother.

291
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,840
Sincerely

292
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,920
Everyone knows your sincerity.

293
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,240
But everyone is being careful

294
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,480
To maintain this relationship.

295
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,640
She cherishes you.

296
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,360
So she wants to help you realize your dream.

297
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,520
But what about you?

298
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,720
To pierce the glass paper.

299
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,320
She can't accept your relationship.

300
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,040
I can't hurt you.

301
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,960
So this sincerity

302
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,440
Can only become a heavy burden.

303
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,040
Who are you to accuse me?

304
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,120
yes

305
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,640
I will be her burden.

306
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,600
But what about you?

307
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,120
You will only hurt her.

308
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,520
Aren't you hurting her?

309
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,480
You pushed her away.

310
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,240
Then, from the beginning,

311
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,720
My sister is the only one in my heart.

312
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,240
I can be single-minded.

313
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,280
Loyal and loyal, can you do that?

314
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,600
What do you mean?

315
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,760
You don't know anything.

316
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
That's enough.

317
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Don't argue anymore.

318
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,880
The most important thing now

319
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,080
To find Ruo.

320
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,040
Qian Sha is right.

321
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,640
The top priority now

322
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,880
We should find Ruo Nan.

323
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,720
Let's search separately.

324
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,080
I'm warning you.

325
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,200
If you keep doing this,

326
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,000
And willful things.

327
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And hurt Ruo Nan.

328
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,560
I won't let you off.

329
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,319
Brother

330
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,319
There's no hotpot restaurant.

331
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,400
I can't find her.

332
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,760
I came to the hospital to look for it.

333
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,240
I didn't see her.

334
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,000
I think she will be

335
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,080
Quiet and familiar.

336
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,560
And feel safe.

337
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,720
If a man

338
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,880
Go. I don't want to see you.

339
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,480
If a man

340
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,040
How about you give me a beating?

341
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,520
Get your emotions out.

342
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,080
You will feel better.

343
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,800
I don't want to go back.

344
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,680
I didn't want you to go back.

345
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,520
I just want to stay here.

346
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,240
Stay with you.

347
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,600
In this world,

348
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
The person who hurts me the most is you.

349
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,760
I really don't want to see you.

350
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,960
I finally got rid of you.

351
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,280
Now, Sida is making trouble again.

352
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,960
Please.

353
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,480
I just want to be alone, okay?

354
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,840
Then why are you here?

355
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,360
Where are you going?

356
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,080
Why are you here?

357
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,240
To prove that you still have me in your heart.

358
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,960
Right?

359
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,440
You need me now.

360
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,800
Stop lying to yourself.

361
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,880
You are back

362
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,280
My legs are getting tired waiting for you.

363
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,480
Haven't I already told you

364
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,400
Is it clear?

365
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Why did you come back to me?

366
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,160
yes

367
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,360
I know our relationship

368
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,400
It's over.

369
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,160
But the relationship between our patients

370
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,080
It's not over.

371
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,880
What's wrong with you?

372
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,000
You're sick again.

373
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,960
I've been feeling ill recently.

374
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,400
Only you can cure me.

375
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,680
President Ji.

376
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,360
The factory

377
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,320
Has started to shut down.

378
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,240
All the production lines

379
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,120
Has stopped.

380
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,960
She said she wouldn't answer it.

381
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Wing fashion.

382
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,720
What did the old factory director say?

383
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,760
I haven't been able to contact him.

384
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,200
You're like this.

385
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,040
To contact him.

386
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,600
Tell me right now.

387
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,280
I'll ask him to meet.

388
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,880
Before that, we have to solve

389
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,560
The problem of being out of stock.

390
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,720
We can't just sit here and wait.

391
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,800
such

392
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,080
You're using the current market

393
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,480
Get rid of all the goods.

394
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,760
I'm going to change the condition

395
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,960
And become sold out.

396
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,680
Is this OK?

397
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,200
Psychologically,

398
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,440
There's a scarcity principle.

399
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,760
As an object.

400
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,240
Was owned by a few people,

401
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,600
Will be precious.

402
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,240
It can also stimulate consumption.

403
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,280
The so-called limit.

404
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,240
This kind of psychology.

405
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,680
Inform the marketing department.

406
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,120
According to the current state,

407
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,240
To come up with a plan.

408
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,760
Chen Fei'er, you're not sick at all.

409
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,640
Is it fun to lie to the doctor?

410
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,240
But I just saw you

411
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,560
You're so nervous about me.

412
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,840
It means you still care about me.

413
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,040
I only care about the patient.

414
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,040
Since you're not sick,

415
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,880
Please leave.

416
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,080
Don't delay me from treating others.

417
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,520
I'm really sick.

418
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:21,920
I

419
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,800
Come on.

420
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,840
Lovelorn syndrome

421
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,360
The new bag.

422
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,560
And new clothes.

423
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,800
Can't interest me.

424
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,800
I don't want to eat.

425
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,960
I don't want to sleep.

426
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,200
I don't want to go shopping.

427
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,640
I only want you.

428
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
By my side.

429
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,240
Do you need me?

430
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,640
Do I have to?

431
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,120
good

432
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,840
Come with me.

433
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,240
go

434
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,600
Where are we going?

435
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,640
sorry

436
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,960
I don't need you.

437
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,240
AiLi

438
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,960
AiLi

439
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,320
I'm really sick.

440
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,720
AiLi

441
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,240
Open the door.

442
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,880
I'm really sick.

443
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,800
Open the door.

444
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,840
Miss, this is a hospital.

445
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
Please be quiet.

446
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,120
AiLi

447
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,320
Miss

448
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,680
Could you please keep quiet?

449
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,640
Hello, please follow me.

450
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,280
Sorry

451
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,720
hello

452
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,720
Just now,

453
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,400
The lady in the white suit

454
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,040
Which doctor is she seeing?

455
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
She's here to do

456
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,720
The psychological counseling activities.

457
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,200
Psychological counseling

458
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,880
Can I join?

459
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,120
You can't go.

460
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
Because of her activity today,

461
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,160
Is for cancer patients.

462
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,320
Mental healing activities

463
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,480
cancer

464
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,160
sister

465
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,960
Where have you been?

466
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,280
I've been worrying about you all day.

467
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,360
To think about the next strategy.

468
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:33,960
Sister, I...

469
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,600
When I came,

470
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,320
I've talked to Mr. Lu on the phone.

471
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,400
After the discussion,

472
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,760
The event will be held as usual.

473
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,560
Yesterday,

474
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,040
During this period,

475
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,080
Promotion trip.

476
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,840
To maintain the positive image of Star.

477
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,360
We must cooperate with the publicity.

478
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,200
If you're a male,

479
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,280
That Sida

480
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,200
Just do it.

481
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,040
sister

482
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,400
Hurry.

483
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,160
sister

484
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,080
sister

485
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,920
I was impulsive yesterday.

486
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,240
just

487
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,280
Now everyone wants to

488
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,440
You're busy.

489
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,520
You have to act like

490
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,240
As a child.

491
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,480
Only care about your own feelings?

492
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
You can't avoid it.

493
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,840
Your feelings.

494
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,920
And then,

495
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,000
As an agent.

496
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,480
To draw a line with me.

497
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,200
good

498
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
Don't worry.

499
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,640
After this matter is handled,

500
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,920
I will make a choice.

501
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,760
I'm busy.

502
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,080
I was in the hospital.

503
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,280
I've seen Su Xiao.

504
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,000
Her breast cancer has returned.

505
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,480
Are you serious?

506
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,640
I've been asking around.

507
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,160
As sure as a gun

508
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,680
I want to stay with Su Xiao for some time.

509
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,320
I have no choice.

510
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,520
I can't say.

511
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,240
I promised her.

512
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,560
President Ji.

513
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
I have news.

514
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,000
He's on vacation in his hometown of Suzhou.

515
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,560
good

516
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,360
We'll leave early tomorrow morning.

517
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,520
that

518
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,480
I'll get back to work.

519
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,640
Take your time.

520
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,600
Why are you here?

521
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,800
It's Star.

522
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,720
Is there any problem?

523
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,280
I have something to ask you.

524
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,040
Go ahead.

525
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,600
Su Xiao's cancer has returned.

526
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,120
Is it true?

527
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,560
How did you know?

528
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,280
This matter

529
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,160
So it's true.

530
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,800
Why didn't you tell me?

531
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,640
I promised Su Xiao

532
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
I won't tell anyone.

533
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,160
And there were a lot of things

534
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,560
You've given your life

535
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,440
And make a mess.

536
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,240
I don't want you to get involved.

537
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,920
Although I was hesitant,

538
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,840
Should I explain to you?

539
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,520
but

540
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,880
I really don't know.

541
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,560
What should I do?

542
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,320
To make you better.

543
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,920
That's why you have to stay with her.

544
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,960
This is your reason?

545
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,440
If a man

546
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,880
I hope I can accompany her to chemotherapy.

547
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,000
So I can make up for it.

548
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,960
The regret in my heart.

549
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,160
But please believe that

550
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,000
Our relationship

551
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,120
It's not what you think.

552
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,560
You shouldn't have kept it from me.

553
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,080
No matter what happens,

554
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
Or something bad.

555
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,880
We should share it together.

556
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,920
To share with you.

557
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,720
I don't want you to do anything

558
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,680
Carry it all by yourself.

559
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,880
You care about me so much.

560
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,840
Did you forgive me?

561
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,000
No,

562
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,160
Who is it?

563
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,320
This is Ren Ai Hospital.

564
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,840
Are you Mr. Zimmer?

565
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,600
Yes, it's me.

566
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Su Xiao didn't have chemotherapy today.

567
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,400
I didn't answer her brother's calls.

568
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,760
That's why I contacted you.

569
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,720
The patient's condition

570
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,640
It needs treatment.

571
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,120
If I interrupt,

572
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,040
The previous treatment

573
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,960
It's all in vain.

574
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,920
Alright.

575
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,880
I'm going to find her now.

576
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,080
Allen

577
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,880
Get off at the junction ahead.

578
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,640
Turn back.

579
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,360
Why?

580
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,040
Su Xiao is gone.

581
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,480
Not President Ji.

582
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,200
We finally

583
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,960
Find the old factory director.

584
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,120
If you don't go to see him now,

585
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
The problem of the factory

586
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,360
Can't be solved.

587
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,720
There will be a big problem.

588
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,040
In my opinion,

589
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,960
Let's see if we can find someone else.

590
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,360
Let them find Su Xiao first.

591
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,040
feed

592
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,560
Hello, Ruuo.

593
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,920
I might have to trouble you about something.

594
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,920
Although I know I'm telling you this,

595
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,720
It's inappropriate.

596
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,160
But only if you do it.

597
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,040
I can rest assured.

598
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,440
Is it about Su Xiao?

599
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,720
Yes

600
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,360
She didn't go to chemotherapy today.

601
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,400
And I can't reach her.

602
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,640
I have something important.

603
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,200
Take care of it.

604
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,360
Can you help me go there?

605
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,360
Alright then.

606
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,440
Give me her address.

607
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,480
I'll find her.

608
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,600
Suxiao

609
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,160
Suxiao

610
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,160
Suxiao

611
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,040
Who let you in?

612
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,680
How did you get in?

613
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,280
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

614
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,200
Do I go to the hospital or not?

615
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,120
It's none of your business.

616
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,680
Get out

617
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,360
Go pack up.

618
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,640
I'll take you to the hospital. Let's go.

619
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,560
Why are you pulling me?

620
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,680
Why should you bother me?

621
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
I don't care about you.

622
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,000
Zimmer asked me to come here.

623
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,200
You didn't go for chemotherapy.

624
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,040
He's worried.

625
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,680
And asked me to take you to the hospital.

626
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,800
Have you ever been ill?

627
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,280
Do you know my pain?

628
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,920
I'm not going.

629
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,920
I don't want to go through that again.

630
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,160
I didn't have your disease.

631
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,080
I can't understand how you feel.

632
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,440
But everyone

633
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,760
Has everyone's problems.

634
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,520
Avoiding is not an option.

635
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,360
Face it and solve it.

636
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
Of course you can be confident.

637
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,840
That's right.

638
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,800
You are not me.

639
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,520
You don't know how I feel when I'm sick.

640
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,360
And you must be satisfied.

641
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,480
I will die soon.

642
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,320
No one will compete with you for Jimo.

643
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,360
Suxiao

644
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,240
Wake up.

645
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,280
You're not thinking about Zimmer.

646
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,240
To worry about your health.

647
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,520
You must be satisfied.

648
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,400
I'm like this.

649
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,760
What qualifications do I have?

650
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,920
To steal Qi Mo from you.

651
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,080
I'm telling you,

652
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,760
Don't pretend to be pitiful.

653
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,840
I won't pity you.

654
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,320
I'm telling you,

655
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,200
It's easy to die.

656
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,560
How to live strong.

657
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Is the hardest.

658
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,160
Why are you laughing?

659
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,080
They treat me as a patient.

660
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,040
You don't treat me as a patient.

661
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,360
I'm suddenly happy.

662
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,440
good

663
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,800
What you have to do now

664
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,320
To cure your illness.

665
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,040
When you're ready,

666
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,120
Let's have a try.

667
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,360
Fair competition.

668
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,200
how

669
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,160
The way you are now,

670
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,400
I won't be proud of you.

671
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,160
Don't regret it.

672
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,560
I won't regret it.

673
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,480
Old factory director.

674
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,520
President Ji.

675
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,360
you

676
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,320
Why are you here?

677
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,720
I heard you went back to your hometown.

678
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,680
To see you.

679
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:39,880
this

680
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,240
Why did the factory shut down suddenly?

681
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,160
This is their

682
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,560
Factory Leadership

683
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,440
To make.

684
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,400
I can't help it.

685
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,160
You have your reasons, right?

686
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
I have no reason.

687
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,720
That President Ji

688
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,080
Look.

689
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,000
I have something to do.

690
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,720
Why don't you

691
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,640
Go back first.

692
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,560
Did Rui Qi come to see you?

693
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,480
How do you know?

694
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,040
yes

695
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,239
They did look for me.

696
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,480
it doesn't matter

697
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,719
Just tell me if you want to.

698
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,719
I won't force you.

699
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,960
That Mr. Ji

700
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,920
It's not me.

701
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
Don't talk about old times.

702
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,400
The allergy incident last time.

703
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,719
Which led to a large number of our goods.

704
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,560
Will be redone.

705
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,560
The workers are very angry.

706
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
And our factory

707
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,199
The credibility

708
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,360
And dropped.

709
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,639
Who worked with us before.

710
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,440
Some brands

711
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,040
And terminated our contracts.

712
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,480
At that time,

713
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,280
They found me.

714
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,600
If I'm right,

715
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:44,960
They acquired

716
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,080
All your clothing orders

717
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,760
And only with them.

718
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,400
A team.

719
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,199
Right?

720
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,639
President Ji.

721
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,120
this

722
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,480
You know that.

723
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,120
I guessed it.

724
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,840
What about the allergy?

725
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,600
It's our company, Mr. Wang.

726
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,040
And this Mr.Wang

727
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,920
Was very close to Rui Qi.

728
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,000
So all these things

729
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,120
Ruiqi did it on purpose.

730
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,280
Sit down.

731
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,200
good

732
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You're not working with Wing Fashion.

733
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,640
It's okay.

734
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,560
But I want to tell you something.

735
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,000
This Rui Qi

736
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,840
He used Chenyang

737
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,880
To attack the wing fashion.

738
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,200
After using it,

739
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,160
And kicked it away.

740
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,480
Are you really willing to

741
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,560
For Rui Qi,

742
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,440
And give up wing fashion.

743
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,560
For so many years?

744
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,400
If you want,

745
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,680
Let's sit down and talk.

746
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,680
Can reach

747
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,640
A win-win for Chenyang and Yi Fashion.

748
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,480
Is the best.

749
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,640
President Ji.

750
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,320
What happened last time

751
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,800
To make such a big trouble for you.

752
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,760
you

753
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,200
You're really willing to

754
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,600
And cooperate with Chenyang.

755
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
I'm not only willing to

756
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,680
I'm also willing to add orders.

757
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,320
President Ji.

758
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,640
Really

759
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,600
I didn't even know.

760
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,520
What should I say?

761
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,920
Don't worry.

762
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,600
I promise.

763
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,240
Chenyang

764
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,200
In the future,

765
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,000
To give priority to you.

766
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,320
Wing fashion list.

767
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,160
The quality and quantity are guaranteed.

768
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,960
On time.

769
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,760
I'll send the goods to you.

770
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,880
good

771
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,920
Thank you.

772
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,800
Thank you so much.

773
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,160
feed

774
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,280
If you're a male,

775
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,840
It's not good.

776
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,160
It's all over the Internet now.

777
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,920
The intimate photos of you and Star.

778
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,960
Take a look.

779
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,280
What intimate photos?

780
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,240
It looks like a hug from this angle.

781
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,040
Hurry back.

782
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,200
The boss is mad.

783
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,520
Listen up, everyone.

784
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,560
If the male sister

785
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,520
We're almost there.

786
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,600
During this period,

787
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,000
I will prepare a statement first.

788
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,400
To clarify everything.

789
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,280
False statement.

790
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
If you need it,

791
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,240
We have to resort to legal means.

792
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,080
Then what should we do?

793
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,600
such

794
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,760
Go to the legal department now.

795
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,200
Let them contact and delete.

796
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,440
All the lies.

797
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,840
As low as possible.

798
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,760
The negative influence.

799
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,480
All right.

800
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,960
Remember that.

801
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,400
We must be concise.

802
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,720
To clarify the relationship.

803
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,240
Try not to take too much.

804
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,280
Public resources

805
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,120
Got it?

806
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,040
I understand.

807
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,920
Hurry up.

808
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,440
Hello, hello.

809
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,200
It's my fault.

810
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,120
I'm willing to take all the consequences.

811
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,160
It's my wishful thinking.

812
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,640
It's me.

813
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,320
Sida

814
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,200
Go out first.

815
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,800
I need to talk to my boss.

816
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,160
I have something to tell the boss.

817
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,040
Sida

818
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,160
Go out first.

819
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,760
What's going on between you and Star?

820
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,720
I thought you were

821
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,800
Mature agent.

822
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,280
How can you be with an artist?

823
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,920
Was exposed by others.

824
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,360
I've been in the company for so many years.

825
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,480
Don't you believe that

826
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Who I am?

827
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,600
What about these photos?

828
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,080
Tell me the truth.

829
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,480
Does Star like you?

830
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,200
No

831
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,560
But this matter

832
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,520
It's my responsibility.

833
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,040
I will be responsible.

834
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,000
At present,

835
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,800
You don't fit in.

836
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,520
To work together.

837
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,200
You two must have

838
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,000
To leave alone.

839
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,280
So I can get rid of them.

840
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,640
I know.

841
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
I will leave the company.

842
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,040
Think it through.

843
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,080
As Star's manager,

844
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,200
I have an obligation to protect him.

845
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,440
But this afternoon,

846
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,880
Is his contract renewal ceremony.

847
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,320
I hope that when he signs the contract,

848
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,320
I'll leave the company.

849
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,520
Alright

850
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,800
Before you leave,

851
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,760
Don't have any more problems.

852
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,560
Of course

853
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,120
I assure you,

854
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,760
Why are you here?

855
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,520
Come on.

856
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,200
What about

857
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,240
Are you feeling better recently?

858
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,240
I

859
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,360
It's good.

860
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,720
During this period,

861
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,800
I've figured it out.

862
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Actually, being an ordinary person

863
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,200
It's really good.

864
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,440
In the past,

865
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,360
What scares me the most

866
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,400
No one paid attention to me.

867
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,040
Now, I hope

868
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,880
No one paid attention to me.

869
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,360
Song Zihao is finally able to

870
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,160
In a down-to-earth manner,

871
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,320
And live your own life.

872
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,000
What about you?

873
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,600
You've gone through so much trouble.

874
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
And came here.

875
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,920
Is it because you miss me?

876
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,240
Come and chat with me.

877
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
I just miss you.

878
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,040
Don't bother.

879
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,280
Brother

880
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,440
I want to ask you

881
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,080
Back in the day,

882
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,280
When we terminated the contract,

883
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,240
Do you regret it?

884
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,480
regret

885
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,320
I don't regret it.

886
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,240
What do you mean?

887
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,880
What if there's no If?

888
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,920
There was never

889
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,280
The Song Zihao with boundless scenery.

890
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,320
I shouldn't act rashly.

891
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,240
Devoid of gratitude

892
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
And broke her heart.

893
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,320
Destroyed her work.

894
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,040
Which is myself.

895
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,040
But when I saw Ruuo,

896
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,920
Restart

897
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,480
And found a new one.

898
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,400
You have a dream.

899
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,520
Who knows how to be grateful.

900
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,800
Which is you.

901
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,480
To continue to be her.

902
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,840
The career of a gold manager.

903
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
I won't regret it.

904
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,120
You really think so?

905
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,480
actually

906
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,160
When you were in a car accident,

907
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,760
She felt guilty.

908
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,000
She often goes to the hospital to see you.

909
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,560
To chat with you and massage you.

910
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,600
Or even using the method of provocation.

911
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,680
To wake you up.

912
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,280
But in the end,

913
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,240
But in the end, Tong Tong

914
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,240
And beat us to the punch.

915
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,840
That's why things become

916
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,040
Today,

917
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,080
Actually, this matter

918
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,360
I've been dimly

919
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
I noticed it.

920
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,960
Maybe it was because

921
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,840
I'm jealous of you.

922
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,440
So I have been resistant to admit it.

923
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:42,760
Sida

924
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,520
Thank you for

925
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,680
Can you tell me this?

926
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,760
Although I've moved on now,

927
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,400
But you must

928
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,080
It's better for you.

929
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,520
Otherwise, I will never let you off.

930
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,320
No matter what you are,

931
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,200
I will beat you up.

932
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,520
If you do this,

933
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,040
I want to beat myself up.

934
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,480
Come on, brat.

935
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,200
Say it.

936
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,760
Why are you looking for me today?

937
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,800
I'm looking for you today.

938
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,880
To get an answer.

939
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,720
Now I have the answer.

940
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,680
It's time for me to leave.

941
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,080
Brother

942
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,360
Thank you.

943
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,200
Good luck to you

944
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,440
You too.
