1
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,280
Why are you looking for me today?

2
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,320
I'm looking for you today.

3
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,400
To get an answer.

4
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,240
Now I have the answer.

5
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,200
It's time for me to leave.

6
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,600
Brother

7
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,880
Thank you.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,720
Good luck to you

9
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,960
You too.

10
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,200
This year, we met the stars.

11
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,960
When it comes to star management,

12
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,000
Step onto a new stage.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,640
A year of reaching new heights

14
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,880
We've built the Star

15
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,880
The new generation of outstanding actors.

16
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,760
Let the other artists who debuted in the same period

17
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,120
I can't stand it.

18
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,520
In order to make Star

19
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,640
To have a better development.

20
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,960
The company decided to renew a contract with him.

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,080
For 15 years.

22
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,280
Exclusive brokerage contract.

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,200
I hope we can

24
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,840
On the basis of friendly cooperation,

25
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,040
And create a new miracle.

26
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,640
good

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,960
Then the next step is

28
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,320
To sign the contract.

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,560
Si Da, look at the contract.

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,520
What's wrong?

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,400
If you are not satisfied,

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,480
Just bring it up.

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,640
If there's no problem,

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,840
Then just sign it.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,680
Sorry

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,840
I won't sign the contract.

37
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,560
Because I don't want to do it again.

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,800
If you're an artist,

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,360
There must be some misunderstanding.

40
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,000
Star must be too nervous.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,800
You said the wrong thing.

42
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,200
That's right.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
STAR has always thanked the company

44
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,960
Thank you so much, Ms. Ruo.

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,080
There must be some misunderstanding.

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,280
There's no misunderstanding.

47
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,240
I've thought it through.

48
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,920
I've thought about it seriously.

49
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,520
I don't want to be with Ruonan anymore.

50
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,080
To maintain this working relationship.

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,880
Dugu is like a man.

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,520
Why are you leading an artist?

53
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,400
So I came to renew my contract.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,720
If you're a male,

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,440
Are you really

56
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,240
What did you do?

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,600
Why wouldn't Star

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,560
To work with you.

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Not today's news.

60
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Is it true?

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,160
If you really

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,640
To attack your own male artist.

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,000
This is so embarrassing.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,720
You don't have to slander me.

65
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,320
If you're a man,

66
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,040
This is all

67
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,080
My own decision.

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,800
Sida

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,320
Boss, sorry.

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,400
I have something to talk to him privately.

71
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,560
What are you thinking recently?

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,800
Why are you suddenly

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,880
Remove the brokerage relationship.

74
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,240
It's another company.

75
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,440
To give you a better offer.

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,840
sister

77
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,720
Am I that kind of person?

78
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,960
Are you interested in

79
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,880
Are you satisfied?

80
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,440
You can say whatever you want.

81
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,160
No,

82
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm satisfied with your work.

83
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,120
You're professional.

84
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
Then why didn't you renew your contract?

85
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,520
You left your boss

86
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,440
If you get angry,

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,960
Will affect your development.

88
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,080
I don't care.

89
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,800
Whether in the past or in the future,

90
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,400
The only thing that matters to me is you.

91
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,240
I've never forgotten it.

92
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,000
Your kindness to me

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,920
I can't let it go.

94
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,200
My love for you

95
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,120
Even if you ignore it,

96
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,560
It's real between us.

97
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,160
I have no choice.

98
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,280
To suppress my feelings.

99
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,040
sister

100
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,480
Anyway, the photos have been released.

101
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,440
So I will announce

102
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,400
My love for you.

103
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,040
Are you crazy?

104
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,520
You will ruin yourself.

105
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,560
Even if it destroys me,

106
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,760
I want to protect you.

107
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,120
I don't need your protection.

108
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,920
I won't even

109
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm not your manager.

110
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,920
I won't accept your relationship.

111
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,640
Go in and sign the contract.

112
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
It's impossible, sister.

113
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,640
It's not up to you today.

114
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,680
I don't want to be your artist anymore.

115
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,960
I want to be your man.

116
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,520
Have you discussed it?

117
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,480
We've discussed it.

118
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,040
I still insist on working with Dugu Ruuo Man.

119
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,880
Remove the brokerage relationship.

120
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,840
I disagree.

121
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,480
Boss

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,160
Give me some more time.

123
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,360
I can definitely persuade him.

124
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,080
Boss

125
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,800
Even if Dugu and I

126
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,920
And broke off the relationship.

127
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,840
My contract with the company

128
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,720
Is still valid.

129
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,880
What do you mean?

130
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,760
I can agree.

131
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,000
All your demands

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,760
The term of the dividend contract.

133
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,040
I can do whatever you want.

134
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,960
To do it.

135
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,560
But there are several conditions.

136
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,440
I hope you can satisfy me.

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
It's easy to discuss.

138
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,840
First, I want to remove

139
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,520
And Dugu Ruuo's relationship.

140
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,240
As for the new manager,

141
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,280
I recommend Qiansha.

142
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,000
no problem

143
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,920
As long as you don't go to another company,

144
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,880
Who is the agent?

145
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,680
I don't care.

146
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,560
I disagree.

147
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,560
Boss

148
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,560
Star is the artist I'm responsible for.

149
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,480
You can't just say yes.

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,760
second

151
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,480
The contract renewal was originally

152
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,120
Dugu Ruuo's project dividend.

153
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,080
I hope it can be attributed to

154
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,040
Under her name.

155
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,760
I'm afraid this is not suitable.

156
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
If you do that,

157
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,000
If the male sister is only responsible for

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Counting money.

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,360
And other hard work.

160
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,920
For others.

161
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,480
Without her, there would be no me.

162
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,680
I don't think it's too much.

163
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,680
This problem

164
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,160
It's about your next manager.

165
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
About the salary.

166
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,680
I'll let you know later.

167
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,840
But as long as you work hard,

168
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,080
To make money for the company.

169
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,960
To Ruo.

170
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
You won't lose a penny.

171
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,760
good

172
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,480
The last point.

173
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,080
And the most important thing.

174
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,280
I want Dugu Ruuo Man to return to

175
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,880
As the director of brokerage.

176
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,400
What do you mean?

177
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,640
Boss, you can't listen to him.

178
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,520
Sida

179
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,920
I really don't understand.

180
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,040
What do you mean?

181
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,440
You don't want Dugu to be a man.

182
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,640
To be your manager.

183
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,560
I thought your relationship

184
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
The situation has become tense.

185
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,080
But from beginning to end,

186
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,880
You are trying to help her.

187
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,840
What do you mean?

188
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,200
Isn't it obvious?

189
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,520
The two of them have already discussed it.

190
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,400
And sing the same song.

191
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,800
To drag me down.

192
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
Keeping such a person in the company,

193
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,800
It's disturbing.

194
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,880
The company's ethos?

195
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,240
I'm telling you,

196
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,560
The company has many artists.

197
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,440
I don't need you.

198
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,600
If you take this,

199
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
To threaten the company,

200
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,840
Leave now.

201
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,120
Why are you yelling here?

202
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,960
What are you talking about?

203
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
I think the whole company

204
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,440
You're the worst.

205
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,200
If you want to leave, go.

206
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,360
Is it your turn?

207
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,240
That's enough.

208
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,480
Stop it.

209
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,600
We'll stop here for today.

210
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,320
I'll think about it later.

211
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,320
I'll let you know the result.

212
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,680
Boss

213
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,200
Don't think about it.

214
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,200
Today's news

215
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,160
As you can see,

216
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,720
My existence

217
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,280
I'll definitely

218
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,800
A lot of obstacles.

219
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,360
For his better future,

220
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,440
I'm resigning.

221
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,480
after

222
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,680
I won't have anything to do with him.

223
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,920
Sida

224
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,280
Sida

225
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,320
Get out of the way

226
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,960
I can't help it.

227
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,560
Even if you don't want to listen,

228
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,760
I must say that

229
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,400
Do you know?

230
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,159
Your behavior today

231
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,640
More childish than Song Zihao.

232
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,440
If you do this now,

233
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,720
Not only for your own future,

234
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,559
Irresponsible.

235
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,720
And failed to live up to Ruo.

236
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,880
For your hard work.

237
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,799
I'm sorry for her sacrifice to you.

238
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,160
I thought you were simple and kind.

239
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,920
Even if you love Ruo,

240
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,640
I won't do it.

241
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,960
To hurt others.

242
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,680
But today, you're not only

243
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,040
And hurt her.

244
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,880
You hurt me.

245
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,360
How could you be

246
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,600
Now,

247
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,240
I told you, for her,

248
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,520
I can abandon everyone.

249
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,000
Now I can do it for her.

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,760
And abandon everything.

251
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,720
She gave it to me.

252
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
I don't care.

253
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
I only care about her.

254
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,480
You'll only make everyone

255
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,240
Are getting further and further away from you.

256
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,840
Aren't you afraid that she will never talk to you again?

257
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,560
By then,

258
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,360
You can't even be a friend.

259
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,280
I don't want her to be my friend.

260
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,360
I only want her to be my woman.

261
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,160
Other identities are

262
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,240
What's the point?

263
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,920
Wake up.

264
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,440
No

265
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,000
I broke off the relationship with her.

266
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
You can be a manager.

267
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,480
You always follow her example.

268
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,640
Don't you want to be a manager?

269
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,120
Aren't you happy to be an agent?

270
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,520
You won't let her be your manager.

271
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,080
Because you can't talk to your manager

272
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,200
to court

273
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,840
I became your manager.

274
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,320
I only have a little hope.

275
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,400
Is it all gone?

276
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,960
Si Da, you're really something.

277
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
You got hurt in one day.

278
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,960
The hearts of two women

279
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,840
If you're a male,

280
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,880
Are you really leaving?

281
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,040
Yes

282
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,120
It's a good chance

283
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,320
Take a vacation.

284
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,600
Everything from now on,

285
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,760
I'll leave it to you.

286
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,720
Although you are not mature enough,

287
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,600
You must listen and learn more.

288
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,720
Don't be impulsive.

289
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,720
Do you know

290
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,320
I'm leaving.

291
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,480
If you're a male sister,

292
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,120
Together with you,

293
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,920
We fought side by side for so long.

294
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,720
No matter what credit I have,

295
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,440
Without you.

296
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,440
To work with everyone.

297
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's my pleasure.

298
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,000
Don't be sad.

299
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,720
This was my battlefield.

300
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,520
I don't want to see you

301
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Only tears.

302
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,240
If you're a male,

303
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,880
I don't want you to leave.

304
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,640
I give you one last order.

305
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
You don't have to see me off.

306
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,200
Go back to work.

307
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,480
If you're a male,

308
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,280
The next news

309
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,560
You don't have to be a publicist.

310
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,480
And confirmed that

311
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,040
There must be enough explosive points.

312
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,800
You're going to sacrifice

313
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,240
I

314
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,800
Zombies, zombies alive.

315
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,400
My sister is crazy about Star recently.

316
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,480
If you can help me.

317
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,400
A signed photo of Star.

318
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:54,960
I want one too.

319
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,440
He's so handsome. I really like him.

320
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,760
Si Da, are you really...

321
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,800
You showed your face.

322
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,440
You're popular.

323
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,480
You're really popular, Star.

324
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,480
You're showing your face.

325
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,960
It's on fire.

326
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,400
If you're a male,

327
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,480
You're really a gold broker.

328
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,920
Double tap 666.

329
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,640
The new song release of Star.

330
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,840
Very successful.

331
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,360
It's all because of Ruuo.

332
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,000
I didn't expect that

333
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,480
Are you really letting Star's business

334
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,960
He came back from the dead.

335
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,120
I'm convinced.

336
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,040
sister

337
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,920
You're so nice to me.

338
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,520
I didn't even know.

339
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,960
How can I repay you?

340
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,120
I'll stay with you.

341
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,960
You resigned?

342
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,640
Just because you and Star

343
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,680
The scandal?

344
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,120
Yes

345
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,560
So you're going to raise me.

346
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,480
No, wait a second.

347
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,440
He broke the rules first.

348
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,640
Why should you resign?

349
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,960
He's leaving.

350
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,680
It's not easy for Sida

351
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,880
To this day.

352
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,040
I don't want to affect his career.

353
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,000
What about you?

354
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,040
Is it easy for you?

355
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,200
How could you

356
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,280
To give up on you,

357
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,320
The cause you love.

358
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,880
Besides,

359
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,320
When you were struggling,

360
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,560
You've come through.

361
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,120
Why are you giving up now?

362
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,960
Just take a temporary leave.

363
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,480
Anyway, I'm working.

364
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,280
For so many years,

365
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
You haven't taken a day off.

366
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Now,

367
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,120
Here comes the chance.

368
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,360
I can make it bigger.

369
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,360
Come on.

370
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,880
Don't I know about you?

371
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,920
You're such a workaholic.

372
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,240
Once there's nothing to do,

373
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,920
You will collapse in a few days.

374
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,840
So what if I don't have a job?

375
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,440
I'm also very happy.

376
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,520
It's comfortable, okay?

377
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,800
Bored

378
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,440
Boring

379
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
It's so boring.

380
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,119
Boring

381
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,319
It's okay. I'm done.

382
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,400
Why are you here?

383
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,520
I'm tired from work.

384
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,319
I miss you.

385
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,200
So I came to see you.

386
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,080
today

387
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,800
You can't find me.

388
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,920
I'm a charging treasure.

389
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,320
It's out of power.

390
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,400
Power shortage

391
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,800
So?

392
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm here to charge you.

393
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,360
How about charging it?

394
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,800
Why?

395
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,400
What are you doing?

396
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,400
Public occasions

397
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,840
Let's change it.

398
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,560
Alright

399
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,840
No, no.

400
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,360
I'm full.

401
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,400
Bye

402
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,800
That's enough.

403
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,600
After losing your job,

404
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,680
Your immunity will also decrease?

405
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,000
This will make me

406
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,080
I can't hold it.

407
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,840
The water is spilling.

408
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,520
Sorry

409
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,680
What are you thinking?

410
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,960
I'm worried about you.

411
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,800
I don't know how she's doing.

412
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,280
Why are you worried about her?

413
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,240
She's fine.

414
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,120
How do you know?

415
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,960
You contacted her?

416
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,080
No.

417
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,400
But I know her very well.

418
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,680
In the past few years,

419
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,400
Never experienced it.

420
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,760
It's important for her

421
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,160
It's a piece of cake.

422
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,400
I hope she won't be too sad.

423
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,240
I found you

424
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,160
The brain structure is really amazing.

425
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,320
What's wrong? You're talking about me?

426
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,560
If Yinzhen and Si Da

427
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,360
There's nothing left

428
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,240
Working relationship.

429
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,120
What do you think Star is thinking?

430
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,960
Haven't you been

431
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,760
On the Internet.

432
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,240
Are you still here with me?

433
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,560
The analysis of watching the fire from the sidelines?

434
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,920
In my own backyard.

435
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,800
I don't know.

436
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,760
What should we do?

437
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,720
No way

438
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,960
I have to go back and watch him.

439
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,600
We can't let him take advantage of it.

440
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,640
What now?

441
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,200
Sida wants to pursue Ruo.

442
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,320
Even if I tie him up,

443
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,080
I can't stop him.

444
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,680
let it be

445
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,440
Don't look at him.

446
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,880
I'd better stay here and watch you.

447
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,360
I won't do anything stupid again.

448
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,640
Don't worry.

449
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,000
I take these pills every day.

450
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,760
I feel groggy.

451
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,680
Although you're not happy,

452
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,520
But at least I won't be able to

453
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,040
To think about those things.

454
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,200
Give it to me.

455
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,960
If you take these pills,

456
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,160
I feel nothing every day.

457
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,520
You have nothing to do

458
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,600
What's the difference?

459
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,520
Do you think it's better to be a vegetable?

460
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,280
It's better to

461
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,640
It's good to be a wreck.

462
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:45,960
That Tong Tong

463
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,280
You're too ungrateful.

464
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,640
Back then, if you did your best,

465
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,680
I've been taking her for so long.

466
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,920
To steal her position.

467
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,800
And artists.

468
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,720
Namely

469
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,040
To exclude you,

470
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,080
To suppress Sida by all means.

471
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,280
It's so disgusting.

472
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,880
That's right.

473
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,120
Fortunately, Song Zihao

474
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
I told the reporters.

475
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,040
Otherwise, we wouldn't have known

476
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,160
She's so disgusting.

477
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,440
It's disgusting.

478
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,320
What did you say

479
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,400
What did Song Zihao tell the reporters?

480
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,480
Say it.

481
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,040
Miss Tong Tong.

482
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,680
Miss Tong Tong.

483
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,800
Boss wants to see you.

484
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,720
Urgent business

485
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,200
Boss

486
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,120
stop

487
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,240
Don't go any further.

488
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,360
I don't want to get too close to you.

489
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,760
Boss

490
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,160
I don't know what happened.

491
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,840
Stop pretending with me.

492
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,840
Zihao has sent you

493
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,600
The dirty things I did.

494
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,680
To the reporters.

495
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,240
The company has a man like you.

496
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,800
I'm so embarrassed.

497
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,080
Boss

498
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,160
I can explain.

499
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,840
Don't be angry.

500
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,720
Zi Hao is delirious.

501
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,320
You can't believe what he said.

502
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,720
You can fool others.

503
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,760
Can you fool me?

504
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,120
I found that

505
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,320
You did something behind my back.

506
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,200
But I didn't expect that

507
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
You would go too far.

508
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,680
I

509
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,880
You've been with Ruo Nan for so many years.

510
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,840
I haven't learned any good skills.

511
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,600
To hurt people.

512
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,760
There are many ways.

513
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,920
Who did you learn it from?

514
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,760
I really can...

515
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,680
To explain it clearly.

516
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,720
Explain what? I'm going to

517
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,120
You're dismissed.

518
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,440
You are not allowed to meet the star again.

519
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,880
Boss

520
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,520
Get out

521
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,800
I

522
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,920
sister

523
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,640
Long time no see

524
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Would you like something to drink?

525
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,240
Go ahead. What's wrong?

526
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,600
Tong Tong is in trouble.

527
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,960
Zihao framed her.

528
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,760
About us.

529
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,080
To the reporters.

530
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,800
The boss dismissed her.

531
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,360
I've told her many times.

532
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,080
I didn't expect the retribution to come so soon.

533
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,960
The position of Director of Brokerage

534
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,880
It's free.

535
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,880
Why don't you go back to work in Yuxing?

536
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,120
I don't want to go back.

537
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,440
Is it because of me?

538
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,720
Sorry, sister. I was

539
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,880
When you said that,

540
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,520
I didn't expect that

541
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,960
When you said that,

542
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,760
The ending has been doomed.

543
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,840
Give me another chance.

544
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,080
I won't say that.

545
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,240
I will work hard.

546
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,800
And shoot well.

547
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,640
And become good.

548
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,400
Good enough to qualify.

549
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,440
Standing by your side,

550
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,240
Please trust my sister.

551
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,720
I believe in you.

552
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,920
I believe you can

553
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,160
Realize your dream.

554
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
I sincerely wish you

555
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,600
I don't want a blessing.

556
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,520
But in your future,

557
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,080
Without me,

558
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,480
I hope you can

559
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,200
Your goal moves forward boldly.

560
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,000
Because that's also my dream.

561
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,640
It's also possible that

562
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,440
We can't do that now.

563
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,360
Why not?

564
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,080
Give me another chance.

565
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,720
One more time.

566
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,760
Just once.

567
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,560
I hope everything goes well with you.

568
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,640
Bye

569
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
No, no. Sis.

570
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,160
Sister, please believe me once more.

571
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,080
sister

572
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,720
sister

573
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,720
Give me another chance.

574
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,400
What are you going to say?

575
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,520
I promised you

576
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,800
I'll never talk back to you again.

577
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,760
I just want to stay with you.

578
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,840
Just once.

579
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,160
Star has only one chance.

580
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,400
Star, just once.

581
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,800
I

582
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,280
Please don't make things difficult for me.

583
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,080
I didn't.

584
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,080
To give each other some dignity.

585
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,960
Mr. Zhao.

586
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,440
I just got the news.

587
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,600
The factory director of Chenyang.

588
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,840
Suddenly changed his mind.

589
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,880
He said he wouldn't give up.

590
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,000
With Wing Fashion.

591
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,920
And rejected us.

592
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,120
It seems that

593
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,200
You're really something.

594
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,880
Every time.

595
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,600
He won't be so lucky soon.

596
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,880
President Ji.

597
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,960
You're finally back.

598
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,560
What's up

599
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,680
It's all over the Internet today.

600
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,400
Wing Fashion is selling out of stock.

601
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,920
To cover up your allergy.

602
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,080
This morning,

603
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,480
The stock has dropped to the limit.

604
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,280
The securities company said there are many more.

605
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,560
The selling commission is under pressure.

606
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,640
President Ji.

607
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,440
How to do it?

608
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,120
The negative news of Wing Fashion

609
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,920
From last night,

610
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,000
And started to ferment.

611
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,600
And spread like crazy.

612
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,200
The click rate is obviously higher than

613
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,520
The normal speed of news

614
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,080
Someone should be

615
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,240
To target us from behind.

616
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,600
How to do it?

617
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,400
The directors are on their way here.

618
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,400
There will be an emergency meeting later.

619
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,920
The news

620
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,080
Only the people inside our company

621
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,000
So I will know.

622
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,760
Are you saying that

623
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,640
There's a mole.

624
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,920
Get ready.

625
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,880
Let's go now.

626
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
Catch the mole.

627
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,520
good

628
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,040
You dare not say it.

629
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,960
I said,

630
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,280
President Ji.

631
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,200
You must give us

632
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,080
One explanation.

633
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,160
Are you right?

634
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,480
Yes

635
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,200
That's right.

636
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,800
You have to make up for it.

637
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,680
Our loss

638
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,440
What now?

639
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,480
everybody

640
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,800
The workers of the factory

641
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,000
Has returned to work.

642
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,840
The group is also moving towards

643
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,800
In the normal orbit,

644
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,040
And the stock price

645
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,880
Suddenly dropped.

646
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,840
There must be someone behind it.

647
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,880
So please calm down.

648
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,480
Give me some more time.

649
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,360
I will definitely give you

650
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,040
One explanation.

651
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,760
There's no time.

652
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,880
Just for today,

653
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,360
Ji, I beg you.

654
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,480
Don't take empty promises.

655
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,840
To fool everyone.

656
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,680
I'm stupid. We are not stupid.

657
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,160
Yes, President Ji.

658
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,160
The news

659
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,960
The description is clear and detailed.

660
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,880
And in this case,

661
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,360
Only the people inside our group

662
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,240
I will know.

663
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,440
Which means our

664
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,680
There was a mole inside the group.

665
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,440
What traitor?

666
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,880
Are you shooting a TV series?

667
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,520
Don't put your problems

668
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,600
To others.

669
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,720
We are all old shareholders.

670
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,800
How could there be a mole?

671
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,400
That's right.

672
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,960
I will definitely find out

673
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,160
The person behind it.

674
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,440
Please calm down.

675
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,880
Go back and wait for the wedding.

676
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,240
Allen

677
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,560
Ask Wang to come to my office.

678
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,920
He's here.

679
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,480
President Ji.

680
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,080
You need me?

681
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,280
Sit down first.

682
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:29,960
good

683
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,440
Sit there.

684
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,760
That chair is comfortable.

685
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,400
We can talk about it.

686
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,800
The internal leak today.

687
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,040
Which caused the stock price to fall.

688
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,840
As the elder of the group,

689
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,080
What do you think?

690
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,640
Mr. Ji, CEO.

691
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,000
The stock price is stable.

692
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,080
It's your responsibility.

693
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,640
If there's no problem,

694
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,600
I'm leaving now.

695
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,840
to wait a moment

696
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,680
Of all the shareholders today,

697
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,240
You are the most anxious to be held accountable.

698
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,160
You seem to care about this.

699
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,880
I really want to know

700
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,120
Who is the leak?

701
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,400
I

702
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,480
I don't want to know.

703
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,320
I don't care.

704
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,720
But Zimmer

705
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,040
I want to remind you

706
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,520
Even if someone wants to reveal something,

707
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
We must have news first.

708
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,160
There are no waves without wind

709
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,800
Old Wang.

710
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,320
If you really care about wing fashion,

711
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,040
Don't do it for selfish interests.

712
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,920
To cause harm.

713
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,040
For everyone's benefit.

714
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,520
I want us to stand

715
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,640
On the same front,

716
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,880
And ride out the storm together.

717
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,520
According to President Ji,

718
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,960
You suspect that I'm a mole.

719
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,160
I was not sure it was you.

720
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,840
But your performance today

721
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,240
Too anxious.

722
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,120
Old Wang.

723
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,720
I don't want to be your enemy.

724
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,120
Go back in time.

725
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,760
When the group was founded,

726
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,600
You are the director.

727
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,920
And my most trusted partner.

728
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,960
trust

729
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:37,880
Zimmer

730
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,040
My proposal at the board meeting

731
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,320
I've been repeatedly denied by you.

732
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,360
You hit me in the face in public.

733
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,320
You trusted me.

734
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,120
From the establishment of wing fashion to now,

735
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,040
As long as you make the decision,

736
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,960
I don't care if it hurts.

737
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,360
I have your back.

738
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,760
But you want to empty me.

739
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,840
You trusted me.

740
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,080
today

741
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,680
You suspect a mole?

742
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,800
I was the first person I thought of.

743
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,120
How dare you say you trust me?

744
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,720
I've always been wrong.

745
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,840
Everything I've done

746
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,000
It's all for the good of the group.

747
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,200
Ji, you're so talkative.

748
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,800
Old season.

749
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,000
Dare you touch your conscience?

750
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,760
That you didn't do it for selfish reasons.

751
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,760
And abused his power.

752
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,920
You don't have to say it.

753
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,800
Let me tell you something.

754
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,480
To support Sida.

755
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,560
To protect Chen Fei.

756
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,480
why

757
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,960
To pursue

758
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,760
Dugu is a man?

759
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
no problem

760
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,640
You used my hard-earned money

761
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,000
You can play with women.

762
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,760
As long as you're my brother,

763
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,360
But you can't put these words

764
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,000
That's too high-sounding.

765
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,760
You're doing it for the good of the group.

766
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,000
It sounds disgusting to me.

767
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,240
Old Wang.

768
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,040
What you used to say.

769
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,720
It's called doing business.

770
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,560
I'll sign with Star Chen Fei'er.

771
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,760
Because of their business value.

772
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,400
It turns out that they are also

773
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,640
Brought great benefits.

774
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,600
Don't you think so?

775
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,120
As for Ruuo,

776
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,640
She's my personal affair.

777
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,240
It has nothing to do with wing fashion.

778
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,360
The company has come so far.

779
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,600
Is it me?

780
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,800
It's not

781
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,200
It depends on everyone's efforts.

782
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,560
My gains and losses alone

783
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,280
For the company,

784
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,440
It's really not worth mentioning.

785
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,200
There's another company.

786
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,280
What's the most important thing?

787
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,880
It's not a benefit. It is a person.

788
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,720
Also

789
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,720
Although the shortcut is fast,

790
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,760
But it will never reach the end.

791
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,240
Old season.

792
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,680
You know what bothers me the most?

793
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,840
I hate it when you act like a saint.

794
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,520
You raised me high and mighty.

795
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,680
since

796
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,720
You said everything you did

797
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,920
It's all for the good of the group.

798
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,360
To say the least,

799
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,200
Even if I leak the news,

800
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,720
I can also say that

801
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm doing it for the good of the group.

802
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,560
You're not good to the group.

803
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,840
You know very well.

804
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,040
About the allergy to the fabric.

805
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,160
You're using that inside story

806
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,680
To create rumors to slander the company.

807
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,200
Are you doing this for the group?

808
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,680
It's useless to say more.

809
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,240
Forget that I didn't

810
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,120
Hold on to you.

811
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,480
This mistake won't happen again.

812
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,320
grasp

813
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,520
Zimmer

814
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,760
I take you as my brother.

815
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,400
Are you using me as a puppet?

816
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,520
wait and see

817
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,400
Mr. Zhao.

818
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,080
Zimmer and I

819
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,320
But it's over.

820
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,960
Now he knows these things.

821
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
I did it.

822
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,240
There should be action.

823
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,680
What should we do?

824
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,960
Don't worry.

825
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,080
He'll soon lose his mind.

826
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,520
It's none of your business.

827
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,200
Alright.

828
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,120
good

829
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,120
Mr. Zhao seems to have a good idea.

830
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:04,840
You know,

831
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,320
Things on my side

832
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,400
You don't have to worry about it.

833
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,480
I'll contact you if there's anything else.

834
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,280
That's it.

835
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,040
good

836
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,760
Master me.

837
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,760
Xiao Wu.

838
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,280
in

839
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,000
The investment department

840
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,080
Are you ready?

841
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,920
Don't worry, Mr. Zhao.

842
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,800
According to your wish,

843
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,520
It's arranged.

844
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,480
Inform them.

845
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,639
Tomorrow morning,

846
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,920
And started to acquire shares.

847
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,080
yes

848
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,600
President Ji.

849
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,280
Old Wang is the one

850
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,200
The person who leaked the information

851
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,560
How did you find out?

852
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,680
At the meeting today,

853
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Wang's body movements

854
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
Is bigger than usual.

855
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,280
It means he's bluffing.

856
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,120
To get the approval of others,

857
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,800
When I pointed out the mole,

858
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,160
His eyebrows went up.

859
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
Eyes wide open.

860
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,040
Your mouth is slightly open.

861
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,480
Just like what you have now.

862
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,160
Obviously,

863
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,840
He didn't expect that

864
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,560
I could sense it so quickly.

865
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,400
Who leaked the secret?

866
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,640
Old Wang is so fierce today.

867
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,320
I didn't expect he was the mole.

868
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,720
Your office

869
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,280
It's too cold.

870
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,600
I turned down the temperature on purpose.

871
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,200
Why?

872
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,200
In certain situations,

873
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,640
The low temperature and the rhythm noise

874
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,360
Can aggravate people's anxiety.

875
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,840
President Ji.

876
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,360
Are you looking for me?

877
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,560
Today, I told Wang

878
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,680
Several times.

879
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,480
Trying to break through his psychological defense.

880
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,480
Although he has been patient,

881
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,760
And kept quiet.

882
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,840
But subconsciously,

883
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,720
There's a lot of hand movements.

884
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,760
To find the fulcrum.

885
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,640
It shows that he is extremely

886
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,680
Nervous and upset.

887
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,720
So I'm pretty sure

888
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,280
The person who leaked the information is him.

889
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,280
What should we do now?

890
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,720
Now I'm struggling.

891
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,720
Who leaked the secret?

892
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,760
It's meaningless.

893
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,080
The most important thing is

894
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,320
Now the major shareholders and directors

895
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,360
Has made a big difference

896
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,280
Losing confidence.

897
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,440
They are likely to have a large number of

898
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,760
Sell your stocks.

899
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,040
So to get to this situation,

900
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,880
Before it happened,

901
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,920
Take action.

902
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,080
What should we do next?

903
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,720
I'll talk to them.

904
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,240
Keep them steady.

905
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,800
Or the consequences will be too bad.

906
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,480
Why are you here?

907
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,680
I lost my job.

908
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,040
I'm bored.

909
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,960
So I came to see you.

910
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Do you think

911
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,560
You're irritating a patient.

912
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,680
Are you interesting?

913
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,360
I heard you haven't been eating well recently.

914
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,360
I just passed by.

915
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,840
Your favorite Cantonese cuisine.

916
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,400
I brought you some.

917
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,120
I don't want you to pretend to be kind.

918
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,640
Don't hang around here.

919
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,960
Are you trying to piss me off?

920
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Actually, I don't care.

921
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,520
Do you hate me?

922
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,960
And I'll come often.

923
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,280
If you don't want to see me,

924
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,800
Get well as soon as possible.

925
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,440
Maybe in the end,

926
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,960
Who defeated the disease.

927
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,480
Is not the power of love.

928
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,840
But the power of the devil.

929
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,120
I don't have time to argue with you.

930
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,880
Now the company has

931
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,640
It's such a big deal.

932
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,840
I have to go back and help him.

933
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,400
What happened?

934
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,640
Didn't Zimmer tell you?

935
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,600
The company's board is in turmoil.

936
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,040
Wing Fashion shares tumble

937
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,000
His situation is very difficult.

938
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,640
It seems he cares too much about you.

939
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,880
yes

940
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,160
You can be behind his back.

941
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,440
To be a happy fool.

942
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,440
But I can't.

943
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,200
I have to go back and help him.

944
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,120
How can you help?

945
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,360
I doubt that

946
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,520
Was planned by my brother.

947
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,720
Because of my illness,

948
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,320
I've been holding a grudge against Zimmer.

949
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,640
And because of your choice,

950
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,880
That's why I hate him.

951
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,160
I know my brother.

952
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,640
He didn't achieve his goal.

953
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,800
Won't let it go.

954
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,880
I have to stop him.

955
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,800
I'll go.

956
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,640
There's my reason.

957
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,240
I'll have a talk with him.

958
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,240
Are you looking for me?

959
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,440
Yes

960
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,400
I have some things

961
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,160
To figure it out,

962
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,680
good

963
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,680
what?

964
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,240
Wing Fashion recently.

965
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,640
There are many problems.

966
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,920
Did you cause it?

967
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,240
that's right

968
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,960
Because of business practices.

969
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,440
Or is it personal?

970
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,200
My goal is not wing fashion.

971
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
It's Zimmer.

972
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,080
It's because of Su Xiao.

973
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,840
And you.

974
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,600
This is not what I want to see.

975
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,160
This wouldn't be

976
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,400
What Su Xiao wants to see

977
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,760
But this is what I want to see.

978
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,360
He hurt two people.

979
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,720
The woman I care about the most

980
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,040
And pay the price.

981
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,560
What do you have to do to let go?

982
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,680
When you are with me,

983
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,960
I'll stop.

984
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,240
You're the kind of person

985
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,360
As the one who made the deal.

986
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,120
Won't be able to defeat Qi Mo.

987
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,240
Because you were born

988
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,960
Is a loser.

989
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:53,920
you

990
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,240
Are you crazy?

991
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,840
that's right

992
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,160
I'm crazy.

993
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,480
Since I was little,

994
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,800
As long as it's what I want,

995
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,640
I've never missed anything.

996
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,200
No matter who he was,

997
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,280
No matter what the situation is,

998
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,160
How bad it is.

999
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,440
I always calm down.

1000
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,720
You always wait until the other person loses control first.

1001
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,360
So I became the winner.

1002
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
But if a man

1003
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,520
When I saw you,

1004
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,040
The one who loses control every time,

1005
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,600
Instead, it became me.

1006
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,600
If a man

1007
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,360
Remember,

1008
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,680
You must be my

1009
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,160
I won't give you a chance.

1010
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,280
Because of Zimmer,

1011
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,880
Yes

1012
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,280
Because of Zimmer.

1013
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,640
If a man

1014
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,920
Please take a good look.

1015
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,720
Wing Fashion's Board of Directors

1016
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,680
Has questioned Zimmer.

1017
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,720
Wing Fashion stocks

1018
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,560
We've fallen sharply these days.

1019
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,640
With internal and external troubles,

1020
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,480
You think

1021
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,400
How many chances does he have?

1022
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,640
As long as you agree to be with me,

1023
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,240
I'll let him off.

1024
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,840
You think I'm the kind of person

1025
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,440
A girl of 17 or 18 years old.

1026
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,240
To act with you.

1027
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,080
And had to break up.

1028
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,800
This childish drama

1029
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,880
Don't even think about it.

1030
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,000
Even if Zimmer loses today,

1031
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,480
I will stand with him.

1032
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,000
And I believe

1033
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,560
He will never lose to you.

1034
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,680
So are you sure

1035
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,360
To be my enemy.

1036
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,960
Zimmer's position

1037
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,120
Is my stance.

1038
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,280
When you decided to

1039
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,160
When you were enemies,

1040
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,920
We can't be friends.

1041
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,840
Zimmer

1042
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,080
Tell me.

1043
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,920
Is your company

1044
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,240
Something serious happened.

1045
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,480
I went to see Zhao Yucheng.

1046
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,520
He said I was with him.

1047
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,240
He will let you off.

1048
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,480
But I rejected him.
