1
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,760
She did it because she loved you.

2
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,760
Where's Su Xiao?

3
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
I'm asking you.

4
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,760
Where is Su Xiao?

5
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,840
You're late.

6
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,480
Su Xiao has left.

7
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,240
It's impossible.

8
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,720
Now I remember to visit her.

9
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Where did you go before?

10
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
When she needed you,

11
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,680
where were you?

12
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,800
When she came to chemotherapy alone,

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,680
where were you?

14
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,320
Aren't you a psychologist?

15
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,480
Can't you see

16
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,320
the patient's mind clearly?

17
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Why can't you tell that

18
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,640
she's lying? She's lying to you.

19
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,120
She's gone.

20
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Remember,

21
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,080
you are the murderer.

22
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,960
Aren't you a psychologist?

23
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,120
Can't you see

24
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
the patient's mind clearly?

25
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Why can't you tell that

26
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,280
she's lying? She's lying to you.

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Remember,

28
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,680
you are the murderer.

29
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
I'm here.

30
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
I'm here.

31
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
What are you doing in the morning?

32
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,200
What are you doing here?

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,960
Ji Mo and I kissed.

34
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,080
Three times in total.

35
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,240
It's okay if you're in love

36
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,360
with the man I like,

37
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,800
It's still

38
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
early in the morning,

39
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,080
You came to stimulate me,

40
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,880
and you even told me the details,

41
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
How many times have you kissed?

42
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,680
Insane.

43
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,320
Before last night,

44
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,640
I really didn't think about it.

45
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,600
What does it have to do with him?

46
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,520
He didn't tell me.

47
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,440
He likes me.

48
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,960
But his performance today,

49
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,040
is totally different,

50
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,960
I find it strange.

51
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Don't be surprised.

52
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,080
That's it.

53
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,840
I did it too.

54
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,760
You have feelings for someone.

55
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,800
And you want to give it a try.

56
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
But how about a try?

57
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
You found that it didn't feel right,

58
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,160
so you had to play dumb.

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,160
After a while,

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,000
just pretend that

61
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,840
nothing has happened.

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,360
But,

63
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,440
you really don't like him?

64
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,600
I don't know.

65
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,040
He's not my type at all.

66
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,880
But the weird thing is,

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,280
as long as I'm happy or unhappy,

68
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,880
I always think of him.

69
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,160
He seems to be able to

70
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
affect my emotions.

71
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,040
And I seem to be used to

72
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,960
his presence.

73
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,200
Let me think about it.

74
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,320
Based on my years of experience,

75
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,440
you two must like

76
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,840
each other,

77
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,000
However,

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,280
both of you still have

79
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,280
some concerns,

80
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,560
No one took the initiative

81
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,120
to pierce this layer of paper.

82
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,720
I'm worried a lot.

83
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,800
Ji Mo has an ex-girlfriend,

84
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,640
and he seems to

85
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,400
care about her past.

86
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,840
To deal with old love,

87
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,960
I have plenty of tricks.

88
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,800
I'll teach you a few unique cheats.

89
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,160
Okay, listen to me. Forget it,

90
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,560
Forget it,

91
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,640
Dugu Ruonan,

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,680
How many years have you been single?

93
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,280
It's not easy for you

94
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,240
to meet someone who has a crush on you,

95
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,400
You're telling me now,

96
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,120
just because you finally

97
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,040
met someone who's in love,

98
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,600
That's why you have to be careful.

99
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,960
When I was in my twenties,

100
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,160
I could do whatever I wanted,

101
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,280
Now that I'm old,

102
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,840
I'm worried a lot.

103
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,480
Besides,

104
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,960
why should I take the initiative?

105
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,720
Men are so unreliable.

106
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,680
Better work?

107
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,720
Work hard.

108
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,880
Where are you going?

109
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Go to work,

110
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,040
Worker,

111
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,160
Then why did you pull me up

112
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,400
so early in the morning?

113
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,440
Come in,

114
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,800
Mr. Ji,

115
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,520
you're not off work yet.

116
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,280
I won't leave

117
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,040
until I'm done with these things.

118
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,760
Did you quarrel

119
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
with Ruonan again?

120
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,040
I don't want to go home.

121
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,880
Indeed,

122
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,080
you can't go back to that house.

123
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,480
Why?

124
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,680
Don't you live well?

125
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,400
Come to a place

126
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,120
with me. Where?

127
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,760
Let's go home.

128
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,960
So sudden?

129
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,840
There's no process.

130
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,920
Go home and move,

131
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,280
Move. Move.

132
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,520
Mr. Ji,

133
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,320
what are you doing?

134
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,760
You had a fight with Ruonan again,

135
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,480
actually,

136
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,160
I think it's good for you to live here.

137
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,440
Although you quarrel from time to time,

138
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
and your emotions are sometimes good and sometimes bad,

139
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,040
But at least,

140
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,520
you've become a little human.

141
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,800
Really?

142
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,880
Even you think I've changed.

143
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
In the past,

144
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,640
I always thought you were like a robot,

145
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,680
Living alone in a hotel,

146
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
it's so quiet,

147
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,920
Keep a distance from others.

148
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,040
Nothing

149
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,720
can affect your mood.

150
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,920
However,

151
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,840
ever since I met Ruonan,

152
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,560
I don't feel so lonely anymore.

153
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,920
When it comes to people and things,

154
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
you need to be more or less emotional.

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,520
I don't need feelings for now.

156
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,200
Mr. Ji,

157
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,120
maybe we won't move.

158
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Don't break Ruonan's heart

159
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,000
in a fit of anger.

160
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,280
I'm not angry.

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,919
Move out now,

162
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,880
It's the best choice

163
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,039
for both me and her.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,799
Fine.

165
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,640
Mr. Ji,

166
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,000
we've almost moved all the stuff,

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,760
Are you leaving?

168
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,880
Get in the car first.

169
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
In order to avoid unnecessary trouble,

170
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
during the contract period,

171
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,760
You can't fall in love with each other.

172
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,280
Those who disobey must move out.

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,480
You think too much.

174
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,880
Even if I'm blind,

175
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,320
this kind of thing won't happen.

176
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,760
If I fall in love with you,

177
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
I'll move out immediately.

178
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,200
Mr. Wang is not bad,

179
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,560
Mr. Li Mr. Li

180
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,200
Is there anything lately?

181
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,120
A chance suitable for our Star Group.

182
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
Don't forget

183
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,040
to promote him more.

184
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,920
Sida,

185
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,680
come here. Sit here.

186
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,200
You see,

187
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,720
although Sida is still a newcomer,

188
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,440
But he has a good image and a bright future.

189
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,080
I hope Mr. Li can help us a lot.

190
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,040
If there's any chance,

191
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,960
he can be promoted

192
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,520
and you can see what he wants.

193
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,320
Is the light shape good? Do you know

194
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,840
any talent or special skills?

195
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,920
A lot of talent,

196
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,960
can dance,

197
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
He can dance,

198
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,720
dance and martial arts.

199
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,040
You can dance, right?

200
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
Okay. Let's dance.

201
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,680
Just in time to relieve our boredom.

202
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,520
Okay.

203
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,400
No problem.

204
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,000
Sida?

205
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,200
Here's to you.

206
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,760
Stop! Stop!

207
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Anything else?

208
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
I know martial arts too.

209
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,640
All right,

210
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
all right. A lot of Hengdian

211
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,920
who knows martial arts,

212
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,440
Someone like you

213
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,680
wants to be a star?

214
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,520
Stop dreaming!

215
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,720
I'm a little nervous.

216
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,840
Here's to you.

217
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,440
Can you sing?

218
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,440
Hui just practiced a song

219
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,560
recently. Sing it.

220
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,000
Sis,

221
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,360
Mr. Li, don't you think I,

222
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,800
Mr. Li, said you were very nice?

223
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,320
He's very impressed with you.

224
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,120
Especially

225
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,360
the last song,

226
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,680
It's very emotional.

227
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm about to cry.

228
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,200
Young man,

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you're very talented,

230
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,120
Thank you.

231
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,320
Sida?

232
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,840
This is Mr. Wu,

233
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,840
a famous music director in the circle.

234
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,440
A lot of big names are working with him.

235
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:37,840
I dare not.

236
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,040
This is our newcomer Miss Sida

237
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,720
Hello I'm Sida,

238
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,440
Sida?

239
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,040
I like your tone very much.

240
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,560
The high note part of the song just now

241
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
needs to be dealt with.

242
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,200
But if we train him,

243
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,880
I think he can achieve great things.

244
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,640
Thank you, mentor.

245
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,120
Sida is still a newcomer.

246
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,240
I hope to have the opportunity

247
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,080
to work with a big shot like you,

248
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,320
I don't dare to be a big shot,

249
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,320
Me

250
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,640
Think about it.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
I'll give you a message.

252
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,360
Okay,

253
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,520
-Thank you. -Goodbye.

254
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,960
He is a famous producer

255
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,000
in the circle,

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,160
He said hello,

257
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,240
you should have a good chance.

258
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,520
Kid,

259
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,920
you've improved a lot.

260
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,160
Let's go. I'll treat you to dinner.

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,040
What's wrong, sister?

262
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,560
My feet are sore,

263
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,520
so I've been toasting

264
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,120
with Mr. Li today,

265
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,400
So now your feet hurt a little.

266
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,760
It's my fault. Let me rub it

267
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,720
for you. No need. No need.

268
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,560
No, thanks.

269
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,640
You've been a good boy.

270
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,160
It's worth it if I'm tired.

271
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,200
But you surprised me

272
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,280
tonight.

273
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,160
Really?

274
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,360
I think you've grown up all of a sudden.

275
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,920
Right?

276
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,360
I feel like I've grown up, too,

277
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,960
Sis,

278
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,040
I've already thought about it.

279
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,120
I have to hurry to grow up,

280
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,600
and then I can take care of you.

281
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,000
Take care of yourself.

282
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,920
little devil; goblin; Lil Ghost

283
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,760
No, actually, I also

284
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,640
have your beef noodles,

285
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,440
-Thank you. -Enjoy. Thank you.

286
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,640
Hurry up and eat.

287
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,160
I don't think

288
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,360
you ate anything just now,

289
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,760
I can tell you're hungry.

290
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,880
I'm welcome then.

291
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,800
I'm starting.

292
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,400
recently

293
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,040
Thank you so much.

294
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,640
You have classes during the day,

295
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,240
and you have to socialize with me at night.

296
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,480
No need to work hard.

297
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,720
I can't help it.

298
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,680
We can't just sit back and eat,

299
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,400
I used to treat you to a big meal,

300
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,040
now

301
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,560
I can only treat you to a roadside stall.

302
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,520
What's wrong with the street stall?

303
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,760
The street stall is delicious.

304
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,480
For me, the roadside stall

305
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,440
is already very good.

306
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,320
I used to eat

307
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,720
spoiled steamed bread and rice, right?

308
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,240
Spoiled steamed bread and rice,

309
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,960
don't your parents care about you?

310
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,920
My parents

311
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,160
have been working in the city

312
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,600
since I was little.

313
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,960
I've been staying at

314
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,840
my aunt's house,

315
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,640
Auntie dislikes me,

316
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,600
thinks I'm a burden,

317
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,680
She has a bad temper.

318
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,640
She thinks,

319
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,320
I can only eat

320
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,280
those leftovers,

321
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,160
That's why I have a problem

322
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,040
with girls.

323
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,960
I thought this kind of situation

324
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,800
would only happen in series.

325
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,560
Did it really happen to you?

326
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,920
Poor girl.

327
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,720
Then why haven't you told me

328
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,000
about this experience before,

329
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,880
Because I'm afraid,

330
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,080
I'll be abandoned by you again.

331
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,320
I always think,

332
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,600
as a child nobody wants,

333
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,520
I used to be

334
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,080
very afraid of sleeping,

335
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,200
I just took a nap,

336
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,520
and when I woke up, I found that

337
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,800
there was no one next to me.

338
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,720
I feel abandoned by the whole world.

339
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,880
Really?

340
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
It's hard.

341
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,360
But not now.

342
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,240
Now I know,

343
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,920
Sis,

344
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,480
You will never abandon me.

345
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,040
Right?

346
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,120
Yes.

347
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,400
Don't worry.

348
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,280
I won't abandon you.

349
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,680
But you can't run away

350
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,200
like you did last time.

351
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,320
I swear.

352
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,320
I will never run away again.

353
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,040
Eat it.

354
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,000
Are you back?

355
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,480
Originally,

356
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,800
I didn't want to talk to you.

357
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,599
But

358
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,040
since I'm in a good mood today,

359
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,319
I have a piece of good news for you.

360
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,280
You didn't even tell me when you left.

361
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,720
Okay.

362
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,680
Let's go.

363
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,520
Don't come back if you leave.

364
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,080
It's clean when you can't see.

365
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,880
Party A's breach of contract is invalid,

366
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,160
Ji Mo.

367
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,320
Mr. Ji,

368
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,880
how long will you stay this time?

369
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,920
One year,

370
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,360
seem

371
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,920
Every time you go on a business trip,

372
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,800
you spend a lot of time.

373
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,840
That's right.

374
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,640
It'll be the same as before.

375
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,600
I'll deliver cleaning items to you

376
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,040
on time every day.

377
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,280
If there's a visitor,

378
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,160
I'll contact you.

379
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,080
No visitors.

380
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,040
Just me.

381
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,160
Okay.

382
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,680
Enjoy your stay.

383
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,320
The neat freak is finally gone.

384
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,400
I'm the only one left in this family.

385
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,400
That's great.

386
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,680
No one cares about me anymore.

387
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,520
Five centimeters apart.

388
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,120
I told you to be five centimeters apart.

389
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,440
Don't touch personal belongings, right?

390
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,920
I want to touch it.

391
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,720
You have to touch

392
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,800
the house. You can't mess it up, right?

393
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,000
I messed it up.

394
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,920
I'll never talk to you again.

395
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,880
Mess it all up.

396
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,120
Mess it up. Mess it up.

397
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,760
I can live a good life on my own.

398
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,720
You'd better never come back.

399
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,440
I'll let you go.

400
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,960
Then you really left.

401
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,240
Tong,

402
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,240
this is the script and proposal

403
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,480
sent by the film and television company.

404
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,840
There are a few projects that are not bad.

405
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,000
Please have a look.

406
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,840
From now on, don't show me

407
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,080
these stupid things anymore.

408
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,400
What I care about is,

409
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,480
how much money can the other party give me?

410
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,880
How much is the production cost?

411
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,920
Is the cast strong enough?

412
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,840
Who has time

413
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,880
to look at this crap,

414
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,680
Why don't you just go and sift it?

415
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,160
But if the script is not good,

416
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,240
the broadcast effect will not be good.

417
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,720
Zihao's future development

418
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,560
will be affected.

419
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,920
Affected by what?

420
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,240
Go

421
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,160
Ask the planning department to re-screen,

422
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,840
I want those

423
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,160
with high pay and short cycle,

424
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,280
If two projects with the same pay

425
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,800
hit the deadline,

426
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,000
Let them talk about it.

427
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,040
Go as far as you can.

428
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,200
Anyway, the project is short of actors.

429
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,680
It's not like the actors are short of projects.

430
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,320
What's more,

431
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,000
You can also look for reality shows.

432
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,080
Those can promote popularity,

433
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,000
and they can pay a lot of money.

434
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,400
But before,

435
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,680
Zihao never took on a reality show,

436
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,960
Ruonan also said,

437
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,600
reality shows consume actors

438
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,680
What do you mean by "Ruonan"?

439
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,720
Do you want to listen to me

440
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,840
or her.

441
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,680
Of course I'll listen to you, Tong.

442
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,640
When she took Zihao with her,

443
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
she only looked at these stupid things every day.

444
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,760
I didn't make any money,

445
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,720
offended a circle of people,

446
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,200
Do we have to

447
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,480
learn from her now?

448
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,800
Get out.

449
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,040
Okay, Tong.

450
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,480
If Dugu is a man,

451
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,720
why are you so haunting me?

452
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,680
I just want to go against you.

453
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,120
Let me see,

454
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,840
who will have the last laugh?

455
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,080
Sister, this company is so big.

456
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,320
Hello, sir. Nice

457
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,600
to meet you again.

458
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,600
Sida

459
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,480
Hello, Miss Sida. Hello,

460
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,040
Miss Sida. Hello, Miss Sida.

461
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,120
Sit down.

462
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,360
I'm looking for you today.

463
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,040
There is a chance.

464
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,280
I want to introduce it to Sida,

465
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,160
but I don't know if you'd like to,

466
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,520
Of course.

467
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,880
There must be a good chance

468
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,840
for you to introduce me.

469
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,400
Okay, I'll get straight to the point.

470
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,280
The TV station invited me

471
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
to do a selection program

472
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,960
for a singer reality show,

473
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,880
I think Sida is a good candidate,

474
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,760
though she's still a little rusty

475
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,880
in singing skills.

476
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,200
I don't have much experience on stage,

477
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,760
but there's room for improvement.

478
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,040
But there are pros and cons

479
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,400
to this show,

480
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,520
It depends on how you choose to go

481
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
Of course

482
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,920
Sida?

483
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,560
I want to hear your opinion.

484
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,840
I listened to Ruonan,

485
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,000
and I'll go if Ruonan says I'll go.

486
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,080
As a man, sometimes decisions

487
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,840
are made on your own.

488
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,680
But I've rarely seen

489
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,200
such an obedient and sensible artist,

490
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,960
Okay,

491
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,040
Then I'll recommend Star

492
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,200
to the TV station,

493
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,160
But I'm just recommending,

494
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,840
as to whether I can get the ranking,

495
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,440
It depends on your personal ability.

496
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,600
Even if we were eliminated in the preliminary round,

497
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,720
we were very satisfied.

498
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,320
Thank you

499
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,240
for giving a newcomer

500
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,400
like Sida a chance,

501
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,600
You're welcome.

502
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,160
I also want to use this program

503
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,360
to find talents and encourage talents.

504
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,080
By the way,

505
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,560
in this show,

506
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,200
There is also an original part,

507
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,280
which is to test the singer's original ability.

508
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,440
In this respect,

509
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,800
Star should be weak.

510
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
I think

511
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,880
you should prepare for him

512
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,200
in advance.

513
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Okay, got it.

514
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,320
Sis,

515
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,040
What is original?

516
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,680
Originality means writing lyrics and composing music,

517
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,880
but I just started training,

518
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,120
I don't know how to write it.

519
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,720
What should I do?

520
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,720
Don't worry,

521
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,240
Mr. Wu said.

522
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,320
Your skills are immature,

523
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,960
I will let the teacher in this aspect,

524
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,200
I'll train more with you.

525
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,240
If it doesn't work,

526
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,440
we can take the emotional route,

527
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,480
Put your true feelings

528
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,640
into the song,

529
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,280
Then you can

530
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,800
feel real feelings,

531
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,480
It's not that bad today.

532
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,800
Let's just say,

533
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,560
frustrated in love and proud in the workplace,

534
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,600
I'm not frustrated

535
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,160
or complacent.

536
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,080
I'm leaving.

537
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,240
Practice your song.

538
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,360
Practice your song.

539
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,200
True feelings,

540
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,760
true feelings,

541
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,360
Okay, okay,

542
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,960
Okay.

543
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,800
True feelings.

544
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
True feelings,

545
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,520
true feelings

546
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,000
are rare.

547
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,240
You took the initiative to ask me out,

548
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,280
how

549
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,960
You suddenly remembered mine.

550
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,480
What if it were in the past?

551
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
I'm happy to drink this glass of wine.

552
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,560
He even took the initiative to get himself drunk,

553
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,280
and then took the opportunity

554
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,480
to have something to do with you.

555
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,160
But it's different now.

556
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,880
Before I drink this glass of wine,

557
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,960
I'd like to

558
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,320
ask you two questions soberly,

559
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,160
First,

560
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,080
does Ruonan know that

561
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,920
you asked me out?

562
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,520
I'll get going then.

563
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,640
I don't want to hide it from her.

564
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
To meet you alone,

565
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,680
I moved out of her house.

566
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,080
Did you two break up?

567
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,280
Why?

568
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,600
She mortgaged her house

569
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,480
to the bank for a loan,

570
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,680
Have you finished

571
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,560
your second question?

572
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,840
The house

573
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,720
is worth it. If such a big thing

574
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,840
happened to Ruonan,

575
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,760
You didn't even tell me.

576
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,800
That's why

577
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,680
I called you here,

578
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,400
Ruonan is so strong,

579
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,960
she will only bear the burden if something goes wrong.

580
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,440
With her personality,

581
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,600
even if I help her,

582
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,920
She won't accept it either.

583
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,160
This card is enough for her to tide over the difficulties.

584
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,760
But you have to give it to her in your name.

585
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,000
Don't mention that

586
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,760
I'm generous enough.

587
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,440
The silent type,

588
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,760
you're concerned

589
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,440
about Ruonan,

590
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,760
Or out of selfishness,

591
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,320
you want to keep the house.

592
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,560
Whatever you think.

593
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,320
As a person,

594
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,840
I hate it when men say,

595
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,240
It's just a word.

596
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,120
You'd better make it clear.

597
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,840
Otherwise,

598
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,360
I won't collect the money randomly.

599
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,760
Care and selfishness, right?

600
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,560
I dare to show my love to you.

601
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,440
One for Ruonan,

602
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,280
and one for your ex-girlfriend, right?

603
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,760
You're so divided.

604
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,280
Do you accept it or not.

605
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,200
Yes,

606
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
Of course,

607
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,640
the money collected by the bastard is not spent for nothing,

608
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,640
But let me be clear with you.

609
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,160
This money

610
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,520
is for Ruonan's mental damage compensation. If you give it,

611
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,360
you won't get it back.

612
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,080
It's even more impossible

613
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
to go back in the form of a house.

614
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,080
Have you thought it through?

615
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,680
The second question I wanted to ask you

616
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,920
was whether you like Ruonan or not?

617
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,760
Now it seems,

618
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,880
there's no need to ask.

619
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,800
Ji,

620
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,800
you're good enough.

621
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,320
You broke the hearts of two women.

622
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,680
If you dare to

623
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,720
bully Ruonan again?

624
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,600
If it falls on your head,

625
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,920
it's not wine.

626
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,720
It's a wine bottle.

627
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,320
Sis,

628
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,920
You came to practice so early.

629
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,480
I want the teacher

630
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,760
to give me one more lesson.

631
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,200
I hope we can make progress.

632
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,400
Okay,

633
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,800
Go ahead.

634
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,040
I'll wait for you outside.

635
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,480
Let's do it again.

636
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,240
Okay,

637
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:18,960
Remember

638
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,120
what I just said, right?

639
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,120
Are you in a relationship?

640
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,560
Love?

641
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,760
How can you be in love?

642
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,600
I like her,

643
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,560
but she doesn't know I like her.

644
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,280
She won't like me either.

645
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,760
I support your unrequited love.

646
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,440
But she doesn't support your relationship.

647
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,000
She doesn't like you.

648
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,240
She has no taste.

649
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So?

650
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,720
You have to work hard

651
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,000
for the girl you like,

652
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,920
Hurry up and become

653
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,800
a qualified artist.

654
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,440
You sang very well just now.

655
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,920
It's totally different from before.

656
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,200
We just had feelings for each other.

657
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,960
Right?

658
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,880
Okay,

659
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,920
let's take a break.

660
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,160
Thank you, mentor.

661
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,840
If you want to hold on to the woman

662
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,880
you like,

663
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,520
you have to be better.

664
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,520
What is it?

665
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,760
Okay,

666
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,880
I'll go over there.

667
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,080
Goodbye.

668
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,880
Sida?

669
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,200
I need to take care of something.

670
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,640
I'll work hard.

671
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,720
Good boy.

672
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,160
Why did you suddenly

673
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,560
ask me out?

674
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,640
How have you been recently?

675
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,720
That's great.

676
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,960
Are there any flaws?

677
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,000
What do you need?

678
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
For example, men,

679
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,800
houses,

680
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,240
Or money,

681
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,400
you know it.

682
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,000
How dare you say that?

683
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,160
You had such a big accident,

684
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,400
but you didn't even tell me.

685
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,040
If you need money, just tell me.

686
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,280
I'll lend it to you.

687
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,120
You even mortgaged

688
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,080
the house.

689
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,120
In your mind,

690
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,080
I'm so unreliable,

691
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,560
I'm so sad.

692
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,760
How do you know?

693
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,720
I mortgaged the house. Ali

694
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,880
said so.

695
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,800
He's my personal doctor now.

696
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,920
Ali

697
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,760
Ji Mo's friend,

698
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,320
this bastard.

699
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,040
I can't believe you're talking nonsense.

700
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,960
Yes,

701
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,159
I am short of money,

702
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,639
He's wicked.

703
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,760
I heard Ji Mo moved out,

704
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,040
You won't be sad.

705
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,320
It's not too late for me to be happy.

706
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,239
Through this incident,

707
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,120
I finally got a good look

708
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,480
at this person.

709
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,880
If Ji Mo comes to you again,

710
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,639
or cares about you,

711
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,480
Will you waver?

712
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,199
I don't have feelings for him anymore.

713
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,280
Then I'm relieved.

714
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,600
Take this card

715
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,480
with the password six nines,

716
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,000
No, thanks.

717
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,679
I'll figure it out myself.

718
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,560
If you can really

719
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,400
solve it yourself,

720
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,159
Do you have to

721
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,200
mortgage the house?

722
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,120
Cut the crap!

723
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,560
Redeem the house now.

724
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,840
I won't stand on ceremony then.

725
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,200
When I earn money,

726
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,440
I'll pay you back immediately.

727
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,720
You don't need to return it.

728
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,800
It's not my money anyway.

729
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,600
It's not your money,

730
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,280
it's a breakup fee

731
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,840
from an asshole ex-boyfriend of mine,

732
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,040
I don't need the money anyway.

733
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,480
Just help me spend it hard.

734
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,920
Don't feel bad if you spend money

735
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,000
on a bastard. Really?

736
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,000
You're not afraid,

737
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,480
but I feel bad about it.

738
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,040
You deliberately made up a story to coax me.

739
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,720
I made up a story

740
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,320
to coax you. Can I? No. Look.

741
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,400
This is our artist

742
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
Sida. Say hello, Mr. Ji.

743
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,120
Hello, Mr. Ji. I'm Star.

744
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,520
Why did you hit my artist?

745
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,680
He seduced me.

746
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Sida, come here.

747
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,120
You're too thick-skinned.

748
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,960
It's a compliment.

749
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,720
Who's here?

750
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,000
I didn't arrange for someone

751
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,280
to rehearse in the studio today, right?

752
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,400
I heard that Star

753
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,920
is about to take part in a singing contest,

754
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,840
If Shengnan hired

755
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,960
a music teacher for him,

756
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,880
I guess,

757
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,600
they want to use this competition

758
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,680
to turn over again.

759
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,640
I want you

760
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,600
to be mine.

761
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,160
So where are you going to wait?

762
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,320
Don't you want to have dinner with me?

763
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,600
I have an appointment.

764
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,400
I have an appointment with Ali.

765
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,520
He treated me.

766
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,440
What else did you say?

767
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,240
You have to supervise my diet.

768
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,960
It doesn't matter. I'll eat it myself.

769
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,440
As for what you said,

770
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,960
didn't you like

771
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,480
to be alone before?

772
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,280
You even like to go to the movies alone,

773
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,400
and you asked me to have dinner with you today,

774
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,760
Is it because Ji Mo moved out?

775
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,840
So I feel empty and lonely alone.

776
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,800
You never saw that

777
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,200
I was empty and lonely.

778
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,840
Hello, Ali,

779
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,520
are you here?

780
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,640
Okay, I'll be right there.

781
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,840
Let's go.

782
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,000
The song is really good.

783
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,080
There are some areas that can be changed.

784
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,240
But I think your lyrics

785
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,320
are very good.

786
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,400
I can see that you have feelings for him.

787
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,040
Thank you, mentor.

788
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Generally speaking,

789
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,240
it's still a little tender.

790
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,520
But I think,

791
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
the simpler it is,

792
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,880
The more touching it is.

793
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,200
It's my first time to write a song,

794
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,280
with such a level,

795
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,960
It seems that you have

796
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,760
some talent in music.

797
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,520
Really?

798
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,640
Really?

799
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,040
I think you should change it.

800
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,520
Then you can take part in the competition.

801
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,440
Take part in the competition.

802
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,040
Forget it.

803
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,160
I don't want Ruonan

804
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,400
to see this word,

805
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,000
Why can't I see it?

806
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,640
Did you write

807
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,920
some skeletons in your closet?

808
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,960
You guys go ahead. I'm leaving.

809
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,120
Thank you for your hard work.

810
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,840
Not bad.

811
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,240
The first time I wrote the lyrics,

812
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,640
I was praised by the teacher

813
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,320
for writing them well, right?

814
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,280
Let me have a look. It's okay.

815
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,560
Let me have a look.

816
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,640
Hurry up. Don't push me.

817
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
Move! Give it to me!

818
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,960
What did you write by dragging your feet?

819
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,000
Big woman.

820
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,240
Sida?

821
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,560
I don't think this song

822
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
is suitable for

823
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,920
a singing contest,

824
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,600
Why?

825
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,080
This,

826
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,200
this direction is totally incorrect.

827
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,080
It's like sister-brother love.

828
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,320
What's wrong with sister-brother love?

829
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,120
Sister-brother love is very popular now,

830
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,320
Could it be

831
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,920
Can't you accept sister-in-law love?

832
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,640
Your goal is to be young and energetic.

833
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,080
You have to give those girls

834
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,720
some fantasy space,

835
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
You wrote this?

836
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,600
The song title and lyrics,

837
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,560
both have the feeling

838
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,600
of a little man,

839
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,400
Do people who don't know think

840
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,760
you like old women?

841
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,720
Me

842
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,920
What's wrong

843
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,440
with liking an older woman?

844
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,880
I don't want to fantasize about

845
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,360
those little girls, do I?

846
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,840
Could you be

847
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,560
Sis,

848
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,040
I'm sorry. Actually, I...

849
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,880
You're not writing it

850
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,160
to the person you secretly love.

851
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,320
You told me that

852
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,120
you like her?

853
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,360
She doesn't like you.

854
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,600
She's older than you.

855
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,920
After a long time,

856
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,720
this is a confession song.

857
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,760
