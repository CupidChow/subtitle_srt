1
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,640
Listen to me.

2
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,880
If you don't wear well,

3
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,160
The audience will act.

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
The audience is acting.

5
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
I'll be very interested in

6
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,960
I suspect that

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,840
Doubt your role.

8
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,720
You wouldn't have

9
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,640
Everyone's approval.

10
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,600
You won't be recognized by everyone.

11
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,400
If Dugu is a man, he will be disappointed.

12
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,560
Do you want her to be disappointed?

13
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,360
I hope

14
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,280
So,

15
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,440
For my dream,

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,600
For art,

17
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,400
For the sake of Dugu,

18
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,120
Are you...

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,160
You should accept my help.

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,280
Put on these clothes.

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,640
For Dugu,

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,000
I think you're right.

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,840
Take Star to change.

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,960
Okay, everyone, let's go.

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,240
Hurry up.

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,000
For the sake of Dugu,

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,640
Hurry up.

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,960
Why am I so smart?

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,760
Don't give it to me in the morning.

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,800
To arrange a play.

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,360
Your face is swollen like a pig's head.

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,520
It's so ugly on camera.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,720
good

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,400
Sida, come on.

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,080
Sit there.

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,720
Sit here.

37
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,120
sit

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,200
Get the paper.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,960
Makeup artist

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,000
Fix a makeup for Star.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,240
The kind of makeup that has zero pores.

42
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,360
Although we are good,

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,520
Forget it.

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,680
No way

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,400
stylist

46
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,840
Choose a pair of sunglasses for Star.

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,720
To fit his face.

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,640
good

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,440
How about this?

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,200
This one.

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,000
This is fine.

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,040
So handsome.

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,440
Get up.

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,960
I'll take some photos for you.

55
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,360
Look at the formation.

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,560
I don't know.

57
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,200
I thought Star was the male lead.

58
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,080
Sida

59
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,800
You must be handsome on camera.

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
Shen Qiansha, come here.

61
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,640
Shen Qiansha, come here.

62
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,320
What's wrong?

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,720
Don't you see I'm busy?

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,120
You're the one who brought these here.

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,200
Well

66
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,200
What's up

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,480
What's wrong with you?

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,800
You're my assistant.

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,040
How dare you go to create a trend for others?

70
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,480
Are you crazy?

71
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,240
I spent my money

72
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,320
I can do whatever I want.

73
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,840
What do you care?

74
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,120
Buy me a new cup of coffee.

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,440
Haven't you finished your cup?

76
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,160
You're my paid assistant.

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
It's the same.

78
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll do whatever you want.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
If you don't like it, leave.

80
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,079
you got me!

81
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,640
I'll buy it.

82
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,280
Behave yourself.

83
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,080
Alright.

84
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,080
Sida

85
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,320
I'll buy you some coffee.

86
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Wait for me.

87
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,320
Get the screenwriter here.

88
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,040
good

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,760
Zi Hao, the screenwriter has arrived.

90
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,040
Reading the script?

91
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,800
Sit down.

92
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,040
You need me?

93
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,480
Change the play.

94
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,320
No

95
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,960
The scene is about to be shot.

96
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,640
And the director

97
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,160
There's no problem.

98
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,920
I don't need you to add scenes for me.

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,760
The play of the second man

100
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,840
Delete more.

101
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,080
Actually,

102
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,400
To her relationship,

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,280
Mr. Zihao,

104
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,400
This is the title page of the play.

105
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,240
Please have a look.

106
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,280
But I think

107
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,320
Sida

108
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
The title page of this scene

109
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,240
Thank you

110
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,800
What? My lines.

111
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
It's all gone.

112
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,840
The actors are in position.

113
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Get ready.

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,880
Try it.

115
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,560
come

116
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,360
Hurry and get into position.

117
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,280
to do sth more quickly

118
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,840
Okay, get ready.

119
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,760
Five, four, three.

120
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,800
How dare you hurt her?

121
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
Do you know?

122
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
She's my woman.

123
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,320
Actually, I am.

124
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,560
I can't help myself.

125
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,640
Fell in love with her.

126
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,840
I can give up for her.

127
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,160
As the president.

128
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,680
To give up my financial empire.

129
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,640
but

130
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,880
You don't have to give it to me, but...

131
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,200
I would never

132
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,400
To forgive you.

133
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,120
But, but I...

134
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,320
Remember that.

135
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,720
If you dare to show up again,

136
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
In front of her,

137
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,520
I will destroy your whole world.

138
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,040
Stop

139
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
What's wrong with you, Star?

140
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,920
As an actor,

141
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,760
You were blocked.

142
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,320
Don't you have any sense of scene?

143
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,160
director

144
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,520
Don't be so demanding.

145
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,760
She's not a professional.

146
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,840
I think everyone has worked hard.

147
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,120
Why don't we put the rice on first?

148
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,040
Alright, alright. Serve the food.

149
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,000
Rice is ready.

150
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,400
Qian Sha, help me get food.

151
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,640
Continue after dinner.

152
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,480
Sida

153
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,280
Read the script carefully.

154
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,480
Don't waste your time.

155
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,920
Script

156
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
The two scenes were deleted.

157
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,360
If this scene is deleted,

158
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,440
What should we do?

159
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,960
There are no lines at all.

160
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,840
Sida

161
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,920
Hi, screenwriter.

162
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,960
Sida

163
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,440
The writer, I want to ask you.

164
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,320
Why do I have so many scenes?

165
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,480
Was deleted.

166
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,320
I have no choice.

167
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,080
It's Song Zihao who wants to delete your play.

168
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,680
He's a star.

169
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,240
And I'm just a screenwriter.

170
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,880
I dare not disobey him.

171
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,920
By the way, Star,

172
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,120
Are you...

173
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
I offended him.

174
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,760
I

175
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
No, right?

176
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,320
I'm telling you,

177
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:49,960
You'd better

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,160
Don't go against him.

179
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,200
Otherwise, I won't do this to you.

180
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,160
A little benefit.

181
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,560
After all, this film is sold

182
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,360
It's Song Zihao, not you.

183
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,120
Well

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,480
Thank you, screenwriter.

185
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,760
Song Zihao has gone too far.

186
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,440
You're a big star,

187
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,280
You can delete the play casually.

188
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,160
Are you bullying me?

189
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Star, don't worry.

190
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,560
I'll scold him now.

191
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,720
Don't go.

192
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,200
Or the director will hear it.

193
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,040
And have a bad impression on me.

194
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,440
What can we do

195
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,640
I'll talk to Mrs. Ruo.

196
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,600
No way

197
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,960
I promised If

198
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,720
I have to face the problem myself.

199
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,679
Solve the problem.

200
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
That's not right.

201
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,640
I can't stand to see you.

202
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,960
To be bullied by Song Zihao.

203
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,760
If I can't overcome this setback,

204
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,559
In the future,

205
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,919
What about the bigger problem?

206
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,800
I can't do everything

207
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,880
Rely on me.

208
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,840
Trust me.

209
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
To become stronger,

210
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,120
A better actor.

211
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,200
You have to learn.

212
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,560
Solve the problem yourself.

213
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,360
Without that,

214
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,320
What is your identity?

215
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,720
What is your identity?

216
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,880
What is money?

217
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,680
Don't recite it.

218
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,880
Just three words.

219
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,920
It adds up to nine words.

220
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,880
And back.

221
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,200
That's right.

222
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,360
What is your identity?

223
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,520
What is money?

224
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,400
Never mind

225
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,760
Leave them.

226
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,520
I love you

227
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,240
director

228
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm ready.

229
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,240
Can start again.

230
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,040
Sorry about that.

231
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,200
I've kept everyone waiting for so long.

232
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,400
Okay, let's see how you behave.

233
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,280
Go and stand.

234
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,680
Well

235
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,240
Come on

236
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,120
All departments in place.

237
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,280
Get the actors in position.

238
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,800
All departments are ready.

239
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,960
Turn it on.

240
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,640
Five, four, three.

241
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,480
How dare you hurt her?

242
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,280
I know.

243
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,800
She loves you.

244
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,960
But I love her anyway.

245
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,640
I'm asking you, do you love her?

246
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,560
I love her.

247
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,840
I can't help myself.

248
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,800
Fell in love with her.

249
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,800
I can do it for her.

250
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,360
To give up my position as president.

251
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,280
Give up my financial empire.

252
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,200
Identity and money.

253
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,160
What does it matter?

254
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,480
For her, I didn't even

255
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,640
Can give up.

256
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,320
Stop, stop.

257
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,120
Not the director.

258
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
He changed the lyrics and the script.

259
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,680
I think the lyrics are good.

260
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,600
Si Da will do as you want.

261
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,320
Don't cut it off. Continue.

262
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,040
good

263
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,240
Here, get ready.

264
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
Contact, turn on.

265
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,880
Three, two.

266
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,720
start

267
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,840
You don't have to tell me that.

268
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,960
I won't forgive you.

269
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,920
I don't expect your forgiveness at all.

270
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,360
On the one hand, she's my favorite woman.

271
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
On the one hand, he's my good friend.

272
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,000
How should I choose?

273
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,280
I will feel sorry for you.

274
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,680
I hope you will always

275
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,360
Don't forgive me.

276
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,920
In this way,

277
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,360
You can love her with a clear conscience.

278
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,440
Okay, remember that.

279
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,640
If you dare to show up again,

280
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,760
In front of her,

281
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,760
I will ruin your whole world.

282
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,120
She means the world to me.

283
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,000
Not the director.

284
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,280
He changed the script and the lyrics.

285
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,720
How will the play be performed?

286
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,640
I think it's very effective.

287
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,560
Look.

288
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,920
Your anger

289
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,600
That kind of jealousy.

290
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,920
They're all aroused.

291
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,840
That

292
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,360
That's what a good actor should do.

293
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,000
To each other.

294
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
To each other.

295
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
You two work well together.

296
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,080
With six cakes.

297
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,720
He changed the script and the words.

298
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,760
I'm the male lead.

299
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,040
Follow his rhythm.

300
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,160
How does the play match up?

301
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,200
That's fine.

302
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,120
You don't want to

303
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,840
Then let him be with a girl.

304
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,240
Deputy director.

305
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,600
Come on, director.

306
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,000
To tell the writer.

307
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Let him

308
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,720
To add drama to Star Wars.

309
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,040
Okay, director.

310
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,560
a row

311
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,320
If you have the ability,

312
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,160
Delete them all.

313
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,240
Thank you, director.

314
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,960
Okay, then.

315
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,560
Rest for ten minutes.

316
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,400
good

317
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,000
Come here.

318
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,160
Director, please tell me.

319
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,880
Sida

320
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,640
Your acting just now

321
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
very good

322
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,840
I was touched.

323
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,080
Why are you so amazing?

324
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,520
And write a script.

325
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,280
No, I won't.

326
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,120
My sister taught me this before.

327
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
She said that ordinary actors

328
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,640
Only read the script.

329
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
A good actor?

330
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,120
What I want to understand is

331
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,240
The characters in the script

332
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,120
I just followed

333
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,880
The emotions of the characters

334
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,640
Just a few more words.

335
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,640
You're really talented.

336
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,120
How are you? Thank you.

337
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,040
Shen Qiansha.

338
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,880
I'll fire you if you don't come here.

339
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,680
I know.

340
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,400
Then I'll wait.

341
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,680
To come to you again.

342
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,120
awesome

343
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,520
Come on

344
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,640
I don't know that

345
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,000
What are you doing?

346
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,400
I hope I can

347
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,400
We can cooperate.

348
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,360
This glass of wine

349
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,400
I propose a toast to everyone.

350
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,040
good

351
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,680
Come on.

352
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,400
It's done.

353
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,560
When you look at it,

354
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,400
If a lady is a straightforward person,

355
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,080
Old Zhao has a good taste.

356
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,480
That's right.

357
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,720
Old Zhao,

358
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,840
I usually come to see you.

359
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,120
You always say you're busy.

360
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,400
To talk about cooperation.

361
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,320
You did it yourself.

362
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,200
Come here.

363
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,760
I think it's for Miss Ruonan.

364
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,440
That's right.

365
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,360
Don't misunderstand me.

366
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,480
Ruonan and I

367
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,280
Is my working partner.

368
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,400
Come on.

369
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,760
cooperative partner

370
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,200
It can make you

371
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,960
Call us one by one in the middle of the night.

372
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,440
To have a meeting in Nanjing.

373
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,360
It's been a long time.

374
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,120
Right?

375
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,920
To let us

376
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,280
To help your future sister-in-law.

377
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,760
That's right.

378
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,720
You really misunderstood.

379
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,400
That's right.

380
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,280
Cut the crap.

381
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,560
Let's get down to business.

382
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,680
Personally, I admire Ruowan.

383
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Including her character.

384
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,960
Including her ability to work.

385
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,360
And I'm also optimistic about it.

386
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
The future development of STAR

387
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,040
So, in your hands,

388
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,280
If there's anything suitable,

389
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,760
Resources and projects.

390
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,200
Try to cooperate with them.

391
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,000
no problem

392
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,000
You recommended Zhao.

393
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,120
It's reliable.

394
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,960
If you're a male,

395
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,440
What if we cooperate in the future?

396
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,360
Contact me anytime.

397
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,200
Here's to you.

398
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,080
Thank you

399
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,520
If the man is not a good drinker,

400
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,280
Where's her wine? I'll hold it.

401
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
It's the same.

402
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,800
Of course.

403
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,440
If you're a male,

404
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,800
I was absent-minded.

405
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,320
It's not because we have to rush.

406
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,200
The last high-speed train is going back.

407
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,040
If you're a male,

408
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,680
Don't leave today.

409
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,560
To do business here.

410
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,600
You have to enjoy yourself.

411
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,440
Is that right?

412
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,280
Manager

413
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,400
To help President Zhao.

414
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,440
And Miss Ruo Nan.

415
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,840
Book a room. Okay.

416
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,760
Come on, President Zhao.

417
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,440
Let's keep drinking.

418
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:42,920
Come on.

419
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:44,920
Drink and drink.

420
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,000
Come on.

421
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,520
drink

422
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,920
good

423
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,120
To eat.

424
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,520
Come and eat.

425
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,480
Come on.

426
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,520
That project last time,

427
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,400
A big deal.

428
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,800
It's so heavy.

429
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,480
Mr. Zhao.

430
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,120
Thank you for today.

431
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,200
Call me Zhao.

432
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,880
Old Zhao.

433
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,200
You gave me such a good resource.

434
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,680
And pushed the Star for me.

435
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,160
I really appreciate it.

436
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,800
But do you know

437
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,320
This is the only time.

438
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,040
You know what I mean.

439
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,800
understand

440
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
actually

441
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,600
I also hope you know

442
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,840
I don't want to force you to do it.

443
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,560
Anything you don't want to do,

444
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,280
Of course I know.

445
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Before my deception,

446
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,840
To hurt you.

447
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,800
and

448
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,120
Before I tell you,

449
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,560
It was indeed premeditated.

450
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,360
But in the end,

451
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,080
I chose to confess to you.

452
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,360
And I can assure you

453
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,480
In the future,

454
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,760
What you want to know.

455
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,240
I can confess to you.

456
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,160
Really

457
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,440
To confess everything.

458
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,120
Of course

459
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Including Su Xiao.

460
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,120
to be sorry

461
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,760
I shouldn't have mentioned Su Xiao.

462
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,280
it doesn't matter

463
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,280
It's just that

464
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,800
I don't know where to start.

465
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,360
Su Xiao,

466
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,600
What kind of person is she?

467
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
I grew up in a single-parent family.

468
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,120
I was unhappy in my childhood.

469
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,480
Later, when my mother remarried,

470
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,800
To have Su Xiao.

471
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,040
But it wasn't until I was 10 years old

472
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,920
For the first time.

473
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
My sister

474
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,960
At the beginning,

475
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,560
I don't like her either.

476
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,080
And rejected her.

477
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,120
But little by little,

478
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,200
And influenced me.

479
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,040
And warmed me little by little.

480
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,240
And make me happy.

481
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,160
Then I swore

482
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,400
I must protect

483
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,200
This sister

484
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,800
To prevent her from getting hurt.

485
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
That's why you hate Zimmer so much.

486
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,680
that's right

487
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,359
Actually, as you can see,

488
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,760
Su Xiao is optimistic.

489
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,960
And outgoing.

490
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,880
But I know her.

491
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,640
So I know

492
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,240
She just left her vulnerability

493
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,920
In the bottom of my heart.

494
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,000
Just like later,

495
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,599
She knew she was sick.

496
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,720
To break up with Zimmer.

497
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,119
It's because

498
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,200
I don't want Zimmer

499
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,520
And suffer with her.

500
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,960
I don't agree with it,

501
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,240
What she did

502
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,160
But I can only show respect.

503
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,880
But that doesn't mean

504
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,600
I can forgive Zimmer.

505
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,760
I don't know Su Xiao either.

506
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,240
But I think

507
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,760
She is a kind woman.

508
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,000
It's because of love.

509
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,400
That's why she made the wrong choice.

510
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,280
She must

511
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,240
I don't want you to

512
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,560
Living in hate,

513
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,360
You should try to let go of the past.

514
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,040
Just for her.

515
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,880
I'm different from Su Xiao.

516
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,160
Su Xiao is too kind.

517
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,280
She doesn't care about anyone

518
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,320
Anything.

519
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,040
Are full of kindness.

520
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,640
But I'm not.

521
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,320
I'm not kind.

522
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,360
My heart

523
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,080
Full of hatred.

524
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,720
Filled with darkness.

525
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,640
But even so,

526
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,760
It doesn't mean that

527
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,400
I don't know how to cherish.

528
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,920
Today I put my heart

529
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,800
In front of you.

530
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,360
I hope that

531
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,520
You can give me another chance.

532
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,360
Don't worry.

533
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,480
You have plenty of time to think about it.

534
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,520
Hello, Aaron.

535
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
My car broke down.

536
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,080
Now,

537
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,160
The exit of Hu Rong Expressway.

538
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,560
Ask someone to come.

539
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,000
Help me deal with it.

540
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
What about you?

541
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
I can't wait.

542
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
I want to see Ruonan now.

543
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,240
Why are you here?

544
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,480
You went on a business trip with Zhao Yucheng.

545
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,840
Why didn't you tell me?

546
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,640
Why is your phone off?

547
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,560
Why did you come here

548
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,920
And stay in Nanjing for one night.

549
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,480
Do you know how much I worry about you?

550
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,280
Come in first.

551
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,920
Brush your hair.

552
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,200
Don't catch a cold.

553
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
That

554
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,920
Zhao Yucheng.

555
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,040
Did you come? No.

556
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,320
I'm talking to him about business.

557
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,440
What are you thinking?

558
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,160
Before you came,

559
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,680
Zhao Yucheng and I

560
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,040
About Su Xiao.

561
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,680
Don't be nervous.

562
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,120
I know Su Xiao.

563
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,680
Is very important to you.

564
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,040
She's not only your problem,

565
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,480
Is also on my mind.

566
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,000
And you and Zhao Yucheng

567
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,440
Has always been the source of conflicts.

568
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,960
It's because of Su Xiao.

569
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,520
About Su Xiao,

570
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,640
It hit Zhao Yucheng hard.

571
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,760
I also want to try to

572
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,680
To dissolve the hatred in his heart.

573
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,760
But his hatred for you

574
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,360
Is the love for Su Xiao.

575
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,720
I can't solve his problem.

576
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,160
I'm sorry to Su Xiao.

577
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,280
I feel guilty to her.

578
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,920
therefore

579
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,440
So that Zhao Yu Cheng

580
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,800
Compromise and compromise.

581
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,560
The reason I didn't tell you

582
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,480
His identity

583
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,080
Because

584
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,480
I don't want to make it more complicated.

585
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,560
Then why are you here?

586
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,000
Because I really want to see you.

587
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,000
Because I'm afraid of losing you.

588
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,200
You know what?

589
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,200
I really don't want to

590
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
To get you involved.

591
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,040
I want you to live a simpler life.

592
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,160
More pure.

593
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,880
But you know everything.

594
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,240
I'm not afraid to tell you.

595
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,440
I missed it before.

596
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,200
So I don't want to miss it again.

597
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,240
This time,

598
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,600
I won't let go of you.

599
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,520
Go to the next room.

600
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,760
Take a rest.

601
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,560
Get changed and take a hot shower.

602
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,000
Don't catch a cold.

603
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
I'm looking at your sofa.

604
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,480
It suits me well.

605
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,920
It's big and spacious.

606
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,360
You think so.

607
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,160
I'll cheer you up.

608
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,000
You want to sleep here?

609
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,920
You get out of here, please.

610
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,520
Sir, your clothes.

611
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,600
Let's go.

612
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Don't play tricks, so...

613
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,760
You forgive me?

614
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,160
therefore

615
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
We're back to the old days.

616
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,880
go

617
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,480
Get out of here.

618
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,200
So you are willing to

619
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,400
To accept me again?

620
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,160
Get out

621
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,800
Don't.

622
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,440
I braved the storm

623
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,120
So I came.

624
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,640
Give me the right answer.

625
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,360
Do you choose me or Zhao Yucheng?

626
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,560
I know you will choose me.

627
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,280
is or isn't

628
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,120
Yuck!

629
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,240
Who said I would choose you?

630
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,480
Am I that bad?

631
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,440
Only you and Zhao Yu Cheng

632
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,240
You can choose.

633
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,360
I'm telling you,

634
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,920
I'm really good.

635
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,600
Many people like me.

636
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,480
Get out of here.

637
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,240
Get out

638
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Quotation

639
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,520
What's the price?

640
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,480
Who else is there?

641
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,240
If a man

642
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,920
If a man

643
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,200
I'm Ji Mo, Ruuo Nan.

644
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,680
Open the door.

645
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,880
Open the door

646
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,000
It's really you.

647
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,960
Why are you here?

648
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,560
Take her home.

649
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,640
You're really haunting me.

650
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,160
I think people who plan to do evil

651
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,400
Is it you?

652
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,600
Before I move back,

653
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,920
Find an excuse.

654
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,800
Bring Ruuo back to me.

655
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,480
mean

656
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,680
Whatever you want.

657
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,040
Anyway, I won't...

658
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,560
Let Ruonan be with you.

659
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,720
Because I know

660
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,120
You won't bring her happiness.

661
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,520
You have to figure it out.

662
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,680
To get close to her.

663
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,360
You were the one who used her.

664
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,000
That's enough.

665
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,000
Public occasions

666
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,360
To send you home.

667
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,560
Come with me.

668
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,600
I'll leave by myself.

669
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,120
Return the room first.

670
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,520
Tomorrow.

671
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,240
Three scenes.

672
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,240
Why are you here?

673
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,840
I missed you so much.

674
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,680
I'm here to conduct a surprise inspection.

675
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,320
To see if you're lazy.

676
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,520
I swear,

677
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,400
I'm not lazy.

678
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,200
I'll take it for you.

679
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,680
The director praised you just now.

680
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,960
And said you would be a good actor.

681
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,560
See, I didn't embarrass you.

682
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,120
Imp

683
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,680
Come on.

684
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,640
Sit down.

685
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,560
sister

686
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,840
What are you doing recently?

687
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,440
I just came from Nanjing to do something.

688
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,120
So I came back.

689
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,320
To talk about the show.

690
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,920
Nankin

691
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,480
Well

692
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,520
Star, get ready.

693
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,440
We started to put on makeup.

694
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,240
Your crew is rich.

695
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,000
And give you a private one.

696
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,960
The makeup team.

697
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,440
No, actually these are

698
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,240
Sida

699
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,320
Which coat do you want to wear today?

700
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,480
Correct!

701
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,400
The new one is limited.

702
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,000
suit

703
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,200
How do you like it?

704
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,040
Shen Qiansha.

705
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,400
how could that be?

706
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,920
This dress

707
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,280
And the makeup.

708
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,440
You found them.

709
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Of course.

710
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,080
Not to mention the Suihua Road of Star.

711
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,920
Even if it is his daily necessities,

712
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,480
I can handle everything.

713
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,760
As an agent,

714
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,480
It's useless.

715
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,960
I'll take care of Star.

716
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,920
In the future,

717
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,880
You don't have to come.

718
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,440
Shen Qiansha, what are you talking about?

719
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,880
Aren't you Song Zihao's assistant?

720
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,640
You're doing these things for Star.

721
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,720
Zihao doesn't mind.

722
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,560
I came to the crew

723
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,880
Is for Sida.

724
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,040
If he has any opinions.

725
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,280
It has nothing to do with me.

726
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,800
Shen Qiansha.

727
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,720
Come out.

728
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,480
Why are you yelling?

729
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,240
What you want me to do,

730
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,160
I've finished it.

731
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,040
What are you doing?

732
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,520
What did I tell you?

733
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,280
How many times?

734
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,320
You're my assistant.

735
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
I know.

736
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,920
My ears are almost callous.

737
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,000
If you don't stay with me,

738
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,240
What are you doing?

739
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,320
This is my break.

740
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,560
Don't care what I'm doing.

741
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,040
I

742
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,800
You're just in time.

743
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,640
I want to talk to you.

744
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,400
Come out with me.

745
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,800
I

746
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,160
Can you manage it well?

747
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,840
Your artist

748
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,640
Don't bother me all the time.

749
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,600
My staff

750
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,520
The staff you mentioned

751
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,680
Is it Shen Qiansha?

752
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,080
Did you say the opposite?

753
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,280
Qian Sha went to harass Si Da.

754
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,800
Star didn't mess with her.

755
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,760
Tell Star to stay away from Qiansha.

756
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,600
Ignore her.

757
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
I'm telling you,

758
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,800
This is all your fault.

759
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,520
You insisted on letting Star join the team.

760
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,400
Now it's better.

761
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,360
Shen Qiansha's thoughts

762
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,400
To Sida.

763
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,720
I don't want to lose face.

764
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,520
Also

765
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,720
Why is it that every time I see you,

766
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,240
And the people around you,

767
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,320
Are so unlucky.

768
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,360
I really doubt that

769
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,640
The kryptonite of my life.

770
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,560
I'm not sure I am.

771
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,000
The bane of your life.

772
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,080
But I'm sure Shen Qiansha

773
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,160
What do you mean?

774
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,080
otherwise

775
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,480
Why are you so concerned about her?

776
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,640
No

777
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,400
Who says I care about her?

778
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,600
You've been on the stage for so many years.

779
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,920
It's been a long time.

780
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,600
You really like someone?

781
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,720
Shen Qiansha is reckless,

782
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,160
But it's actually quite cute.

783
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,960
It's not surprising that you like her.

784
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,040
I like six cakes.

785
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,760
I

786
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,280
Songzihao

787
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,960
A star will fall in love with an assistant.

788
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,520
Are you crazy?

789
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Don't forget that

790
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,160
I was your manager for three years.

791
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,800
With your little thoughts,

792
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,240
You can't escape my eyes.

793
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,200
Actually, who do you like?

794
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,520
It has nothing to do with me.

795
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,440
But I have to warn you.

796
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,400
If you really care,

797
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,600
If Qian Sha

798
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,960
Tell Tong Tong to stay away from her.

799
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,480
Don't let her use

800
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,600
Dirty tricks.

801
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,440
To take advantage of

802
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,720
A simple girl.

803
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
What are you writing?

804
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,720
Love matching test

805
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,440
See how Phil and I are doing.

806
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,360
Help me take a look.

807
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,320
Is it suitable for me and Phyl?

808
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,200
Reproductive value

809
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,800
You gave Phyl

810
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,680
It's 80 points.

811
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,080
Give yourself a hundred.

812
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,840
Where is your confidence?

813
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,480
you

814
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,400
You look down on me.

815
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,160
Your senior brother.

816
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,960
I'm different from Phil.

817
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,480
Okay?

818
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm a Cambridge graduate.

819
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,440
she

820
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,920
She has no brain.

821
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,560
How about you and this mindless

822
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
What's the progress of Phil?

823
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,840
You can't criticize her like this.

824
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
I can say that about her.

825
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,800
You can't say that.

826
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Xiao Xiao.

827
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,600
Xiao Xiao is not here today.

828
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,080
So you pretended to be my assistant.

829
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,480
Well

830
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,440
remember

831
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,720
You're so smart.

832
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,960
Put them all up.

833
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Don't let people think

834
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,280
It seems that after that happened,

835
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,400
When I took photos,

836
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
It's all down.

837
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,280
Do you know

838
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,040
understand

839
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,760
Dutifully follow the king

840
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,720
The service is in place.

841
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,600
Must be a model.

842
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,440
right or wrong?

843
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,160
excellent

844
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,840
Is Miss Phil comfortable?

845
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,800
Where are the others?

846
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,560
They're still changing.

847
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
I lost.

848
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,080
Really!

849
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,120
It's early.

850
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,200
I think it's good.

851
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,800
It's pretty.

852
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,360
Right?

853
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,960
Why is she here?

854
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,080
Watch her.

855
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,920
Isn't this Miss Fei?

856
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,480
It's been a long time.

857
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,080
I heard you had a rest.

858
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,360
A period of time

859
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,640
I really envy you.

860
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,680
You can rest.

861
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,080
It's not like us.

862
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,560
I'm so busy every day.

863
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,360
What did you say, Sister Fei?

864
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,760
As if there's no work to do.

865
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,280
The exposure rate is high.

866
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,400
The webcast

867
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,560
It went viral.

868
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,160
I cried watching it.

869
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,480
Sister Fei,

870
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,320
It's really hard for you.

871
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,040
Can you speak?

872
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,880
Thank you for your concern.

873
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,920
But I heard that

874
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,440
During my absence,

875
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,480
You didn't ask too much.

876
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,720
Where are my advertising resources?

877
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,440
But don't bother.

878
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,240
because

879
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,920
I'm back

880
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:30,800
Also

881
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,960
I'm still the main model.

882
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,720
Please wait.

883
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,120
Cooperate a lot.

884
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,160
I'll cheer you on.

885
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,440
Come on

886
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,000
Come on

887
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,000
Alright.

888
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,760
It's great.

889
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,840
If I hadn't chosen

890
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,680
This suit

891
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,960
You can't get this feeling.

892
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm telling you,

893
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,400
Everyone is here, right?

894
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,040
come

895
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,200
Start shooting.

896
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,600
good

897
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,360
One more.

898
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,400
That's great.

899
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,520
With more energy.

900
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,080
OK

901
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,200
come

902
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,000
What are you doing?

903
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,240
What are you doing?

904
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,160
Why are you here so suddenly?

905
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,000
Impact shooting.

906
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,080
Who influenced the shooting?

907
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,440
Are they taking photos?

908
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,520
Who?

909
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,760
Who is it?

910
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,600
Who's talking about our model?

911
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,640
I

912
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,880
Who are you?

913
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,040
I'm Chen Fei'er's assistant.

914
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,240
An assistant.

915
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,080
You're an assistant.

916
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,400
What is that?

917
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,480
Go and play.

918
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,080
You want to play the hero and save the beauty?

919
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,800
Don't you want to see it?

920
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,760
What is it?

921
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,640
That's right.

922
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
How about you?

923
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,080
What are you?

924
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,760
What are you talking about?

925
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,440
You look sad.

926
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,480
Just like your master.

927
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,120
decline

928
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,400
Who are you talking about?

929
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm warning you.

930
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,840
You said I could.

931
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,080
That Chen Fei'er can't.

932
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,120
What do you mean?

933
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,199
You two are bullying each other.

934
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,080
is or isn't

935
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,880
Just one sentence.

936
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,840
It's so simple.

937
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,960
The main model of this issue is me.

938
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,920
As long as I don't shoot,

939
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,560
Don't even think about it.

940
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,159
understand

941
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,320
Understand.

942
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,880
Shoot it?

943
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,840
Are you shooting?

944
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,440
Can you shoot it?

945
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,280
sit

946
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,679
What's up

947
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,080
Are you still thinking about

948
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,800
You're not happy?

949
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,920
No,

950
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,679
I thought about it.

951
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,840
I should apologize to you.

952
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,159
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

953
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,440
It's affecting your work.

954
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,840
Mainly.

955
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,239
When they bully you,

956
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,160
I didn't control my emotions.

957
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,560
It's my first time to be an assistant.

958
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,760
Ali, don't mind.

959
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,440
You're like a dog.

960
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,200
I'm apologizing to you.

961
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,560
It's inappropriate for you to scold me as a dog.

962
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,640
I'm not scolding you.

963
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,360
I'm praising you.

964
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,080
Like a little milk dog.

965
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,520
lovely

966
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,960
This is your reward.

967
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,720
What are you doing?

968
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,680
Let's go.

969
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,560
Do you usually like

970
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,400
What dog?

971
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,720
Let's get a more masculine one.

972
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,280
all right?

973
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,720
Tibetan mastiff

974
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,680
Dubin

975
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,040
Labrador

976
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,960
Labrador

977
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
I really admire your design.

978
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,560
Welcome back.

979
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,640
For the fashion interview.

980
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,360
I'm looking forward to your participation.

981
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,840
I'm also looking forward to meeting you.

982
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,520
So handsome.

983
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,840
Did this guy

984
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,880
Torture me.

985
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,040
Why are you so early in the morning?

986
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,240
You deliberately seduced me.

987
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,360
I'm not interested in

988
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,120
He has no resistance at all.

989
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,440
Why are you here in the morning?

990
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,560
Looking at me all the time.

991
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,160
There's something on your face.

992
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,440
No,

993
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,840
I'm watching you today.

994
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,640
Why is it so ugly?

995
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,880
Is it ugly?

996
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,600
I'm slightly myopic.

997
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,440
So I sometimes wear glasses.

998
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,840
That's right.

999
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,320
Wearing glasses is really

1000
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,440
It's so ugly.

1001
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,080
To make you happy.

1002
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,040
I admit the ugly.

1003
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,560
Breakfast is on the table.

1004
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,240
Go eat.

1005
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,560
Where are you going?

1006
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
Where are you going?

1007
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Work?

1008
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,280
Go like this.

1009
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,760
If you don't work, you can support me.

1010
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,520
Hold on.

1011
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,040
Don't wear glasses.

1012
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,440
I'm the only one who looks ugly.

1013
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,280
Let's go.

1014
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,240
Strong and domineering.

1015
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,200
You're so dizzy.

1016
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,120
Sida

1017
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,360
What are you doing here?

1018
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,080
I'm watching Zihao's performance.

1019
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,280
Don't you hate him?

1020
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,880
Why are you learning from him?

1021
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,560
I think you're more

1022
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,160
Much better.

1023
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,000
Brother Zihao.

1024
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,120
It's Ruo.

1025
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,240
And brought it out.

1026
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,680
And also my senior.

1027
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,520
Look at his acting.

1028
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,640
That's great.

1029
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,720
And in the eyes,

1030
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,240
You're so handsome.

1031
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,160
It's worth learning from.

1032
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,360
I'm not looking at him.

1033
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,240
He's not handsome enough.

1034
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,880
And I think you...

1035
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,440
It's so handsome when you're serious.

1036
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,840
The most important thing

1037
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,920
Is to follow your own heart.

1038
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,720
Stop

1039
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,400
Sida

1040
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,360
Who said stop?

1041
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,720
director

1042
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,640
Is there Sida in this scene?

1043
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,320
Without his announcement,

1044
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,720
What mess did he make at the scene?

1045
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,720
He's dangling in front of my eyes.

1046
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,760
I'm very dramatic.

1047
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,480
Without me,

1048
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Sorry, director.

1049
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,120
Sorry

1050
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,440
I'm leaving now.

1051
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,160
sorry

1052
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,720
It's okay.

1053
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,080
Sida

1054
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,360
Come on.

1055
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,840
No more acting.

1056
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,720
I'm not in the mood.

1057
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,080
what

1058
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,360
Are you the director or me?

1059
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,760
If you don't want to act, you won't act.

1060
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,320
Fine, you don't have to act.

1061
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,720
We'll have to reshoot.

1062
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,440
Try another one.

1063
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,800
you

1064
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,280
Are from the same company.

1065
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,400
The difference between the two people

1066
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,320
Why is it so big?

1067
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,160
Songzihao

1068
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,640
Let me ask you something.

1069
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,280
Why did you say that about Star?

1070
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,160
He's not making trouble at all.

1071
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,600
He's learning from you.

1072
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,720
Who asked him to learn from me?

1073
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,040
He is not qualified.

1074
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,720
Since the shooting started,

1075
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,400
You targeted him everywhere.

1076
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,640
Why on earth

1077
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,040
You're so critical of him.

1078
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,680
I have the biggest opinion on you now.

1079
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,560
It's all because of you.

1080
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,720
You affected my mood.

1081
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,480
You know what?

1082
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,960
You don't know why.

1083
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,200
You can't act well.

1084
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,200
You blame others everywhere.

1085
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,280
Who are you?

1086
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,320
It's not Shen Qiansha.

1087
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,200
I'm warning you.

1088
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,800
You know who you are.

1089
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,680
Don't talk to Star in front of me.

1090
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,760
You're flirting with me, you know?

1091
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,800
Songzihao

1092
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,280
I won't let you go.

1093
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,200
I won't let you go.

1094
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,040
I'm not.

1095
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,560
No, I don't.

1096
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,240
No, I don't.

1097
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,040
I wouldn't...

1098
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:11,960
They hurt

1099
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,120
I'll be gentle.

1100
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,040
Songzihao

1101
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,080
Thousand yarn.

1102
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,240
It's none of your business now.

1103
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,080
Let's go.

1104
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,440
The whole crew is waiting for you.

1105
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,520
Go back now.

1106
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,440
Tell them to wait.

1107
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,360
I'm not in the mood to act.

1108
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,480
Tell me the truth.

1109
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,840
Recently,

1110
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,920
Emotional fluctuations.

1111
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,600
Is it related to Shen Qiansha?

1112
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,520
If that's the case,

1113
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,880
I changed her immediately.

1114
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,040
Anyway, now,

1115
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
I don't need her.

1116
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,920
The endorsement contract of Rui Qi.

1117
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,880
And got it.

1118
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,560
No one allowed you

1119
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,480
You're acting on your own.

1120
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,000
If you dare to change Shen Qiansha,

1121
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,440
I'll change you now.

1122
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,760
Go back to filming.

1123
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,160
Was it because I

1124
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,840
The way you wear glasses.

1125
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,880
Narcissist

1126
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,960
Buy coffee, drink coffee every day.

1127
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,400
What a lovely cake.

1128
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,880
A bear.

1129
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,000
A little bunny.

1130
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,760
One Star, one me.

1131
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,200
Buy it for him.

1132
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,560
Sida is so tired.

1133
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,280
Something sweet will make him happy.

1134
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,680
Waiter/Waitress

1135
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,840
These two help me pack.

1136
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,640
OK

1137
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,320
What are you pressing?

1138
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,160
I'm buying coffee for you.

1139
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,760
You fool.

1140
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,000
You didn't check your phone?

1141
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,800
Now the whole world

1142
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,840
Are all rumors about you and Star.

1143
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,760
Are you happy now?

1144
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,520
what

1145
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,200
I'm gossiping with Star.

1146
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,640
Yes
