1
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,280
Chen Fei, cheer up.

2
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,040
No one has hit you yet.

3
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,760
You got down.

4
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,480
It's no big deal.

5
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,240
Or you can start again.

6
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,040
You're so beautiful. What are you afraid of?

7
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,320
I'm afraid

8
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm afraid that without money,

9
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,160
Without a job,

10
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,720
No one loves you.

11
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,560
ILOVEYOU

12
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,160
You have no money and no job.

13
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,200
I raised you.

14
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,480
I'll sign the contract with Rui Qi tomorrow.

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,039
I'll raise you from now on.

16
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,680
When the sky falls, I will be there.

17
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,800
It's okay.

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,240
Fortunately, I have you by my side.

19
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,920
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known.

20
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,320
What should I do?

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,920
Don't be afraid. It's okay.

22
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,360
You have me, I'll protect you.

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,440
I will never leave you.

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,920
That's it.

25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,280
That's it.

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
That's it.

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,040
That's it.

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,480
How's it going?

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
And fell asleep.

30
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,400
Go back first.

31
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,120
I'll stay here with her.

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,920
good

33
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,560
Take care of her first.

34
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,680
Call me if you need help.

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,560
I'll be right there.

36
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,880
I just finished shooting.

37
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,440
He's downstairs at Phil's.

38
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,360
How's Phil?

39
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,880
Actually, it's not good.

40
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Phil has always cared.

41
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,120
Her past

42
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,959
Now it's been exposed online.

43
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,760
It's the same as

44
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,200
The deepest secret.

45
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,360
I was actually very scared.

46
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,160
She's upset.

47
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm afraid she can't accept it.

48
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,040
Who I used to be.

49
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,720
But I dare not show fear.

50
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,960
Because if you don't

51
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,000
If you are scared,

52
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,800
She has no one to rely on.

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,240
Don't worry.

54
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,320
She will survive.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,840
Everyone has scars in their hearts.

56
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,440
It's not that easy.

57
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,040
At least Phyl has you.

58
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,160
Psychologically speaking,

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,920
People can be vulnerable all their lives.

60
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,560
Can also be strong.

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,240
My heart was broken.

62
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,560
Can be rebuilt.

63
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,200
So you don't have to be too pessimistic.

64
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,360
But even if it is rebuilt,

65
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,560
The cracks on it

66
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,240
Can't be erased.

67
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,440
If a man

68
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,680
It's inevitable that it will be broken.

69
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
In my lifetime,

70
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,960
Have to experience it once.

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,360
Or broken many times.

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,720
You can't protect Phyl.

73
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,360
a lifetime

74
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
Phil needs to be rebuilt.

75
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,920
and

76
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,320
Was only broken.

77
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,120
I really understand.

78
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,880
What do you want?

79
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,960
Let's go.

80
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,480
I'll take you home.

81
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,760
Mr. Zhao.

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,720
Xiao Wu.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,240
Prepare the contract.

84
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,920
Let's sign a contract with Star Entertainment.

85
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,560
Take a look at this.

86
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,280
This is President Shen.

87
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,200
Sent it personally.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,640
Why haven't you come yet?

89
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,160
Mr. Zhao.

90
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,320
If you come,

91
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,720
We can sign the contract.

92
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,720
There's something wrong with the contract.

93
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,200
I can't sign it today.

94
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,200
The details

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,440
Is there any problem?

96
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,040
It's not about the details.

97
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,040
But

98
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,480
Sorry, Mr. Zhao.

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,640
I'm late.

100
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,600
I signed the contract with Mr. Zhao today.

101
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,280
What's wrong?

102
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,720
Mr. Zhao hasn't told you?

103
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,560
The Ruiqi Group has decided

104
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,480
And use Zihao to make them.

105
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,360
The spokesman.

106
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,400
Star has been replaced.

107
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Is it true?

108
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,920
Really

109
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,240
I'll explain to you later.

110
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,960
Mr. Zhao.

111
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,920
Let's put the contract

112
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,600
Let's talk about it.

113
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,280
People who have nothing to do with it can go out first.

114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,080
sorry

115
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,280
I'm not in the mood.

116
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,520
Another day.

117
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
OK

118
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,760
Thousand yarn.

119
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,160
Come out with me.

120
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,000
What a pity.

121
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
We used all the means.

122
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,280
But I didn't get it.

123
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,360
Endorsement contract

124
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,920
It seems that the world

125
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,160
It's still fair.

126
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,760
Whose is it?

127
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,440
Who will get it back?

128
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,760
If you're a male,

129
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,720
Disappointed?

130
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,440
Actually,

131
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,040
I have long expected that

132
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,520
There's nothing to be disappointed about.

133
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,920
Look at that pair of yours.

134
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
You are so proud of yourself.

135
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,760
It matches the ambition of a young man.

136
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,600
This sentence

137
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,880
Who are you talking about?

138
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,559
why

139
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,440
Why did you let President Shen

140
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,400
To oppose STAR being the spokesman.

141
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,760
I don't think Star is suitable.

142
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,280
You think it's inappropriate?

143
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,760
What makes you think it's inappropriate?

144
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,280
Don't you like Star?

145
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,240
Why did you ruin it?

146
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,160
This is my chance.

147
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,560
I didn't mean to ruin him.

148
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,680
I just want Star to be an actress.

149
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,880
I'm worried about him and Rui Qi.

150
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,560
After signing the contract,

151
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,960
Will be bound by a treaty, right?

152
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,440
Then he can only be a singer.

153
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,960
Who told you about this contract?

154
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,240
Will tie him down.

155
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,720
Tong Tong said that.

156
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,960
I read it myself.

157
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,600
It's clearly written on it.

158
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,760
The treaty states that Star must

159
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,640
To complete Rui Qi's arrangement.

160
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,920
That was the previous contract.

161
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,840
your daughter

162
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,520
Please take a look.

163
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,880
Is this a new one?

164
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,600
Before that, Ruonan and I

165
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,120
We have reached an agreement.

166
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,160
As an actress,

167
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,360
To sign the contract with Ruiqi Group.

168
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,120
Spokesman

169
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,360
We're even willing to

170
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,280
To match Star's schedule.

171
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,080
To adjust the performance.

172
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,320
And the activity time.

173
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,240
Do you know?

174
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,440
This contract is very important

175
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,320
How important is it?

176
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,320
He's not a singer now, but an actor.

177
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,800
The corresponding exposure rate

178
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,600
His business value

179
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,640
Will fall rapidly.

180
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,280
But with this contract,

181
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,120
Can not only make him

182
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,160
To get more resources.

183
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,960
Better resources.

184
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,000
It can even bring more.

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,480
A job opportunity, Miss.

186
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,080
It cost me and Ruonan.

187
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,920
So strong.

188
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,120
It was finally cleared.

189
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,920
All the obstacles

190
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,080
It's fine now.

191
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,680
You ruined everything.

192
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,920
impossible

193
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,440
Dugu Ruoruo, how could she?

194
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,520
Why would you support Star?

195
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,760
Is that right?

196
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,680
That's right.

197
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,440
You underestimated Ruuo's courage.

198
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,160
before that

199
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,640
In order to support Star as an actress,

200
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,200
Even prepared.

201
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,760
To give up the contract.

202
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,360
But you.

203
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
Your selfishness

204
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,840
Your impulse, your naivety.

205
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,720
Your self-righteousness

206
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
And made Star lose

207
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,840
This is a good chance.

208
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,840
Thousand yarn.

209
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,560
If you love someone,

210
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,280
To help him.

211
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,720
Let him be.

212
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,240
Instead of causing him trouble.

213
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,600
What should we do?

214
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,680
Then I'm...

215
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,960
I'm calling now.

216
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,640
Give it to my dad.

217
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,480
I asked him to change Star back.

218
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,600
It's too late.

219
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,320
You've managed to get your father

220
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,400
And made a decision.

221
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,680
And as him,

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,120
The decision he made

223
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,200
Can't be changed at will.

224
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,080
therefore

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,880
Sida

226
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,240
You are doomed to lose this chance.

227
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,320
It's all my fault.

228
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,320
It's all my fault.

229
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,120
It's all my fault.

230
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,000
The headquarters came to inform us.

231
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,200
I can't control it.

232
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
I understand.

233
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,040
You also said that

234
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,160
The contract is selfish.

235
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,400
Actually, in my heart,

236
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,200
I can't bear it.

237
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,480
Now the back door

238
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,840
But he didn't leave.

239
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,560
I'm more down-to-earth.

240
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,240
I can't.

241
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,920
And become a spokesman.

242
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,480
He's not strong enough.

243
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,600
After that, it will be better.

244
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,080
We have many chances to cooperate.

245
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,680
You're right.

246
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,240
I'm very happy.

247
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,560
Because you understand me.

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,720
It's not my fault.

249
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,240
But at the same time, I was sad.

250
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,520
Because you still won't accept it.

251
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
My selfish.

252
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,480
I forgot to ask you.

253
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,760
Your friend's...

254
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,480
Phil!

255
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,920
Yes

256
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,600
she

257
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
Is she alright?

258
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,160
Correct!

259
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
I'm going back to see her.

260
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,080
I can give it to you.

261
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,760
No need.

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,880
I'll go myself.

263
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,800
Bye

264
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,280
Qian Sha, what's wrong with you?

265
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,120
Who bullied you?

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,160
sorry

267
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
It's all my fault.

268
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,200
It's all my fault.

269
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,600
The endorsement of Rui Qi.

270
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,400
It's all my fault.

271
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,640
Nothing

272
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,000
I just heard that

273
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,280
It's not your fault.

274
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,640
I'm not capable enough.

275
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,240
They wanted to replace me.

276
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,960
For the sake of Ruo.

277
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,160
To reconsider it.

278
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,080
Don't cry.

279
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,160
I have self-knowledge.

280
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,720
I'm just worried that

281
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,800
If a man can,

282
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,640
Disappointment

283
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,360
You really don't blame me?

284
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,440
No

285
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,520
It's all my fault.

286
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,920
Call my dad.

287
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,880
I want to change you.

288
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,720
I thought that

289
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,600
You can be an actor.

290
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,880
You have no constraints.

291
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,960
Don't cry.

292
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,440
It's not your fault.

293
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,800
I have to blame myself.

294
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,760
I'm not strong enough.

295
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,800
Not good enough.

296
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,600
Besides,

297
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,880
I have to thank you.

298
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,600
Without your encouragement,

299
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,520
I didn't have the courage to tell Sister Ruo.

300
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,800
I want to be an actress.

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,600
And she agreed to it.

302
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,520
I'm satisfied.

303
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,200
Really

304
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,600
But obviously,

305
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,320
Everyone has worked hard.

306
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,200
That's a lot.

307
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,600
I didn't get

308
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,480
It means it doesn't belong to me.

309
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,600
When I grow stronger one day,

310
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,720
Excellent.

311
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,120
It will come back.

312
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,800
And I have nothing now.

313
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
You're so relaxed.

314
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,160
I can chase it with all my might.

315
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
My dream of acting.

316
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,240
Let the past be the past.

317
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,640
The future is the most important.

318
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,080
What do you think?

319
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,520
Sida

320
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,920
What's up

321
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
Why are you so nice?

322
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,160
I did something wrong.

323
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,760
Nothing

324
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
You comforted me in return.

325
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Thousand yarn.

326
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,200
Speak nicely.

327
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
No, no. Don't touch it.

328
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,040
Thousand yarn.

329
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,800
Thank you, Star.

330
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,600
Give me a hug.

331
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,080
You have no idea how much I blame myself.

332
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,880
Qian Sha, I can't breathe.

333
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,520
Give me a hug.

334
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,840
No, no. I can't.

335
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,720
Thank you.

336
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,600
Si Da, you're so kind.

337
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,040
Are you a male sister?

338
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,000
Phil is in big trouble this time.

339
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,640
Many partners have terminated.

340
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,720
The cooperation with Phil.

341
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,920
Even the wing fashion

342
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,400
To replace Phil.

343
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,720
Please help her.

344
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,120
Don't tell her about this.

345
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,920
She has no choice now.

346
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
To be irritated.

347
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,840
I'll handle it.

348
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,720
good

349
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,560
You want to replace Phyl?

350
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Not yet.

351
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,880
Don't worry.

352
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,760
Phyl, she has been

353
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,200
It's really not easy.

354
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,880
There are many manufacturers

355
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,120
To replace her.

356
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,080
I...

357
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,280
I want to ask you a favor.

358
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,520
Even if you reject me,

359
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,440
It doesn't matter.

360
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,320
Because I can understand

361
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,560
You have your own position.

362
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,760
I promise you,

363
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,440
What did you promise me?

364
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,840
Do your best to keep Phyl's endorsement.

365
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,280
I didn't plan to

366
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,320
Replace Phil.

367
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,840
Although there are many people inside,

368
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,080
The voices of doubt.

369
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,080
But I believe I can solve it.

370
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
And I know

371
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,600
Phyl is your good friend.

372
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,040
I know what she means to you.

373
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,840
I promised you.

374
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,640
I will definitely make it.

375
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,840
And you said that

376
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,640
There's nothing I can't solve.

377
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,240
The problem?

378
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,280
I'm relieved.

379
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,360
What about Phil?

380
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,280
Please.

381
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,160
You should have a lot of things.

382
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,000
Are you busy?

383
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,119
I won't bother you.

384
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,119
to wait a moment

385
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,800
You and Zhao Yucheng

386
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,079
What's the progress?

387
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,280
Why are you asking about Zhao Yusheng?

388
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,359
Are you still jealous?

389
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,520
I'm just asking.

390
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,520
You're just jealous.

391
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,360
I'm jealous.

392
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,680
Why should I be jealous?

393
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
There's a way to make you

394
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,640
You are openly jealous.

395
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
Do you want to know?

396
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,240
What?

397
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,320
Be my man.

398
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,960
Are you kidding me?

399
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,600
I'm serious.

400
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,360
You look jealous.

401
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,200
So cute.

402
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,960
I'm not jealous.

403
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
I'm no better than Zhao Yucheng.

404
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,920
Much better.

405
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,160
I'm more confident than him.

406
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm so confident.

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,200
From your micro expression,

408
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,520
I saw the tension, fear and guilty.

409
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,320
When I approached you just now,

410
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
You're the only one

411
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,720
A defensive posture.

412
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,520
It shows your heart.

413
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,640
Very nervous.

414
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,480
Because you don't know.

415
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,080
How to respond to my request.

416
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,680
You just explained that

417
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,280
You don't have a jealous look.

418
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,920
His eyes suddenly went up.

419
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,920
Rapid breathing.

420
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,160
It means you are guilty.

421
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,280
Are you nervous?

422
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,760
Of course, it's possible that I'm guilty.

423
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,080
The act of being jealous.

424
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,840
It's also possible that

425
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,520
Care about someone very much.

426
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,920
Right?

427
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,480
Don't mention it.

428
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,680
Because from your micro expression,

429
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,920
I have the answer.

430
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,640
A little facial expression.

431
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,080
Who wouldn't?

432
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,360
Dugu is like a man.

433
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,640
I shouldn't have

434
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,520
Microfacial psychology taught you

435
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,760
I was almost caught.

436
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,880
Are you awake?

437
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,240
It's good to wake up.

438
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,120
Come on.

439
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,480
I bought it for you.

440
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,360
Your favorite pig's trotter.

441
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,160
Eat it while it's hot.

442
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,080
Do you think I'm

443
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,160
Are you still in the mood to eat?

444
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,600
Then stop eating.

445
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,480
You have to stay in shape.

446
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,200
To take photos.

447
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,120
What photo?

448
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,680
No one dares to use me now.

449
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,880
I was abandoned by everyone.

450
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,360
No,

451
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,880
Wing Fashion didn't abandon you.

452
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,760
Ji Mo also asked me to tell you that

453
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,200
To take photos tomorrow.

454
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,920
How do you know?

455
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,320
You went to intercede with Ji Mo?

456
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,840
I just ran into him.

457
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,200
I knew it.

458
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
If you hadn't gone to him,

459
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,480
To intercede,

460
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,720
He probably wouldn't dare to use me.

461
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,640
Yes

462
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,400
I went to see Zimmer.

463
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,000
But he also said

464
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,960
He didn't want to replace you.

465
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,680
You're very popular now.

466
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,240
Don't be so pessimistic.

467
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,520
I don't need your pity.

468
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,360
And pitiful.

469
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,960
I didn't pity you.

470
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,880
Don't pretend to be

471
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,040
As the savior, okay?

472
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,160
It's annoying.

473
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
Chen Fei.

474
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,600
I'm talking to you nicely.

475
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,960
You won't listen. Are you looking for a scolding?

476
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,400
For you,

477
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Running around.

478
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,160
I just finished a meeting.

479
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,240
I will come to your home to look for you.

480
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
When I came to your house,

481
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,280
I got another call from Xiao Xiao.

482
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
I went to Wing Fashion.

483
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,400
I have to coax you back.

484
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,480
What's my intention?

485
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,720
I didn't mean to make you happy.

486
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,800
Don't feel wronged.

487
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,280
The whole world owes you.

488
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,800
When I was wronged,

489
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,920
Have I called you?

490
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,880
Is there

491
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,800
Nothing.

492
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,320
I didn't want you to worry.

493
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,400
Do you like pig's trotter?

494
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,520
It's up to you.

495
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,800
Stand still. Don't move.

496
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,160
If it's a bad guy,

497
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,280
I'll throw him out.

498
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,080
I've checked everything.

499
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,840
There's no danger.

500
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,880
There's no explosives.

501
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,240
A fan's letter to you.

502
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,760
And a ball for what?

503
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,600
I have no idea

504
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,560
Beautiful Phyl.

505
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,400
I sent you a pressure ball.

506
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,440
When you're feeling stressed,

507
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,640
Or unhappy,

508
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,560
Hold it tightly in your hand.

509
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,000
It can relieve the pressure.

510
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,400
This pressure ball

511
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,120
No matter how you shape it,

512
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,640
It will return to its original condition.

513
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,320
Actually, people are the same.

514
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,640
No matter what the pressure is,

515
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,760
Can be changed back to the way it was.

516
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,400
Or even use force.

517
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,880
To create a stronger explosive force.

518
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,200
That's why you bounce back from the bottom.

519
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,320
I believe

520
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,680
You can do the same.

521
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,480
remember

522
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,000
I will always be your most loyal.

523
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,560
Little fan.

524
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,920
You still smile?

525
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,840
I'm hungry.

526
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,880
That

527
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,920
pig trotters

528
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,760
Come and eat.

529
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
Luckily, I didn't eat it.

530
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,120
That's what women do.

531
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,680
Pretentious and hypocritical.

532
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,880
Should I do it?

533
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,960
Nothing.

534
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,200
Learn from me.

535
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
Okay, I'm pissed off.

536
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,160
Don't be angry.

537
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,760
Eat pig's feet.

538
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,880
pig trotters

539
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,800
It's not cut.

540
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,320
I'll eat whatever I want.

541
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,280
Didn't you cut it?

542
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,120
I'll cut it for you.

543
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,840
to do sth more quickly

544
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,440
Alright.

545
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,040
do

546
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,520
I owe you a scolding.

547
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,600
who

548
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,440
Who is it?

549
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,120
If a man

550
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Why are you here?

551
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,960
I just woke up.

552
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,320
I haven't washed yet.

553
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,160
I don't want to

554
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,840
For others to see.

555
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,680
Especially you.

556
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,240
It's not like I haven't seen it before.

557
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,760
It's 9: 30.

558
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,480
I have a meeting at 10: 00.

559
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,640
From here to the office,

560
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,520
It takes 25 minutes.

561
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,240
So I only have five minutes.

562
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,240
I need to get along with you.

563
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,200
These five minutes,

564
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,640
To support my day.

565
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,200
but

566
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,080
Five minutes is not enough.

567
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,760
I want you to

568
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,040
Every minute with me,

569
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,800
If a man

570
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,720
I admit I was a jerk.

571
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,240
There are too many concerns.

572
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,120
I won't tell you anything

573
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,920
What excuse?

574
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,440
But give me a chance.

575
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,120
No matter now or in the future,

576
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,040
Let me prove my love for you.

577
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,680
I really...

578
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,320
I haven't been in a relationship for a long time.

579
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,960
I haven't pursued anyone for a long time.

580
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,640
I have forgotten

581
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,560
The skills of love.

582
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,640
I won't.

583
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,320
I won't use it on you.

584
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
Any routine.

585
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,640
So I will try my best.

586
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,200
To give you security.

587
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,520
I really don't want to miss it again.

588
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,080
Why?

589
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,920
Don't move.

590
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,960
I need to charge it.

591
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,400
That's it.

592
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,800
Finally.

593
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,880
I'm going to work.

594
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,960
You look so beautiful when you just woke up.

595
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,600
If a man

596
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,000
You just woke up.

597
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,200
It's so beautiful.

598
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,640
Am I beautiful?

599
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,280
Do you?

600
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
This is the legendary natural beauty.

601
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,560
Messy beauty, wild beauty.

602
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,800
Why am I beautiful? I'm so beautiful.

603
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,840
Too beautiful is a burden.

604
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,360
To keep a low profile.

605
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,280
You are not allowed to

606
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,480
Hello, hello.

607
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,480
I'm

608
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,600
where

609
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,680
Really?

610
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,880
Yes, I have.

611
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,960
We have a schedule recently.

612
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,680
Okay, thank you. Let me know.

613
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,520
Bye

614
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,080
The sun is rising in the west.

615
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,840
sister

616
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,800
Why are you so happy?

617
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,840
It's rare.

618
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,720
Have you ever heard of

619
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,160
Embrace the future.

620
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,600
This play

621
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,120
The crew wants you there.

622
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,600
Audition Male 2.

623
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,520
This is the last time

624
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,120
The big red project.

625
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,320
Really?

626
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Embrace the future.

627
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Qian Sha took a pile of scripts

628
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,880
That name seems to be it.

629
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,840
Song Zihao seems to be a male.

630
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,440
I'd better forget it.

631
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,120
So that you don't have to

632
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,520
You're always looking up.

633
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,640
Do you still want to act?

634
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,080
Yes, of course.

635
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,080
But Song Zihao

636
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,360
There's no but.

637
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,320
A real actor.

638
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,400
Won't pick a rival.

639
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,080
Are you acting?

640
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,120
Whether to act with Song Zihao or not.

641
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,080
What does it matter?

642
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,760
And a newbie.

643
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,400
It's not your turn to pick and choose.

644
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
Got it, sister.

645
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,560
I'm telling you,

646
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,280
I've studied the script.

647
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,640
The male number two is

648
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,120
A rare role.

649
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,320
Although it looks like

650
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,640
There aren't many scenes.

651
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,640
But he's indeed better than the male lead.

652
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,680
And become more colorful.

653
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,840
Especially his personal setting.

654
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,400
Plump and solid.

655
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,360
But also affectionate route.

656
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,080
The female audience

657
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,440
Is my favorite.

658
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,440
If you act well,

659
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,520
It will be you.

660
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,560
In my acting career,

661
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,920
A good beginning.

662
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,120
sister

663
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,440
I didn't expect that

664
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,720
You're so well-researched.

665
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,600
Where's my job?

666
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,400
To help you choose a good one.

667
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
The script and the role.

668
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,560
To make you

669
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,680
To achieve this role.

670
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,200
This role also makes you

671
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,680
I've picked a script for you.

672
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,640
And the character.

673
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,360
Can I pass the audition?

674
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,560
It's up to you.

675
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,200
Yes, definitely.

676
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,600
I will try my best.

677
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,240
Take down the role.

678
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,920
I repeat.

679
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,160
You are my girl

680
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,800
Song Zihao, are you sick?

681
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,960
You said you wanted to help me with the drama.

682
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,160
Why are you sleeping?

683
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,240
You can either put on a poker face

684
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,440
Or act cool.

685
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,400
After all,

686
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,680
Similar emotions.

687
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,080
I won't compete with you.

688
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,400
You're a layman.

689
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,040
There's something wrong with the character.

690
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,560
Tong Tong is an agent.

691
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,680
How did you do that?

692
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,400
otherwise

693
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,960
You'll be responsible for me from now on.

694
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,000
Choose a role.

695
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,640
I'm just an assistant.

696
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,480
Other work

697
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,720
Don't try to push it on me.

698
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,200
Zihao

699
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,640
The coffee from the director.

700
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,000
Thank you. Put it there.

701
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,640
Alright.

702
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,720
Congratulations.

703
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,520
I heard there's a new employee in your company.

704
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,280
To be the second male in our play.

705
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,080
New people

706
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,040
Who is it?

707
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,080
It's called Si.

708
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,960
Sida

709
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,760
That's right.

710
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,560
It's called Si Da.

711
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,960
very good

712
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,840
If Star can be interviewed,

713
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,520
Wouldn't I be able to

714
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,320
I saw him.

715
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,760
This job won't be

716
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,800
It's so boring now.

717
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,560
What do you want to say?

718
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,840
You can speak freely.

719
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,280
The bad reviews we received recently

720
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,520
And 90 percent of the complaints

721
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,120
Are all aimed at the endorser.

722
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,840
It's Chen Fei's.

723
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,800
This is very serious.

724
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,320
Has affected

725
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,520
The reputation of our brand

726
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,640
Don't watch the old season.

727
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,040
And you're looking into it.

728
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,440
The more I look, the worse it is.

729
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,840
The worst is us.

730
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,360
For long-term cooperation.

731
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,840
Has started asking us

732
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,600
To increase the proportion of advance payment.

733
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,160
What does that mean?

734
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
It means that

735
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,680
Don't you have confidence in the future?

736
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,920
How did that result?

737
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Ji, I'm wrong.

738
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,360
I think it's because of you.

739
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,200
Persist in wilfully and arbitrarily

740
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,960
You insist on using this.

741
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,120
What gossip-ridden?

742
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,760
What Chen Fei?

743
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,120
Of course, not only this decision,

744
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,160
A lot of recent decisions

745
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,880
Are all inside.

746
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,000
Before you came,

747
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,920
All the directors

748
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,880
You're breathing.

749
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,200
On behalf of the board,

750
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,520
I solemnly inform you that

751
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,640
Please cancel it immediately.

752
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,400
Chen Fei, as our company,

753
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,040
The image spokesman's decision.

754
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,720
Take this stinking meat from us.

755
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,920
Can you peel it?

756
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,800
What everyone said,

757
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,840
I heard it.

758
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
But I can't agree.

759
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,280
Your proposal

760
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,840
Because I think

761
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,480
The spokesman event.

762
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,800
To our company.

763
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,720
Will pass soon.

764
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,400
Let me ask you one more thing.

765
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,120
What makes you so sure?

766
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,120
That's right.

767
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,080
Based on my understanding of public psychology,

768
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,200
Analysis and understanding

769
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,560
This is the information age.

770
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,560
Once a celebrity is involved in a scandal,

771
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,200
It will cause the public

772
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,360
The carnival of public opinion.

773
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,840
Prying curiosity.

774
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,480
The expression of public opinion

775
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,680
The superiority of morality.

776
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,000
These are all people

777
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,280
Focus on the cause of the scandal.

778
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,440
They are looking for

779
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,640
Immediate compensation

780
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,760
And this kind of instant compensation

781
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,360
Your memory is short.

782
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,640
Which is what psychology says,

783
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,760
Short-term memory

784
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,160
Will soon be forgotten.

785
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,160
So we don't have to

786
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,200
For the current public opinion,

787
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,720
Because of this.

788
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,720
If you look carefully,

789
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,480
You will find that

790
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,240
The bad comments against Phyl.

791
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,200
Since the first week of the outbreak,

792
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,360
Is the most.

793
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,120
After that, it dropped sharply.

794
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,880
Now, there are almost none.

795
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,840
What bad comments?

796
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,120
Which means it's consistent with psychology.

797
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
The oblivion curve

798
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,800
everybody

799
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,760
What do you understand?

800
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,400
Follow them.

801
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,520
Nod there.

802
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,080
Anyway, I didn't understand.

803
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,240
Ji, I beg you.

804
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,360
Don't take these.

805
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,600
The psychology of suspense.

806
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,760
To fool us.

807
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,920
I'm a rude man.

808
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,400
I'll admit one thing.

809
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,440
No matter what theory you put forward,

810
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,920
Than a good performance.

811
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,760
Are you right?

812
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,040
That's right.

813
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,880
Then tell me what your decision is.

814
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,040
It's us.

815
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,120
All of them.

816
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,400
And the future of wing fashion.

817
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,640
It's a huge responsibility.

818
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
I strongly disagree.

819
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,240
If you want to

820
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,160
If you don't do that,

821
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,120
I can only suspect

822
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,560
Are you capable of

823
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,720
And continue to work.

824
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,240
The president of Wing Fashion.

825
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,960
If you insist on getting the performance,

826
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,880
What you said,

827
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,920
Then I assure you,

828
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,800
Increase sales within three months

829
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,560
Thirty percent.

830
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,920
If I can't,

831
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
And resigned.

832
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,080
No

833
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,040
Old Wang.

834
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,480
How dare he say that?

835
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,280
Thirty percent.

836
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,960
good

837
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,040
Three months.

838
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,400
Just three months.

839
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,160
I will wait and see.

840
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,000
Old Wang, old Prince.

841
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,400
Thirty percent for three months.

842
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,200
That's impossible.

843
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,560
Three months? Did I hear you right?

844
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,920
How is that possible?

845
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,560
President Ji, I think you should

846
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,080
Cancel Phil's endorsement status.

847
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,560
Or you'll be the one leaving.

848
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,920
I promised Ruuo

849
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,159
You must keep Phyl.

850
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,440
You have to keep your word.

851
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,440
If you want too many things,

852
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,280
You can't promise her everything.

853
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,600
As long as you care about it,

854
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,080
I will do my best to protect it.

855
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,719
The price of love

856
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,760
It's too big.

857
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,199
No

858
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,199
As my assistant,

859
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,000
Can you speak?

860
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,159
Don't be so upset.

861
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,520
Send the statements of all departments

862
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,920
The details.

863
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,840
I'm going to make a plan

864
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,679
Detailed plan.

865
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,719
Document statement financial statements

866
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,679
It's all here.

867
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,239
Are you sure you want to finish it?

868
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
After reading these things,

869
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,240
At least a week.

870
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,920
There's always time.

871
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,280
So I have to sleep in the office again.

872
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,400
This is your audition script.

873
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,040
I marked the time for you.

874
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,520
Hurry up and practice.

875
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,840
I've memorized the lines.

876
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,720
We need to figure out

877
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,080
The emotions of the characters in it.

878
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,880
good

879
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,080
Because of you,

880
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,400
I have the ability to love.

881
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,160
The love scene.

882
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,280
What's so weird about that?

883
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,080
The love scene can really test

884
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,160
Acting skills

885
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,880
But sister,

886
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,360
I have heterosexual disorder.

887
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,360
I'm afraid that

888
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,840
The actress who plays with me.

889
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,560
Let me ask you something.

890
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,840
You said you wanted to be an actress.

891
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,080
Are you ready?

892
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,920
to be ready

893
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
But I was afraid that I would get sick.

894
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,600
I'll be

895
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,360
Since you want to be an actor,

896
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,000
Then you have to overcome it.

897
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,560
Your own mental disorder.

898
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,040
In your acting career,

899
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,080
We will meet in the future.

900
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,840
A lot of actresses are acting against you.

901
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,200
You should recognize

902
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,960
And face the reality.

903
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,760
I don't want to

904
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,320
Because of you.

905
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,640
I won't give up.

906
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,360
I will read the script.

907
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,040
And analyze the characters.

908
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,320
And figure out the characters.

909
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,720
I'll go back and recite the script.

910
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,720
Bye, sister.

911
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,320
Because of you.

912
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,560
I experienced it all over again.

913
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,160
Human's complex emotions

914
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,320
But then I realized

915
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,320
Love needs to be responded to.

916
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,680
to punctuate

917
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,520
But no matter what happens here today,

918
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,360
I want to tell you out loud.

919
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,720
I love you

920
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,120
It's not right to have no feelings.

921
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,800
I love you

922
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,920
I love you

923
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,840
I love you

924
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,880
I love you

925
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,920
I love you

926
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,880
I love you

927
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,960
ILOVEYOU

928
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,040
What are you laughing at?

929
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,480
What's so funny?

930
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,280
good

931
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,960
But you know I'm hard?

932
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,040
Emotion, I know this feeling.

933
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,640
Needs to be responded to.

934
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,200
You know I'm hard.

935
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,280
Most of the time, my efforts

936
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,600
Can't be answered.

937
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,520
But no matter what,

938
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,360
Here, I'm going to

939
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,480
To tell you that I love you.

940
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,240
Hello, Si Da.

941
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,800
Can you help me with the arrangement?

942
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,880
what

943
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,720
To help you with the rehearsal.

944
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,600
No, no.

945
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,520
I'm busy now.

946
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,920
Besides, I'm not a director.

947
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,160
How can I help you?

948
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,840
She asked me to overcome the psychological barrier.

949
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,760
I thought of you first.

950
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,880
Can you help me?

951
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,760
He asked you to call me.

952
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,760
No

953
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,960
But she values it very much.

954
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,200
This chance

955
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,640
I don't want to let her down.

956
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,360
Okay, wait for me.

957
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,080
I'll be there soon.

958
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,360
very good

959
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,640
mother

960
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,960
You're still sitting in the courtyard.

961
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,120
In the moonlight,

962
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,680
Looking at that RV?

963
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,400
The moon above the elm tree

964
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,200
Sida

965
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,160
You must work hard.

966
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,760
You must pass the audition.

967
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,080
We will be able to

968
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,320
We meet every day.

969
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,320
Who are you?

970
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,440
What are you doing here?

971
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,280
She's bad-tempered.

972
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,280
I didn't see Star inside.

973
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Are you practicing?

974
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,160
If I'm right,

975
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,000
You're the one

976
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,400
To get Sida into trouble.

977
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,240
Than Dugu Ruoruo.

978
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
And a powerful woman.

979
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,800
Shen Qiansha.

980
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,760
How do you know me?

981
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,640
I seem to be in the company.

982
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,680
Haven't I seen you before?

983
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,840
Answer me one question first.

984
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,440
Do you want to see it?

985
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,720
Is Star rehearsing?

986
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,520
Of course I want to.

987
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,040
But I'm not qualified.

988
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,920
Now, I have...

989
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,040
Is not his assistant anymore.

990
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,040
To meet each other.

991
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,680
I'm the acting teacher of Star.

992
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,240
Hello, hello.

993
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,640
Would you like me to invite you in?

994
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,200
Yes, I'm willing.

995
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,000
Brother, you're here.

996
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,760
You're a good friend. I'll come as soon as I tell you.

997
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,880
Come on. Hurry up.

998
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,000
Teach me this.

999
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,760
This one.

1000
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,680
How to do it?

1001
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,680
I really can't.

1002
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,080
Sida

1003
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,560
Qian Sha, what are you doing there?

1004
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,080
I'm training.

1005
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,360
Don't bother me.

1006
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,880
I asked her to come.

1007
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,440
Not brother.

1008
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,720
Don't you know she's a thunder?

1009
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,040
I know.

1010
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,680
I also know that she kissed you.

1011
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,560
And confessed to you, right?

1012
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,560
Stop it.

1013
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,320
The thought of it makes me sick.

1014
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
This time,

1015
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,760
You want her to help you with the drama.

1016
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,480
To compete with her.

1017
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,720
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

1018
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,840
I'm willing to act.

1019
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,800
I don't want to.

1020
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I will.

1021
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,320
No, no. Don't.

1022
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,680
Sida

1023
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,120
To cure you,

1024
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,440
Heterosexual social disorder

1025
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,960
You must have Shen Qiansha's help.

1026
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,520
Combat poison with poison

1027
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,400
Besides,

1028
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,080
Aren't you always afraid

1029
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,320
This kind of woman?

1030
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,760
Just right

1031
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,600
If you can overcome it,

1032
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,320
Such an opponent.

1033
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,000
In the future,

1034
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Which opponent did you meet?

1035
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,120
You can handle it well.

1036
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,720
Brother

1037
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,400
Is there no other way?

1038
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
Let's change.

1039
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,240
It's really not working.

1040
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,480
If this kind of girl

1041
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,640
You can handle it.

1042
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,520
What are you afraid of?

1043
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,080
Okay, don't waste time.

1044
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,640
Let's start.

1045
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,400
Brother

1046
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,000
Now, Star is heading towards Qiansha.

1047
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,960
Take a step.

1048
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,880
Qiansha is also heading towards Sida.

1049
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,600
Take a step.

1050
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,120
Sida

1051
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,920
Open your eyes.

1052
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,440
During the whole process,

1053
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,120
You must have only Qiansha in your eyes.

1054
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,280
Even if you have

1055
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,960
Ten thousand voices.

1056
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,200
To avoid her eyes.

1057
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,160
You have to break it.

1058
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,120
The ten thousand voices

1059
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,160
Sida

1060
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,680
Don't be afraid.

1061
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,920
I'm here to help you.

1062
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,080
I know you hate me.

1063
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,880
But if this kind of hate

1064
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,520
Will cure you.

1065
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,760
Heterosexual communication disorder

1066
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,880
I'd rather be hated by you.

1067
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,720
Brother

1068
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,560
I can't. I really want to vomit.

1069
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,200
Go there and vomit.
