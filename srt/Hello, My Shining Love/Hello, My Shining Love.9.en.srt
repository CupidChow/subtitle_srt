1
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,160
Haven't you always

2
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,280
hated her?

3
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,600
Actually, she's not to blame for the car accident.

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,920
If I had listened to her earlier,

5
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,480
I wouldn't have

6
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,600
ended up like this,

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,000
When I'm discharged from the hospital,

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,040
I'll explain everything

9
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,240
to the company myself,

10
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,160
I didn't expect that

11
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,760
you would speak for her.

12
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,560
Although I'm in a coma,

13
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm conscious.

14
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,040
During this period of time,

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,480
I can always hear Dugu Ruonan

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,920
nagging in my ear,

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,680
She must have been there for me.

18
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,320
She's really

19
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,600
annoying.

20
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,680
You said I was in a coma,

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,000
but she didn't let me go.

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,280
It's all your illusion.

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,240
How could she come to see you?

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
What do you mean?

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,360
You mean,

26
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,120
she didn't come to see me.

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,120
People like her

28
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,320
have long forgotten about you.

29
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
You made such a big scene,

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,960
the hospital said,

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,480
You may not wake up again.

32
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,600
So in her heart,

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,320
you have long lost your use value.

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,440
Take a look.

35
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,600
The boy on the cover,

36
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,360
is her newly signed male artist.

37
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,320
While you were unconscious,

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,160
he took your place.

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,120
Dugu Ruonan abandoned you a long time ago,

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,480
she has forgotten you.

41
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,120
Don't worry, Zihao.

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,480
They won't be famous for long.

43
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,440
I'll help you.

44
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,320
Take back everything

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,080
that belongs to you.

46
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,120
Why did you do that?

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,360
Because the enemy of the enemy

48
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,920
is a friend.

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,400
Mr. Wu,

50
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,800
why are you here?

51
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,800
I'm here today

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,240
just to have a chat,

53
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,880
As for our advertising collaboration this year,

54
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,320
haven't we

55
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,480
discussed this?

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Following the commercial we shot before,

57
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm sorry,

58
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,160
After internal discussions in our company,

59
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,320
we all think Song Zihao

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,440
has been in the hospital,

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,360
There's no exposure,

62
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,240
so you're here today

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,320
to terminate the contract,

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,360
That's not true.

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,800
Our two companies

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,079
have been working together for so many years,

67
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,160
I appreciate your ability to work,

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,160
and I hope

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,560
I can continue to work with you.

70
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,280
So, I hope

71
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,760
you can change your artist,

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,360
To replace Song Zihao,

73
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,600
and continue to fulfill his endorsement contract.

74
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,800
I heard that

75
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,560
you signed a new model,

76
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,240
His name is Sida.

77
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,240
Is he very popular in the fashion circle?

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,040
I see.

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,000
You want to use Sida

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,240
as your new spokesperson.

81
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,880
Yes.

82
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,560
Sida does have a lot of potential.

83
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,120
But Zihao is his senior.

84
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,400
While he was in the hospital,

85
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,240
Star stole his endorsement,

86
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,600
If it gets out like this,

87
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
whether it's for Sida,

88
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,840
It will affect

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
your company.

90
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,560
Can you give me some time?

91
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,760
Let me think about it.

92
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,840
Okay,

93
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,360
Then.

94
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,560
I'm waiting for your reply.

95
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,040
Ruonan, you're a smart person,

96
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,600
I believe,

97
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,000
You can weigh the pros and cons.

98
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,000
Tong,

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,160
the advertiser came to the company just now.

100
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,080
She said she wanted Si Da

101
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,640
to be the spokesperson of her company

102
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,920
for the new season

103
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,000
Does Dugu Ruonan agree?

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Not yet.

105
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,360
If Shengnan seems to be still thinking about it,

106
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,120
But now advertisers are really realistic,

107
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,480
Song Zihao is still lying in the hospital,

108
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,920
They can't wait to change people.

109
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,480
If Zihao sees this,

110
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
he will be very sad.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's good to change it,

112
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,880
so that he can give up.

113
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,760
Who is it? Song Zihao?

114
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,680
Isn't he still lying in the hospital?

115
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,680
Inform Mr. Wu.

116
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,360
Just tell him that

117
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,640
the company has agreed to replace him.

118
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,960
Ask him to send me the contract.

119
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay, Tong.

120
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,040
What is this?

121
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,280
This is a replacement contract.

122
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,240
Dugu Ruonan

123
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,920
went to the brand today.

124
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,240
Ask them to use Star

125
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,920
as the spokesperson for the next season,

126
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,960
Dugu Ruonan has

127
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,280
completely abandoned you.

128
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,480
Why are you still in love with her?

129
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,800
Don't wait any longer.

130
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,800
In addition to her interests,

131
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,200
she doesn't care about you at all.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,160
I'm leaving the hospital.

133
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,200
I want to take back everything that belongs to me.

134
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,440
You're back.

135
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,200
I've been waiting for you.

136
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,000
Here's the thing.

137
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,120
I have something to ask you,

138
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,120
I have to face

139
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,560
a very difficult choice now.

140
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,320
I'd like to hear

141
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,600
your professional opinion,

142
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,160
Not interested.

143
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,280
Today, the advertisers came to me,

144
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
asking Sida to be their spokesperson

145
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,520
for the new season.

146
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,680
Isn't that a good thing?

147
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,320
That means

148
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,160
replacing Song Zihao.

149
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,320
Of course, I know

150
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,720
he's been in a coma for so long,

151
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,440
Forgotten is for sure,

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,400
but this day is coming.

153
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,280
I still can't bear it.

154
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,840
Zihao worked so hard

155
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,400
to put it all together.

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,320
How could I...?

157
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,800
How can I be cruel?

158
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,520
You just think,

159
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,720
it's unfair to Song Zihao,

160
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,960
Have you considered

161
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,040
Sida's feelings?

162
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,440
That's why I'm struggling.

163
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,800
I brought

164
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,120
them up.

165
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,000
I've seen them

166
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,320
come this far bit by bit,

167
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,560
It's hard for me to make a choice.

168
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,880
It's not hard for you to make a choice.

169
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,400
You just want to escape.

170
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,760
You want to extend Song Zihao's

171
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,960
elimination time

172
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,480
to make yourself feel better.

173
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
In other words,

174
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,000
even if Sida

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,240
doesn't eliminate Song Zihao,

176
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,080
the advertisers need to find someone to replace him.

177
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,040
This is not your choice.

178
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,840
Yes.

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,160
You're still blaming yourself

180
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,880
for what happened to Song Zihao.

181
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,440
Because you feel guilty,

182
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,400
you subconsciously have

183
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,640
a compensation mechanism,

184
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,280
You want to make it up to Song Zihao,

185
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,920
but this kind of emotion

186
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,080
is irrational.

187
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,560
Of course I feel guilty.

188
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,520
He's still in a coma.

189
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,080
I can't help him.

190
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,080
have to

191
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,799
Think of some ways to make it up to him.

192
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,679
If it weren't for you,

193
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,080
there wouldn't be him.

194
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,600
In today's high-profile world,

195
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,560
gains and losses are relative.

196
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,680
As for his own choice,

197
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,920
he can only bear it himself.

198
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,600
Your compensation

199
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,680
is meaningless.

200
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,640
It can only increase the psychological burden.

201
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
Don't wait.

202
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,920
Cherish the person in front of you.

203
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,680
Let bygones be bygones.

204
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,480
Put it down.

205
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,840
You still can't let go of yourself,

206
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,000
what do you mean?

207
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,480
When your ex-girlfriend

208
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,560
stays in this house,

209
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,920
Isn't it just to wait for her?

210
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,720
Sida told you that.

211
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,120
I forced him to say it.

212
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,320
No wonder I thought,

213
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,440
why are you so obsessed

214
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,440
with this house,

215
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,040
It's because of your ex-girlfriend,

216
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,800
I didn't know you were so infatuated,

217
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,920
Is this

218
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,240
the kind of compensation

219
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,480
you mentioned,

220
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
Did you do anything

221
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,360
wrong to her,

222
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,080
Or is there a misunderstanding between you two?

223
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,560
I'm warning you,

224
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,080
don't bring it up again.

225
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,720
Believe it or not,

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,600
I'll let you move out right now.

227
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,600
The house belongs to me,

228
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,000
so you should move it.

229
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,080
Isn't that too much?

230
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,200
I just want to care about him.

231
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,960
Who is he?

232
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,840
Tell me who he is?

233
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,080
Ji Mo

234
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,960
No, he's my boyfriend.

235
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,160
Please go inside.

236
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,480
I'll talk to him alone.

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,240
You did it for him.

238
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,360
Break up with me.

239
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,480
Yes.

240
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,520
Why?

241
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,320
Why? Because I'm tired.

242
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
You only care about

243
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
what the patients think all day long?

244
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,160
When did you ever care about

245
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,880
what I thought?

246
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,240
You don't know how to

247
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,800
love someone at all,

248
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,840
You don't know how to love me at all.

249
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,200
I already have a boyfriend.

250
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,400
Please don't

251
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
pester me again.

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,440
Why haven't you got up yet?

253
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,360
Are you still mad at me?

254
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,400
Get up.

255
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,480
I just made a lot of breakfast.

256
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,120
Do you want to join us?

257
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm sorry

258
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,040
about last night,

259
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
I didn't mean

260
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
to remind you,

261
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,040
The lease contract stipulates that

262
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,840
each other does not interfere in each other's privacy

263
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,680
and life,

264
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,080
I hope you don't cross the line.

265
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,480
You and I

266
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,080
are just roommates,

267
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,840
Do you have to be like this?

268
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,400
I've apologized to you.

269
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,000
Besides,

270
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
if you hadn't argued with me

271
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,600
about Song Zihao last night.

272
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,480
I wouldn't have mentioned those things.

273
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,600
Okay, I crossed the line.

274
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,160
Keep a distance between us

275
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,120
from now on.

276
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,400
I won't meddle in your business anymore.

277
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,480
You have to keep your distance from me.

278
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,520
I want to keep my distance from you.

279
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,320
What's the big deal?

280
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,880
A man with 80 thousand,

281
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,960
is he handsome?

282
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,160
Not bad. Is there anyone

283
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,640
more handsome than Jincheng?

284
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,440
No.

285
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,560
Hey,

286
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,440
Mr. Wu,

287
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,040
what contract?

288
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,680
I didn't ask you

289
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,800
to send me the contract.

290
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,400
I told you

291
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,720
to reconsider.

292
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,800
Okay,

293
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,480
I'll see you later at our company. Okay,

294
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Okay, bye.

295
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,440
What's going on?

296
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,640
Come on,

297
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,000
You're in good shape

298
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,720
today. Take a break.

299
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,000
Be careful.

300
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,080
Watch out!

301
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,040
Slow down.

302
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,480
No need.

303
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,400
When can I leave the hospital?

304
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,160
The doctor said

305
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,560
we need to observe him for a few more days.

306
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,000
I have no problem with my action now.

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I've been lying down for too long.

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,120
What else do you need to observe?

309
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,120
If I stay here

310
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,160
any longer.

311
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,000
His popularity and exposure will be gone.

312
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,280
I can't wait

313
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,040
for others to forget me.

314
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,960
Let's go out.

315
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,000
Especially Dugu Ruonan,

316
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,640
I want to confront her face to face.

317
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,480
No way.

318
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,160
Why not?

319
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,080
She

320
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,960
I'm sure he won't admit it.

321
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,680
As you know,

322
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,520
Dugu Ruonan

323
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,040
is a liar!

324
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,000
If she finds out,

325
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,240
you're awake.

326
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,920
Maybe we'll strike first,

327
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,160
so we can't take it lightly.

328
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,160
You,

329
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,160
Go back to the ward and rest.

330
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,960
It suddenly occurred to me

331
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,280
that I have something to deal with.

332
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,720
Remember,

333
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
don't let Dugu Ruonan

334
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,320
know that you're awake.

335
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,960
Why are you here?

336
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,920
Ruonan,

337
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,920
what's wrong?

338
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,640
You're the only one allowed to visit Song Zihao.

339
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,360
Can't I come to see him?

340
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,800
You still have a conscience.

341
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,960
I'm different from you.

342
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,680
As soon as Song Zihao fell into a coma,

343
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,120
you were busy informing the advertisers,

344
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,160
Change the spokesperson right away,

345
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,200
are you in such a hurry

346
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
to push Sida to the top?

347
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,160
I don't even want my conscience.

348
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,240
Who said I agreed?

349
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,560
You're the one who told Mr. Wu

350
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,120
that I promised to change the spokesperson,

351
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,400
Don't talk nonsense

352
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,280
if you ask him to send me the contract.

353
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,160
Do you have any proof?

354
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,120
I don't know what you're up to.

355
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,200
But I warned you,

356
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,600
if you step on my bottom line again,

357
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,240
I'll make you look good.

358
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,480
Have you ever heard of the saying,

359
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,800
"Buddha is in your heart? ",

360
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,200
Everyone is a Buddha.

361
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,839
If you have shit in your heart,

362
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,560
everyone will be dirty.

363
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,200
In your eyes,

364
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,319
others just do things like

365
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,880
stealing chickens and touching dogs,

366
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,079
In fact,

367
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,640
everyone can't see the light.

368
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,599
You know it best.

369
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,240
Where are you going?

370
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,640
If you want to

371
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,680
see Song Zihao,

372
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,400
I advise you

373
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,319
not to waste your time.

374
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,000
I just talked to the doctor.

375
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,120
He won't wake up again.

376
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,320
Why don't you take advantage of this time,

377
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,200
go back

378
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,680
and cultivate your Sida? Is it none of your business

379
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,000
what I do?

380
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,280
Get out of the way.

381
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,640
You slept well.

382
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,760
Do you know

383
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,840
what's going on out there?

384
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,840
I'm here to tell you that

385
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,720
the advertisers have proposed a substitution,

386
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,960
Star will replace you

387
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,880
as the spokesperson of the new season.

388
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,760
Song Zihao,

389
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,680
there are fewer and fewer opportunities

390
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,440
for you to stand up again.

391
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,880
No one will wait for you forever.

392
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,320
Do you know how realistic

393
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,480
this circle is?

394
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,040
Do you know how fast it is to replace the old and the new?

395
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,760
You don't like to

396
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,040
disagree with me.

397
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,200
Wake up.

398
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,800
If you wake up,

399
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,920
I'll do whatever you want.

400
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,400
Don't act like a loser.

401
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,320
Lie here.

402
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,840
She just came to see you.

403
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,000
What did you say to her?

404
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,040
still

405
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,200
What sweet words did she say,

406
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,720
and now you forgive her?

407
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,680
I will never forgive her.

408
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,640
Dugu Ruonan and I

409
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,360
are at daggers drawn,

410
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
Get me discharged immediately.

411
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't want to stay here

412
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,920
like a cripple anymore.

413
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Have you made up your mind?

414
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
I've made up my mind.

415
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,960
I promise to cooperate with you.

416
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,760
I'm going to put Dugu Ruonan

417
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,920
and Sida under my feet.

418
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,960
I want her to regret it.

419
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,800
Everything I did today.

420
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,240
Mr. Ji.

421
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,600
Why are you here again?

422
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,240
What do you mean again?

423
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,560
Aren't you happy to see me?

424
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,520
Besides,

425
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,560
you didn't know I was waiting for you.

426
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,280
I'm just waiting for you.

427
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,640
I advise you not to waste your time,

428
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
but to move on to another target.

429
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,640
Where are you going?

430
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,000
Let me see you off.

431
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,920
On the way,

432
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,160
I don't have time to mess with you.

433
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,480
I'm not messing with you.

434
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,080
If you're going to work,

435
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,760
you'll get extra points if you take me with you.

436
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,240
It's not about work,

437
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,000
it's about personal matters,

438
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,120
Then I'm going even more.

439
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,440
I want to see who

440
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,280
is more important than me.

441
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,880
Let's go. I'll drive you to the car

442
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,920
and wait for you.

443
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,360
Did you bring anything?

444
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,600
Yes.

445
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,080
You …

446
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,880
You … Are you

447
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,840
the popular Chen

448
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,800
Fei'er lately?

449
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,160
Yes, it's me.

450
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,480
-Hello. -Hello.

451
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
My name is Ali.

452
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,080
I …

453
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,320
Ali, I saw your commercial

454
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,640
before,

455
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,440
I didn't expect you

456
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,960
to be prettier in person than that photo.

457
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,160
I know.

458
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,360
Ali, right?

459
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,720
Very tasteful.

460
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,320
How do you know each other?

461
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,440
I'm his future girlfriend.

462
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,960
Colleagues. Our company

463
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,880
signed a model contract.

464
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,880
Tell me

465
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,720
about the future,

466
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,480
How could he like you

467
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,760
as an insulator of love?

468
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,320
Love insulator,

469
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,360
he's never been in a relationship before,

470
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,240
Yes.

471
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
I've had a lot of girlfriends.

472
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,000
Give me some girlfriend stuff.

473
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,440
What is it?

474
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,120
Yes,

475
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,520
that's right. That's beside the point.

476
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,280
That's beside the point.

477
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,600
The medicine for insomnia,

478
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,800
you two talk first.

479
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,880
I need to go to the washroom.

480
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,920
Ali,

481
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,800
so how did you

482
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,880
and Ji Mo meet?

483
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,000
Are you close?

484
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,280
We're close.

485
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
When we were in Cambridge, England,

486
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,680
we were studying,

487
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,880
I'm his senior.

488
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,880
You two should be familiar with each other,

489
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,120
but do you know

490
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,040
what kind of woman

491
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,680
Ji Mo likes?

492
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,800
You seem to be very interested

493
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
in Ji Mo.

494
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,960
Is it that obvious?

495
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,920
I'm very interested in him.

496
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,080
But he seems to be

497
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,120
hot and cold to me,

498
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,200
I don't know what he's thinking.

499
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,920
Hello,

500
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,440
I'm the actor Song Zihao,

501
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,600
I didn't regulate my words

502
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,560
and deeds some time ago,

503
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,840
I have reflected deeply

504
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,000
and sincerely apologize to everyone,

505
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,880
For some reason,

506
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,960
I've officially replaced

507
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,920
my former agent, Miss Dugu Ruonan,

508
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,200
From now on,

509
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,800
all my acting affairs,

510
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,000
It will be managed by Miss Tong

511
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,880
beside me.

512
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,120
Ji Mo is a neat

513
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
freak.

514
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,960
I said at home,

515
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,760
yeah, I put Ji Mo

516
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,760
in the tool,

517
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,120
Ali just said that

518
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,480
he really wants to go to the movies,

519
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,560
Let's go to the movies.

520
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,040
I didn't say that, did I?

521
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,400
Yeah, we were talking about

522
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,240
watching a movie.

523
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,560
He said the recent movie

524
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,200
is pretty good.

525
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
Why don't we go and watch it together?

526
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,840
Let's go and watch it together.

527
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,800
Where are you going?

528
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,080
Ji.

529
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,280
For some reason,

530
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,200
I've officially replaced

531
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,200
my former agent, Miss Dugu Ruonan,

532
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,320
From today on, Song Zihao

533
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,200
has been discharged from the hospital.

534
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,800
Why haven't you heard of it before?

535
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,080
Dugu Ruonan is in trouble this time.

536
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,560
It was rumored that

537
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,360
Song Zihao had a car accident because of her,

538
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,440
This time, as soon as Song Zihao was discharged from the hospital,

539
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,480
he changed his agent.

540
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,040
Isn't it true?

541
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,400
Am I right?

542
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,320
Zihao is awake.

543
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,800
It's good that you're awake.

544
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,120
Now is not the time

545
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,480
for you to be thankful.

546
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,120
I wonder, too.

547
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,440
Why did Zihao wake up?

548
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,080
But the hospital didn't inform me.

549
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,440
I was watching the video just now,

550
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,840
and Tong Tong announced,

551
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,920
When Song Zihao was sick,

552
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,960
he blinked frequently,

553
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,080
That means she's lying.

554
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,160
She knew

555
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,280
Song Zihao's condition a long time ago.

556
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,800
When Song Zihao announced

557
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,720
that

558
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,640
Tong Tong was his new agent,

559
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,560
Tong Tong raised the corner of her mouth.

560
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,760
This detail shows that she is very contemptuous.

561
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,720
Proud,

562
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,000
all this,

563
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,800
She planned it all by herself.

564
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,320
It turned out to be her.

565
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,040
No wonder.

566
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,200
She kept stopping me from going to see Zihao,

567
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,880
and didn't let the hospital inform me.

568
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,520
He's awake.

569
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,080
How do you know so clearly?

570
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,080
He even came to pick me up.

571
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,320
I was just passing by.

572
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,440
Thank you.

573
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,480
So what are you going to do now?

574
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,560
I don't know either.

575
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,640
You've become the target

576
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,600
of public criticism.

577
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,520
Not showing up is

578
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,400
your best choice,

579
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,840
I don't want to watch cell phones, magazines or TV

580
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,600
these days.

581
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,440
Give yourself a break,

582
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
be quiet,

583
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,320
What about you?

584
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
I'll go with you.

585
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,600
switch off an electrical device

586
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,080
Don't you even have a reasonable explanation

587
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,760
for leaving like this?

588
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,360
Really?

589
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,280
Why are you so unlucky?

590
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Since you're so unlucky,

591
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,520
it won't be bad again, will it?

592
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,120
What do you mean?

593
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,880
Let me take you to a place.

594
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,920
It'll make you feel better.

595
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,320
I'll take you on a date.

596
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,680
Don't think too much.

597
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,000
Ji Mo owes you a date?

598
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
As a senior, I'll make it up to you for him.

599
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,400
Let's go.

600
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
You're welcome.

601
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,480
Why did you bring me to the beach?

602
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,520
There are no reporters

603
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,200
or outsiders here,

604
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,160
You can vent your emotions here

605
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,440
at will,

606
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,960
You don't

607
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,640
want me

608
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,960
to be like a TV,

609
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,960
Yell into the sea.

610
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,560
It doesn't matter.

611
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,120
If you swim naked in the sea,

612
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,320
I won't even look at you.

613
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,400
You wish.

614
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,880
But the scenery here

615
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,080
is nice.

616
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,840
Next time,

617
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,200
you can shoot here.

618
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,480
Can you let go of your work

619
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,600
one day?

620
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,200
So what?

621
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,920
I have to work the next day.

622
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,200
But,

623
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,160
come out for a walk,

624
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,520
It's a nice person.

625
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,680
When you're nervous,

626
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,920
The brain will be deprived of oxygen,

627
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,440
and at this time,

628
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,400
You just need to relax.

629
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,560
Inhale more oxygen,

630
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,200
so that you can feel happy.

631
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,440
You're

632
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,040
quite considerate.

633
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,760
Ji Mo, isn't the water

634
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,720
deep here?

635
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,720
I don't think it's deep.

636
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,080
Why do you ask?

637
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,960
Because you may leave.

638
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,000
It's really not that deep.

639
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,920
Dugu Ruonan,

640
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,600
what are you doing?

641
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,360
I told my mom,

642
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,600
don't be like this.

643
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,720
Let's talk about it.

644
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,080
I'm so pissed off.

645
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,120
Let me tell you,

646
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
their meat

647
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,680
is really delicious.

648
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
I often come to their house.

649
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,560
Can you order so many dishes

650
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,600
for one person?

651
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,960
Let's eat together.

652
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,480
I can't eat it.

653
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,720
I'm taking a photo tomorrow,

654
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,000
especially with this

655
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,960
carbohydrate,

656
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,440
After eating this,

657
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,720
my face will swell up tomorrow.

658
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,600
All right.

659
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,640
You look hungry.

660
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,120
Would you like some meat?

661
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,360
Just one bite.

662
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm very strict

663
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,600
with my body.

664
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,400
Don't tempt me.

665
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,800
All right.

666
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
So juicy.

667
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,480
You brought me here

668
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,680
to piss me off, didn't you?

669
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,280
I didn't mean to piss you off.

670
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,960
I just want you to be happy.

671
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,600
Food can increase

672
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,440
dopamine secretion,

673
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,360
It makes you happy.

674
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,800
Do you know that

675
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,880
if I take this bite,

676
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,760
My face

677
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,760
will swell up tomorrow.

678
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,280
I can't get fat.

679
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,480
I can't wear the smallest size

680
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,360
once I'm fat,

681
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,000
I just.

682
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,200
Well,

683
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,000
No one likes me.

684
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,240
Is it that exaggerated?

685
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,080
Do you think

686
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm just a vase?

687
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,960
I am,

688
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,600
but I'm also a valuable vase.

689
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,480
Is it easy for me? It's not easy for me.

690
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,800
First of all, I don't think

691
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,680
you're a vase, do I?

692
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,800
And I don't think you can't fit into

693
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,480
the smallest size,

694
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,560
I'm not a good model.

695
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,200
Even if you gain weight,

696
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,080
but the one who really likes you,

697
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,200
I'll still like you.

698
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,160
Although today is

699
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,000
the first time we've met,

700
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,320
But I think,

701
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,600
compared to your appearance,

702
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,320
Your character is more attractive.

703
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,880
So you can

704
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,080
break the jar today.

705
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,680
Okay?

706
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,520
It's already such bad luck.

707
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,840
After today,

708
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,880
Stop making excuses for yourself.

709
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,360
Is it good?

710
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,640
Isn't it delicious?

711
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,040
Come on, try this.

712
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,600
This beef is amazing.

713
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,360
Come on, try this.

714
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,920
Don't eat instant noodles.

715
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,840
Eat more meat.

716
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,440
Pay more attention to your image.

717
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,040
You're a star.

718
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,960
Try this meat again.

719
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,480
This meat

720
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,280
is super tender.

721
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,560
It's a little hot.

722
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,120
Is it good?

723
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Are you okay?

724
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,800
It's okay,

725
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,080
it's okay,

726
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,760
Do you need me to take you to the hospital?

727
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,360
No need.

728
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,800
I throw up when I eat too much.

729
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,000
Just spit it out.

730
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,680
Do you often vomit?

731
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,880
Yes.

732
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,960
All right. I threw up.

733
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,200
I've vented my anger.

734
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,640
And I'm in a better mood,

735
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,960
maybe we won't

736
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,880
see each other again,

737
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,760
But thank you for your company today.

738
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,120
I think we might

739
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,320
see each other again.

740
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,680
Miss Chen Fei'er,

741
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,200
I suspect you're sick now.

742
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,760
Anorexia,

743
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,960
or bulimia.

744
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
This morbid state of mind

745
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,480
causes your body,

746
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,720
Nervous conditioned reflex.

747
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,600
It's a mental illness.

748
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,400
I suggest you pay more attention to it.

749
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,160
Really

750
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,560
At the very least,

751
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,440
it might affect your

752
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
mental health,

753
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,880
It caused you to suffer from anorexia.

754
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
In a big way,

755
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,760
it might even endanger your life.

756
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,719
Why is it so serious?

757
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,040
Besides,

758
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,600
you're not a doctor.

759
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,800
I'm a doctor.

760
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,400
I'm a psychologist.

761
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,000
Welcome to my hospital.

762
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,440
I'll give you a psychological treatment,

763
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,199
of course,

764
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,280
If you have any other psychological problems,

765
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,440
you can come to me at any time.

766
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,960
It's so cold.

767
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,920
Get back to the car.

768
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,600
It's all you.

769
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,719
Who told you to push me? It really

770
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,600
made my whole body wet and cold.

771
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,520
Hurry up.

772
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,320
Hurry up. Get back in the car.

773
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,320
No, no, no.

774
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,840
-It's so cold. -It's so cold. Are

775
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,000
you home?

776
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,159
Sister.

777
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,120
That's weird.

778
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,400
The phone is off too.

779
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,840
She's not home either.

780
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,440
Thank you for today.

781
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,000
Coming out for a walk,

782
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,320
I feel much better.

783
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,480
You've said so many

784
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
thanks to me these days.

785
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,080
How are you going to repay me?

786
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,480
Don't expect me

787
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,760
to sell the house to you.

788
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,880
I would have forgotten if you hadn't mentioned it.

789
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,640
When are you going to

790
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,320
sell the house to me.

791
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,200
You wish.

792
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,840
Then why do you

793
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,800
have to stay in that house.

794
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,360
Is it for your ex-girlfriend?

795
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,280
Get out of the car.

796
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,480
I don't want to ask.

797
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,520
I won't ask.

798
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,480
Why did you ask me to get out of the car?

799
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,160
In the middle of nowhere.

800
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,080
Where am I going?

801
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,920
I didn't kick you out.

802
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,760
The car ran out of gas.

803
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,680
We're out of gas.

804
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,840
Then.

805
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,320
Why are you out of gas?

806
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,240
You even brought me to the middle of nowhere,

807
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,600
because it ran out of gas

808
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,560
and it was an unplanned emergency,

809
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,760
What should we do now?

810
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,400
Now,

811
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,600
the gas station must be closed.

812
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,960
We might as well find a place to stay.

813
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,440
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

814
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,640
What? There's only one room?

815
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,840
Am I right?

816
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,280
Auntie, please think of another way.

817
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,880
We really can't live together.

818
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,520
In the middle of the night,

819
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,960
a man and a woman came out to get a room,

820
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,320
Why are you pretending to be reserved?

821
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,200
You misunderstood.

822
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,640
There's only one room anyway.

823
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,320
It's up to you

824
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,640
if you can't stay here.

825
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,840
We're staying.

826
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,280
Are you really going to live with me?

827
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,160
I'm still a man.

828
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,400
Don't you have any scruples?

829
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,200
Anyway, it's written

830
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,960
in the contract.

831
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,480
If you dare to do anything to me,

832
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,800
you can move out tomorrow.

833
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,640
You don't care, do you?

834
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,720
Why are you nervous?

835
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,920
Who said I was nervous?

836
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,160
I don't even want

837
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,760
someone like you to be naked.

838
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,920
But your actions betrayed you.

839
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,440
If you lean back,

840
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,600
it means you're resisting it.

841
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,920
Are you nervous?

842
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,840
Don't mess around.

843
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,920
I... I did.

844
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,640
I really did.

845
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,200
I'm still a man,

846
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,480
but what if I give up the contract

847
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,000
on impulse?

848
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,160
What are you imagining?

849
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
I'm not fantasizing about what?

850
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,520
Then why did you close your eyes?

851
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,720
I can't even close my eyes because my eyes are sore.

852
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,320
Really?

853
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,200
Don't look at my face.

854
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,360
Nice look.

855
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,240
Go take a shower. Don't catch a cold.

856
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,120
Gosh,

857
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,720
you're not really going to sleep

858
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,840
in the same room

859
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,160
with him tonight.

860
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,000
Even though we used to live together

861
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,640
and sleep in the same bed,

862
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
But that was

863
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,000
when I was drunk

864
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,080
or he was sleepwalking,

865
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,240
Both of them are so sober now.

866
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,560
Isn't it awkward?

867
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,360
It's a long night. It's too dangerous

868
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,560
to be alone

869
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,800
with a man and a woman.

870
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,640
Dugu Ruonan,

871
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,040
don't talk to yourself all the time,

872
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,560
Okay?

873
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,720
You look like a madman.

874
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,240
All right,

875
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,720
all right.

876
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,920
Hello,

877
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,760
bring me a quilt.

878
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,640
And a bed sheet,

879
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,400
and a hair dryer,

880
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Okay. Thank you.

881
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,880
What is she thinking?

882
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,000
You promised to sleep with a man.

883
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,000
Does she not see me as a man?

884
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,560
Pretty fast.

885
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,680
Come on,

886
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,920
Auntie, I want

887
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,400
a hair dryer, not an electric fan.

888
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,080
Only sheets but no quilts?

889
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,480
The room is full.

890
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,800
There are no extra quilts.

891
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,720
We're not a hotel,

892
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,080
we don't have that hair dryer,

893
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,560
Do you want it or not?

894
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,240
No, I'll take it.

895
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,280
Auntie, do you want it? Yes, yes, yes

896
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,000
Be quiet.

897
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,360
What are you doing?

898
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,920
Take off your wet clothes

899
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,560
and put on this one.

900
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,600
I just dried it.

901
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,600
I'll wear your clothes,

902
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,360
What are you wearing?

903
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,080
My physique is good.

904
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,440
Go now. Don't catch a cold.

905
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,800
The smell of a neat freak

906
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,960
is quite good.

907
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,080
It smells so good.

908
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,000
I didn't expect that,

909
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,280
He's quite considerate.
