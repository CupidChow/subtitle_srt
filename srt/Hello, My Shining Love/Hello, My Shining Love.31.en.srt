1
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,680
That

2
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,280
Star and I are leaving tomorrow.

3
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,920
You must work hard.

4
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,520
Don't move.

5
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,840
You're giving others a hard look.

6
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,440
It will affect you.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
I know.

8
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,080
You're really bad at learning from Duguoruo.

9
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
More and more annoying.

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,720
I don't know how to be a good person.

11
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,960
Wait a second.

12
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,720
Are you leaving now?

13
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,240
Right. Sida and Ruo

14
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,320
Waiting at the door.

15
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,320
But you left.

16
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,320
I'm the only one left here.

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,880
By myself

18
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,160
Actually, it's lonely.

19
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,440
such

20
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,880
You're getting bored.

21
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,040
You can come to me.

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,840
but

23
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,400
When you're acting well,

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
Under the premise,

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,120
Really

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,840
Of course.

27
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,800
We are friends.

28
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,240
Although sometimes you are annoying.

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,120
but

30
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,440
I won't abandon my friends.

31
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,640
Who is your friend?

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
I don't need a friend.

33
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,440
reluctant to admit a mistake

34
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,160
I'm leaving.

35
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,600
OK!

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,040
Bye

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,880
The new drama of Sida.

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,320
Has entered the late stage.

39
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,320
This week's official fair will begin.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,720
To post some publicity stills.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,320
So the pace of our publicity

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,440
To catch up with them.

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,120
We have worked out

44
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
The first step of the publicity plan.

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,640
To cooperate with each other.

46
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,600
Official Bo's publicity.

47
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,000
Using self-media platform

48
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,720
To increase the exposure of Star.

49
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,720
After that, we will discuss with the director team.

50
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,800
In the trailer,

51
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,160
To increase the lens of Star.

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,480
The second round of publicity is mainly

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,360
To match the characters and plot of the play.

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,480
Create multiple sets of partners and topics

55
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,920
To increase the number of people

56
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,520
In the eyes of the fans.

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,480
It's not a long-term solution.

58
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,720
The publicity

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,200
Put it on the front guide.

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,560
To highlight his youth.

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,960
The proposals you proposed

62
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,200
Although it's comprehensive,

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,520
But nothing new.

64
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,960
Do you have any other suggestions?

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,880
I have a young

66
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,760
Little advice.

67
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,960
I don't know if I can

68
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,880
You know,

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
This is my publicity plan.

70
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,040
I think we can jump out

71
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,000
The traditional pattern

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
In a more diversified way.

73
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
To promote Star.

74
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,720
We can use

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,760
The resources of fashion circle.

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,640
For example,

77
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,800
Women of all ages

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
Will focus on

79
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,960
A fashion account.

80
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,960
And a lot of them.

81
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,000
A hit TV series.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Will come out.

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,560
The analysis of wearing.

84
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,080
If you need it,

85
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,080
I'll be there soon.

86
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,800
Make a plan.

87
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,440
I have many stills of him here.

88
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,840
This is a good idea.

89
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,640
And a lot of young people

90
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,000
I like watching short videos.

91
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,320
You can use young people.

92
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,560
The fragmented time.

93
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,200
For example, on the bus,

94
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,840
On the subway,

95
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,920
You can go anywhere.

96
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,320
Watch funny short videos

97
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,960
I can edit a lot.

98
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,520
The daily life of Star.

99
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,280
This will not only draw you closer,

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,200
The image of his popular idol

101
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,800
Can also satisfy

102
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,720
The curiosity of fans

103
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,080
To get closer to each other.

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,000
It's good.

105
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,520
I'll leave it to you.

106
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,920
Leave it to me.

107
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,640
Can I do that?

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,320
I think you can do it.

109
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,400
to accept

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll talk to him about a few more plays.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,040
And a lot of work.

112
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,240
I may be too busy.

113
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
So I need someone

114
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,560
Come and help me.

115
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,720
What about

116
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,040
Do you want to challenge yourself?

117
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
As long as I can help Sida,

118
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,160
I'll do anything.

119
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,080
Alright.

120
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,040
to accept

121
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,280
You will be fully responsible.

122
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,720
remember

123
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,480
You have to use the standard of a manager

124
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,400
To demand yourself

125
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
Okay, I got it.

126
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

127
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,600
I will do my best.

128
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,360
If a man

129
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,280
What a coincidence.

130
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,640
Do you have time?

131
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,480
To have a meal together.

132
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,560
Next time.

133
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,080
I've been busy recently.

134
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,920
I know.

135
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,200
The promotion period of Star.

136
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,160
Has started.

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,960
He needs

138
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,280
A lot of business resources.

139
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,080
And I'm here to see you.

140
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,720
Is your sponsor.

141
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,440
Alright

142
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,520
Let's talk later.

143
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,200
good

144
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
I'll make a call.

145
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,200
You go first.

146
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,160
Waiting for you in the car.

147
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,800
good

148
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,800
See you later.

149
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,240
feed

150
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,080
Today,

151
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,800
We need to deal with it temporarily.

152
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,000
Something important.

153
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,800
Will come home later.

154
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,720
Will it be late?

155
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,480
Do you want me to pick you up?

156
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,920
No, no.

157
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,840
I'm having dinner with the sponsor.

158
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,680
And then I want to say whether

159
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,000
Dora, a little publicity cooperation.

160
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,000
I might work overtime today.

161
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,400
Don't be too tired.

162
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,200
Take care

163
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,520
See you at home.

164
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,480
See you at home.

165
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,120
Mr. Ji, are you looking for me?

166
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
The proposal of the Sales Department

167
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,680
Give it to Sermantha.

168
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,360
I dare not.

169
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
Samantha has been painting.

170
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,480
And told everyone

171
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,400
Don't bother her.

172
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,760
She has been working overtime.

173
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,360
That's right.

174
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,280
I didn't go back yesterday.

175
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,160
Even the office

176
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,080
Hasn't come out yet.

177
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,080
Suxiao

178
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,840
What's wrong with you?

179
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,880
Nothing

180
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,080
I have a stomachache.

181
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
I haven't eaten.

182
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,760
I haven't finished the script yet.

183
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,840
I forgot.

184
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,360
You were seriously ill before.

185
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,200
My body can't stand the torture.

186
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,480
Let's go.

187
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,520
what are you doing?

188
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
To have dinner with me.

189
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,360
Can you come in with me?

190
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,840
I'm not going in.

191
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,760
I have no appetite.

192
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,039
before

193
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,679
When I was doing treatment abroad,

194
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,280
Because of work,

195
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,760
I can't be with you every day.

196
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,559
I'm doing chemotherapy alone.

197
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,280
To perform the surgery alone.

198
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Eating alone.

199
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,040
actually

200
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,480
The pain of chemotherapy

201
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,400
Is not the hardest.

202
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,800
The hardest part.

203
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,960
Is eating alone.

204
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,360
The air will amplify the sound of chewing.

205
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,840
The voice seemed to tell me

206
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,880
You only have one person.

207
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,960
You can't go on.

208
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,720
You can't hold on.

209
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,240
Zimmer

210
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,160
You don't need to eat it.

211
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,800
Stay there with me, okay?

212
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,800
Although Star is a newbie,

213
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,440
But since his debut,

214
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,960
His image has always been good.

215
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,120
With the successful transformation,

216
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,360
Many of his fans

217
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,200
Are looking forward to his new work.

218
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,120
Well

219
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,480
As you know,

220
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,560
I chose the script.

221
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,080
Has always been very strict.

222
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,720
His next work

223
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,120
It'll be huge.

224
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,280
that's right

225
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
I've checked.

226
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Your team

227
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,840
There are many products.

228
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,000
You haven't found a spokesman yet.

229
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,600
It seems to be jewelry.

230
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,520
Skincare products.

231
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,040
Are suitable for Star.

232
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,120
What about

233
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,040
Think about it.

234
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,920
I know.

235
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,160
What about you?

236
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,640
For work.

237
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,040
So you agreed to have this meal with me.

238
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,120
But you're so direct.

239
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
I don't think so.

240
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,240
Too anxious?

241
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,520
Of course I'm anxious.

242
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,480
Si Da has finished shooting.

243
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,280
I want to make sure

244
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,160
The resources behind him

245
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,120
You have to keep up.

246
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,680
We have known each other for so long.

247
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,280
Every time,

248
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,360
You always

249
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,640
A workaholic.

250
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,040
In front of me.

251
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,680
But,

252
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,320
The more you act like this,

253
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,080
The more I want to be close to you.

254
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,960
And take care of you.

255
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,160
Old Zhao.

256
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
We just

257
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,640
Just keep working together.

258
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,360
Zimmer and I are already together.

259
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,040
I'm happy now.

260
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,640
And he takes good care of me.

261
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,040
Happy?

262
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,840
As far as I am concerned

263
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,400
He should be busy now.

264
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,240
So many people need his care.

265
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,480
Can he take care of it?

266
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
What do you mean?

267
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,280
Nothing.

268
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,160
I'll take you to a restaurant.

269
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,640
A special restaurant.

270
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,320
Really

271
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,440
Think about it, Star.

272
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,680
He is now suitable

273
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,880
Because he hasn't

274
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,360
Brother

275
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,840
Zimmer and I used to go there

276
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,960
That restaurant.

277
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,560
Don't bring me a midnight snack tonight.

278
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,000
Braised Bean Curd

279
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,440
OK

280
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,960
Cantonese style cabbage.

281
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,800
Shrimp dumplings and a bowl of congee.

282
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,120
Thank you

283
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,760
Okay, hold on.

284
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,720
You used to

285
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,240
I don't know what to eat,

286
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,600
To order these dishes.

287
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,480
I don't remember.

288
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,520
How many times have I eaten with you?

289
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,320
Crab er.

290
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,400
Later,

291
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,080
When I heard the crab roes tofu,

292
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,760
The past.

293
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,560
I've forgotten that

294
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,120
But I still remember

295
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,600
If you insist on mentioning it,

296
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,360
These topics,

297
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,120
I think I can go now.

298
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,520
You hate me so much?

299
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,280
It's not annoying.

300
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,320
It's the past.

301
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,120
Let it pass.

302
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,120
The memory is beautiful.

303
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,920
I've changed.

304
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,920
You have changed too.

305
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,800
It's time to move on.

306
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,840
Zimmer

307
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,960
President Ji.

308
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,840
What a coincidence.

309
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,800
why

310
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,160
If a man will be with you,

311
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,440
We just finished our work.

312
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,040
And have a simple meal.

313
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,400
Don't bother.

314
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,520
therefore

315
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,880
Is this the investor you mentioned?

316
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,760
Thermansa

317
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,000
Why are you here?

318
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,040
You know Zimmer?

319
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,480
Do you know President Ji?

320
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,320
He's my boyfriend.

321
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,960
Didn't he tell you?

322
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,840
I didn't get a card last time.

323
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,000
I've joined the wing fashion.

324
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,120
Now,

325
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,560
Is the design director of Wing Fashion.

326
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,600
Oh

327
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,440
Is Mr. Ji's subordinate.

328
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,680
There's such a coincidence.

329
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,520
I think so too.

330
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,680
The two of us

331
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,040
Is really fated.

332
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,640
In fact, a lot of fate and coincidence

333
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,800
It was deliberately guided by people.

334
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,960
Many clients I've contacted

335
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,800
All use this move.

336
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,400
By fate.

337
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,960
To get closer to each other.

338
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,320
Try everything.

339
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,120
But to me,

340
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,080
It won't work.

341
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,480
Because I used it too many times.

342
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,920
therefore

343
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,360
How do you two know each other?

344
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,280
What a coincidence.

345
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,960
Once she accidentally

346
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,280
Hit my car.

347
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
So we got to know each other.

348
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,320
Let's go home.

349
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
What are you going to do?

350
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,560
You have a secret.

351
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
You're leaving in such a hurry.

352
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,000
No,

353
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,080
Since we all know each other,

354
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,920
Let's have a meal together.

355
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,960
Alright.

356
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,480
I don't know if

357
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,440
Sorry to disturb you.

358
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,720
Alright.

359
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,880
Let's eat together.

360
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,120
Let's eat together.

361
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,840
Alright.

362
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,440
If a man

363
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,080
I ordered red date tea for you.

364
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,000
Tranquilizing the nerves

365
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,040
She will get angry when drinking red date tea.

366
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,400
You have a bad voice recently.

367
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,720
Something light.

368
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,680
Feed me.

369
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,800
silent

370
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
Can you speak nicely?

371
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,600
It's you now.

372
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,080
To show loyalty,

373
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,320
Yes?

374
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,120
Guilty conscience

375
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,480
I dare not show my love.

376
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,960
Who dare not?

377
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,720
Come on, man.

378
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,600
Open mouth

379
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,400
Ironing

380
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,200
If the relationship between the man and President Ji

381
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,960
That's great.

382
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,400
envy

383
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,400
You should find one.

384
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,360
After you have a boyfriend,

385
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,840
You wouldn't have been off work.

386
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,760
He was dragged out for dinner by his boss.

387
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,640
It's too hard.

388
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,320
My ex-boyfriend three years ago,

389
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,800
I've been single since we broke up.

390
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,560
I'm used to it.

391
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,560
But I remember you said

392
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,200
Your ex-boyfriend.

393
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,760
Seems to have a girlfriend.

394
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,680
That's right.

395
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,160
But I'm not going to give up.

396
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,680
When I think about it,

397
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,200
What a coincidence.

398
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,520
You just hit my car.

399
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,560
And now we're here.

400
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,960
Zimmer's company

401
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,080
Will your target

402
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,920
Not your ex-boyfriend.

403
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,320
It's him.

404
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,040
Why are you eating here?

405
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,480
The dishes are getting cold. Move your chopsticks.

406
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,319
I'm just kidding.

407
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,160
Why are you so nervous?

408
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,920
But love is like a dish.

409
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,040
Just eat from your own bowl.

410
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,760
Don't worry about others.

411
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,359
Who cares about others?

412
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,800
Be reasonable.

413
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,240
Now I'm being unreasonable.

414
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,000
The chopsticks you ate secretly.

415
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,560
Has reached me.

416
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,960
Should I pretend not to see it?

417
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,720
Who ate it?

418
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,120
Can I stop eating?

419
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,880
other

420
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,120
Eat it.

421
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,480
Try to eat as much as you can.

422
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,360
And eat it.

423
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,760
But I ate too much.

424
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,440
Don't blame me for not warning you.

425
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,760
If a man

426
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,080
Where are we going?

427
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's eat.

428
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,800
About your car crash,

429
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,640
Why didn't you tell me?

430
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,560
You've recruited a new female subordinate.

431
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,760
Why didn't you tell me?

432
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,760
This is the normal working arrangement.

433
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,400
I

434
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,880
Anyway, don't talk to that.

435
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,720
Thermantha contact

436
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,520
Why can't I contact her?

437
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,400
Are you afraid of me?

438
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,800
What did you find?

439
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,680
Sorry, Mr. Ji.

440
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,560
Sorry to bother you today.

441
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,720
I just saw her stomach ache.

442
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,080
So I took her to dinner.

443
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,160
You ate with Zhao Yucheng.

444
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,480
Didn't you tell me?

445
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,200
She has a stomach ache.

446
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,560
Take her to dinner.

447
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,800
Why don't you take her to the hospital?

448
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,120
Take it home and take care of it.

449
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,480
That's great. The boss

450
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,600
You're so affectionate.

451
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,480
Why don't I resign?

452
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,920
Just be your subordinate, okay?

453
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,680
Alright.

454
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,320
Can't you hear I'm angry?

455
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,480
Is it so obvious?

456
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,600
The relationship between superior and subordinate.

457
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,920
It's not what you think.

458
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,840
first

459
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,840
And lied about military information.

460
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,840
You're eating with a heterosexual.

461
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,560
second

462
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
I feel sorry to see a pitiful subordinate.

463
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,360
It's a sign of cheating.

464
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,600
The sign of a scum.

465
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,840
Third

466
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,120
In front of everyone,

467
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,200
She said I was unreasonable.

468
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,360
I don't want to lose face.

469
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,720
You're really eating inside and outside.

470
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,880
Lean your arms outward.

471
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,920
Fourth

472
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,440
Fourth, I'm full.

473
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Don't laugh.

474
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
We haven't quarreled yet.

475
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,400
Why?

476
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,560
To cure the hiccups.

477
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Are you ready?

478
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,840
What? I'm still angry.

479
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,640
Take them to dinner.

480
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,400
You really care for her.

481
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,360
Did I say you could kiss me?

482
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,800
All right, it's over.

483
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,480
If a man

484
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,080
I really care about you.

485
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
I can only tolerate you in my heart.

486
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,520
Don't try to

487
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,920
Because of you.

488
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,600
Stop it.

489
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,520
Go back to your room.

490
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,440
Continue

491
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,400
What?

492
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,520
arrive

493
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,160
Phil!

494
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,280
We have been trying to love for half a month.

495
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,720
We can

496
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,840
Have you confirmed the relationship?

497
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,760
You like me so much?

498
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,640
like

499
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,320
I really like you.

500
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,640
I want to end this love experiment.

501
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,960
To the whole world.

502
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,880
I really like you.

503
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,000
I want to feel

504
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,400
enter

505
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,120
President Ji.

506
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,040
This is for the next quarter.

507
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,800
Design the final draft.

508
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,000
Put it on the table.

509
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,520
Are you free after work?

510
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,680
I want to talk to you alone.

511
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,160
If there's anything, let's talk here.

512
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,320
Besides work,

513
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,480
I don't want to have anything

514
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,160
In private.

515
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,440
I'm sorry.

516
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,520
What happened yesterday

517
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,720
It must be hard for you.

518
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,920
If the boy is angry,

519
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,160
Whether she's angry or not,

520
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,080
I don't want to get hurt

521
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,720
Let her think too much.

522
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,280
Do you really like her?

523
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,880
Thermansa

524
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,960
You and I are just ordinary.

525
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,880
Superior and subordinate relations

526
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,560
I don't want you to make

527
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,000
Something beyond my status.

528
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,600
Also

529
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,880
Tell your brother

530
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,080
Stop doing boring things.

531
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,480
The relationship between me and Ruo Man

532
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,160
Will not be affected.

533
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,560
Zimmer

534
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,840
There's someone around him.

535
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,160
A dangerous woman.

536
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,400
Although I don't know her,

537
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,600
But my gut tells me

538
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,080
This woman is not simple.

539
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,240
But it hasn't happened yet.

540
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,960
What happened?

541
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,080
According to my experience,

542
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,840
She must have taken the initiative.

543
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,360
nowadays

544
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,640
There's no corner that can't be broken.

545
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Even if Qi Mo has high concentration,

546
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,240
I can't help this woman.

547
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,360
I've been tempted repeatedly.

548
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,560
So there's only one solution.

549
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,800
Don't add fuel to the fire.

550
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,000
Why did I add fuel to the fire?

551
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,120
What should I do?

552
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,480
When you cheat,

553
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,600
Depends on whether there's a chance.

554
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,680
So you have to

555
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,600
This opportunity was killed in the cradle.

556
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,200
You know what?

557
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,240
I see.

558
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,960
I've figured out a way.

559
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,920
If a man

560
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,280
Don't listen to her nonsense.

561
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,680
What are you going to do?

562
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,760
I want to claim sovereignty.

563
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,960
Declare sovereignty

564
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
You and I are just ordinary.

565
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,960
Superior and subordinate relations

566
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,640
I don't want you to make

567
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,040
Something beyond my status.

568
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,880
I'm back

569
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,160
This is the dress I designed for you.

570
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,240
Look at this sign.

571
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,960
Is it pretty?

572
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,440
As long as you designed it,

573
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,360
Both of them are beautiful.

574
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,880
I'm thinking.

575
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
When my skills are mature,

576
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,200
I'll take all your clothes

577
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,480
All of them.

578
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
This way, every day,

579
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,200
Will have unique clothes.

580
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,040
Wearing a dress,

581
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,080
Isn't it lovely?

582
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,520
Yeah, you know what?

583
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,640
The patients in our clinic

584
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,480
Wear your design.

585
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,800
The colorful clothes.

586
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,800
I was so happy to see it.

587
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,200
And our clinic

588
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,000
The patients with depression

589
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,320
Wear the clothes you designed.

590
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,600
His condition has improved.

591
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,320
You're much better than me.

592
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
You want spirit?

593
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,160
Of course.

594
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,040
Haven't I told you earlier?

595
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,360
The clothes are different colors.

596
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,720
Represents different emotions.

597
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,280
Different materials?

598
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,800
Gives people a different feeling.

599
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,840
I always had a dream.

600
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,880
I want to open

601
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,560
A clothing company called Wing.

602
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,240
Is the letter W.

603
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,080
Look, here's the thing.

604
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,960
Does it look like

605
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,280
Can fly.

606
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,040
Okay, I will be your wing.

607
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,800
Always protect you and support you.

608
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,200
Actually, I have a dream.

609
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,120
Guess what it is.

610
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,520
what

611
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,640
Namely

612
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,880
you

613
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,920
I want to be with you forever.

614
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,440
good

615
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,880
Why are you here?

616
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,760
What you did before,

617
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Those coincidences

618
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,000
Are all aimed at

619
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,280
I'm here with Ji Mo.

620
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,760
You came to see me.

621
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,040
That's it.

622
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,680
You think you're so clever?

623
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,520
I'm here to see you.

624
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,160
I'm here to tell you.

625
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
It's not yours.

626
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,440
Don't touch it.

627
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,920
Who doesn't belong to you.

628
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,440
Don't dream about it.

629
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,360
Are you so sure?

630
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,960
Does this belong to you?

631
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,320
What do you mean?

632
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,000
I've been wanting to tell you.

633
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,320
that's right

634
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,720
I just love Zimmer.

635
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,480
You finally revealed

636
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Your true colors.

637
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,440
A man as good as Zimmer

638
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,120
There are women who admire him.

639
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,360
Isn't it normal?

640
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,240
I have thought about it.

641
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,160
I will confront you one day.

642
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,000
I didn't expect that

643
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,160
You can't calm down.

644
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,800
I've thought about it.

645
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,200
This game

646
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,960
You always have to play more rounds.

647
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,720
But you showed your hand so quickly.

648
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,320
I have to say,

649
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,600
You can't wait.

650
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,800
To declare ownership.

651
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,680
A little guilty.

652
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,000
Who should be guilty.

653
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,320
It should be you.

654
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,240
You should have seen you.

655
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Now,

656
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,480
I've never seen someone like you.

657
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,040
A confident mistress.

658
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,200
You're too nervous.

659
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,920
When you're nervous,

660
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,640
It's easy to expose your weakness.

661
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
How much you care

662
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
How nervous.

663
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,480
It shows that you are not confident enough.

664
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,480
You're afraid that I'll take Jimo away.

665
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,880
That's why you came to me.

666
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,600
right or wrong?

667
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,440
You don't trust Zimmer enough.

668
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,680
Or not?

669
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
The relationship between you two

670
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,560
Whether you rob it or not,

671
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,000
Zimmer won't leave.

672
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,720
Between the two of us,

673
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,360
Will not be affected because of you.

674
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,960
I never doubt that.

675
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:12,920
Yes

676
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,640
If he is yours,

677
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,680
No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get it.

678
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,000
Why should I...

679
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,880
You're so excited.

680
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,360
same

681
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,960
If he is mine,

682
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,240
No matter how hard you try,

683
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,840
He will come back to me.

684
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,640
Don't you think so?

685
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,560
I want to...

686
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,080
We don't have to talk anymore.

687
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,680
after all

688
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,320
To stand in the way of others.

689
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,720
Is always bad.

690
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
I forgot to tell you.

691
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,840
For Zimmer,

692
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,480
I will win.

693
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,800
Smile.

694
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,840
If you hold it, it will cause internal injury.

695
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,960
Hahaha

696
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,400
You quarreled with that elf.

697
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,560
But you lost the argument.

698
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,880
Oh, my God.

699
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,680
You're the only one

700
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,160
A notoriously vicious tongue.

701
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,280
You lost your fight.

702
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,280
I'm so angry.

703
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,600
When I went there,

704
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,880
And confident.

705
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,960
I thought she was guilty.

706
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,600
You must be afraid to beg for mercy.

707
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,800
I didn't expect her to take the initiative.

708
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,480
Admit it.

709
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,080
The lines I prepared

710
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,840
It's useless.

711
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,680
I really...

712
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,560
I'm suffocating.

713
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,560
Are you listening?

714
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,360
I

715
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,000
We lost the fight.

716
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,600
There is.

717
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,400
Are you listening?

718
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,760
But I heard that

719
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,760
This Thermantha.

720
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,160
She's really something.

721
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,880
Chen Fei'er, whose side are you on now?

722
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,840
Of course I'm on your side.

723
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,400
I mean,

724
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,320
This leprechaun

725
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,120
We underestimated her.

726
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,040
She can pretend.

727
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,160
baby

728
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
I know.

729
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,320
Because you can lose to anyone.

730
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,080
But you can't lose to your rival.

731
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,480
You can't lose the momentum.

732
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,720
Don't worry.

733
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,120
I'll help you there next time.

734
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,080
I scolded her.

735
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,440
I'll cool her down.

736
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,080
To deal with the green tea white lotus.

737
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,680
You definitely can't.

738
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,160
You're soft, you know?

739
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,520
Hello, honey.

740
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,880
Tonight,

741
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,960
Alright.

742
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,120
I miss you too.

743
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,160
See you later.

744
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,480
What a pretentious voice!

745
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,200
Is that a group of models?

746
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,360
Plastic girlfriends.

747
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,960
That's right.

748
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,040
I don't know which young model it is.

749
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,560
Which crony?

750
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,040
You want to set up a game in front of me.

751
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Show off.

752
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,080
Who doesn't have a boyfriend?

753
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,560
Really!

754
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,760
When are you going to break up?

755
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,720
Take Ai Li with you.

756
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,480
A ready-made boyfriend.

757
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:45,960
I

758
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Take Ali with you.

759
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,360
I'm crazy.

760
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
I don't want to lose face.

761
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,400
It's not like you don't know.

762
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,800
My plastic sisters

763
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,480
He's a snob.

764
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,040
If I take Ellie there,

765
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,600
You must be laughed to death by them.

766
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,840
I don't want to lose.

767
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,680
Women can lose to anything.

768
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,760
But you can't lose to a woman.

769
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,600
Didn't you just learn about it?

770
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,320
Let's go.

771
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,199
Don't miss me too much.

772
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,639
Get out of here.

773
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,320
Neuropathy

774
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,920
I'll send you a WeChat.

775
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,040
You didn't reply me.

776
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
When will it end?

777
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,520
I'll pick you up.

778
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,000
Are you coming to pick me up?

779
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,400
It's okay after work.

780
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,840
You're so busy.

781
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,600
Don't come to pick me up.

782
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,159
I can go home by myself.

783
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,880
Don't worry.

784
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,679
So I hung up.

785
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,760
feed

786
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,679
Hello, Xiao Xiao.

787
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,560
Phil is at a party.

788
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,520
She asked me to pick her up.

789
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,280
You put her position

790
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,199
Can you send it to me?

791
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,960
Okay, thank you.

792
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,160
Second cup.

793
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,360
The second cup.

794
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,760
Cup Three. Third.

795
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,920
There's another one. Come on.

796
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,080
One last drink.

797
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,320
Chen Fei.

798
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,480
Why are you here?

799
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,320
My stomach is bad.

800
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,360
I can't drink any more.

801
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,880
No

802
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,800
Who is this?

803
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,760
Yes, Phil.

804
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,080
Introduce them to us.

805
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,840
Who is this?

806
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,840
Who is it?

807
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,840
He is my...

808
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,960
boyfriend

809
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,960
The driver

810
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
I'm so drunk.

811
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,640
I'm so drunk.

812
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,160
I drank too much.

813
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,160
So drunk.

814
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,040
I'll never drink it again.

815
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,080
So much wine.

816
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,840
Drink it.

817
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,360
And drink every day.

818
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,520
You don't know you have a bad stomach.

819
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,720
Where are you going?

820
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,800
Are you angry?

821
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,800
I'm not angry.

822
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,680
You drank too much.

823
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,520
Tomorrow.

824
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,800
I was acting. I'm not drunk.

825
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,160
Why are you pretending to be drunk?

826
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,320
I'm afraid of embarrassment.

827
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,560
I don't want you to say anything about me.

828
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,000
Who am I to judge you?

829
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
You're the driver.

830
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,240
I just want to save face.

831
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,560
It's all because of those women.

832
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,720
You really love to compete.

833
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,760
You are always comparing with others.

834
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,360
Even a boyfriend has to compete.

835
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
I don't want to be inferior to them.

836
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,760
So I can only say that

837
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,200
You're my driver.

838
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,760
Yes, I admit I'm so

839
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,600
A little vanity.

840
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,400
but

841
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,040
But we're not

842
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,080
The relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend.

843
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,680
Right?

844
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
I can't introduce you.

845
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,960
You're my boyfriend.

846
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,040
You're right.

847
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,640
We're not

848
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,480
That kind of relationship.

849
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,200
Right?

850
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,760
I'm the one who drank too much.

851
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,080
To pick up your driver.

852
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,160
The other one, you're happy.

853
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,720
To come and play.

854
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,240
Are you unhappy?

855
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,400
Who kicked me to the side.

856
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,080
Alright

857
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,520
I was wrong.

858
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,480
I was really wrong.

859
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,120
I'm too vain.

860
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,480
I care too much about the eyes of others.

861
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,720
But understand,

862
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,720
In this circle,

863
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,920
I've been here for a long time.

864
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,840
All of a sudden,

865
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,400
I can't change those bad habits.

866
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,920
Aren't you a doctor?

867
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,800
You won't give up.

868
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,120
Treat the patient?

869
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,560
You cured me.

870
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,280
Cure me.

871
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,800
And uglier.

872
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,440
All right.

873
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,560
It's so ugly.

874
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,520
Really!

875
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,720
You won't be allowed to drink.

876
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,960
Don't you know you have a bad stomach?

877
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,920
Hurry up. Get into bed.

878
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,680
Come on, lie down.

879
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,520
Have a good sleep.

880
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,800
Have a good rest.

881
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,400
Are you still angry?

882
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,840
You're not angry anymore.

883
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,920
Are you really not angry?

884
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,520
You're really not angry anymore.

885
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,800
Then smile.

886
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,320
Who would do such an ugly thing?

887
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,240
Really!

888
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,560
All right.

889
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,360
to wait a moment

890
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,960
Be gentle.

891
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,400
Then sleep well.

892
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,360
All right, go to sleep.

893
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,280
Bye

894
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:30,880
Bye

895
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,520
Bye

896
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,800
early

897
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,280
early

898
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,760
feed

899
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,280
What?

900
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,000
Song Zihao went missing again.

901
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,920
Acting and Associate Director.

902
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,920
Where are the actors?

903
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,080
Where is the actor?

904
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,000
where?

905
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Everyone has been waiting for so long.

906
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,240
Where are the actors?

907
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,160
to do sth more quickly

908
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,800
director

909
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,720
I'm really sorry.

910
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,080
Have some coffee first.

911
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,560
Where is Song Zihao?

912
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,440
Did you find it?

913
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,600
I've asked someone to look for it.

914
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,440
Let's wait a little longer.

915
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,840
Are you still waiting?

916
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,440
The whole team is waiting for him.

917
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,400
It's been an hour.

918
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
What's going on here?

919
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,480
Is this a big deal?

920
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,400
director

921
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,440
How about this?

922
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,680
Get someone to take a photo.

923
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,240
You can do that.

924
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,280
It won't delay the progress.

925
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,200
Today's announcement

926
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
It's all about him.

927
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,320
Who do you want me to shoot?

928
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,960
I heard that

929
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,280
You gave it to him at the same time.

930
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,240
Other scenes, right?

931
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,720
You're crazy about money.

932
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,280
This play is for him.

933
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,920
To shorten the shooting cycle.

934
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,200
You still want him to act.

935
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,800
I'm telling the truth.

936
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,040
If it's because of his frequent absence,

937
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,080
To delay the shooting progress.

938
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,520
I can change at any time.

939
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,520
Really?

940
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,400
If you say that in front of the management,

941
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,680
I hope you can say the same.

942
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,280
So stubborn.

943
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,880
What do you mean?

944
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,960
director

945
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,280
The popular actor now.

946
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,440
Who doesn't fight?

947
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,000
Who has a problem with money?

948
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,520
Your style.

949
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,480
Now in the entertainment circle,

950
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,920
Is no longer viable.

951
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,600
You have to learn to be flexible.

952
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,640
Then Zihao is the capital.

953
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,280
And paid a lot of money for it.

954
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,880
Is his traffic.

955
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,560
Without him,

956
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,760
Who will guarantee the box office?

957
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,560
If you really change people,

958
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,600
Who would it be?

959
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,920
a row

960
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,680
With an agent like you,

961
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,960
It will be over sooner or later. I'm telling you.

962
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,320
I can't do this.

963
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,440
It can't be done.

964
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,640
It's all over.

965
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,280
Mr. Lu,

966
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,600
The Dugu Ruuo man of Yuxing Entertainment.

967
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,160
He's here.

968
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,640
Mr. Lu, where are you going?

969
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
This tigress.

970
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,240
I quarreled with her.

971
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,320
You never won a fight.

972
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,560
This is definitely a publicity matter.

973
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,640
Just say I'm not here.

974
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,360
Mr. Lu,

975
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,920
Are you going out?

976
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,400
If a man

977
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,280
Look at this. It's too bad.

978
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,880
I have something to do.

979
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,560
How about we talk next time?

980
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,240
If you want to talk next time,

981
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,040
I'll probably

982
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,240
To visit you every day.

983
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,800
Why don't you give me five minutes?

984
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,520
It's fast.

985
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,480
Let's talk about it.

986
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,360
Please sit down.

987
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,960
Just sit down.

988
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,040
Mr. Lu should know that I'm here today.

989
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,280
Why are you here?

990
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,040
what?

991
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,120
I don't know.

992
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,840
About the promotional video, right?

993
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,600
If a man

994
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,720
Actually, I have difficulties here.

995
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,560
I'm here to help you.

996
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,080
To solve the problem.

997
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,920
I know that

998
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,560
To invite Zihao to perform,

999
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,880
And spent a lot of money.

1000
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,480
So the promotion fee you are paying now

1001
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,520
It's not enough.

1002
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,640
What about me?

1003
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,160
You can use my contacts and resources

1004
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,760
To promote your play.

1005
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,920
But I have my own conditions.

1006
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,800
I hope Star can

1007
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,600
On the promotional materials.

1008
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,400
If a man

1009
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,480
It's not that I don't want to help you.

1010
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
Look, I really...

1011
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,760
Mr. Lu,
