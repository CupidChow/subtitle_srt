1
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,000
If a man

2
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,120
Actually, I have difficulties here.

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
I'm here to help you.

4
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,480
To solve the problem.

5
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,320
I know that

6
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,960
To invite Zihao to perform,

7
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,280
And spent a lot of money.

8
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,880
So the promotion fee you are paying now

9
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,920
It's not enough.

10
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,040
What about me?

11
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,560
You can use my contacts and resources

12
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,160
To promote your play.

13
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,320
But I have my own conditions.

14
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,200
I hope Star can

15
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,000
On the promotional materials.

16
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,800
If a man

17
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,880
It's not that I don't want to help you.

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Look, I really...

19
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,160
Mr. Lu,

20
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,120
Our Si Da

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
It'll be a big fire sooner or later.

22
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,200
Are you sure you want to

23
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,240
That Song Zihao

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,840
Don't you get along well with me?

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
If your relationship with me

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,920
If you can't handle it well,

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,880
You and I...

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,960
In the publicity industry.

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,200
Will get along well.

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,160
Your loss will be

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,400
It's not just the show.

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,360
Actually, what I want

33
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,800
It's not too much.

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,960
I just hope that Star

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,080
We can get more publicity.

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,400
And personal videos.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,040
It won't violate

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,360
The agreement between you and Tong Tong

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,240
Can satisfy my requirements.

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,320
Satisfy both sides

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,000
What do you think?

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,040
This is OK.

43
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
This is good.

44
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,200
It's settled then.

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,640
You're really a gold broker.

46
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,480
You have to be thoughtful.

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,440
It's settled then.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,840
Thank you, President Lu.

49
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,480
I immediately contacted

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,360
Contact the publicity department.

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,280
To promote your show.

52
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,160
Then I will sign the contract as soon as possible.

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Send it here.

54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,760
Our Star would like to trouble you

55
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,880
I've been thinking about it.

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,280
If a man

57
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,000
It's a deal.

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,680
If a man

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,320
I found you changed.

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,240
When we were negotiating,

61
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
You're aggressive.

62
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,360
And won't compromise.

63
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,400
It's different now.

64
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,680
Are you in a relationship?

65
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,320
All right.

66
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,040
Forget it.

67
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,560
I'm leaving. Don't bother.

68
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,320
Your office.

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm leaving.

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,040
Don't bother.

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,600
Alright.

72
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,320
I won't give it away.

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,000
Bye

74
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,600
I became soft.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,520
Is it that obvious?

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,960
We can't.

77
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,040
This is too formal.

78
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,800
The color is too dark.

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
You look pale in the mirror.

80
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,520
This seems to be OK.

81
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,080
Then take me back.

82
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,960
Right?

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,600
Pleasantly surprised

84
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,120
It's me.

85
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,560
Song Zihao, are you sick?

86
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,800
You scared me to death.

87
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,200
Lower your voice.

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
When I came out,

89
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,400
Has been caught by fans.

90
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,280
Don't invite the paparazzi.

91
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,000
If they catch me cheating,

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
Are you going to write an article again?

93
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,240
Play tricks.

94
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,600
Are you from the crew?

95
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,080
It's just fooling around.

96
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,160
How long have you been out?

97
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,200
I'll send you back.

98
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,880
I came out.

99
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
It's boring to go back like this.

100
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,520
Short legs.

101
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,120
Why don't you go out with me?

102
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,280
Songzihao

103
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
You don't work.

104
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,400
I have to work.

105
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,160
Who has time to play with you?

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
Can it be reliable?

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,000
If the company knows

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,960
You came here to see me.

109
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,040
It was my assistant who was scolded.

110
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,760
You're not a star.

111
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,840
sorry

112
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,960
During this period,

113
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,200
I'm probably too lonely.

114
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,760
In addition to work,

115
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,640
I miss you

116
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,600
What did you say

117
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,040
I

118
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,960
Didn't you say that

119
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,640
Are we friends?

120
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,920
When I was lonely,

121
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,840
I can come to you.

122
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,600
Then the first person I thought of

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,520
It's you.

124
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,800
So I came as soon as possible.

125
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,920
I said that.

126
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,800
Hey, look.

127
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,240
Is that what you said?

128
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,200
In that case,

129
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,480
You can go out with me.

130
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,880
Right?

131
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,800
But it's working time now.

132
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,000
Go back to the crew.

133
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,360
There's no discussion.

134
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,680
That job.

135
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,760
I'll stay with you.

136
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,440
Songzihao

137
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,160
Aren't you going back?

138
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,640
good

139
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,360
I'll personally escort you back.

140
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:36,960
go

141
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,000
No, no. I'm not going back.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,240
Leave now.

143
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm not leaving.

144
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,440
Hurry up.

145
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,600
to do sth more quickly

146
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
There are fans down there.

147
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,720
to do sth more quickly

148
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,480
Just let me stay with you for a while.

149
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,360
There's no discussion.

150
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,440
No, I won't bother you.

151
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,280
Don't worry.

152
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,920
Hurry up. I'm getting angry.

153
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
I was in the area.

154
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,040
To see Song Zihao.

155
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,400
Are you sure?

156
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,440
Of course.

157
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Let's have a look around here.

158
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,320
We'll definitely find him.

159
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,920
good

160
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,800
Take a look.

161
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,240
What's wrong with you?

162
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,440
Alright.

163
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,360
What now?

164
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,120
What time is it?

165
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,000
Why are you laughing?

166
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
How about that?

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,560
We've been

168
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,240
Hide here.

169
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,160
What are you talking about?

170
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,560
I have to go back to the office.

171
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,120
There's only one way.

172
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,720
Are you ready?

173
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,880
what

174
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,960
Listen to my command.

175
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,960
What password?

176
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,280
One, two, three.

177
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,120
run

178
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,520
Let's go.

179
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,360
Let go of me.

180
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,080
I just saw it.

181
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,680
Run!

182
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,480
Songzihao

183
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,400
Songzihao

184
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,560
Songzihao

185
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,400
Don't run, Song Zihao.

186
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Don't run.

187
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,040
Wait for me.

188
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,680
Song Zihao, don't run.

189
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,240
Stop chasing me.

190
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,120
Wait for me.

191
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,440
Songzihao

192
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,120
Song Zihao, don't run.

193
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,080
Where is she?

194
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,200
Look over there.

195
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,600
Songzihao

196
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,760
Songzihao

197
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,800
Songsongsongsong

198
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,320
It's loose.

199
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,440
Why did you react so much?

200
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,800
Yes?

201
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,560
Holding hands with a star.

202
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,800
You're shy.

203
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,480
I'm not.

204
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,000
I was the one who pulled Star

205
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
This is my first time

206
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,320
And was pulled to run.

207
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm not used to it.

208
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,400
What about

209
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,920
By a big star.

210
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,360
Is it more advanced?

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,160
Do you want to try again?

212
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,560
There are so many people here.

213
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,360
It's quite strong.

214
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,560
feel

215
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,880
Seems to be different.

216
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,160
feel

217
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,360
It's disgusting.

218
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,080
Say yes and mean no

219
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,640
Short legs.

220
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,720
Thank you for today.

221
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm warning you.

222
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,440
If you ever pull me again,

223
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,240
I hit you.

224
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,920
Short legs.

225
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,080
And fierce.

226
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,240
It's quite cute.

227
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,200
Songzihao

228
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,600
Are you out of your mind?

229
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,560
That's not true.

230
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,800
I'm wide awake now.

231
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,120
You know what?

232
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,040
During this period,

233
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,400
I feel like my life

234
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,000
It's very confusing.

235
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,720
I find life very boring.

236
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,960
It's useless to do anything.

237
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,440
But as soon as I see you,

238
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,560
It's just troubles and pressure.

239
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,440
It's all gone.

240
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,240
I just want to be like this.

241
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,080
Looking at you,

242
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Whether you hit me,

243
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,200
Or scold me?

244
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,800
I feel quite happy.

245
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,200
I think you're sick.

246
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,440
I don't care about you.

247
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
I have to work.

248
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,480
I'm warning you.

249
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,600
Go back to the crew.

250
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,120
strange

251
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,760
Why is my heart beating so fast?

252
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,680
Is it because of Song Zihao?

253
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
It's impossible.

254
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,480
It's absolutely impossible.

255
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,760
Next, give me

256
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
A picture of two people.

257
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,360
good

258
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,480
How could it be her?

259
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,920
You're haunting me.

260
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,120
Then let's go on.

261
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,960
Thermansa

262
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,520
It is said that there are many people

263
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,400
Famous brand.

264
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,520
To offer you an olive branch.

265
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,800
You always refused.

266
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,200
So all of us

267
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
I really want to know

268
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,840
Why did you suddenly choose

269
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,920
Wing fashion?

270
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,120
My boyfriend is so handsome.

271
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,280
I don't know what he's talking about,

272
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,320
It's really charming.

273
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,040
If it wasn't for the girl next to me,

274
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,200
That's it.

275
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,120
What are you talking about?

276
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:12,960
I've been

277
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,680
Preparing for the arrival of Wing Fashion.

278
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,200
Because here,

279
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,640
I can protect

280
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,000
The design dream I love.

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,080
Besides,

282
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,120
I can protect

283
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,160
The one I want to protect.

284
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,160
It's been said that

285
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,120
You and Ji are always lovers.

286
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,080
That's why you came to Wing Fashion.

287
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,920
Is it true?

288
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,000
Actually, President Ji and I

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,160
I think we got the wrong idea.

290
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,560
Samantha and I

291
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,360
Is actually a pure working relationship.

292
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,640
I do have a lover.

293
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,760
She's outside the door.

294
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,320
Hurry up.

295
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,280
Go in with me.

296
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,040
Why?

297
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,880
Let's go.

298
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,960
Why?

299
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,880
This is my girlfriend

300
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,920
Dugu is like a man.

301
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,360
I didn't expect that

302
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,840
There will be unexpected gains.

303
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,600
Isn't this Mrs. Ruo?

304
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,040
There's been a rumor that

305
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
You two broke up.

306
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,640
And the rumors about you two.

307
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,720
It's fake.

308
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,400
I didn't expect it to be true.

309
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,520
Actually, I've always wanted to be public.

310
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,840
I just didn't have the chance.

311
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,160
Some people are already shy.

312
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,000
The way they love each other,

313
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,840
A good thing is coming.

314
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,680
Then I'll borrow your lucky words.

315
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,480
Have you finished the interview?

316
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,800
I'll escort you out.

317
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,120
This way.

318
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,720
good

319
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,760
I'll escort them out.

320
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,920
Come on.

321
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,880
Why are you...

322
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,200
I didn't tell you in advance.

323
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,400
Let me prepare.

324
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,760
I don't know, reporter.

325
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,560
Would suddenly ask me

326
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
But it's okay.

327
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,640
I want the whole world to know.

328
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,080
You're lonely as a man.

329
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,320
She's my girlfriend.

330
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,160
I want all the men in the world

331
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,120
Are jealous of me.

332
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,800
Are you sure all the men in the world

333
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,960
Will be jealous of you.

334
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,680
They will laugh at you.

335
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,600
After all, I'm out here

336
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
It's not good.

337
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,160
It will ruin your image.

338
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,200
No.

339
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,800
They don't understand.

340
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,600
They don't understand how nice my girlfriend is.

341
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,120
Disgusting

342
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,040
In my previous life,

343
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,520
And helped 20,000 old ladies.

344
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
to cross the street

345
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,040
Otherwise, in my lifetime,

346
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
How could I meet you?

347
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,120
Before that,

348
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,160
You always stand behind me.

349
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,280
Support me and wait for me.

350
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,760
Now,

351
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,920
I just want to stand behind you.

352
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,880
Take care of you and protect you.

353
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,560
Marry me.

354
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Take back the ring.

355
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,720
Don't contact me anymore.

356
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,520
Between us,

357
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,880
It's over.

358
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,200
Why didn't I agree to it?

359
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,360
If I had promised you,

360
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,520
That's it.

361
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,640
I wish I had promised you.

362
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,800
You know what?

363
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,400
In the past,

364
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,920
I didn't have a sense of trust.

365
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,200
Always worrying about gains and losses.

366
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,240
Really?

367
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,600
I was so scared.

368
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,920
To rely on someone.

369
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,240
Even if I really need the other half,

370
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,480
Give me a sense of security.

371
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,920
I won't talk.

372
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,520
Because I don't want to burden him.

373
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,320
but

374
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,480
Since I've been with you,

375
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,440
Most of the time, I don't have to talk.

376
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,960
As you know,

377
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,680
My weakness

378
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,400
My unhappiness

379
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,720
Do you know when I'm...

380
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
What you need most.

381
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,960
To rely on someone.

382
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,120
Is my weakness.

383
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,800
But you...

384
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,120
But I'm not afraid to rely on it.

385
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,120
Because I know

386
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,960
You know how to use armor?

387
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,280
To cover my weakness.

388
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Because I know

389
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,960
You're like this.

390
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,079
Can give me a sense of security.

391
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,440
Never take off this armor.

392
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,240
Okay?

393
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,359
Thank you.

394
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,520
I love you

395
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,599
I love you more than you love me.

396
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,960
You are also my armor and weakness.

397
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,960
feed

398
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,680
Zimmer

399
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,120
Have you seen Su Xiao?

400
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,640
No, what's wrong?

401
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,240
I can't find Su Xiao now.

402
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,040
If you see her,

403
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,080
Tell me quickly.

404
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,720
what?

405
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,760
who

406
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,840
Who hit him?

407
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,320
Samantha is gone.

408
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,680
I'm going to find her.

409
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,280
Why is Samantha gone?

410
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,040
You want to find her?

411
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,880
Who is it?

412
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,400
What's your relationship with her?

413
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,560
At that time,

414
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,840
The place where you proposed to me.

415
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,400
I wait for you

416
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,560
Is it her WeChat?

417
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,960
I must go to her.

418
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,400
Send the location to Zhao Yucheng.

419
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,000
Or Aaron.

420
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,680
Tell them to find her.

421
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,440
Don't go.

422
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,600
Trust me.

423
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
I'll explain to you when I come back.

424
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
I'll be back soon.

425
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,040
Why do you have to go?

426
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
Why did she only send you a WeChat?

427
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
What's your relationship?

428
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,640
Trust me.

429
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,080
I knew you would come.

430
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,440
Come on.

431
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,440
Because you still care about me.

432
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,760
is or isn't

433
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,040
I really care about you.

434
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,160
But do you know why?

435
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't want you to suffer

436
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Any injury,

437
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,200
And make me feel guilty for the rest of my life.

438
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,600
I don't want your brother to harass me again.

439
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,400
And threatened me.

440
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,880
And that's why

441
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,400
To destroy me and Ruonan.

442
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,040
The relationship between them.

443
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,440
I'm here today.

444
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,080
I want to ensure your safety.

445
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,640
Give your brother an explanation.

446
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,240
If so,

447
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,320
You can rest assured.

448
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,720
I won't affect anyone.

449
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,400
Don't be so headstrong.

450
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,840
We've already finished.

451
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,080
Was here at that time.

452
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,920
Do you remember?

453
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,880
I remember.

454
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,640
But I don't want to admit it.

455
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,960
Zimmer

456
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,640
I didn't forget you for a moment.

457
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,560
I always have you in my heart.

458
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,680
Let's start over, okay?

459
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,760
Why are you

460
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,320
Can't accept the reality?

461
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,360
Like this merry-go-round.

462
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,000
It can never be reversed.

463
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
We can't go back.

464
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,320
We can't go back.

465
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
Do you remember this?

466
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,800
remember

467
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,240
Of course I remember.

468
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,800
Are you returning it to me?

469
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm not returning it to you.

470
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,320
I want you

471
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,240
Leave it here.

472
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,640
We missed it before.

473
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,400
This ring

474
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,520
Is the beginning of us.

475
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,880
So I have to let it go.

476
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
Just like you and me.

477
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,200
To start a new life.

478
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,120
If I can't let go,

479
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,120
Can't I...

480
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,400
Stay by your side.

481
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,280
I've just given your brother

482
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,080
Called.

483
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,520
He'll pick you up later.

484
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,000
It's all over, Ruuo.

485
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,120
If a man

486
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,440
I'm back

487
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,760
sorry

488
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,320
The number you dialed

489
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,800
Can't be connected for the moment.

490
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,280
If a man

491
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,920
I know you're still angry.

492
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,440
But it's not what you think.

493
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
I have a very important thing.

494
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,520
To tell you that

495
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,640
It's all over.

496
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,640
It's all over.

497
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
What do you mean?

498
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,200
What end?

499
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,360
Something important?

500
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,520
It's not important.

501
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,120
What matters is that

502
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,000
You can't talk to him now.

503
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,400
You have to make him realize

504
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,720
The severity of the problem

505
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,480
yes

506
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,680
Trust me.

507
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,760
I know men the best.

508
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,760
He will definitely send a message again.

509
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,400
Here you are.

510
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,520
But of course,

511
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,640
You can't go back.

512
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,840
You must be firm this time.

513
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:52,960
Otherwise,

514
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,520
He will make the same mistake again.

515
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,400
Do you know

516
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,360
Resolutely.

517
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,960
drink

518
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,320
You know what?

519
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,840
One time, something happened to me.

520
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,560
It's funny.

521
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,760
Dugu is like a man.

522
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,120
Dugu is like a man.

523
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,160
Can you be nice?

524
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,920
Listen to me.

525
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,160
I'm not happy about your attitude.

526
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,080
Okay?

527
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,120
Focus on it.

528
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,440
I'm very focused.

529
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,040
Where are we?

530
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,040
Something happened to me today.

531
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,240
It's very interesting.

532
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,480
I

533
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,400
How could he...

534
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,120
Why don't you text me?

535
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,800
I'll be worried.

536
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,080
He should explain.

537
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,280
Otherwise, I will think a lot.

538
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,400
Something important?

539
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,480
What is over?

540
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,640
right or wrong?

541
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,440
Don't you think

542
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,080
Is something wrong?

543
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,840
If you're a male,

544
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,760
Why are you here?

545
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,280
Where's Zimmer?

546
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,600
Tell him I'm busy.

547
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,880
If there's anything else, tell me.

548
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,640
He's not here.

549
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,920
I haven't been here today.

550
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,120
What about Sermantha?

551
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,720
I just came back.

552
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,240
I just came back.

553
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,400
It's okay.

554
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,560
Bye

555
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,360
Take care, Young Master Ruo.

556
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,760
Can I have a look at this one?

557
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,280
good

558
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,840
Sir, you have a good taste.

559
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,400
This ring

560
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,440
It's Kimberly Diamond.

561
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,320
Special tailor-made.

562
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,520
This is the only one in the world.

563
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,520
To get married.

564
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,480
Is the most suitable.

565
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,920
How about this one?

566
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,200
Sure.

567
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,400
This is the only one in the world.

568
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,840
what?

569
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,520
You're sure to propose to Ruuo.

570
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,360
I've already confirmed that

571
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,000
Now it's more certain.

572
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,240
About Su Xiao,

573
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,320
After the dust has settled,

574
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,840
I can't wait any longer.

575
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,280
I'm going to take this ring

576
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,320
In the hands of Ruo Man.

577
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,960
Disappear all of a sudden.

578
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,280
And then appeared again.

579
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,000
He went out all of a sudden.

580
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,240
Find another woman.

581
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
What are you talking about?

582
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,560
Something important.

583
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,240
It's a ghost.

584
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,880
Where should I ask?

585
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,600
How can I ask?

586
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,120
And asked him

587
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,920
I heard Sermantha is back.

588
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,560
How do you explain it?

589
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,080
That's it.

590
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,760
I'll explain to you.

591
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,960
Why are you eavesdropping?

592
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,160
This is a public place.

593
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,160
You're talking to yourself.

594
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,160
I'm afraid that others will hear it.

595
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,640
This ring

596
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,800
I always carry it with me.

597
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,560
I want to give it to you.

598
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,840
This ring

599
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,720
This is my ex-boyfriend.

600
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,800
When he proposed to me,

601
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,600
It's for me.

602
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,880
impossible

603
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,640
Is it the same?

604
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,600
I don't think so.

605
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,840
This one.

606
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,000
Is specially designed by him.

607
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,320
worldwide

608
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,520
This one.

609
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,680
Your ex-boyfriend?

610
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,800
What's his name?

611
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,960
My ex-boyfriend.

612
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,120
season

613
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,240
silent

614
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,440
I forgot to tell you.

615
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,400
My Chinese name is...

616
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,320
Suxiao

617
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,360
Suxiao

618
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,680
Isn't Su Xiao dead?

619
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,760
That's right.

620
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,040
To be forgotten by the one you love?

621
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,800
Is also a kind of death.

622
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,520
But I didn't stop my heart.

623
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,440
So you approached me before.

624
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,120
You did it on purpose.

625
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:03,960
That's right.

626
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,600
Because I'm curious.

627
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,880
I'm curious about the person who replaced me.

628
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,840
What it looks like.

629
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,040
You don't have to look at me like that.

630
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,840
I didn't do anything to you.

631
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,800
Instead, I want to thank you.

632
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
If it weren't for you,

633
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,320
Zimmer may not come out yet.

634
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,320
Are you just thanking me?

635
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,640
I want to say sorry to you.

636
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,480
Because this time,

637
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,400
Not only to continue

638
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,520
Wing Fashion Dream

639
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,440
and

640
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,000
I want to get Zimmer back.

641
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,160
I want to transfer Ji Mo's love for Su Xiao

642
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,720
And find it.

643
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,600
Zimmer knows

644
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,240
Your purpose?

645
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,760
When you come back,

646
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,640
Do you have a second purpose?

647
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,760
I believe in Zimmer.

648
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,640
If he knows your purpose,

649
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,800
He will never let you stay.

650
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,040
yes

651
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,440
He rejected me.

652
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,680
But now,

653
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,160
I'm still here.

654
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,520
Wing Fashion needs me.

655
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,280
Zimmer needs me more.

656
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,160
Think about it carefully.

657
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,160
Recently,

658
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,720
Is something wrong?

659
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,560
Zimmer

660
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,720
President Ji.

661
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,640
What a coincidence.

662
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,480
About your car crash,

663
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,520
Why didn't you tell me?

664
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,800
You've recruited a new female subordinate.

665
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,880
Why didn't you tell me?

666
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,680
This is the normal working arrangement.

667
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,280
I

668
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,680
Anyway, you don't have to

669
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,720
That Thermantha contacted

670
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,480
Samantha is gone.

671
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,040
I'm going to find her.

672
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,560
You...

673
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,880
You still don't know Zimmer well.

674
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,520
Dugu is like a man.

675
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,840
I thought

676
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,720
My opponent

677
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,960
Will be stronger.

678
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,200
Now,

679
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
You are so close.

680
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,320
You can't wait to see

681
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,360
If I don't say it now,

682
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,160
It's too late.

683
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,920
that's right

684
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,080
I can't wait.

685
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,080
It's impossible for me

686
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,000
When the night comes,

687
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,520
I want to see Ruonan now.

688
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,360
It's too cheesy.

689
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,200
However

690
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,720
To help you choose a diamond ring.

691
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,600
It's done.

692
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,400
Phil and I will go back and prepare.

693
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
Looking forward to your triumph.

694
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,080
Come on

695
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,640
good

696
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,400
Hello, Ruuo.

697
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,960
Do you still remember the first time

698
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,880
The rooftop?

699
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,560
I'll wait for you there.

700
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,920
I have something important.

701
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,600
To tell you that

702
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,680
Just right

703
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
I have something important.

704
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,320
I want to ask you.

705
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,480
If a man

706
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,920
I've settled a problem.

707
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,320
I have many things to say.

708
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,600
But I don't know where to start.

709
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:35,920
therefore

710
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,280
To invite you here.

711
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,680
If a man

712
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,480
This rooftop

713
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,960
Is the place where we first met.

714
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,400
Is also our starting point.

715
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,120
scumbag

716
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,320
You're here to watch a play.

717
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
I'm sending you here.

718
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,760
A timely help.

719
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,640
You add fuel to the fire.

720
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,280
From the two of us,

721
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,400
When we fell together,

722
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,400
Are doomed to be entangled together.

723
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,160
When I'm tired,

724
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,880
You taught me how to relax.

725
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
How to leave everything behind?

726
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,480
Whenever I fall into the past,

727
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,600
The pain and embarrassment,

728
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
You will cure me.

729
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,080
Whenever I look back,

730
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,520
When you dare not show your sincerity,

731
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,440
You will make me see

732
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,960
Let me see my heart.

733
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,440
The reason why

734
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,480
Will choose this rooftop.

735
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,440
Because I want to

736
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,320
To start a new journey.

737
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,320
I know this proposal

738
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,240
It's simple and crude.

739
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,080
But I can't wait any longer.

740
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,640
I can't wait

741
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,760
And made you mine.

742
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,240
I want to possess you.

743
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,720
Will you marry me?

744
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,360
Why didn't you tell me?

745
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,760
Su Xiao is still alive.

746
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
You already know

747
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,120
We know each other.

748
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,680
Then why didn't you tell me?

749
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,000
She treats me like a fool.

750
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,600
The same way.

751
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,840
But you lied to me with her.

752
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,160
why

753
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,400
I was afraid that you would think too much.

754
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,440
I don't want you to get involved.

755
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,200
And hurt you.

756
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,400
I just want to protect you.

757
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,880
A lie is a lie.

758
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,200
To be honest is to be together.

759
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,440
The most basic respect.

760
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,360
I don't want you to protect me.

761
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,040
I want you to tell me the truth.

762
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,240
Maybe I shouldn't have

763
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,120
Wake you up.

764
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,480
Because of your past,

765
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,080
It's not over at all.

766
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,440
I've already told her.

767
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,280
I have already rejected her.

768
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,720
Why is the ring

769
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,760
Will be in her hands.

770
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,520
It seems that

771
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,480
All the things

772
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,760
Will be returned to the owner.

773
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,160
If a man

774
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,280
It's my fault.

775
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,720
I kept it a secret.

776
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,080
But I really...

777
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,360
I've never lingered.

778
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,040
And with her,

779
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,360
I'm more determined.

780
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,320
To you.

781
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,480
I can't lose you again.

782
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,159
She lied to you.

783
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,920
Now you're lying to me.

784
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,199
You are all the same.

785
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,239
You are using the name of love

786
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,520
To cheat the one you love.

787
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,800
You said it was love.

788
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,000
It's good to be back here today.

789
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,520
Stop at this starting point.

790
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,239
Let's give each other some time.

791
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,920
Take a break and calm down.

792
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,000
Think about what you want.

793
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,280
If a man

794
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,160
Boss

795
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,160
What's your order?

796
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,560
I want the hottest and hottest base.

797
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,360
The pot is not spicy enough.

798
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,200
Change it for me.

799
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,160
The previous gentleman

800
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,440
Specifically asked me

801
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,720
I told you not to eat spicy food.

802
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,040
I've already contacted him

803
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,680
It's okay.

804
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,720
Please change it for me.

805
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,560
well

806
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,080
Please wait a moment.

807
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,480
I really can't blow it.

808
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,280
That's enough.

809
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,720
No, more.

810
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,880
You're back.

811
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,840
Congratulations.

812
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,960
to tie the knot

813
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,040
What if a man?

814
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,120
I lost Ruonan.

815
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,600
What happened

816
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,120
I don't know.

817
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,960
sister

818
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,560
Why are you here?

819
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,120
Why are you here?

820
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,400
I'm learning my lines in the practice room.

821
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,760
What are you doing?

822
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,680
I thought of

823
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,280
I've been working a lot recently.

824
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,320
I haven't dealt with it.

825
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,080
She might stay up all night.

826
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,480
So I'm going to sleep here.

827
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,760
Someone bullied you.

828
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,440
No,

829
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,840
How could it be?

830
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,720
No,

831
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,040
The taste of hotpot.

832
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,120
Did you go to the hotpot restaurant and cry?

833
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,880
I'm busy.

834
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,560
Why would I have time?

835
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,520
Go to the hotpot restaurant.

836
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,760
sister

837
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,920
If someone bullies you,

838
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,760
Tell me.

839
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,720
I'm not the man

840
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,760
Will only follow you.

841
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,640
Little boy.

842
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,920
I'm trying my best to grow.

843
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,400
I have the power to protect you, really.

844
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,960
hand

845
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
I'm fine.

846
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,160
Who dares to bully me?

847
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,200
I'm so fierce.

848
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,760
Alright, go back.

849
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,280
Are you really fine?

850
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,520
go

851
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,400
Go home and recite the lines.

852
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,360
Don't be lazy.

853
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,440
Don't go home for a midnight snack.

854
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,480
go

855
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,000
Send me a short message when you go back.

856
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,240
No wonder he's so angry.

857
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
If it were me,

858
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,760
I can't accept it.

859
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,880
I can understand Ruuo's feelings.

860
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,240
But I've really

861
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,400
Let go of the past.

862
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,720
Even if you let it go,

863
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,040
But you lied to Ruonan.

864
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,040
This is the truth.

865
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,240
You didn't report it.

866
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,960
This is a taboo for women in love.

867
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,480
Besides, it's about your ex.

868
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,280
That Su Xiao

869
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,800
She went to find Ruo Nan.

870
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
If a man acts like a fool,

871
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,920
I was fooled by you.

872
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,000
I knew it and ignored it.

873
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,840
This is very important

874
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,680
It's a double blow.

875
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,720
I didn't ignore it.

876
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,680
I've dealt with it.

877
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,160
but

878
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,960
But what?

879
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,680
But you found out

880
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,840
The white moonlight in your heart

881
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,280
Now you're like a wolf.

882
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,840
Really?

883
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,920
Zimmer

884
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,520
Aren't you the best at

885
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,880
See through people's minds?

886
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,840
Why is this...

887
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
To yourself.

888
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,480
But you became blind.

889
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,480
Phil, I...

890
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,200
Love is a battlefield.

891
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,600
Former and current

892
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,920
Will always be the enemy.

893
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,480
From the moment you met her,

894
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,800
You should understand that

895
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,600
She was wearing a long spear and a short sword.

896
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,280
You're back.

897
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,240
She can't win or lose.

898
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,560
She won't give up easily.

899
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,520
Hold on, Chen Fei.

900
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,480
You're too harsh.

901
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,680
I thought

902
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,200
As long as you protect him,

903
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,720
To stop her from fighting.

904
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,440
So she wouldn't get hurt.

905
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,720
I don't want her to suffer

906
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,640
Any injury,

907
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,200
Even if she is injured,

908
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,800
But as long as you stand by her side,

909
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,600
Whether you win or lose,

910
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,280
She will fight to the end.

911
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,680
This is Dugu Ruuo Man.

912
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,800
It's my fault.

913
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,160
It's my fault.

914
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,800
Okay, Phil, stop.

915
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,200
This is not what Zimmer wants.

916
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,120
Zimmer wanted to protect Ruuo.

917
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,640
Don't be so helpful.

918
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,800
You're not a good person.

919
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,560
I'm telling you,

920
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,120
Don't you want to

921
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,680
Don't you know?

922
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,480
You know a lot.

923
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,040
If you had told me earlier,

924
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,800
Do you think this matter

925
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,680
Can develop into today.

926
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,520
Like this?

927
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
I actually have my own.

928
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,040
Okay, I was wrong.

929
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,560
Phil!

930
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,640
I was wrong.

931
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,920
I was completely wrong.

932
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,880
I really regret it now.

933
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,200
I'm full of thoughts about Ruuo.

934
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,360
I can't do anything.

935
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,960
I beg you to help me.

936
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,640
Can you help me find it?

937
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,960
Are you going to help him?

938
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,080
Help or not?

939
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,200
I can only say I'll try.

940
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,200
I knew you were hiding here.

941
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,760
Why didn't you answer my calls?

942
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,120
I don't want to talk.

943
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,680
Is it because of Zimmer?

944
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I thought

945
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,640
He's different from other men.

946
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,760
I didn't expect that

947
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,560
Are all the same.

948
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,120
It's true.

949
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,080
What's going on?

950
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,640
You'll never get around it, right?

951
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,520
Zimmer is really disgusting.

952
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,720
He didn't even bother.

953
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,360
And jumped into it.

954
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,040
You're actually colleagues.
