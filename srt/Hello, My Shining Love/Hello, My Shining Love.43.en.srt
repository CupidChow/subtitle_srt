1
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,240
Ruonan, what's going on?

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,880
What's going on?

3
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,800
How's it

4
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,560
going, sister?

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,120
Star was shortlisted for the Best Newcomer Award.

6
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,080
Sida?

7
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,560
That's great.

8
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,120
That's great.

9
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,720
That's great.

10
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,759
Thank you for your hard work.

11
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,120
I want three.

12
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,160
I want two aunts.

13
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,320
I want three, too.

14
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,360
I'll just wear a mask.

15
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Why are you wearing it too?

16
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,360
Who knows you?

17
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,560
If you wear it alone,

18
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,960
the target is too obvious.

19
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
It won't be so weird

20
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,600
if we wear it together.

21
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,640
Are you sure?

22
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,600
Short legs,

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
not only are your legs short,

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,760
You seem to have a short brain circuit.

25
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,600
Whose legs are you calling short?

26
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,720
Whose legs are you calling short?

27
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
You must be crazy.

28
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,640
Song Zihao Song Zihao,

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,240
why are you taking off your mask?

30
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,520
If you have nothing to do, wear it together.

31
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,600
If you want to pick them together,

32
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,200
it's called "women sing along with each other".

33
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,680
You're so silly.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,680
Yes,

35
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,600
I'm Song Zihao.

36
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,840
This is my girlfriend.

37
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,440
We're dating right now,

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,600
I hope you won't disturb us.

39
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,240
Thank you.

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,280
Did you do it on purpose?

41
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,360
Did you do it on purpose?

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,640
What's wrong?

43
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,240
I just want to announce to the whole world,

44
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,720
that I, Song Zihao, am in charge now.

45
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,720
Smells so good.

46
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,160
Come on,

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,880
have a bite. No,

48
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,720
What's wrong?

49
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,880
What else do you want to talk about?

50
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,560
You're in a normal relationship,

51
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
so you come here to buy snacks.

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,320
Now it's all exposed.

53
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,839
Then there's nothing we can do.

54
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,079
I was too bright.

55
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,680
I can't hide it even if I want to.

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,560
By the way,

57
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,720
what's wrong with dating?

58
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,880
As if I were a thief,

59
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,200
I'm not an artist anymore.

60
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,160
Like the two of us,

61
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,320
let it out a few more times.

62
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,440
Everyone will get used to it.

63
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,240
In the future, even if they run into each other,

64
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,760
they won't make a fuss.

65
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,520
Don't worry. I have experience in this matter.

66
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,200
I don't want to talk about ordinary relationships.

67
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
I don't think

68
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
you're ordinary at all.

69
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,840
Why don't we try it now?

70
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Try what?

71
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,280
Let's start with a normal kiss.

72
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,720
I don't want it.

73
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,520
Where are you going?

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,280
Do you think you can escape?

75
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,480
What are you doing?

76
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,800
You think I'm going to kiss you?

77
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,640
No, I didn't.

78
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,680
Not yet. You've closed your eyes.

79
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,640
You're looking forward to it.

80
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,120
I don't have you. Don't talk nonsense.

81
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,920
Don't be serious.

82
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,560
Next, I will present

83
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,280
this year's Best Newcomer Award.

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,840
This year, the competition for this award

85
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,480
is fierce.

86
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,880
In this year,

87
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,520
a large number of newcomers have emerged.

88
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,920
They have achieved

89
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,520
great results

90
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
in music, film and television.

91
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,280
Next, I announce,

92
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,840
the winner of this year's

93
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,760
Best Newcomer Award is,

94
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,280
Yes.

95
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,680
Sida

96
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,840
Sister, I finally made it.

97
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,600
Hurry up!

98
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,240
Hurry up!

99
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,640
-Thank you. -Thank you. Hello,

100
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,560
everyone.

101
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm the actor Sida.

102
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,200
First of all, thank you all

103
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,600
for your recognition of me.

104
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm grateful to my fans

105
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,600
for their support.

106
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,320
Today's award,

107
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,560
I stepped into this industry.

108
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,520
The first award,

109
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,480
it means a lot to me.

110
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,480
So I also want to

111
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,080
share this award with someone in particular.

112
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,400
She is my agent.

113
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,760
Dugu Ruonan.

114
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,520
Actually,

115
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,440
if it wasn't for her,

116
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,320
I won't step into this industry at all.

117
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,840
I didn't know

118
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,320
I could be an actress.

119
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,799
Without her,

120
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,559
I wouldn't be

121
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,120
standing here today.

122
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,360
So this award,

123
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,640
not only belongs to me,

124
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,720
It belongs to you, too.

125
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,880
Thank you, Ruonan.

126
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,840
If you wish for the future,

127
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,760
We can go together.

128
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,240
Thank you, everyone.

129
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,480
Excuse me,

130
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,080
I need to borrow Ruonan

131
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,720
from you. I want to talk to her.

132
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,600
What is it?

133
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,720
You were the one who discovered me,

134
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,360
and took me to the path

135
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,960
of being an artist.

136
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,400
You have to be responsible for me.

137
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,560
What should I be responsible for?

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,720
After so many storms,

139
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,240
you've carried them through with me.

140
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,040
Now, I'm going to

141
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,280
fight for the last page,

142
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,440
As my agent,

143
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,680
would you like to accompany me for the last time?

144
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,000
Congratulations

145
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,920
Zihao,

146
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,800
Thank you.

147
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,840
Long time no see.

148
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,440
What about today?

149
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,480
I have something very important

150
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
to announce.

151
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,840
It's definitely big news.

152
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,160
I won't let you down.

153
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,120
Zihao

154
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,840
It's been a long time

155
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,920
since you stood with your former agent.

156
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,480
So are you two

157
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,760
going to work together again this time?

158
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,120
Yes, we're going to cooperate.

159
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,920
Are you planning

160
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,600
to act first and then act later?

161
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,920
I didn't agree.

162
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,280
From now on,

163
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,800
I won't work with

164
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,680
any brokers anymore,

165
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,480
I've decided

166
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,200
to quit the entertainment industry.

167
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,360
Quit the entertainment industry.

168
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,520
Zihao,

169
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,480
what do you mean?

170
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,800
Zihao, have you made up your mind?

171
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,600
I want to be

172
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,760
an ordinary person,

173
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,240
Enjoy your life.

174
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,600
Are you going to

175
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,960
retire temporarily?

176
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,760
No.

177
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,560
It's a complete exit.

178
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,840
Over the past few years,

179
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,040
I've been working hard to play

180
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,280
the role of the actor Song Zihao,

181
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,480
Try to be

182
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,120
the perfect idol in the eyes of others,

183
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,320
But I lost myself once.

184
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
My happiness and sadness

185
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,000
are fake every day,

186
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,480
They all belong to the public.

187
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,280
There is not a moment in my life

188
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,200
that is real,

189
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,640
I don't want to live like this again,

190
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,960
playing Song Zihao every day,

191
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,720
A life of striving for fame and gain,

192
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,080
suffering from loss and gain.

193
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,840
I want to find myself again.

194
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,240
Find your true

195
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,960
and ordinary self.

196
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,240
Thank you to the fans who have been with me

197
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,640
and supported me all these years.

198
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,040
Unfortunately,

199
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,560
I can't

200
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,600
go on with you.

201
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,840
But what's worth celebrating is

202
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,040
that I've found the one

203
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,480
I can protect

204
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,600
for the rest of my life,

205
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,080
I believe everyone

206
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,280
will support me

207
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,960
and be happy for me, right?

208
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,200
Can you tell me

209
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,720
your next plan?

210
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,480
Exactly

211
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,000
Tell us more.

212
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
I've already announced my withdrawal.

213
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,520
Leave your personal space to me.

214
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,520
I hope both the media

215
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
and the public,

216
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,560
You can put more attention

217
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,480
on the ordinary people

218
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,320
around us,

219
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,680
In today's society with so much pressure,

220
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,320
in fact, there are many people

221
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,880
around us

222
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,160
who have mental health problems,

223
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,280
They all need our attention.

224
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,320
maybe

225
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
When they need

226
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
help the most,

227
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,520
He sent us

228
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,440
a distress signal,

229
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,120
But we ignored it.

230
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,360
I think compared to

231
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,720
the attention of entertainment gossip,

232
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,120
It's more important

233
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,640
to care about them.

234
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,240
All right,

235
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,640
actor Song Zihao is here,

236
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,080
Say goodbye to everyone.

237
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,280
Goodbye.

238
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,160
Zihao has finally found

239
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,760
the life he wants.

240
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,400
He likes

241
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,640
free people so much.

242
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,080
Now I can finally

243
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,720
be free.

244
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
Sida also won the Newcomer Award.

245
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,920
He realized his dream.

246
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,600
Hope everything goes well

247
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,880
for both of them in the future, right?

248
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,440
This is their choice.

249
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,040
Why are you following me?

250
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,160
I'm not worried.

251
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,200
Because you're my choice.

252
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,160
Thank you for always being by my side.

253
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,880
What?

254
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,080
Are you going to propose to Ruonan?

255
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,680
Yes.

256
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,480
Didn't you two just get back together?

257
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,320
So soon?

258
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Not fast.

259
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,920
How many times

260
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,640
have you been on and off?

261
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,560
You have to talk for a few years

262
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,840
before it's called true love, right?

263
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,160
How many couples are there?

264
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,120
We didn't talk for a few years,

265
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,160
and then broke up.

266
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,240
Ji Mo,

267
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,480
I absolutely support you. Hold on tight.

268
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,720
I'll hold on tight.

269
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,640
We must hurry.

270
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,800
If you don't hurry up,

271
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,560
what if someone else takes her away?

272
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,560
Why are you looking at me?

273
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
I'm not hugging her.

274
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,040
Straight man,

275
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,760
really.

276
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,720
I think Fei'er is right.

277
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,160
I can't wait any longer.

278
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,520
Because I lost it before.

279
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,200
So now I cherish

280
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,080
this relationship more,

281
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,600
I'm afraid I'll miss it again.

282
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,080
And I didn't do it

283
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,880
on impulse,

284
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:15,920
I thought about it

285
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,240
after careful consideration,

286
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,280
I've been looking for her for the rest of my life.

287
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,320
That's her.

288
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,920
Besides,

289
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,440
after going through so many things,

290
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,080
I can take good care

291
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,920
of her now.

292
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,800
Give her happiness.

293
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,440
So,

294
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,120
it's time.

295
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,680
Okay,

296
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,520
let's congratulate you in advance.

297
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,440
Congratulations. Thank you.

298
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,120
What's your plan?

299
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,440
I'm going to give her

300
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,960
a unique marriage proposal.

301
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,520
But I need both of you.

302
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,320
participate in

303
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,720
And witness.

304
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,360
You want us to witness it.

305
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:53,920
Right?

306
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,240
Is the appearance fee very expensive?

307
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,160
I have to go, too.

308
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,400
I had just arrived in Shanghai

309
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,920
at that time,

310
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,480
I'm still a very small agent.

311
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,440
I often moved around in different crews,

312
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,079
and every time I had to check out,

313
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,280
I was so scared.

314
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,319
be afraid

315
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,680
Where's your next job?

316
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,280
If I don't have a job,

317
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,640
I won't have a place to live.

318
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,160
At that time, I thought,

319
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,319
one day,

320
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,000
I must buy a house

321
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,160
in Shanghai,

322
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,480
When I made money,

323
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,960
the first thing,

324
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm just going to see the house.

325
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,320
I saw the house.

326
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,920
I'll pay you in one lump sum.

327
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,920
I still remember the day I handed over the house,

328
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,920
I was alone,

329
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,240
I didn't do anything.

330
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,920
I just slept for a whole day.

331
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,160
I feel very down-to-earth.

332
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
I have a sense of belonging

333
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,680
that I haven't had for a long time,

334
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,120
So from now on, I thought,

335
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,080
no matter what grievances you

336
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
encounter at work,

337
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,040
No matter

338
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,440
what goes wrong,

339
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,600
It's okay.

340
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,560
I still have a room.

341
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,040
In the past, I didn't have

342
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,400
much trust in love.

343
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,600
You always worry about gains and losses,

344
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,440
don't you?

345
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
I'm so afraid of

346
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,320
relying on someone.

347
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,760
Even if I really need the other half,

348
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,960
to give me a sense of security,

349
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,440
I won't say anything.

350
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,920
Because I don't want to burden him.

351
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,160
But ever since

352
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,760
I was with you,

353
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,960
Most of the time, I don't need to talk,

354
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,200
and you know how vulnerable I am.

355
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,840
I'm unhappy,

356
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,600
do you know when I was?

357
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,760
What do you need the most?

358
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,000
To rely on someone.

359
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,160
It's my weakness.

360
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
But you

361
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,240
made me not afraid to rely on you.

362
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,400
Because I know,

363
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,080
you'll wrap your armor

364
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,440
around my weakness.

365
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,120
Because I know

366
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,040
you're like this.

367
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,240
It gives me a sense of security.

368
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,320
Thank you.

369
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,160
I love you.

370
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,560
Why are you so mysterious?

371
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,720
Nothing happened at all.

372
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,480
Who's so mysterious?

373
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,760
To be honest,

374
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
I didn't come back last night.

375
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,400
Where did you go?

376
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,480
Tell me,

377
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,640
I want to work with the staff

378
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,080
to make a new series.

379
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,720
Work with the staff to make a new series.

380
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,680
How could this happen?

381
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,880
Do I need you to keep an eye on me?

382
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,160
Because the big show of this new series

383
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,840
is very important to me.

384
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,520
That's why you have to keep an eye on him.

385
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,760
When you're done with this,

386
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,680
you'll feel much better in a while.

387
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,200
Don't miss me too much.

388
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,200
I miss you.

389
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,600
I didn't miss you.

390
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,720
Me,

391
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,360
I am an independent woman in the new era,

392
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,560
am I the kind of person

393
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,800
who often works as a husband's stone at home?

394
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,520
No,

395
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,520
No,

396
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,360
I'm going to check

397
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,120
the fridge. What's there to eat?

398
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,080
I'll make it for you.

399
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,840
Toast,

400
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,160
bacon and eggs.

401
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,200
That's it. I think

402
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,000
there's noodles,

403
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,800
I'll cook a bowl of noodles for you.

404
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,560
Okay?

405
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
Mr. Ji.

406
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,400
Mr. Ji.

407
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,440
Mr. Ji

408
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,200
is asleep.

409
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,440
How tired have you been for a while?

410
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,000
No way.

411
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,400
I still need you to fight for it.

412
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,680
Discuss with the director group,

413
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,520
arrange for the fifth scene of Episode 7

414
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,200
and the third scene of Episode 45

415
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,840
to be filmed on the same day.

416
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,920
Because Sida

417
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,320
is very serious about the play.

418
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,360
He especially pursues a sense of hierarchy,

419
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,280
and in these two games,

420
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,200
They are him and his two most important,

421
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,520
but very different

422
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,240
women,

423
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,520
The last goodbye,

424
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,640
what if we shoot it on the same day?

425
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,520
You can quickly

426
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,160
find the difference inside.

427
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,680
This will not only improve his room

428
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,080
for improvement quickly.

429
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,560
It can also improve the efficiency

430
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,480
of our team.

431
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,440
Qiansha, you're amazing.

432
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,200
If you are so familiar with the script,

433
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,120
you may remember it more clearly

434
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,240
than the actors themselves,

435
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
What is this?

436
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,360
Ruonan taught me

437
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,200
and instructed me to do so.

438
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,720
She asked me to memorize

439
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,880
all the scripts.

440
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,440
If you take time to help Sida with the play,

441
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,680
not only that,

442
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,840
And in life,

443
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,080
big and small things,

444
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,960
You have to know everything like the back of your hand.

445
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,640
We can't let anything go wrong.

446
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,240
Your agent,

447
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,440
every day for your own artists,

448
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,520
It's really hard for you

449
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,000
to be in front of each other.

450
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,840
I heard that

451
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,160
you've been here for a long time,

452
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,920
Why are you doing well?

453
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,360
The daughter of the noble is improper,

454
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,080
and she even works as an agent.

455
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,400
I promise you,

456
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,880
I will work hard.

457
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,080
I'll behave myself.

458
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,000
I won't make trouble.

459
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,760
From tomorrow on,

460
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,840
Qiansha will no longer be

461
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,120
my personal assistant,

462
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,600
She will be

463
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,760
Star's executive agent,

464
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,280
I'm an agent now.

465
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,320
I have to restrain myself.

466
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,360
I want to be professional.

467
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,120
I think

468
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
you're getting better.

469
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,000
Not only is he well-organized at work,

470
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,160
but when it comes to treating people and doing things,

471
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,760
And you're getting more and more aware of priorities,

472
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,600
if all of my men are,

473
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,640
You're smart, capable

474
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
and promising.

475
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,920
I saw on the company's website

476
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,240
that you want to hire an assistant?

477
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,400
That's good.

478
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,600
I just lost my job.

479
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,200
I might as well condescend

480
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,480
to be your assistant.

481
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,960
If you're my assistant,

482
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,120
you won't be afraid of others pointing fingers at you

483
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,880
and making irresponsible remarks.

484
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,640
What about me?

485
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,800
I want to be an ordinary person.

486
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,200
And then live a normal life,

487
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,320
and find a normal woman,

488
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,400
In an ordinary relationship,

489
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,680
and this ordinary woman,

490
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,200
It's you.

491
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,520
If I say it's because of fate,

492
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,840
will you think it's exaggerated?

493
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,840
You guys go to work first.

494
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,760
I need to take this,

495
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,760
Hey, Miss,

496
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,640
didn't we agree that

497
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,920
you would mop the floor today?

498
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,600
Song Zihao,

499
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,960
I really like you so much.

500
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,440
-No. -What's wrong?

501
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,880
You're a bit out of your mind today.

502
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,720
Nothing.

503
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,760
I suddenly remembered

504
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,960
the past,

505
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,960
think

506
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,360
Everything is the best arrangement.

507
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,200
Silly girl.

508
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,880
What are you thinking about?

509
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,920
When are you coming back?

510
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,920
We'll have to wait a little longer.

511
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,080
I'm now

512
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,800
the agent of a popular artist,

513
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,840
I'm busy.

514
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,000
-Here you are. -You're with

515
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,280
Sida?

516
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,720
Why are you asking him?

517
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,600
He's filming.

518
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,720
We're not together.

519
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,840
Don't worry.

520
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,840
We are

521
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,680
not alone at all now.

522
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,720
There won't be anything more than

523
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,680
the relationship

524
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,400
between an artist and an agent.

525
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,520
Don't worry about it.

526
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,320
Why should I be nervous?

527
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,720
You don't think I'm jealous, do you?

528
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,200
Even if I don't trust you,

529
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,560
I can rest assured that

530
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,080
Sida

531
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,320
is not interested in you at all.

532
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,120
He only cares about Ruonan,

533
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,440
who seems to be

534
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,400
getting married recently.

535
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,520
If he likes her so much,

536
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,800
what should he do?

537
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,080
Get married.

538
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,240
Hey,

539
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,040
Eat more.

540
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,760
You're going to lose weight.

541
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,160
Ruonan has to criticize me again.

542
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,800
I can't eat it.

543
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,640
You.

544
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm still thinking about Ruonan,

545
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,200
how much I miss her,

546
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,680
I've become a habit for a long time.

547
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,400
Ji Mo

548
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,840
I'm going to propose to Ruonan.

549
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,400
Ji Mo is going to invite

550
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,360
all his friends there.

551
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,640
But I think,

552
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,840
you'd better not go.

553
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,720
Why don't I tell them that

554
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,840
you don't have a schedule?

555
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,400
Just stay here and film,

556
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:29,920
I don't want you

557
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,600
to be affected by these things,

558
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,080
I want to go.

559
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,040
I don't want to miss

560
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,320
the most important moment in her life.

561
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,320
Pretty much.

562
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,080
how

563
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,560
I couldn't see anyone a while ago.

564
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,640
Now I just want to make up for it with one meal.

565
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,160
Let me tell you,

566
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,440
I didn't calm down so quickly.

567
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,160
How can it be just a meal?

568
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,640
I even prepared a gift.

569
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,320
Enjoy your meal.

570
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,360
I don't think

571
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,160
you're such

572
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,560
an old-fashioned scene.

573
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,880
Please, I don't accept it.

574
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,840
Open it first.

575
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,200
You took so much effort,

576
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,720
but you gave me an invitation.

577
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,920
What do you think it is?

578
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,920
Nothing.

579
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,640
You don't think it's a proposal, do you?

580
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,600
No, I didn't.

581
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,200
Am I afraid I can't get married?

582
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,520
Those who want to marry me,

583
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,000
from here to the door,

584
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,720
back

585
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,360
Order another bottle.

586
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,280
You've been working late

587
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,440
and tired lately,

588
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,040
So take a break first.

589
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,760
At the beginning later,

590
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,400
I'll call you.

591
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,760
Why is it so sudden?

592
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,840
Nothing.

593
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,560
I just want to hug you.

594
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,040
Come on!

595
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,120
Nice to meet you.

596
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,520
Hello.

597
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,280
Long time no see, Mr. Li.

598
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,160
Please have a seat.

599
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Mr. Ji is busy in the back.

600
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,120
She'll be here soon.

601
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,320
Please have a seat.

602
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,080
Get back to work.

603
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,280
Ali, Sida,

604
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,200
why are you here?

605
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,480
What about Ruonan?

606
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,400
He must be backstage.

607
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,360
Over there?

608
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,240
Okay.

609
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,520
Sis,

610
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,760
Sida?

611
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,080
Why are you back?

612
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,880
Aren't you filming?

613
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,360
It's such an important day,

614
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
of course I have to come back.

615
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,680
Support brother's press conference.

616
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,680
It's just a press conference.

617
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,800
What's so important?

618
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,760
There will be more in the future.

619
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,440
But I heard that

620
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,120
my new product release this time

621
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,040
is very important.

622
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,800
Didn't he tell you?

623
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,520
No.

624
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,880
What if you come back

625
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,360
to the crew

626
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,840
in the middle of the filming?

627
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,720
It's okay.

628
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,480
Before we come back,

629
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,080
I've finished filming

630
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,880
all night.

631
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,560
It's not a drama.

632
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,080
It's good.

633
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,960
When you grow up,

634
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,560
don't cause him any trouble.

635
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,440
It makes me feel more and more at ease.

636
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,640
Have you eaten?

637
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,520
Yes.

638
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,560
Ruo Nan

639
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,160
Ruonan,

640
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,880
emergency in Jianghu,

641
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,040
Help me find a way.

642
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,960
What's the matter? Did something go wrong

643
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,320
with your press conference?

644
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,440
No,

645
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,440
it's me.

646
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,000
I have a stomachache.

647
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,160
And I've gone to the toilet

648
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,640
several times today.

649
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,800
I'm afraid after the finale,

650
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,760
I won't be able to leave.

651
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,840
What should I do?

652
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,600
It's okay.

653
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,200
It's not too late.

654
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,040
I'll call the company's model

655
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,160
to save the scene.

656
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,320
It's too late.

657
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,080
Look

658
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
at this time,

659
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,800
There's a traffic jam.

660
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,320
He can't make it.

661
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,880
I haven't called yet.

662
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,200
How do I know?

663
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,800
Go for me.

664
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,080
Are you kidding me? How can I get there?

665
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,320
I'm not kidding.

666
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,160
I can't walk.

667
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,320
I didn't walk on the catwalk.

668
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,960
Why didn't you walk by?

669
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,320
Didn't you

670
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,760
practice walking with Sida before?

671
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,320
Then … Where does it count?

672
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,880
I'm not leaving.

673
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,840
If you don't leave,

674
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,200
let's figure it out, Star. Star,

675
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,120
Come on.

676
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,480
Sida will be standing

677
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,360
next to you later.

678
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,480
If you're nervous,

679
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,440
just let him hold you.

680
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,760
It's very fast and simple. It only

681
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,920
takes a few seconds.

682
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,960
No, no, no.

683
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,040
I can't leave.

684
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,840
Why not?

685
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,320
You're so fat that you can't wear a dress,

686
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,920
and you can't walk.

687
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,320
What did you teach me back then?

688
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,000
Believe in yourself.

689
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,000
No, no, no

690
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,240
Ruo Nan

691
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,120
Sis, don't worry. I'm here.

692
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,520
Please help me.

693
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,640
If it's empty,

694
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,400
do you think Ji Mo

695
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,840
will spare me this time?

696
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,040
And you don't want him

697
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,080
to watch his efforts

698
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,320
go to waste, do you?

699
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,320
Please.

700
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,840
I'm here. Don't worry.

701
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,120
Please.

702
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,240
Is it pretty?

703
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,400
This is Ji Mo's special photo.

704
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,960
My stomach hurts,

705
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,440
The wedding dress that will be the last to be designed tonight.

706
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,040
It's so pretty.

707
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,480
Right?

708
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,840
Put that

709
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,080
on first. I'll wait for you outside.

710
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,160
Call me when you're done.

711
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,480
Thank you so much.

712
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,680
You can come to my new product launch

713
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,440
during your busy schedule.

714
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,719
For this press conference,

715
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,040
for me,

716
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,320
Perhaps

717
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,320
the most memorable day.

718
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,199
I'm happy.

719
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,760
I can share this night

720
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,600
with you.

721
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,480
Not much to say,

722
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,360
let's enjoy

723
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,560
it together.

724
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,920
Gosh,

725
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,600
this dress is really

726
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,960
made for you.

727
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,639
This dress is your size.

728
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,199
It should be a smaller size.

729
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,600
Why is it so perfect?

730
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,520
Don't care about the details.

731
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,840
It's almost time. Go, go, go, go, go, go,

732
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,040
go, go, go, go, go.

733
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,120
Watch out!

734
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,400
Sida?

735
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,520
Well,

736
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,680
I'm leaving.

737
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,480
What do you think? Nervous?

738
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,560
It's okay.

739
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,680
I'm a little flustered.

740
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,080
Sis, do you remember

741
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,720
what you taught me before?

742
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,280
Believe in yourself.

743
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,240
I'm here.

744
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,840
I'm ready.

745
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,360
Let's go.

746
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,840
It's so beautiful.

747
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,640
I wish you happiness.

748
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,360
You're so beautiful.

749
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,840
Tell me what happened first.

750
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,160
Listen to me,

751
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,840
this dress for tonight,

752
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
It's called resplendent.

753
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,520
Its design concept

754
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,120
is to bring you to the bright you.

755
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,000
Each of us,

756
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,200
more or less,

757
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,680
There are some flaws.

758
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,080
But we just have to

759
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,240
wait carefully.

760
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,560
One day,

761
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,320
true love will come to

762
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,280
that bright you,

763
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,960
It will light up all the roads.

764
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,880
Everyone will meet

765
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,720
someone brilliant,

766
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,760
To love

767
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,040
The one you love,

768
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,880
where is the muse

769
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,720
of this dress design?

770
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,960
It's her.

771
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,920
Dugu Ruonan

772
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,240
is the woman I've loved

773
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,920
for the rest of my life.

774
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:25,960
There was once

775
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,400
a coward who closed his heart.

776
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,480
He doesn't dare to love,

777
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,560
in the eyes of others,

778
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,760
He is gentle and elegant.

779
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,200
Brilliant,

780
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,120
but only he knows it.

781
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,920
He is aloof and indifferent,

782
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,120
with all the light and temperature in the world,

783
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,360
Keep your distance.

784
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,040
Later,

785
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,120
he met a bitter man,

786
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,080
For mercenary women,

787
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,880
they are fighting against each other.

788
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,600
Thanks to you,

789
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,680
your fingers are pressed by heavy objects,

790
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,800
It's broken.

791
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,160
You've pushed so many artists,

792
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,600
but they don't want any of them.

793
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,200
Is his boss

794
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,120
out of his mind?

795
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,520
Ji Mo, right?

796
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,520
I'm not going to talk to someone

797
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,120
who has no brain, no vision,

798
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,680
Working with people with no future?

799
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,640
No,

800
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,080
Do you have any self-esteem?

801
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,200
People like you

802
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,080
in the brokerage industry,

803
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,760
Are they all so shameless?

804
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,920
Like a beggar,

805
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,120
do you know what an agent is?

806
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,720
An agent is the other side

807
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,600
of an artist,

808
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,200
The artist is so beautiful.

809
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,480
How humble an agent is,

810
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,160
if I want to be self-respecting,

811
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,640
My artist.

812
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,720
There's no way to stand out.

813
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,560
As long as I can achieve my goal,

814
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,960
I can do anything.

815
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,040
But this seemingly

816
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,640
rigid and rude woman,

817
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,000
But my heart is very soft.

818
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,240
Fragile and enthusiastic,

819
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,440
although they are tit for tat,

820
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,480
There's some friction,

821
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,320
but we still understand each other.

822
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:52,960
tolerate

823
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,400
That coward

824
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,560
fell in love with this woman.

825
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,480
But he ran away again.

826
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,640
You don't have to wait any longer.

827
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,400
Later on, this woman

828
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,440
kept crying.

829
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,520
You spent all your makeup crying.

830
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,320
But I saved him with my true love.

831
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,360
He helped this coward

832
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,640
open his heart.

833
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,320
Unshackled him.

834
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,760
So that he can finally have love.

835
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,520
We can embrace happiness.

836
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,920
Ruo Nan

837
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,720
Without you, there would be no glory.

838
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,280
I don't have what a coward

839
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,320
like me has.

840
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,760
Confess your love,

841
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,160
and make it so emotional.

842
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,120
I've never cried

843
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,520
in front of anyone else.

844
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
What a shame.

845
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,440
This ring

846
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,560
is tailor-made for you.

847
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,840
It's unique.

848
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,880
I want it to ask you.

849
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,800
Whether or not I can have the brightest

850
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,320
in the world.

851
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,640
The most unique you.

852
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,480
Ruonan,

853
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,280
it's our love agent's appointment.

854
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,800
I want to sign for you

855
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
and marry me for the rest of my life, okay?

856
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,600
Are you envious?

857
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,240
